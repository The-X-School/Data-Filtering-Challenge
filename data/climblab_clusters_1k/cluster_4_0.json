{"text":"ALEXANDRIA, VA -- The National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded the American Geological Institute (AGI) a grant of $998,000 to develop an environmental science textbook for high-school students over the next three years. The new textbook, Environmental Science: Understanding our Changing Earth, will be written in collaboration with scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) and high-school teachers, and will focus on the relationship between humans and their geological surroundings. \"Using an Earth system science approach, this innovative, interdisciplinary environmental science curriculum will help students gain the fundamental scientific knowledge and skills that will empower them to be literate citizens of Planet Earth,\" says Michael Smith, AGI Director of Education and Outreach.\n\nRecent studies show that the demand for environmental science courses is growing and there is a tremendous need for appropriate curriculum materials. The majority of environmental science textbooks emphasize ecology. What makes the AGI project unique is its geoscience approach to environmental problems. The textbook will integrate technology, field, and laboratory-based activities to address five core concepts associated with the environment: human population growth and its impact; sustainability of population with available natural resources; understanding Earth's systems and the effects of natural and induced change; earth processes and risk to life and property; and scientific inquiry in reaching decisions and formulating policy. Accompanying the textbook will be a DVD developed by the USGS having a wide variety of datasets, including a global base map, population, land cover, petroleum deposits, and ecosystems, and ArcView Data Publisher software. This powerful feature will enable students to conduct activities which examine how multiple factors influence the environment and will reinforce the core concepts. A co"}

{"text":"Wednesday, May 16, 2007\n\nTeacher Magic!\n\nAs a pre-service teacher, I am faced with many tasks; sometimes they are intentionally given and at other times, simply encountered. Although both tend to be equally challenging at one point or another, I am finding it more and more difficult to meet those presented by my professors, but more specifically the standards that are set by the state. On one ocassion in particular, I was faced with the task of designing a student-investigation but there was a catch--I had to relate it to a current event. I had no idea what I was going to do, until I came upon a news article that I thought was quite engaging and could easily be re-enacted. This way, I did not have to stretch myself too far--at least in regard to gathering enough materials and designing an investigation from virtually nothing! To save myself time and money, I used the article 'Amphibian Ark' Planned to Save Frogs to recreate an investigation similar to the one that might have been performed by the scientists in the article. From this article, students may be exposed to the process in which a scientific claim is made. Foremost, the scientists had to conduct some form of observation, and, from there, gather evidence\u2014there was obviously a noticeable change in frog population. Then, scientists had to perform an investigation to get to the root of the problem; and once they were almost certain that they had isolated the cause(s), they had to create a solution that they predict, based on evidence collected, will aid in preventing further depopulation of the frogs. Hence, from this article, students will learn that science demands evidence, explains and predicts, and helps us to understand the world.\n\nThis is just how I thought I might use this article--In my classroom, I would use this article to demonstrate how a scientific investigation should be performed, but because this is in fact second grade, I would not be too concerned with details. As a class, we would re-enact the investigation, placing ourselves in the shoes of the scientists who made this discovery. Wearing make-shift lab coats equipped with clipboards and a worksheet, the class would act out a simplified version of the investigation step-by-step. Arranged around the classroom would be stations, each focused on one aspect of a typical investigation. For example, at the first station, we would observe a drop in frog population\u2014I would demonstrate this by providing them with a bar graph that is missing data and have them fill it in after 'observing' me take out a definite number of frogs out of a make-shift pond (a few per minute). Moreover, this article kills two birds with one stone by allowing me to apply both SOL 2.5 and an altered version SOL 2.8 a (this article exposes the important animal products)."}

{"text":"For the past few months, Dr. Fernand Brunschwig and a small group of phyiscs teachers, have led area physical science teachers in a set of workshops on physics modeling instruction.\n\nWhile we promote their workshops through our PD Calendar and newsletters, I was hoping to find it an even bigger audience by putting it up on the blog.\n\nBuilding and maintaining a community of practice is a huge challenge to any teacher but considering there are so few physics teachers, this type of ongoing professional workshop and community seems especially important.\n\nThe details for the event and an answer to the question \"What the heck is Modeling Instruction?\" can all be found below.\n\nSUMMARY: The concept of energy is central to all of science. This workshop will lay out several ways to introduce students to the concept of energy. We will begin with common intuitive notions and everyday language and develop the key analog, working and mathematical models, including conservation and degradation of energy, necessary for successful problem solving. Participants will collaborate on discussing and solving a variety of problems focusing on specific conceptual issues that generally pose difficulty for students.\n\nParticipants should bring an electronic version of a selection of their best homework assignments and test questions on energy to the workshop; assignments\/questions can be at any level from middle school through advanced placement. We will provide copies to all participants, along with Chapter 4 (\"Energy & Matter\") from Introductory Physics: A Model Approach by Robert Karplus. Biology, chemistry and earth science teachers will also find many aspects of this workshop to be of value.\n\nThere will also be time at the beginning of the meeting for 2 or 3 individuals to make short presentations (5 minutes max.) about specific physics teaching ideas. If you wish to make a presentation, you should post a brief preview\/summary of whatever you would like to share at the following URL: <  >\n\nPhysicsTeachersNYC was originated in summer 2011 by a group of teachers as a teacher-led physics study group. The group members were all practitioners of a curriculum and pedagogy known as Modeling Instruction, developed collaboratively by university and high school physics educators over the past 20 years. The group conducts sessions focused directly on Modeling Instruction as well as more general workshops for sharing ideas about teaching and learning in physics.\n\nModeling Instruction. The use of modeling in teaching was pioneered by Robert Karplus in his 1969 textbook, Introductory Physics: A Modeling Approach, and Modeling Instruction was subsequently developed at Arizona State University by David Hestenes, Malcolm Wells, and Gregg Swackhamer, as well as by many others across the country. Modeling Instruction is disseminated through peer-led summer workshops. The best way to learn more about modeling is to participate in a workshop, but if you'd like to read more about it, go to < modeling.asu.edu > or take a look at Introductory Physics by Robert Karplus"}

SOS is that product. We checked out several SOS reviews, spoke with the company several times and decided to try one subject first. In the techno world that we live in we wanted to switch over to the computer slowly in our homeschooling. We ordered the SOS 3rd grade Science and so far it has worked out great. They seem to be retaining what they learned in their lessons and that was our goal. They have their own laptops, so they do their Science at different times. We chose to load the full CD on each of their computers and let me put the teacher portion on each computer with a password. You can also use a main computer for the teacher portion, but you have to have the wireless access for them to do their school work. There are times when we are on the road and don't have access to wireless, so we did not use the client install. I thought that perhaps they would get bored with the initial layout, but because each lesson is different that has not been an issue. One of the things that I am wanting in our home school is for our children to be able to study and do their classes independently. Another plus for us personally is that we like the KJV of the Bible and you have a choice of that and NASB. Set up is very easy, and the SOS Technical Support is just a phone call away. Overall this product has met our needs more than I expected and that makes me and our children very happy. Next year we are going to add the Health elective and Bible."}

{"text":"Tags\n\nCurrent Events in Biotechnology\n\nLesson Plan Overview \/ Details\n\nThe field of biotechnology is changing rapidly. Everyday\nsignificant new discoveries are bringing new products to market.\nStaying current on these advances makes for a better lab\ntechnician, informed voter, etc. Students will use scientific\ndatabases and perform Internet research on current events. Students\nwill summarize what they have learned and share it with their\npeers.\n\nActivities in this Lesson\n\nStart class by handing each student an unsealed envelope.\nIn the envelope is a ballot. Tell students to go to their\nseats and vote. Have the classroom already set up so students\nmay not see how one another votes. Tell students to quickly\nvote first and then fill out the questions below the voting\nballot.\n\nHave a discussion on how being informed on current events might\nmake for better voting. This will vary according to class\nbeliefs, but allow students time to reflect on this voting\nexperience. Responses should include knowing more specifics\non genetically engineered livestock (as in positive and negative\neffects), understanding current rules in genetic screening and or\nunderstanding the diseases being screened for, etc.\n\nDiscuss as a class other benefits to staying current in the\nbiotechnology field. Students should associate current events\nwith items like sharing research, better safety and lab knowledge,\nbetter consumers, etc.\n\nBiotechVotingBallot\n[\nDownload\n]\nThe ballot you hand each student as they enter class.\n\nGo over with the class the four biotechnology domains.\nHave students quietly read the \"Biotechnology Domains\" handout\nwhich has been glued into legal scientific notebooks. Call on\nfour students to read each section outloud. Call on other\nstudent volunteers to give known examples for each domain.\nStudents should take notes and actively read on the handout.\n\nAssign students a domain according to birthdate. For\nexample, if their birthday falls between January through March,\nstudents are to focus on industrial\/environmental\nbiotechnology. If their birthday falls between April through\nJune, students are to focus on diagnostic biotechnology. If\ntheir birthdate falls between July through September, students are\nto focus on medical\/pharmaceutical biotechnology. Finally, if\ntheir birthdate falls between October through December, students\nare to focus on agricultural biotechnology. The teacher may\npick other methods to determine student focus. It may be\nbased on the dominant color in the student's shirt (i.e. black\nfocuses on diagnostic) or distance the student lives from school\n(i.e. within 2 miles students focus on diagnostic), etc.\n\nGo over the handout \"Current Events in Biotechnology.\"\nHave students actively read, highlight and take notes as the class\ngoes over the handout.\n\nStudents are to complete tasks #1-5 on the handout. For\nitem #1, students are to go to websites looking for current events\nin the assigned biotechnology domain. I emphasize the\nwebsites on the handout to the students as a starting point as many\nstduents want to go straight to Google. These websites are\n   and\n\n\nMake sure to focus on the methods of printing to avoid wasting\nvaluable ink and paper. Some teachers skip the printing of\nthe article and have students write the URL address. In this\ncase, students must write a summary as well as specifically stating\nthe three main points of the article.\n\nTeachers may decide to have students work solo or in\npairs. This decision may be based on computer\navailability. If students pair up, they must pair with\nanother student focusing on the same domain.\n\nOnce the first current event has been completed in class, future\ncurrent events may be completed as homework. Students benefit\nmost from completing current events at least once a quarter during\nthe school year.\n\nHave students turn to the next blank page of their legal\nscientific notebooks. They are to make a chart in their\nnotebook with three columns. The first column is the title of\nthe current event. The second column is the domain the\ncurrent event focuses on. The final column is one interesting\nfact from the current event.\n\nHave students find one person for each domain. They must\nfind one for their own domain as well. At the end of this\nshare time, students should have shared information on four current\nevents.\n\nHave students return to their voting ballot. Students may\nor may not have focused or learned more about the topics from the\nvoting ballot. Ask students if they have changed their minds\non any of the issues they voted on. Students should add to\nwhat they wrote in the first five minutes of class on the voting\nballot houndout.\n\nAssessment\n\nAssessment Types:\n\nProjects, Journals, Observations,\n\nStudents are assessed on three items:\n\n1. The completion of the voting ballot that started and ended\nthe class period. Teachers can check for completion on the\nday of class by stamping the assignment or they can check the\ncompletion of the assignment when the legal scientific notebooks\nare collected. Student beliefs are not graded on, only\ncompletion of handout with thoughtful responses below the\nvoting.\n\n2. Students are given points for participating every day.\nThere are many places where students can contribute to class\ndiscussion, including adding known examples in the biotechnology\ndomains, reading aloud, asking clarifying questions, etc. I\nbase student participation on a rubric which I give students after\nthe first 4 weeks of school. After that point, students are\nevaluated on participation every quarter.\n\n3. Students are graded on the current event. Since I have\nstudents print and glue in the current even to legal scientific\nnotebooks, I grade current events based on 10 points: 4 points for\nthe doing hte researcha nd finding, printing and gluing out the\ncurrent event article, 3 points for a valuable summary and 3 points\nfor the 3 main points (one point each). In order to receive\npoints, responses must be in complete sentences and not\nplagarized."}

{"text":"International Baccalaureate\n\nIB Biology Field Trip\n\nThe Biology course in the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma programme offers Ecology in both the core syllabus and as an option for students studying Biology at both standard level and higher level.\nField study courses at Medina Valley Centre allow IB Biology students to develop their knowledge and enjoyment of Biology and build up some practical hours in the outdoor classroom.\n\nThey also provide the opportunity for students to apply their knowledge at the end of the field course by carrying out an individual investigation of their choice on a particular ecosystem or organism. The rocky seashore at the eastern tip of the Island is ideal for carrying out investigations due to the wealth of different marine invertebrates and seaweeds found in the large, shallow rock pools.\n\nFor those students taking Option G, a field study course enables them to cover large parts of the syllabus including hands-on use of fieldwork techniques and equipment, such as random sampling and use of quadrats and transects.\nAll field courses begin with an introduction to ecology and as each group is unique, we tailor the rest of each field course to individual requirements. Risk assessments and resources are available to download beforehand.\n\nAll field study sites are within a 40 minute drive from Medina Valley Centre or are within walking distance\n\nEstuarine Ecosystem\n\nStudents carry out practical work which involves core sampling for invertebrates on mudflats of the Medina Estuary and measure abiotic variables which include tidal height, turbidity and salinity. ICT is used to turn the data the students collected into ecological pyramids of number, biomass and energy, which can be compared with data from other local ecosystems.\n\nRocky Seashore\n\nStudents can carry out an investigation on food webs and feeding relationships to generate ecological pyramids, similar to the study which can be carried out on the estuarine ecosystem. An alternative or supplementary investigation, particularly for those students studying Option G, is to use the rocky seashore to investigate an organism's niche, inter- and intraspecific competition and the competitive exclusion principle (Gause's Law).\n\nThe rocky seashore provides a brilliant opportunity for all students to see first hand and recognise species from the following animal Phyla: Porifera, Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, Annelida, Mollusca and Arthropoda as required in Topic 3. Each student can build on this knowledge to develop their own dichotomous key for up to 8 chosen organisms. There are also real live examples of alien species on the seashore, which students will have the opportunity to investigate, as well as many examples of species which use the r-strategy for reproduction.\n\nSaltmarsh Study\n\nThe key concepts of zonation and succession (as required for Option G) are taught using the data students obtain by sampling along a transect established to investigate the environmental gradient of a saltmarsh. The Spearman's Rank statistical test is use to analyse the results of the soil samples.\n\nPond Study\n\nStudents use instruments to measure abiotic factors and a dichotomous key to identify invertebrates to determine the species richness and biodiversity of 3 local ponds. Simpson's Diversity Index and the Mann-Whitney U statistical test are used to help analyse the data. The pond study is popular as an introductory session on the first afternoon because as some students are familiar with this habitat and all sites are within walking distance. However, the Simpson's Diversity Index can easily be carried out as part of another option if there is sufficient time available.\n\nMark-Release-Recapture\n\nSeveral different organisms can be caught to investigate their population using the mark-release-recapture method. Depending on the time available and tidal conditions, students can investigate the population of periwinkles or topshells on the seashore, crabs in the estuary or small mammals either in the Centre's grounds or the local woodland. Having collected data the population of the particular species can be estimated using the Lincoln Index.\n\nConservation Study\n\nThere are opportunities to compare first hand the advantages and disadvantages or in situ and ex situ conservation by visiting a Nature Reserve and the Isle of Wight Zoo, particularly considering the zoo's lemur conservation project. A visit to the zoo also allows students to study the behaviour of spider monkeys and the genetics of the white tiger, of which the zoo has the largest collection in Europe.\n\n________________________________________\n\nIB Geography Field trip\n\nThe fieldwork course for International Baccalaureate (IB) Geography is designed to provide stimulating case studies and to engage students in a range of geographical skills required by the exam board. The investigative approach and the fieldwork techniques will provide valuable training for students preparing the fieldwork report at the Higher Level or engaging in coursework at the Standard Level.\nSpecial emphasis is put on aerial photographs and map interpretation, including the use of Google Earth, electronic maps and GIS.\n\nAll field study sites are within a 40 minute drive from Medina Valley Centre or are within walking distance\n\nCase studies based on the Optional Themes for International Baccalaureate (IB) Geography:\n\nCoastal Management\n\nFieldwork at a coastal protection scheme on the active landslip zone of the Island or at a coastal honey pot in the West Wight. The coastal localities are investigated within the context of the Isle of Wight Shoreline Management Plan and Coastal Defence strategies.\n\nDrainage basin management\n\nFieldwork in either one of two accessible river basins. One of the rivers includes an innovative restoration scheme in an urban setting and the other flows across an agricultural landscape of mixed land use and geology.\n\nThe Estuarine Ecosystem and human activity\n\nFieldwork includes core sampling for invertebrates on the Medina Estuary to record the biological productivity of the inter-tidal mudflats. ICT is used to turn the data the students collect into ecological pyramids of number, biomass and energy. Mapwork and fieldwork is used to identify the pressures and threats to the protected habitats.\n\nPlant succession on a Saltmarsh\n\nFieldwork to record the plant succession across a halosere, includes soil sampling; the Spearman's Rank statistical test is used to analyse the results of processing the soil.\n\nSettlements - Urban morphology\n\nFieldwork includes urban land use mapping in Newport, retail mapping, use of GOAD maps; traffic and pedestrian data is presented as isoline maps to help define the CBD. Maps and aerial photographs are used to describe the site, situation and growth of the settlement.\n\nSettlements - Competing land use on the urban-rural fringe\n\nFieldwork includes detailed land use mapping and evaluations on Newport's urban-rural fringe. Historic land use surveys used to identify change on the urban-rural fringe and the Isle of Wight's Unitary Development Plan controlling further development."}
{"text":"FILES FOR THIS PROJECT HAVE BEEN UPLOADED TO DOCUMENT MANAGER - ISLAND CHALLENGE FOLDER\n\nINTRODUCTION Island Challenge 2010 will take place for much of the third quarter and include investigations in several important areas of earth systems science: topography and landforms, plate tectonics, geologic history, weather and climate, oceanography, hydrology, land use and management, energy, building and landscape design, transportation, outdoor recreation and even human history. Through active engagement in this important project, you will develop your critical thinking skills and apply your knowledge gained from research to solving real problems. Other important outcomes include functional collaboration and the use of imagination. A major goal will be to develop an understanding of the concept of sustainability and its relevance in today's world.\n\nThis project will provide an opportunity to work on a team and create something of which you have ownership. This will require cooperation, collaboration, communication, imagination and real commitment. In the second phase of this project, you will have the opportunity to experience civil engineering, building and landscape architecture, urban development, and environmental conservation. This project will require some work during lunch, before school or after school - class time alone might not be enough to achieve excellence, which is your goal. I will provide media center time for research as well as a number of links to excellent web sites. Be sure to allocate some time at home to do additional research.\n\nFINAL PRODUCTS\n\nEach group will be required to showcase their project at the town of Chapel Hill's annual Earth Action Fest to be held on Saturday afternoon April 10, 2010 at the newest city park just down the road from Southern Village. You will engage the general public in a talk about your island using visuals: a tri-fold display board, a large map of your creation and a three-dimensional model. If you developed a powerpoint slide show or infomercial, a laptop computer will serve as a tool in your display. I will secure a date for a similar display of products at the high school.\n\nGRADING\n\nThe Island Project (as it was once called) has been facilitated in some form for the past eight years. The changes from last year include a longer span of time, more specific rubrics for each facet of the project, and a required three-dimensional model. Much of the grade for the third quarter will be based on this project. It is imperative that every student maximize the use of their class time each day as well as communicate and cooperate. In this time of \"teach to the test,\" it is not common to have opportunities like this to engage in meaningful projects at school. You will be held accountable each day for your work by doing journal entries, a part of which will include an honest assessment of your use of time. Clear and concise rubrics for each step of the process and a timeline will be posted in DOCUMENT MANAGER - \"Island Project\" link.\n\nSTART-UP Students will work in cooperative groups of three to four. Each group will have ONE student who at the very least is a fair to good \"artist.\" In contrast to past years, each group in a class will randomly \"pick\" an island. The approximately fifty islands I have selected represent every oceanic region of the world, and information is available on each. The \"Island Project\" web link has the list of islands. Only one group will work on a specific island or island group.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE PROJECT The first step involves researching the island or island group and collecting important information. The island your group creates will be based on your randomly selected island. In other words, the climate, geology, location, etc. must be exactly the same as your selected island or island group. Part of your grade will be how similar the properties of your created island are to the island or island group from which it is based. This is an important idea for this project. Please speak with me if this explanation is not clear.\n\nConcurrently, your group will be collecting information through research AND sketching the \"natural island.\" Think of the natural island as uninhabited, therefore no human features will be shown on the map. It is the way the island appeared before it was ever settled. Information such as climate, geology, human history and the final drawing of the natural island map will be part of the tri-fold display, one of the final products\n\nThe next phase involves the creation of a wisely-planned, \"sustainably developed\" island. This island (shape and natural features) will be a replica of your natural island drawn at a much larger scale for display. The sustainably-developed island will, of course, have people living or vacationing on it, therefore the map will show human features. This phase will give group members experience with a number of interconnected disciplines such as civil engineering, \"green\" landscape and building design, energy, transportation, urban planning, outdoor recreation and environmental conservation.\n\nThe final phase of the project will begin several weeks before spring break and be completed in time for Earth Action Day on Saturday April 10th. Each group will highlight one area of the developed island and build a lightweight and easily transportable architectural model using materials including basswood, Styrofoam, and other \"junk drawer\" supplies.\n\nEarthbag Building Building with earthbags (sometimes called sandbags) is both old and new. Sandbags have long been used, particularly by the military, for creating strong, protective barriers, or for flood control. The same reasons that make them useful for these applications carry over to creating housing.

We worried about:\n\uf0a7 devoting enough time to reviewing the Benchmarks taught in previous grades;\n\uf0a7 being developmentally appropriate;\n\uf0a7 including just the right amount of best practice instructional activities;\n\uf0a7 incorporating to, with, and by into the Day-by-Day lesson plans;\n\uf0a7 interpreting and aligning the Benchmarks accurately;\n\uf0a7 making the lessons interesting and motivating; and\n\uf0a7 addressing the teaching and learning standards within the lessons.\nWe worried about everything, so you wouldn't have to worry. We know teaching is a difficult\nprofession at best and even more difficult when faced with increased academic standards and\ncontent expectations. We wanted to help you through this transition period by providing this easy\nto use model designed to prepare Michigan's students for future statewide assessments.\nWe realize we are providing a way for you to prepare your students for the MEAP. We also\nunderstand the best way for students to prepare for the MEAP is through excellent instruction\naligned to a carefully designed curriculum. With changing content expectations and statewide\nassessments, it has been challenging for schools and districts to keep pace. We offer this toolbox\nin light of the previous statements. We hope you will find, within these day-by-day lesson plans,\ninstructional strategies, and pedagogical ideas you can use everyday of the school year. If you\ndo, we have done our job. It means we have created more than MEAP preparation materials. It\nmeans we have influenced your instruction and possibly your curriculum.\nSt. Clair County teachers created this toolbox for use by Michigan teachers with Michigan\nstudents. It was a time consuming effort we hope other teachers find useful and will appreciate.\nSincerely,\nEighth Grade Toolbox Team\nMichael Larzelere \u2013 Port Huron Area School District\nSteven Hunt \u2013 Yale Public Schools\nCrystal Harris _ St. Clair RESA\nMonica Hartman \u2013 St. Clair County RESA\nKathy Lentz \u2013Capac Community Schools\nJason Letkiewicz \u2013 St. Clair RESA\nMike Maison \u2013 St. Clair RESA\nTracie Stubbs \u2013 Algonac Community Schools\n2\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nImportant Notices\nMichigan Curriculum Framework, Science Benchmarks\nThe science toolboxes are a suggested review at the beginning of the year for Michigan's fifth\ngrade students. Our emphasis is placed on the constructing and reflecting benchmarks. We\nembed them in the Physical, Earth and Life Science content standards of the Michigan Curriculum\nFramework. Use of these toolboxes does not guarantee all benchmarks have been addressed.\nThe benchmarks chosen are the ones that seem to be more difficult for many students.\nThe lessons are designed to make use of the \u2015to\u2016, \u2015with\u2016, and \u2015by\u2016 format. First, you model the\nskills and strategies for your students. Modeling means explicitly showing how the skill or\nstrategy is completed and all the thinking that goes on during its completion. Second, you help\nyour students practice the skills and strategies. This help can be whole class, small group, or\nindividual guidance. Third, you let your students complete the skills and strategies on their own.\nThis format starts with the activity on Day 2. During this activity, you will model the inquiry\nprocess. You will think aloud as you ask the investigation question, make a prediction, graph data,\ninterpret results and draw a conclusion. In the lessons that follow, students will be given\nopportunities to practice these skills with less and less intervention until they can do them on their\nown.\nEach daily lesson is designed to engage the students for the full science period of 50-60 minutes.\nBecause the toolbox is a review of content taught in fifth through seventh grade, for most of the\nactivity days, the students are not doing the investigations themselves. Rather they are graphing,\nanalyzing, and interpreting data collected by the project teachers or their students. This is not the\nbest way to teach science, but given the time constraints of fifteen days, this is the format we\nchose. In a few cases, pictures and videos were made of the data collection. The video clips are\nprovided on a separate CD. We invite teachers to extend the full investigation to their students,\nwhen time permits.\nWe hope that some of the ideas presented will be springboards to further inquiry projects after the\nreview period.

These two strands\nare the foundation of the inquiry process and should be a part of any Life, Earth and Physical\nScience Lessons. The context of this investigation is a real-world problem involving the\ngreenhouse effect in cars. Students will have an opportunity to ask a question related to the\nscenario, make a prediction, identify variables that make the investigation a fair test, graph\nresults, analyze data and draw a conclusion. An optional activity to extend the learning is\nincluded.\nTo, With and By\nUsing the \u2015to, with and by\u2016 format, first model the strategy for the students. Modeling means\nexplicitly showing how the skill or strategy is completed, including the thinking processes that\ngoes on during its completion. Second, help the students practice the skills and strategies. This\nhelp can be the whole class, small group, or individual guidance. Third, let students complete the\nskills and strategies on their own. As you go through the steps of the inquiry in this activity, model\nthe skills and strategies. Make your thinking explicit. In later activities, you will give the students\nthe opportunity to practice the skills with help.\nKEY QUESTIONS\nWhat are the steps in a scientific investigation?\nHow can I design an investigation to solve a real world problem?\nPROCEDURE\n1. Students read the scenario that sets the stage for the investigation.\n2. Follow the steps through the investigation, modeling them and thinking aloud.\nEXTENSION\nIf there is time, students should design an investigation to answer one of the research questions\nthey suggest in their reflection.\n9\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nName _______________________________________________________ Day 1\nA Car in the Sun\nAlicia read the newspaper. She read: \u2015A baby girl has died, apparently from sunstroke,\nafter being left in the family car outside her home on one of the hottest days of the\nyear\u2026It is believed that the baby was in the car which had been parked in the shade for\nabout two hours during early afternoon, in temperatures of up to 23\uf0b0 C (75\uf0b0F).\u2016 The news\narticle continued, \u2015The Automobile Association is currently carrying out tests on heat\ninside cars at different times of the day.\u2016\nAlicia was very sad to read that news. She heard of other similar cases. She wondered\nhow hot it does get in the car when it is parked in the sun. She decided to conduct an\ninvestigation.\nPurpose:\nHelp Alicia design the investigation. The first step is to define the purpose or ask a\nquestion. What question could Alicia ask for the investigation?\nHow hot does it get inside a car that is parked in the sun?\nWhat is the rate of the temperature increase inside a car when it\nis parked in the sun?\nHypothesis:\nThe hypothesis is the prediction of what you think will happen in the investigation. It can\nbegin with the words \u2015I think\u2016.\nWrite your hypothesis on the lines.\nNext, give a reason for your prediction. Explain your thinking.\nI think this because\nProcedure:\nThe next step is to design a procedure that will answer the research questions and gather\nthe tools she needs. Alicia has a digital temperature probe to measure the temperature\n1 10\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\ninside the car. She must decide how long the temperature probe will stay in the car to\ngather temperature information. She must also decide how often the probe will collect the\ndata. An advantage of the temperature probe is she would not have to open the car to\nread the thermometer. This is Alicia's procedure:\n1. Do this activity on a mostly sunny day.\n2. Measure the air temperature and record.\n3. Set the probe so it will measure the temperature every minute for 30 minutes.\n4. Close all the car windows. Put the thermometer in the back seat where a baby car\nseat would be, and start the temperature probe. Close the car door.\n5. After 30 minutes, download the temperature data into the computer.\n6. Repeat this test two more times.\nFair Testing: Identify and Control Variables:\nManipulated variables are the things that you change on purpose in the investigation.\nWhat variable was Alicia controlling or studying in this investigation?\nAlicia will put the car in the sunlight for the purpose of finding out what happens.\nSunlight is the variable she is manipulating or controlling.\nThe responding variable is the one that changes as a result of changing the manipulated\nvariable. What will change when the sunlight shines into the car?\nThe temperature inside the car will change when the car is in the sunlight.\nWhat should Alicia do to make sure the test is fair?\nThe temperature of the inside of the car should start at about the same\ntemperature as the air. Have Mom or Dad drive the car out of the garage\ninto the sunny part of the driveway when you are ready to start, or start the\nexperiment after the car has been driven with the windows open.\n2\n11\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nCollecting and Organizing Data\nThe day was a mostly sunny day. The air temperature was 87\u00b0F. The car was in the\ngarage and driven out to begin the investigation.\nThe following table shows the temperatures inside the car each minute for 20 minutes.\nUse these data to make a graph.

Describe your observations.\nThe temperature inside the car was 89\u00b0F at the beginning of the investigation. The largest\nincrease in temperature came during the first 3 minutes. During the first and second minute,\nthe temperature went up 10\u00b0 each. During the third minute, it increased 6\u00b0. In the fourth\nminute, it increased only 1\u00b0, and then the temperature started to decrease slightly. This\ncould be due to a passing cloud. It increased by 4\u00b0 each from the 8th to the 9th minute and\nthe 9th to the 10th minute, and then it decreased again by 1\u00b0. After the 11th minute, there was\na more gradual increase of 3\u00b0, than 2\u00b0, and during the last 14 minutes, there was a 1 \u00b0\ndifference or less. After 30 minutes, the temperature in the car was 145\u00b0.\n4\n13\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nConclusion:\nWhat do your results tell you? Are there any relationships, patterns or trends in you\nresults?\nThe temperature inside the car parked in the sun became uncomfortably hot. It increased the\nmost during the first few minutes and it continued to get hotter after that. The temperature\ninside a car parked in the sun with closed windows gets very hot in a short period of time.\nWhen the temperature outside is 88\uf0b0, it can get to be 145\uf0b0 in less than a half hour.\nCan you explain the relationships, patterns or trends in your results? Try to use some\nscience ideas to help you explain what happened.\nThe sunlight can pass through the car windows because the windows are transparent.\nObjects inside the car absorb the light energy and the light energy is transformed to heat\nenergy. The molecules in the air and the objects in the car start to move faster. The heat\nenergy cannot get through the windows as easily as the light energy. The heat energy is\ntrapped inside the car (greenhouse effect) and the car gets warmer until it reaches a point\nwhere the rate of heat entering the house equals the rate of heat lost by the car (equilibrium).\nReflection:\nHow could Alicia improve this investigation?\nA passing cloud may have caused the temperature to decrease for a short time during the\ninvestigation. Alicia could repeat the experiment to see the affect of clouds.\nShe could set the probe to take more temperature readings, maybe twice or three times a\nminute instead of once a minute.\nShe could take the temperature readings for a longer period of time.\nShe could do this again on a day where there are no clouds.\nWhat new questions could she investigate?\nWhat is the rate of temperature increase if the car was parked in the shade?\nDoes the color of the car make a difference?\nDoes the time of day make a difference?\nDoes the temperature of the air make a difference?\nWhat would happen if there were no clouds during part of the investigation?\nWhat difference would there be if the car had tinted windows?\nEXTENSION\nDesign an investigation that could study one of your new research questions.

The molecules in a solid are closely\npacked and locked in place by an invisible force.\nThey can make only small movements, but they are\nalways moving. The more energy they have, the\nmore they can move. If you apply heat to a solid, the\nparticles will vibrate faster and faster until eventually\nthey have enough energy to break the force that\nholds them together and the solid becomes a liquid.\nA liquid is a state of matter that has a definite volume, but no definite shape. The\nparticles in a liquid are farther apart but are still held together by invisible forces.\nThey bump into each other, but can move around within a substance and slide\npast each other. The faster moving molecules will\nescape the liquid completely and the liquid\nsubstance turns to a gas. This is called\nevaporation. The more heat energy you apply to a\nliquid, the faster the molecules move and then\nescape. Evaporation of water can occur when the\nwater boils and at room temperature.\nA gas is a state of matter that has no definite shape\nor volume. The particles in gas are far apart and\nmove in any direction, as fast as they want. The more\nheat you apply, the faster they move and the gas\nexpands, not the molecules. If the gas is in a closed\ncontainer, the pressure inside the container will\nincrease.\nIf you continue to heat a gas and keep it contained while you heat it, the molecules\nwill break apart and when it is very hot, the atoms will eventually come apart,\nleaving a substance called plasma. Plasma is rare on Earth, but is plentiful in\nother parts of the universe.\n7\n19\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nStudent #1\nName ____________________________ flask\nare far apart.

The\nReciprocal Teaching strategy will be used. They will write notes in a graphic organizer so they\nwill have a record of their ideas which they can revisit as they go through the other days of the\ntoolbox.\nRECIPROCAL TEACHING 1\nPalincsar (1986) describes the concept of reciprocal teaching:\n\"Definition: Reciprocal teaching refers to an instructional activity that takes place in the form of a\ndialogue between teachers and students regarding segments of text. The dialogue is structured\nby the use of four strategies: summarizing, question generating, clarifying, and predicting. The\nteacher and students take turns assuming the role of teacher in leading this dialogue.\nPurpose: The purpose of reciprocal teaching is to facilitate a group effort between teacher and\nstudents as well as among students in the task of bringing meaning to the text. Each strategy was\nselected for the following purpose:\n\uf0b7 Summarizing provides the opportunity to identify and integrate the most important\ninformation in the text. Text can be summarized across sentences, across paragraphs,\nand across the passage as a whole. When the students first begin the reciprocal teaching\nprocedure, their efforts are generally focused at the sentence and paragraph levels. As\nthey become more proficient, they are able to integrate at the paragraph and passage\nlevels.\n\uf0b7 Question generating reinforces the summarizing strategy and carries the learner one more\nstep along in the comprehension activity. When students generate questions, they first\nidentify the kind of information that is significant enough to provide the substance for a\nquestion. They then pose this information in question form and self-test to ascertain that\nthey can indeed answer their own question. Question generating is a flexible strategy to\nthe extent that students can be taught and encouraged to generate questions at many\nlevels. For example, some school situations require that students master supporting detail\ninformation; others require that the students be able to infer or apply new information from\ntext.\n\uf0b7 Clarifying is an activity that is particularly important when working with students who have\na history of comprehension difficulty. These students may believe that the purpose of\nreading is saying the words correctly; they may not be particularly uncomfortable that the\nwords, and in fact the passage, are not making sense. When the students are asked to\nclarify, their attention is called to the fact that there may be many reasons why text is\ndifficult to understand (e.g., new vocabulary, unclear reference words, and unfamiliar and\nperhaps difficult concepts). They are taught to be alert to the effects of such impediments\nto comprehension and to take the necessary measures to restore meaning (e.g., reread,\nask for help).\n1\nRetrieved from the NCREL website at \n25\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\n\uf0b7 Predicting occurs when students hypothesize what the author will discuss next in the text.\nIn order to do this successfully, students must activate the relevant background knowledge\nthat they already possess regarding the topic. The students have a purpose for reading: to\nconfirm or disprove their hypotheses. Furthermore, the opportunity has been created for\nthe students to link the new knowledge they will encounter in the text with the knowledge\nthey already possess. The predicting strategy also facilitates use of text structure as\nstudents learn that headings, subheadings, and questions imbedded in the text are useful\nmeans of anticipating what might occur next.\nIn summary, each of these strategies was selected as a means of aiding students to construct\nmeaning from text as well as a means of monitoring their reading to ensure that they, in fact,\nunderstand what they read.\nKEY QUESTION\nHow is matter classified?\nWhat are the molecular properties of matter?\nPROCEDURE\n1. Use the Reciprocal Reading Strategy as a whole group for each section of the reading.\nThese strategies include Question, Predict, Clarify, and Summarize. These do not need to\nfollow in any particular order.\n2. Students complete the graphic organizer.\n3. Use the assessment items on pages 13 and 14 in the student journal.\nREFERENCES AND RESOURCES\nPalincsar, A.S. (1986). Reciprocal teaching. In Teaching reading as thinking.

Today we know that there are a certain\nnumber of elements that make up all matter on Earth. Elements are made of tiny\nparticles called atoms. Atoms are composed of a certain number of protons, electrons,\nand neutrons.\nMatter has physical and chemical properties. Color, smell, mass, volume, density,\ntemperature, freezing point and boiling point are examples of physical properties of\nmatter. The way elements combine and react with each other are chemical properties.\nMatter can change physically and chemically. To understand how matter changes, you\nneed to know something about molecules.\nElements, Compounds, and Mixtures\nElements are the building blocks of all matter. They are Element Percentage\nsubstances that cannot be broken down or divided by Oxygen 47\nordinary chemical means. The smallest possible Silicon 28\namount of an element is called an atom. We know of Aluminum 8\nover 100 elements. About 92 occur in nature and the Iron 5\nrest are man-made. Four of the elements make up 96% Calcium 3.5\nof all living matter: carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and Sodium 3\nnitrogen. Eight elements make up 99% of the Earth's Potassium 2.5\ncrust. Magnesium 2\nAll Other 1\nOne or two letters represent each element. The\nelements are arranged in order based on their Elements Found in the Earth's Crust\nproperties in what we call the Periodic Table. The\nrows are called periods. All the atoms in a row or period have the same number of\natomic shells for their electrons. Columns are called groups and elements in the groups\nhave the same chemical and physical properties.\nCompounds are substances made of two or more elements that are combined\nchemically. Compounds can be in the form of a solid, liquid or a gas. They can change\nfrom one phase to another, but the elements that combined to make them cannot be\nbroken down through a physical process. For example, when two atoms of hydrogen\ncombine with one atom of oxygen, they form water. The symbol for water, H 2O, shows\nhow the atoms combined. Water can go through physical changes by heating and\ncooling. Liquid water can lose heat energy and become a solid, or it can gain heat\nenergy and become a gas. But a chemical process called electrolysis is needed to break\nthe water molecule back to hydrogen and oxygen molecules. Carbon dioxide is a gas\n9\n27\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nformed when two atoms of oxygen combine with one atom of carbon. The symbol CO 2\nshows how the atoms combined. When the atoms combine, the new substance is very\ndifferent than the elements that made them. For example, water is very different than\nhydrogen or oxygen.\nMinerals are another example of compounds. Pyrite, or Fool's Gold, is a mineral that is\nmade of the elements iron and sulfur. Each molecule of Pyrite is made of 1 part of iron\nand 2 parts of sulfur that are chemically combined. The chemical symbol for Pyrite is\nFeS2. The mineral magnetite (Fe3O4) is a natural magnet formed when 3 atoms of iron\ncombine chemically with 4 atoms of oxygen. In forming compounds, the number and kind\nof elements that combine are always the same.\nChemists look for new ways to chemically combine the elements to make new\ncompounds with properties that they find useful, but elements always remain the same.\nMixtures are a physical combination of two or more elements or compounds. They are\nnot chemically combined. The amount of the substance that combines does not always\nhave to be exactly the same. For example, you can mix a different amount of sugar with\nwater and still have sugar water. A new substance is not formed in the mixture. The\noriginal materials are still in the mixture and they can be easily separated by physical\nmeans. The properties of the mixture could be similar to the properties of the substances\nthat came together to form them.\nThere are many kinds of mixtures. Solutions are mixtures in which the particles are\nspread out evenly throughout the mixture. The particles are very small and will not settle\nout. Solutions can be made from all phases of matter. Examples of solutions are Kool-\nAid, tea, sugar water and salt water. Mixtures can also be in a solid form. Rocks are an\nexample of a mixture of solids. Minerals combine physically to make rocks, but elements\ncombine chemically to make minerals. help10\n28\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nOrganizer for Elements, Compounds and Mixtures\nUse this chart to help you organize ideas about elements, compounds and mixtures found\nin the reading.\nElements\nOver 100 kinds of elements\nmake up all matter.\nMade of one kind of atom\nMixtures\nCompounds\nMade of 2 or more\nMade of 2 or more elements physically\nelements chemically combined\ncombined\nSolutions\nMade of very small particles\nthat will not settle out and\nare spread out evenly\nthroughout\nStates of Matter\nDescribe the molecular bond and the motion of molecules in a solid, liquid and gas\nState of Matter Molecular Bond Motion of Molecules\nMolecules move randomly and bump into\nSolids Strong bond\neach other.

A video of this investigation is provided on the CD. They will extend their learning by\napplying it to another investigation with a balloon on a flask which holds a small amount of water\nthat is heated. If available, the investigation of the balloon and the flask can be performed in the\nclassroom.\nKEY QUESTION\nBy what pattern will the chocolate chips melt? Why?\nHow can I represent the molecules in a flask with water and a balloon attached when it is\nheated and cooled?\nPROCEDURE\n1. Read the description of the investigation and the investigation question on Student Journal\npage 15. Give students time to make a prediction and write an explanation.\n2. Watch the video, Melting Chocolate, twice; the first time to get a big picture of what is\nhappening and the second time to record the time it takes for the chocolate chips to melt.\n3. Students make a graph of the data.\n4. Discuss the results. Use these questions and the questions from the video:\na. Describe the properties of chocolate before and after it melted. What properties\nstayed the same? What properties changed? Before: sweet, hard or firm, brown,\ndefinite shape, solid. After: sweet, soft, brown, undefined shape, liquid.\nb. How did the closeness of the flame affect the chocolate chips? The closer the\nchocolate chip was to the flame, the faster it melted. The chocolate chip furthest\nfrom the flame did not melt.\nc. In what direction did the heat energy move? The heat energy moved from the area\nclose to the candle to the area farther away from the candle\nd. What can you conclude about how the heat energy moves? Heat energy moves\nfrom a warmer area to a cooler area.\ne. Describe the molecules of the chocolate chip before and after they were heated.\nBefore the chocolate chip was heated, the molecules of the chocolate chip were\narranged in an orderly pattern. They were held together by a molecular force and\nthey were moving in place. When they were heated, the energy they received\nmade them move faster. The molecules remained close, but they were able to\nslide past each other. The heat energy allowed the chocolate chip to change from\na solid state to a liquid state.\nf. Describe the molecules in the aluminum foil bridge during the investigation.\nAluminum foil is a solid, so the molecules in the aluminum foil remained in an\norderly pattern throughout the investigation. The molecules were moving in place.\nThe heat gave them energy which made them vibrate faster and bump into each\nother harder than before. The molecules did not travel along the foil, but when\nthey bumped their neighbors, they passed the energy on. This is called the\nconduction of heat. This conduction of heat slowed down as it was passed along\nthe foil because some of the heat energy was passed to the air molecules near the\nfoil bridge.)\n5. The balloon and the flask pages can be used as an assessment. They can be completed\nat a later time.\nRESOURCES\nThe melting chocolate chips activity came from the following resource:\nAIMS Education Foundation (2004). Hot Chocolate. Popping with Power. (pp. 96-102)\n33\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nName ________________________________________________ Day 4 heldWhat is Energy?\nEnergy can be defined as the ability to do work. If an object can be put to work, then it\nhas energy. Applying energy is doing work. In science, work is when you apply a force\nto an object and it moves.\nObjects can have stored or potential energy. When you stretch a rubber band, you store\nenergy in the rubber. You can feel this stored energy when you let it go. It can sting your\nfingers or zoom across the room. When you jump on a trampoline, as you go down,\nsome of the energy is stored in the springs around the edge of the mat. This energy is\nused to lift you back up into the air.\nWhen an object moves, the potential energy it has changes to kinetic energy, or energy of\nmovement. The amount of kinetic energy depends on its mass and speed. The kinetic\nenergy of atoms and molecules is sometimes referred to as heat energy.\nHeat Energy\nOn day 2, we reviewed the motion of molecules. Heat energy is due to the motion of\nmolecules. Heat is related to temperature. An object's temperature is the measure of the\naverage speed of the atoms and molecules. The higher the temperature, the faster its\natoms and molecules move. Heat energy is made up partly of kinetic energy and partly of\npotential energy. When the atoms move or vibrate, they have kinetic energy because they\nare moving. They also have potential energy because the spacing between the atoms is\nchanging as they move; as you stretch or squeeze the distance, you store potential\nenergy just like when you stretch or squeeze a spring. So heat energy is due to the\nmotion of individual atoms.\n14\n34\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nName ________________________________________________ Day 4\nMelting Chocolate Chips\nQuestion: By what pattern will the chocolate chips melt? Why?\nIn this investigation, a foil bridge is made\nfrom folding a piece of aluminum foil (24\ncm x 30 cm) into a narrow strip and\nplacing it between two 16 ounce metal\ncans. Five chocolate chips are spread\nout evenly along the aluminum foil bridge\nand a small candle is placed under the\nbridge, under the first chocolate chip. The\ncandle is lit and the time it takes the\nchocolate chips to melt is measured.\nPrediction:\nWatch the video (name) Record the amount of time it takes for each chocolate chip to\nstart to melt in the table below. Make a graph of the results.\nResults:\nWhat happened? Describe your observations and record your results.\nThe first chocolate chip close to the flame melted in 10 seconds.\nThe second chip took 25 seconds to start to melt. The third chip\ntook 45 seconds and the fourth chip took 100 seconds. The last\nchocolate chip did not melt. When the chips melted, they first got\nsoft on the bottom of the chip.\nChip Time\n1 10 seconds\n2 25 seconds\n3 45 seconds\n4 100 seconds\n5\n15\n35\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nTime it Takes for Chocolate Chip to Melt\n110\n100\n90\n80\n70\nSeconds\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nChip 1 Chip 2 Chip 3 Chip 4 Chip 5\nChip Number\nConclusion:\nWhat do your results tell you? Are there any patterns?\nIt took time for the heat energy from the flame needed to melt the\nchocolate chip to transfer along the foil strip. Although the chips were\nplaced an equal distance apart, it took longer each for each chip to get\nthe heat energy\nExplain the patterns using scientific ideas about the motion of molecules and the transfer\nof heat energy.\nHeat energy from the flame transferred to the molecules in the foil strip. The\nmolecules in the foil started to move faster making the temperature of the foil bridge\nhigher. The molecules in the foil bumped the molecules in the chocolate, making\nthem move faster. This made the chocolate chip change from a solid to a liquid. It\ntook time for the molecules in the chocolate chips further from the flame to receive\nenough heat energy to melt. Some of the heat energy transferred to the air\nmolecules and was lost.\nWhat did you find out about the question you were investigating? Was it different from\nyour prediction? Explain.\nThe chocolate chips melted in the pattern of increasing time. The\nfurther the chip was from the heat source, the longer it took between\nthe chips to melt.\n16\n36\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nName ________________________________________________ Day 4\nThe Flask and Balloon Part 1\nA balloon was placed over the neck of a flask, which had a small amount of water. The\nflask was placed on a cup warmer. Use pictures and words to explain what happened.\nThe molecules in the second flask are moving\nfaster, increasing the pressure inside the flask and\nballoon and taking up more space.\nHeat energy from the cup warmer was transferred to the water in the flask. The energy\nmade the molecules in the water move faster, increasing the temperature of the water\nand the air. As the liquid water molecules moved faster, some escaped the liquid and\nchanged to water vapor molecules. The molecules were free to move and spread out.\nThis increased the pressure inside the flask. Since the balloon was stretchy, the balloon\nwas able to expand.\nNote students' misconceptions: It would be incorrect to say that the hot air rises or the\nparticles expand when heated.\n17\n37\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nName ________________________________________________ Day 4\nThe Flask and Balloon Part 2\nA balloon was placed over the neck of a heated flask with a small amount of water. The\nflask was removed from the cup warmer. When the flask cooled, the balloon went into\nthe flask. Explain in words and pictures what happened to the molecules.\nThe molecules in the first flask were warmer and were moving very fast. They lost energy\nwhen they cooled. Some of the water vapor molecules condensed back into liquid water\nmolecules. The molecules in the flask when it was cooled did not take up as much space\nas they did when they were warmer. The pressure inside the flask decreased. The air\npressure outside the flask and balloon pushed the balloon into the flask.\n18\n38\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nLesson Focus Day 5\n\uf0b7 Using Physical Science\nMotion of Objects\nDay 5: Balanced and Unbalanced Forces; Constant\nmotion and balanced forces.

Write a theory about why the brick did not move in these investigations. Include the\nconcepts of force and motion.\nWhen two forces are equal and are applied in opposite directions, they\nare balanced and there is no motion.\n6. The brick is on the table with two force probes attached. Pull harder on the right.\nWhat happens? Why?\n25 N 47N The brick moves to the right. The pulling force on\nthe right is greater than the pulling force to the left.\nThe forces are in the opposite direction, but they are\nnot equal. They are unbalanced forces, so the brick\nmoves.\n7. Why was the motion to the right?\nThe forces were opposite in direction, but were not equal. The motion occurs\nin the direction of the greater applied force.\n8. The brick is on the table with 2 force probes attached. Push harder on the right side\nand lightly on the left. Predict the force. What happens? Why?\n17 N 36 N The brick moves to the left. The pushing force on\nthe right is greater than the pushing force to the left.\nThe forces are in the opposite direction, but they are\nnot equal. They are unbalanced forces, so the brick\nmoves.\n20\n42\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\n9. Why was the motion to the left?\nThe forces were opposite in direction, but were not equal. The motion\noccurs in the direction of the greater applied force.\n10. Hold the brick waist high with one force probe attached to the top of the brick. Pull\nthe brick up to your shoulder. Hold it at shoulder level for 10 seconds. The graph\nusing the force probe is pictured below. After 1.42 seconds, the greatest force was\nmeasured. It was 16.81 N.\nDraw a picture of the brick and the forces acting on the brick between second 1 and 2.\nExplain what happened to the brick.\n17 N The brick moved up because the pulling force upward\nwas greater than the force of gravity pulling down.\nLike the other examples, the forces are in opposite\ndirections, but are not equal.\nLesser force\n11. Write a theory about how things move. Use the concept of balanced and\nunbalanced forces.\nIf two equal forces are applied in opposite directions, they are balanced\nforces and the object does not move. When two forces are not equal or\nnot in opposite directions, they are unbalanced and the object moves in\nthe direction of the greater applied force.\n21\n43\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nLesson Focus Day 6\n\uf0b7 Using Physical Science\nMotion of Objects\nDay 6: The Roller Coaster.

In class they\nmade a roller coaster from foam tubing. They formed a loop with\npart of the tube and taped it to the floor. They taped one end of\nthe roller coaster to the wall at different heights from the floor. The\nfirst height was taped at 1.4 meters (140cm). The second height\nwas set at 1.2 meters (120 cm). The third height was set at 1\nmeter (100 cm).\nA marble, held in position at the top of the roller coaster,\nwas let go. It rolled down the hill and then up and around\nthe loop. It continued to roll off the foam tubing onto the\nfloor where it eventually came to a stop. The class timed\nhow long it took for the marble to complete the path.\nThey measured the distance the marble traveled on the\nroller coaster and on the floor after it left the roller\ncoaster.

Machines\nhelp us by making it easier to apply the unbalanced force needed to move\n50\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nheavy things.\nThere are six simple machines: the inclined plane, pulley, lever, screw, wedge, and wheel and\naxle. Some of these are variations of others. The wedge is made of two inclined planes. The\nscrew is an inclined plane that wraps around itself.\nThe inclined plane reduces the force needed to lift an object. Instead of lifting the object straight\nup, it is pushed along the inclined plane. The longer the inclined plane, the more gradual the\nslope and less force is needed. A shorter plane would have a steeper slope and would require\nmore force. The trade-off for an inclined plane is that you have to move the object a longer\ndistance to use less force.\nThe lever is a rigid object that is usually long and narrow, like a bar or pole. This bar or pole\nturns or pivots around a fixed point called a fulcrum. There are different kinds of levers,\ndepending on where the fulcrum is and where you apply the force. In a first class lever, the\nfulcrum is in the middle, between the force and the load. If the fulcrum is close to the load, then\nless force is needed to lift an object. The trade off is that the pushing end of the lever has to\nmove a greater distance. In a second class lever, the load is in the middle between the fulcrum\nand the force. Wheel barrows and nut crackers are examples of second class levers. In a third\nclass lever, the force is in the middle. Examples of third class levers are golf clubs, hockey\nsticks, baseball bats, brooms, rakes, and catapults.\nAt the beginning of this review, students are asked to think about the pyramids and how simple\nmachines may have been used to help build them. The focus for this review is on three of the\nsimple machines: the inclined plane, the lever and the pulley. As this is meant to be a review,\nwhat would take about 9-10 days of hands-on, minds-on classroom instruction is condensed to\none day. To make this review process easier for the visual learners, video of the activities are\navailable on the CD. Pictures are also presented on the students' journal pages.\nKEY QUESTION\nWhat is the advantage of using simple machines like inclined planes, levers and pulleys?\nPROCEDURE\n1.

We see things because they either\nproduce light, like the sun, light bulbs, lasers, lightning bugs and candles, or they reflect\nlight. Light is energy.\nScientists think about light in two ways, the particle theory and the wave theory. In the\nparticle theory, light is thought of as a stream of particles called photons. This theory\ndeveloped because people saw rays of light streaming through clouds on partly sunny\ndays. The particle theory explains how objects that block the stream of light make\nshadows. In the wave theory, light travels in waves of different sizes. Waves are\narranged in order by size and frequency in what is called the electromagnetic spectrum.\nThe electromagnetic spectrum includes gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet, optical or\nvisible light waves, infrared, and radio waves. Gamma waves are the shortest and radio\nwaves are the longest. Human eyes can only see the optical or visible light waves.\nThe frequency of the waves determines the colors we see. Frequency is the number of\ncomplete waves that pass a given point in a certain amount of time. It can also be\ndescribed as the number of waves per second. Frequency is measured in units called\nhertz. Red has the shortest frequency of visible light and violet the longest. The longer\nthe frequency is, the greater the energy. Violet has more energy than red.\nLight travels in a straight line. It travels at different speeds, depending on the medium it\nis traveling through. Light travels about 186,000 miles per second in the vacuum of\nspace. It slows down when it travels through air, water, and other transparent materials\nlike glass and diamonds. The denser the material, the slower it travels.\nInteractions of Visible Light with Matter\nVisible light interacts with materials in different ways. Some materials allow light to pass\nthrough. Objects that transmit light, that is, they let nearly all the light pass through, are\ntransparent. Examples of transparent materials are glass, clear water and diamonds.\nIf light is scattered as it passes through a medium and the object is distorted or hazy,\nthe medium is said to be translucent. Examples of translucent materials include\nsunglasses, waxed paper, frosted glass windows, or smoky air. Objects that do not\ntransmit any light are opaque.\nWhen light reaches matter it can be:\n\uf0b7 Transmitted, or pass through the object with no effect\n\uf0b7 Refracted through the object, which changes speed\n\uf0b7 Reflected off the object\n\uf0b7 Absorbed by the object\nA combination of these interactions is possible at one time.\n60\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\n32\nReflected Light\nReflected light is light that bounces off something. The law of reflection of light says that\nthe angle at which light bounces off a surface is the same as the angle at which it hits\nthe surface. When light hits a flat, smooth surface like metal or glass, the light energy\nbounces off in one direction. When light hits a rough surface, it scatters in many\ndirections because the surface is uneven. But a surface can be rough even if it does\nnot appear to be rough to us. It could be rough to an extremely\nsmall photon of light. You can see the uneven surface of paper if\nyou look at paper under a microscope. You are able to see the\nReflected Light words on this paper when you look them from any angle because\nof the way the reflected light is scattered. When that light reaches\nyour eyes, you see it.\nRefracted Light\nLight travels at different speeds through space, air, water and\nother transparent materials. When it reaches the boundary\nbetween two different kinds of material, it changes speed and in\nmost cases it changes direction. When this happens, we say\nthat light is bent or refracted. You can see this when you look at\nobjects in water. A pencil in a glass of water appears to be bent\nwhen you look at the pencil through the side of the glass.\nLight is also refracted when it travels through lenses. The\nbending of light through the curved surface of a lens causes the\nlight rays to come together or spread out. A convex lens causes light to come together.\nThis can produce an image that can be focused on a screen. A concave lens spreads\nthe light out, so an image on a screen cannot be focused.\nConvex Lens\nConcave Lens\nAbsorbed Light\nWhen light is absorbed, almost all of its energy is transferred to the\nmatter it strikes. This absorption of energy causes the atoms and\nmolecules in that matter to move faster and heat up. How fast they\nspeed up depends on the type of material and the arrangement of Absorbed Light\nmolecules.\n33 61\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nCornell Two-Column Notes\nKeywords: Notes:\nLight I.

Information that students are not\nexpected to master but are important for interpreting the graphs is included in the scenario of\nsome of the problems. Students should learn to read all the text as a test taking strategy. There\nmay be information in the text hat could help them answer some questions.\nKEY QUESTIONS\nHow can charts and graphs help interpret weather data and show relationships?\nWhat is the water cycle?\nPROCEDURE:\n1. Students work on the first two questions about dew point and temperature. Information\nneeded to answer these questions is contained in the text before the question. Discuss\nanswers and strategies for finding the answers.\n2. For question 3, students draw a picture that will represent the water cycle. Students\nshould continue answering questions 4 through 9 on their own to give others time to\ndraw and explain. Take time for students to share their drawings of the water cycle.\nSome students think that water disappears when it evaporates. Listen during their\nexplanations to be sure they understand the science. Students' responses should\ninclude the motion of molecules as reviewed in earlier lessons.\n3. In the next set of questions, students construct graphs of the data and describe an\ninteresting pattern from the data of wind speed and air pressure. If there is not enough\ntime during class to do the graphs, students can do these as a homework assignment\nand they can be discussed the next day.\nRESOURCES\n\uf0b7 Weather Underground: \n\uf0b7 Intellicast.com: \n\uf0b7 University of Illinois Online Weather Guide:\n\n\uf0b7 The Weather Channel: \n\uf0b7 USA Today Weather Maps: \nsystems.htm\n70\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nName ______________________________________ Day 11\nThe graph below shows the temperature and dew point for Detroit on July 16, 2005.\nUse it to answer questions 1 and 2.\nDetroit, Michigan\nJuly 16, 2005\nTemperature Dew Point\n90\n80\n70\nTemperature (\u00b0F)\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n5:00 6:00 7:00 8:00 9:00 10:00 11:00 12:00 1:00 2:00 3:00 4:00 5:00 6:00 7:00 8:00 9:00 10:00\nAM AM AM AM AM AM AM PM PM PM PM PM PM PM PM PM PM PM\nTime of Day\nThe temperature at which water vapor condenses into liquid is called the dew point\ntemperature.

Evaporation of water from a source\n2. Transportation of water as vapor\/clouds to another place\n3. Precipitation in another place\nAn explanation would refer to the water cycle in which water evaporates\ninto the air. This happens when the molecules are heated, usually from\nthe sun, and move rapidly, breaking the molecular attraction that holds\nthem together. When they escape, they become gas. Eventually, the\nmolecules cool, losing energy, and forming liquid water again. These\nsmall drops of water condense on salt or dust particles in the air, forming\nclouds and are carried away in currents of air to another place. The\nmolecules of water fall from the clouds as precipitation in the form of\nrain, sleet, or snow.\n4.

To make these abstract concepts easier to visualize, models of the room\nwill be used. Students will then be given an opportunity to explain their\nideas in writing. For these investigations, the room should be as dark as\npossible. Even a small amount of light from a source other than the\nlamp will shine on the Styrofoam bulbs and affect the results.\nKEY QUESTIONS\nHow can I model and explain the phases of the moon?\nHow can I model and explain solar and lunar eclipses?\n79\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nPROCEDURE: PHASES OF THE MOON\n4. Darken the room as much as possible. Put a lamp in the center of the room. Position\nthe lamp so the bulb is eye level for the students.\n5. Give each student a Styrofoam ball and a skewer or pencil. (The pencil makes a larger\nhole, so a skewer is preferred.) Stick the skewer into the ball.\n6. Students stand in a circle facing the lamp. Their heads will represent the Earth. The ball\nrepresents the moon. The lamp represents the sun.\n7. With all lights out except for the lamp, students hold their ball out in front of them. Since\nthe moon orbits the Earth, the students will move the ball in a circle around their head.\nThe motion needs to be counterclockwise. This models the orbit of the moon. Make\nsure students understand the moon's orbital path. Many students believe that the moon\nstays in one place in relation to the Earth, just like the sun. They think that when the\nEarth turns and faces the sun, it is day. When the Earth faces the moon it is night.\nBecause the Earth is spinning on its axis, the moon appears to travel across the sky.\n8. The Moon rotates in the same amount of time that it takes to revolve around the Earth\u2014\n27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes and 11.47 seconds! We always see the same side of the\nMoon facing us. To better see the phases of the moon in our model, the students will\nhave to turn with the moon's orbit. The time between two consecutive full moons is 29.5\ndays. This longer period of time is due to the fact that the Earth is also moving along its\norbit as it revolves around the Sun. In reality, Earth would have made about 29 turns\nduring the time it takes the moon to complete one orbit.4\n9. Students hold the ball in front of them. The people living on the dark side of the Earth\n(the students' backside) cannot see the moon because the moon faces the side of Earth\nthat is having day. When the moon is in this position, it is the new moon. The dark side\nof the moon is facing the daytime side of the Earth.\n10. Take a few steps counterclockwise, while continuing to hold the ball straight out in front\nof you. The right side of the Styrofoam ball will sparkle a bit as it reflects the light from\nthe lamp. This models the crescent moon.\n11. Continue to take a few more steps counterclockwise. When you have made a quarter of\na turn from the starting position, you will see a representation of the first quarter moon.\nThe right side of the ball will sparkle as it reflects the light from the lamp.\n12. Continue to take steps in the counterclockwise motion and watch an increasing amount\nof the ball become illuminated. This represents the waxing gibbous moon.\n13. When you have made a half turn from the original position, your back will be facing the\nlamp. The entire side of the ball facing you will be reflecting the light from the lamp.\nThis is a full moon. Since you cannot see the lamp, you are on the nighttime side of the\nEarth facing the full moon.\n14. Continue to move counterclockwise as you continue to hold the ball in front of you. The\namount of light reflected off the ball will begin to decrease. You will see the waning\ngibbous and the last quarter of the moon, the waning crescent, and finally back to the\nnew moon.\n15. Be sure to remind students that the Earth and the moon do not complete this path\nsimultaneously.\n4\nSee Teacher Background Information at this web site:\n\n80\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nPROCEDURE: SOLAR ECLIPSE\\\n1. The solar eclipse occurs when the moon is positioned\nbetween the sun and the Earth in such a way that the\nmoon blocks the sun and creates a shadow on part of\nthe Earth. The solar eclipse can only occur when there\nis a new moon.\n2. To model the solar eclipse, stand facing the lamp and\nhold the ball so it covers the light bulb. Look at the faces\nof the students across from you to see the shadow of the\nball on them. If their heads were the Earth, the people\nliving in that shadow would experience the solar eclipse.\nPROCEDURE: LUNAR ECLIPSE\n1. The lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth is positioned between\nthe sun and the moon so that the Earth blocks the light from the\nsun and makes a shadow on the moon.\n2. To model the lunar eclipse, stand with your back to the lamp. The\nball is held straight out in front of you, but you will need to position\nit so that your head, which represents the Earth, blocks the light\nfrom the lamp and makes a shadow on the Styrofoam ball.\nRESOURCES\nDemonstration of the phases of the moon and the moon's orbit around the Earth\n\nThe current moon phase:\n\nU.S. Naval Observatory: Phases of the Moon\nIf you continue to scroll down this page, there is a movie that shows the phases of the moon.\n\nResource for software that helps students understand Moon phases, Seasons, and weather\nconcepts through interactive visualizations\n\nSneider, C.

A common misconception is that distance to the sun is the reason\nfor the seasons. Textbooks exaggerate the elliptical orbit of the Earth\naround the sun. Our orbit around the sun is nearly circular. The Earth-\nSun distance varies only by 1.5% and this distance is not significant to be\nthe reason for seasons. Students may believe that we are closer to the\nsun in the summer, but the Earth is actually closest to the sun on\nJanuary 2 and farthest on July 4. A more subtle misconception students\nhave is that when the Northern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, the\nNorthern Hemisphere is closer to the sun. Given the diameter of the\nEarth is 12,000 kilometers or about 7,900 miles, that difference is even\nmore insignificant.\n84\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nThere are two main factors responsible for seasons on Earth. First, there are more daylight\nhours where the parts of the Earth are tilted toward the sun. Second, during the summer, the\nsun's position is higher in the sky. This increases the angle of incidence of the sunlight and the\nconcentration of light on the ground so the ground gets warmer.\nThese are complex ideas and it takes time for students to develop the scientific understanding.\nAn excellent resource for a unit that helps students develop these concepts is the GEMS book\nlisted in the Resource section.\nThe second part of this lesson gives students an opportunity to use what they know to interpret\nthe characteristics of other planets given in a chart.\nKEY QUESTIONS\nWhat causes the seasons?\nHow does the Earth compare to other planets?\nPROCEDURE\n1. Students write a response to the first question on their Journal page.\n2. Have students share their ideas. List them on the board, but do not judge them at this\ntime.

It takes Earth 365.3 days.\n2. Name each planet from this chart with a cycle of light and dark that is shorter than\nEarth's cycle of day and night. Which planet's cycle is similar to Earth's? Explain how\nyou arrived at your answer.\nNo planet listed on this chart has a day and night cycle that is shorter than\nEarth's. The period of rotation gives the length of a planet's day and night\ncycle. Earth's cycle of day and night is 23 hours and 56 minutes. Mars cycle is\nsimilar at 24 hours and 37 minutes.\n3. Name each planet from this chart that might support human life. Explain.\nNo planet listed on this chart could support human life. Humans need oxygen\nto breathe and we are the only inner planet that has oxygen in its atmosphere.\nMercury and Venus are closer to Sun and it would be too hot.

Man has impacted the\nforest ecosystems not only to manage them, but to benefit himself.\nForestry is a practice where trees are managed and harvested. Trees\nare treated as any other agricultural crop, with its goal to provide\nwood products, such as paper, lumber and charcoal. Logging\ncompanies use many different methods to harvest trees, not always\n88\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nkeeping in mind the balance of the forest and the rate of tree growth. Unfortunately when you\nare dealing with \u2015old-growth\u2016 forests, a complete biological ecosystem that contains trees\ncenturies old and hundreds of feet tall, sustainable management is impossible. It takes\nhundreds of years to replace what has been logged. This is why the management of \u2015old-\ngrowth\u2016 forests is so controversial. The debate on whether or not to log \u2015old growth\u2016 forests, or\nleave them alone is raging today.\nStudents will be involved in a discussion of the issues. A compromise may need to be made to\nreach a decision on how to manage several acres of forest. They will evaluate the options and\nexplore the consequences of their decision.\nKEY QUESTION\n\uf0b7 What are the advantages and disadvantages of your decision?\n\uf0b7 How will your decision impact the forest ecosystem?\n\uf0b7 Are there other alternative decisions that can be proposed?\nPROCEDURE\n1. Explain to students the scenario of today's lesson. The students will be working as a\nteam for their community. The community has been given a large parcel of \u2015old-growth\u2016\nforest in their town to do with it as they see fit. Students in their groups must decide how\nthey will manage or use the land and be prepared to share their ideas with the class.\n2. Divide students into groups of 4. Each group will read the proposals.\n3. They will use the discussion questions from the Community Management Assessment\npage to evaluate their proposals and prepare a presentation to the class for the next\nday. They will use poster paper to record their ideas for the presentation.\n4. Allow students time to present their posters on Day 15.\nASSESSMENT\nExamine the students' decision and their reasoning to see how well they understand the\ncomplexity of the decision and how each decision has consequences, both positive and\nnegative, of their own.\nOPTIONAL ASSESSMENT:\nPut a copy of the poem below on the board and have students interpret its meaning.\n\u2015The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing that\nstands in the way.\u2016 -William Blake\n89\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nName _______________________________________ Days 14-15\nProposed Management Decision\nYour community has been given 250 acres of land just outside of town. Your town is a\nmedium-sized town with the largest business being a lumbering company. Many of the\npeople who live in this town work for the lumbering company. Others work for a\ncomputer company in a nearby town. The donated land is completely covered with\nforest including 100 acres of \u2015old-growth\u2016 forest. This old growth forest has enormous\ntrees over 150 years old. There is a pond that is a home to swans and ducks to rest\nduring migration and nest during mating season. Deer, raccoon, foxes, and other\nanimals also make there home there. It is the job of the Community team to decide\nwhich proposal would best suit the needs of the community.\nProposal #1 \u2013 The town's local environmental organization wants to keep the land and\nmanage it as a protected natural area. They have proposed building hiking trails, and\nlook out points for avid wildlife watchers. No hunting signs would be posted and the\nlocal DNR would help to police the area. The 100 acres of \u2015old-growth\u2016 forest would be\nleft as it is, while the other 150 acres would be managed. Dead trees would be cleared\nto allow room for new seedlings to emerge and grow.\n\uf0b7 This area is a unique area. It is home to many plants and animals. If the trees are\ncut down, their habitat will be destroyed.\n\uf0b7 The town does not need a mall. There are enough stores to meet the needs of the\ncommunity. If a mall were built, the people who own businesses downtown would\ngo out of business!\n\uf0b7 There are no forests like this in town. Why should the people of this town sacrifice\ntheir natural heritage so some businesses can make a lot of money?\n\uf0b7 Setting this area aside and maintaining hiking trails would be the best thing for the\npeople of our town,\nProposal #2 \u2013 A local developer would like to purchase the 250 acres to build a\nshopping mall and new homes.\n\uf0b7 Shopping malls are convenient places to shop, with all the stores indoors and under\none roof.\n\uf0b7 With a wide variety of stores, there would be more competition and this would mean\nbetter prices for things the people in the community need.\n\uf0b7 Malls draw people from a wide area and would mean big money for the town.\n\uf0b7 The money earned from the sale of the land to the developer and from the property\ntaxes would create revenue for the town to pay for schools, medical clinics, roads,\n\uf0b7 The developer is proposing that part of the 100 acres of \u2015old-growth\u2016 forest would be\nleft alone to provide \u2015forest character\u2016 for the new homes built there.\n90\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\n\uf0b7 The developer assures us that although much of the trees will be cleared, the pond\nwould be preserved so the wildlife would still have a place for migration and\nbreeding.\nProposal #3 \u2013 The town's lumber company proposes purchasing the land for\ncommercial and ecological purposes.\n\uf0b7 This company already has successfully managed other forests near the town.\n\uf0b7 Lumber from their company has been in high demand for construction proposes.\nThey can provide this lumber at better prices.\n\uf0b7 The lumber company would carefully control the harvesting of the trees. Their\nregular practice is to immediately replant the harvested areas with seedlings.\n\uf0b7 They would set aside part of the \u2015old growth\u2016 forest and set up a buffer zone to\nprotect the habitat there.\n\uf0b7 They would allow hiking and other recreation in the forest.\n\uf0b7 The purchase would provide the town with an economic boost. It would provide the\ntown with the money it needs to balance the budget, provide funds for the local\nlibrary, school expenses, medical clinics, and road management.\n\uf0b7 The proposal will create new jobs for foresters, scientists, loggers, truckers and mill\nworkers and this would lower the unemployment rate of the community.\n91\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nName ____________________________________ Days 14-15\nCommunity Management Assessment\nYour community team must work together to decide what to do with this gift of\nland. You can accept a proposal from one of the three that have been\npresented. You may also choose to make a compromise or offer another\nproposal. Each team member must agree with the team's decision. When\nmaking your decision you need to consider the questions below. Keep in mind\nwhat is best for the entire community. Be prepared to present your ideas to the\nclass.\n1. What facts were presented in the proposal?\n2. Which statements were opinions?\n3. What will it cost the town to adopt the proposal?\n4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal?\n5. What negative effects could happen to the community and the\nenvironment?\n6. Who most benefits from your proposal?\n7. Are there any changes you would make to either of the proposals?\nWhat is the decision of your Community Team and why?\n92\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005\nMEAP Practice\n93\n8th Grade Science Toolbox \uf0e3 St. Clair County RESA 2005"}

{"text":"\"For\nin the end we will conserve only what we love. We will love only\nwhat we understand. We will understand only what we are taught.\"\n~ B. Dioum\n\nThis\nunit is going to have a different \"feel\" from many of my other online units,\nfor a number of reasons:\n\nI'm\ndevoting more time to developing it, and have been actively working on\nit for the past year.\n\nThere\nwill be a much broader spectrum of activities and information covered,\nbecause the ocean is very special to me and I think it's important to teach\nour young students (and ourselves and our colleagues) how to preserve the\ndelicate ecosystems that make up the world's oceans.\n\nBecause my personal areas of expertise are language acquisition and emergent\nliteracy, I approached this project in the same way I begin developing\nall of my units: by finding good, solid materials and activities\nto extend reading, writing, language development, and math skills \"across\nthe curriculum,\" using Ocean Life as an overall theme that allows me to\naddress ALL of the Standards for Language\nArts, Mathematics,\nand Science\n... and, to a slightly lesser degree, History\nand Social Studies.\n\nIn addition to materials and activities created for this unit that fulfill\nthe goals of my CCSP Project, I developed many other terrific lessons,\nresources, and activities, some of which grew out of another year-long\ncourse: an Independent Study class called Monterey\nBay National Marine Sanctuary: Oceans Alive! offered by Dave Miller\nthough Fresno Pacific University. This is a terrific Professional Development\ncourse for teachers, even for those of us who grew up within a two hour\ndrive of the Monterey Bay.\n\nI gained a lot of new knowledge about California's beaches and nearby environs\nduring several Monterey Bay site visitation trips I've taken in the past\ntwelve months (all of them tax-deductible as education expense for the\ncourse mentioned above :o) The site visitations have been informative\nand fun, and were also the basis for several nice weekend vacations with\nmy family.\n\nI especially enjoyed visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium (where we have\na family membership) and the Point Lobos Marine Reserve, where I took over\n200 photos, many of which will eventually find their way into Power Point\nPresentations to be used online and\/or in my classroom.\n\nThe first online emergent reader that I made for this unit -- Color\nFish -- was created as the \"creative project\" for my FPU Monterey Bay\nclass, during my second weekend site visit. I made a second online\nemergent reader -- Who Lives In The\nSea? -- using photos I took at Point Lobos in July 2000.\n\nA\nkey factor in the \"technology\" lessons designed for this unit is that the\nvarious types of technology must be used actively, for direct instructional\npurposes. In other words, sitting a child down to play a computer\ngame does *not* constitute using technology as an instructional tool.\n\nLessons\n& Activities Integrating Techology With\nThe State of California Kindergarten\nScience Standards\n\nI've made extensive use of these three videos\nwhile presenting information about the various aquatic environments (intertidal\nzone, rocky shore, kelp forest, etc.) and also while presenting\ninformation about sea life which includes animals and plants.\n\nThe first two videos -- \"Monterey Bay Aquarium\"\nand \"Behind the Scenes at the Monterey Bay Aquarium\" are comprised of short\ninformational segments on specific habitats or sealife, and are perfect\nfor children of all ages. Watching these two videos, over the course\nof two to three weeks, is like taking a Virtual Field Trip to the Monterey\nBay Aquarium.\n\nThe other video shown above -- \"The Living\nSea\" -- was created for exhibition in IMAX Theatres, and features songs\nand music by STING. The photography is luscious, and the video includes\na follow-up section on \"The Making of The Living Sea,\" which details how\nthe film was made. The KinderKids enjoyed this one, too.\n\nAll three of these videos are wonderful when\nused as \"mini lessons\" to introduce or extend lessons about Ocean Life.\n\nThe Kelp Cam collects a series of twenty live\nimages every minute from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., PST.\n\nThis is a fascinating area for my KinderKids,\nand we've really enjoyed watching the live images of the Kelp Forest while\nlearning about the plants and animals who live there. By clicking\nhere, you can see a short online video about the Kelp Forest. You\ncan also participate in an interactive online program about identifying\nthe creatures that live in the Kelp Forest by clicking here.\n\nNo Virtual Field Trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium\nwould be complete without visiting the wonderful Kids' E-Q. There\nare 8 habitats to explore, plus sections on Marine Mammals and on Octopuses\n(Octopii?) and their kin. Each of the ten areas is filled with facts,\ninteractive online exhibits, links to live cams inside the Aquarium (the\nTide Pool cam -- which keeps an eye on the outside tidepool, right below\nthe Aquarium in the Bay -- and the Otter and Penguin cams are our favorites!).\nDon't miss the fun coloring pages, Tic-Tac-Toe and Memory games, and the\nsuper-popular Ollie the Otter paperbag puppet!\n\nStudent\nArt We\ncomplemented almost every lesson with a creative follow-up activity, which\nmeans we've made LOTS of ocean-themed art! Here are some of our favorite\nprojects ...\n\nA\nhandful of my girls showing off their new sunvisors ~ I bought plastic\nvisors at the dollar store (about 25 cents each!), let the kids choose\ntheir own color and a real seashell for me to attach with a hot glue gun.\nNames were added with a permanent marker."}

Switcheroo Zoo also has short films, sound clips, and photographs about animals for students to watch and listen to.

When they finish, they will receive a Switch Zoo certificate of merit, a guide badge, and are added to the list of offical guides.\nHow to integrate Switcheroo Zoo into the classroom: Switcheroo Zoo is an awesome website for students to explore to learn more about animals and wildlife. This would be a great site to visit when studying animals and their habitats. There are three educational animal-themed games on the site that teach about animal characteristics and habitats. Switcheroo Zoo has an educational section that includes lesson plans for art, science, creative writing, and persuasive writing. In second grade at the school where I teach, students complete animal reports as an introduction to research. Switcheroo Zoo has on-site research with 142 animal profiles, a US endangered species map, and stories about unusual animal feats on a Zookeeper's blog. This site is packed full of fun, useful activities, lessons, and resources! In a computer lab setting, students can research and play games individual. In the one or two classroom computer setting, students can visit Switcheroo Zoo as a science resource center. With the projector or an interactive whiteboard, complete the activities as a whole class or show the animal videos to your whole class.\nTips: This site does have some Google ads.

Algebra Lab was created by Mainland High School teachers in partnership with Georgia Southern University and a host of student assistance. The site includes really well done lessons, activities, practice pages (online), study aids, glossary, and word problems. Algebra Lab is like a free, living textbook. It has enough substance to help students work their way through algebra, while understanding the connections to how that algebra is used in a practical sense. I didn't appreciate Algebra until I took physics and chemistry. When I saw what those equations I learned were actually used for, I could appreciate the learning requirements in algebra. Algebra Lab does a beautiful job of helping students learn algebra within a context so that they really get a grasp of what these numbers are doing.\n\nHow to integrate Algebra Lab into your curriculum: I have enjoyed watching the debate over Algebra unfold in the last year or so. One side of the argument asks if it is really necessary that EVERY child be required to take algebra. The other side argues that algebra has great thinking skills that it develops, it gives students additional tools to understand the world through math. I'm not sure where I land on this debate. I don't know that I believe that algebra should be a requirement for every child, and yet I think that my exposure to algebra was valuable. Maybe the debate just needs to be reframed\u2026HOW should algebra be taught? I'm all for things being taught within context. If you can teach any subject in a way that sheds light on other learning it is valuable. I love when students make the connections between something like ratios and a site like Miniature Earth. They not only get excited about the math (yes, really) they see a purpose for wanting to learn more about how it works. Sometimes I think our job of teachers is really to help students see the overlaps that occur in learning so that they can make connections and have a cause to want to dig deeper.\n\nI digress\u2026\n\nAlgebra Lab is a great resource for math (and non-math) teachers. Here you will find lessons, activities, word problems and practice opportunities for students. Students can directly access the site, or you (the teacher) can pull ideas out to use within any other teaching you are doing. The site is great for students to explore on their own (blended learning algebra style) or with guidance from a teacher. As a non-math teacher, I appreciate the way the site helps me think like a math teacher. It reminds me how all of these pieces connect to other learning.\n\nTips: If you have a one-to-one setting, students can practice directly on the website for immediate feedback. Very helpful!\n\n***Want to do your part as a CHANGE MAKER in personalized education?

The Grade 6 students are looking forward to at least 2 exciting Science field trips.\n\nAs Grade 7 students are generally full of life, it's appropriate that they get to study the life they are full of. Major topics investigated will include the characteristics of life, cell structure and function, genetics, evolution and creation, animal classification, ecology and finally major human body systems. 7th Grade students will use their knowledge of Life in the classroom to two exciting adventures in the field. This course will give students a solid foundation for Biology in the 9th grade.\n\nIn Grade 8 we study Physical Science which is broken down into two parts: Chemistry during the first semester and Physics during the second semester. The Chemistry portion will consist of basic structure of the atom, the Periodic Table, chemical bonding, nomenclature, chemical reactions and solutions. The Physics portion will include Newton's Laws of Motion, forces, simple machines, electricity and energy. We explore opportunities to apply information learned in the classroom to real-world examples through a variety of means, including 2 field trips.\n\nAs Grade 9 is the first year of High School, Biology is a very intense year covering a huge amount of content. Students learn about basic chemistry, biochemistry, the structure and function of cells, evolution and creation theories, human physiology and classification systems in biology. We will also spend almost a whole quarter on an in depth study of genetics. Our year will culminate with an amazing trip to the aquarium and coral reefs of Kenting to study marine life."}

{"text":"The Convention's CEPA Programme\n\n08\/12\/2011\n\nTeaching Materials\n\nA game for 6-12 year olds, produced by WWF Hong Kongand distributed to all primary schools in Hong Kong, looks at the challenges facing Lolo, a Black-faced spoonbill, during its migration. More info here.\n\nThe school curriculum presents a highly effective route for educating children about wetland values and functions, yet there are several problems which make it difficult for teachers to \"deliver\" an effective wetland message in a classroom setting. In many countries, environmental education may not formally be included as part of the curriculum making it difficult to introduce wetland issues into the curriculum. In others, environmental education may be a recognized component of the national curriculum but wetland issues in general, and the Ramsar principles of wetland conservation and wise use in particular, may not be specifically identified as areas to be covered in the classroom. In yet others, where wetland issues are identified in the national curriculum, teachers may not have the necessary knowledge or training to translate this into classroom activities.\n\nIt is generally true that the best resource materials for use in classrooms will be those tailored to a particular age-group and delivering a specific message - to give an example, you might be developing curriculum materials for 8-12 year-olds living around the Okavango Delta that investigate the human uses of water in the area and how they affect the health of the wetlands. This is a specific message that requires targeted material. In most situations it will not be possible to transfer ready-to-use materials from one country to another: the information usually has to be made locally relevant. The aim of this section of the CEPA mini-Web site is rather to provide examples of available materials that will inform, inspire and provide useful contacts to those who are preparing materials and delivering the CEPA message. Its success depends on the willingness of users to share information - please contact Sandra Hails by e-mail at hails@ramsar.org if you have materials to share.\n\nTo start the ball rolling, here are some interesting teaching materials, presented in two sections. Section 1 details structured classroom lessons based on wetlands for teachers of various age-groups. Section 2 details materials which can be used to supplement curriculum activities - books\/booklets on wetlands for use with children, games, wall charts, water and wetland related games etc.\n\nSECTION 1 - Structured classroom lessons\n\nOxfam's Climate Chaos programme provides teachers with a week of activities on climate change for 9-11 year olds. They provide a 5-day plan of activities including links to videos, excellent animations, classroom experiments, group projects etc.\n\nWOW!: The Wonders Of Wetlands, an educator's guide is an acclaimed, comprehensive, interdisciplinary curriculum guide for educators of grade levels K-12. The activities have been correlated with the US's National Science Education Standards developed by the National Academy of Sciencesand and with science content standards in several US states. Available for purchase online.\n\nThe Electronic Naturalist is a new on-line education program providing a weekly environmental education unit. Each unit has artwork, text, activities, additional web sites, plus online access to a professional naturalist. Two reading levels are available for grades K-3 (Quick Read) and 4-8 (Full Read).\n\nWWF-Hong Kong has developed an interactive environmental education CD (in English and Chinese) \"Footprints in Wetlands\"which aims to provide additional supporting materials to aid teachers in carrying out on-site environmental education in secondary schools in Hong Kong. Copies (free) are available from Ms. Yvonne Wan, WWF Hong Kong Administration Officer at ywan@wwf.org.hk\n\nSECTION 2 - supplementary classroom materials\n\nProduced the the Estonian Environmental Board, a series of classroom materials and videos in Estonian with some materials also available in Russian. Links to all materials here.\n\nProduced by the Ramsar Secretariat in collaboration with UNESCO, and with support from the Danone\/Evian Group, a board game has been produced for children of all ages. Ramsar: a fun game to quench your thirst for knowledge is available in English, French and Spanish. More information here\n\nThe Australian Government has created a useful web-based Water Education Toolkit on water and wetland education resources in Australia. It provides Australian teachers and schools with access to hundreds of water education materials and although this resource is mainly to assist teachers, students will also find it a valuable tool when researching school assignments and seeking additional water information. Available here\n\nCatchment to reef - a number of products on this web site are aimed at children. Two well illustrated booklets for download are Are you connected: a guide to the processes linking land, sea and reef and Nutrients, Catchments & Reefs: A guide to nutrients in your landscape. Poster also available.\n\nMarine Debris - a web site with publications and educational resources for addressing marine debris issues, as well as information on how to get involved.\n\nLolo's Flying Journey, a game for 6-12 year olds, produced by WWF Hong Kongand freely distributed to all primary schools in Hong Kong, looks at the challenges facing Lolo, a Black-faced spoonbill, during its migration in east Asia. Available for download in PDF format here\n\nThe Water Cycle: the digram is available for download in over 50 languages along with detailed, explanatory texts available in many of these languages too. Made available by the US Geographic Survey's Water Science for Schools Programme.\n\nExplore Our Wetlands is an interactive web animation produced by the Australian government that aims to enhance the understanding and awareness of the community of the role of wetlands in the Great Barrier Reef catchment.\n\nA Climate Change poster was produced as part of the outcome of a joint Ramsar\/CBD expert workshop on Wetlands, Water, Biodiversity, and Climate change in March 2007. Available in PDF format here.\n\nThe Ramsar Game was launched in 2005 at the 9th Conference of the Parties. Targetting 5-14 year olds, it delivers fun, awareness and learning about wetlands. Launched as a board game in English, French and SPnaish, it has been produced in other languages and as a floor-sized version. Find out more about it here.\n\nCanon Envirothon provides students with a chance to get \"up-close and personal\" with North America's natural resources. Offering both in-class curriculum and hands-on field experiences focused around ecology, natural resource management, and current environmental issues, this unique combination of learning experiences and breadth of study is part of what has made the Envirothon a huge success with students and educators across the United States and Canada.\n\nWaterAid, a charity dedicated to helping people living without safe water and sanitation, provides some interactive games on water issues for 11-14 and 14-16 year-olds as well as a variety of resources aimed at teachers for use in the classroom with different age groups on a range of development issues.\n\nThis interactive website is all about shorebirds, their amazing lifecycles, the flyways and many organisations and people who are dedicated to sharing information about these extraordinary birds. This site was developed by the Hunter Wetlands Centre in Australia.\n\nOn-line information on all aspects of water in our environment. Although US-based, the facts and figures on surface waters, groundwaters, the water cycle - and much more - are useful for teachers and students wherever they are. Water Science for Schools\n\nCD-ROM (in Spanish) on sustainable management of water resources designed for schoolchildren (10-13 years) in Latin America.

{"text":"My name is Daniel Shafer and I would like to tell you a little bit about myself. I have been teaching in the Flat Rock School district for 20 years. I started as a substitute teacher in 1993 and started full time teaching in the fall of 94. I attended Eastern Michigan University and recievied my bachelors degree in education. While I was teaching in Flat Rock I returned to EMU and recieved a Masters in Educational Leadership. My love of teaching is as strong as ever. I have been teaching here at Simpson for the past four years. I am currently in my third year teaching Earth Science. I am very excited and am looking forward to a great year.\n\nMy expectations for Earth Science are high, as they should be. Every student needs to bring the proper materials to class to be successful. These items include: paper, pencil, planner,photo identification, and three ring binder specifically for science. My classroom has several rules that all students must follow. All students must be on time with all neccesary materials, listen to instructoins first time given, keep hands, feet, and objects to themselves, be respectful, and never put others down.\n\nEach unit\/chapter will have learning targets. Learning targets are posted at the front of each classroom so the students can see them. Learning targets tell the students what material they need to master for tests and final exams. Example: I can explain how latitude, oceans, and other factors affect the climate of a region.\n\nFormative assignments\/assessments are used to help students form new knowledge.

{"text":"This presentation is intended to come near the end of the 8th grade unit on the electromagnetic spectrum. Students should already have an understanding of wavelength, the various types of EM radiation (i.e. ultraviolet, visible, infrared, microwave), and their properties.\n\nAll imagery presented in this lesson uses Lincoln School as a focal point since all students are familiar with the area and their prior knowledge of the ground cover allows them to relate to and identify features in the images presented \u2014This lesson could be adapted for other, more general areas if need arose.\n\nOpener\nSimple and complex definitions of \"remote sensing\" are presented. Basic interactions between electromagnetic energy and surface materials are reviewed. Students are then introduced to Landsat, an optical remote sensing satellite. Basic technical specifications are then discussed, including the wavelength range of each of the six bands and their non-coincidental relationship with atmospheric absorption, and the concept of sensor resolution, illustrated through zoomed views of a Landsat scene including the school and a comparison to a higher-resolution Quickbird image.\n\nDevelopment Visual image interpretation. Students are shown a series of six images, representing the same ground area (including the school [built], grass and trees [vegetation] and water) in the six different Landsat bands. In the images, white values represent very high reflectance and black values represent very low reflectance, with gray tones varying continuously in between. Students are asked to compare how the different surface materials interact with different types of EM radiation and how the variations relate to wavelength. They are then introduced to band combinations, which allows information from multiple bands to be used and once and asked to again discuss the appearance of different ground cover materials.\n\nAutomated image interpretation. While much information can be gained from visual interpretation of imagery, the global coverage and relatively frequent repeat times make it impossible to produce accurate land cover classifications by hand. Instead, the information in all bands compared to signatures of known examples in order to identify materials without ever having to see the image! Students are shown the plots of reflectance across the Landsat wavelengths for two unknown materials from an area outside the boundaries of the images of their school. They are asked to guess whether the materials should be classified built, vegetated or water. After allowing them to debate for a short while, plots with the same axes for several examples from the image of the school are shown. Students are given copies of both the unknown and known spectral signature plots and again asked to now predict the class of the unknown materials.\n\nClosure\nThe unknown materials are much more easily identifiable given examples from a known area and students are shown a high-resolution image of the location of unknown pixels to verify their predictions. In remote sensing terms, the students have just performed a \"supervised classification\" and \"ground-truth\"-ed their results. The plots of reflectance by wavelength is referred to as a spectral signature, and the spectral signatures of materials can be used to identify materials in remotely sensed imagery. Several standard examples of spectral signatures are shown, and their similarities to materials in the image of the school are discussed. At the close of the lesson, some project data relating changes in land cover class to change in population are visualized as an example of how spectral information is used in global change research.\n\nEvaluation\n\nThere is no formal evaluation for this activity. In an effort to bring complex remote sensing topics into a middle school classroom, this activity is intended to be an informal investigation of imagery and the underlying data.\n\nExtensions\n\nQualified students interested in participating in classification and ground-truth campaigns could be shown how to use Google Earth imagery to label examples for supervised classification efforts in the Boston area, a fairly simple but incredibly tedious activity."}

Acoustics, chemistry, electricity, magnetism, matter, mechanics, nuclear science, and optics are all categorized under physical science.\n\n3. Life Sciences\n\nThe study of the diversity, continuity, interactions and balance among organisms and their environments.\n\nChildren explore the characteristics of living things - plants, animals, and human beings.\n\nProvide objects to examine when teaching science topics...\n\nInvolve children in experiences such as:\n\ncooking\n\nnature walks\n\nplaying with magnets\n\nexperimenting with color paddles\n\ntaking things apart\n\nobserving pond water in jars with magnifying glasses\n\nplanting seeds.\n\nWhen teaching the science topics below to young children, provide them with lots of objects to observe, examine, and classify. Children develop awareness of the world around them as they explore and investigate it.\n\nEarth and Space Sciences\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\nobserve their surroundings\n\ndescribe features of their nearest environment\n\nidentify characteristics of each season\n\ndescribe the properties of air\n\nidentify some living and non-living materials found in soil\n\nclassify rocks and soil according to their physical characteristics\n\ndescribe some characteristics of rocks, soil, and water\n\ndescribe the effects of water and wind on rocks and soil\n\ndescribe the effects of weather on living things\n\nunderstand the relationship between the position of an object, its shadow, and the sun\n\nWhether collecting soil samples and rocks from different areas of the schoolyard or helping the teacher construct mini water cycles out of an old aquarium, children love investigating and observing features of the Earth and its atmosphere.\n\nWhen teaching science, introduce new vocabulary to describe the characteristics of rocks, soil, water, and weather conditions in your students' surroundings as they play.\n\nidentify a variety of changes that cannot be reversed (popped popcorn)\n\nrecognize changes in properties of matter when water is added\n\nrecognize changes in properties of matter when it is heated or cooled\n\ndescribe how objects can change over time\n\nKids love to sort piles of objects, take things apart, and make collections of things. As students play, observe, and classify things they begin to identify the properties of these objects and think about their similarities and differences and how each one may be used. Winter is a great time to for teaching kindergarten science lessons involving water and ice.\n\nAs children take things apart or experiment with materials, they make observations and ask questions. Something as simple as filling the water table with a bucket of snow gives children opportunities to watch snow melt, to feel ice crystals and make other observations as they play.\n\nLife Sciences - characteristics of living things\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\ndescribe characteristics of some local plants and animals e.g. color, shape, size, texture\n\ncompare local plants and animals\n\nlearn what plants and animals need to stay healthy\n\ncompare the life cycle of an animal hatched from an egg with one born from the mother\n\ndescribe the appearance and behavior of a variety of animals\n\nidentify similarities and differences among animal species\n\nInsects are part of the children's immediate surroundings, and studying them allows kids to observe characteristics of animals and offers lots of material for data collection, recording sheets, poster displays and more.\n\nWhether learning the names of trees, planting seeds, or making a leaf collection, children have opportunities to count, measure, classify, compare and extend their vocabulary. Local parks often have great programs to help teachers and parents learn how to involve children in the outdoors.\n\nLiving creatures in the classroom\n\nWhen teaching science, include teaching children how to respect and treat living creatures when studying them. Tapping on bug bottles, shaking the container, leaving living things in the hot sun should all be discouraged.\n\nTeach the \"Four Ls\"\n\nLook at them, learn about them, let them go (after an hour or two), then leave them alone."}

When you roll overthe image in flickr, you get short explanation or detail related to the region of the diagram.\n\nThis is done easily in flickr when you edit a photo, and click the small icon for Add Note. A region is added to your image which you can drag to resize and reposition over a part of an image, and then compose the note associated with that image.\n\nHotspot type diagrams have many uses in learning- e.g. identifying parts of the nervous system for an anatomy and physiology class, diagraming a sentence structure for English, clarifying composition for music theory, illustrating the location of engine parts for an engiineering class... on and on"}

{"text":"A set of quantitative biology laboratory exercises are being\ndeveloped in an interdisciplinary effort between the Department\nof Biology and the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at\nUtah State University. Our goal is to create a series of\nquantitative biology labs applicable to students from high\nschool biology up through advanced (senior) undergraduate\ncourses. This page gives a brief description of the labs and\nassociated tools we have prepared.\n\nEach title in blue text links to a page\nwhich is either the actual lab material or is\na more thorough description of\nsome part of the project.\n\nNote: This and the associated pages are, like the\nproject itself, continually evolving. Not all of the planned\nlabs have been implemented.\n\nDirectory of Quantitative Labs\n\nThe following directory of lab exercises are descriptions\nof the lab exercises. The description title links to the\nactual webpages that are used by the students in the\nlaboratories while they are doing experiments and solving\nquantitative problems. We employ different pedagogical\ntechniques in different courses. In the introductory\nclasses we use a combination of small-group problem\nsolving and enquiry-based instruction. During the lab,\nthe instructors periodically convenes the class and\ndiscusses the status of the problem solution and\nre-focuses the small groups of students working on the\nproblem. The pages present a series of steps to the\nstudents that must be completed before proceeding\n\nto subsequent steps. Since some of the later steps provide answers\nto questions asked in prior steps, these latter pages have\nboxes to be completed by the students. This strategy\nforces students to think about the problem and also provides a\nrecord of the solution.\n\nSome of the pages may be password protected, as a means\nof withholding information that students are asked to discover\nfor themselves. We have found this to be less\nsuccessful and are phasing out this method.\nIf you wish to view a page which\nis password protected, send email to Jim Haefner.\n\nThe Departments of Biology and Mathematics and Statistics have\nestablished a BioMath minor for students in both Departments. The minor requires completion of a team-taught course that\nintegrates wet-lab experiments with mathematical modeling and\ncomputational analyses. These exercises have not yet been\nproduced as webpages, but a brief description follows.\n\nOsmosis (the diffusion of water across biological\nmembranes) is taught in almost all introductory biology\nlaboratories. It is a ubiquitous phenomenon of cells that\ncan be demonstrated with relatively simple and\ninexpensive experiments. A typical laboratory experiment\nsimply demonstrates the occurrence of the phenomenon. We\nextend this classic exercise in hypothesis\ntesting by adding a predictive mathematical model.\n\nOsmosis is usually treated early in the first term of an\nintroductory biology course along with diffusion and\nplasmolysis. In our labs, the experiment uses a bag made\nfrom dialysis tubing partially filled with water and\nknown, but variable, concentrations of sucrose. The bag\nis immersed in water, removed for weighing, and\nre-immersed in water until the next weighing. This is\nrepeated for 5--6 weighing bouts over a period of about\n40 minutes.\n\nThe interesting phenomena which the students eventually see are:\n\n(1) water moves into the bag,\n(2) the rate of water movement decreases with time as the internal sucrose\nconcentration approaches that of the outside, and\n(3) this rate depends on initial sucrose concentration.\n\nThe quantitative problem for the students to solve is to\nmathematically describe these observations. To solve this\nproblem, they must create a mathematical model.\n\nWithout this quantitative component, an osmosis lab normally\nrequires 1 lab period, but must be expanded to 2 lab periods to include the new material.\nIn first lab period, we lead the students to create a mathematical model of a more familiar\nphenomenon: cooling of a body that is initially warmer than\nambient temperature. This has two advantages; first, the\nstudents have an intuitive grasp of the process. Second, we\nmotivate the cooling problem with a real-world scenario: how to\ntell if a cougar was shot legally (see the webpage for more\ndetails). With the aid of the lab instructors, the students are\nled through the experiments and data analysis to formulate\nNewton's Cooling Law for the rate of change of temperature of a\nbeaker of water.\n\nIn the second lab period, students are presented with the\nosmosis phenomenon. They perform the weight gain experiment and\nare asked to create a model that describes its change. After\nthe cooling example, they can see the similarities of the two\nprocesses and transfer skills they learned studying cooling to\nosmosis.\n\nThe webpages, with instructor guidance, lead students through a\nseries of steps designed to help them solve the problems. The\nprimary quantitative math skills that students learn are:\ngraphing data and drawing \"best fit\" lines, finding slopes\nfrom data plots, transforming data to create linear relations,\nand iterating finite difference equations. The math and\ninference skills are re-inforced with homework problems.\n\nThis is the first of a two-part lab exercise.\nProviding a strong motivation for a quantitative problem is\nessential to hold student interest. The motivating question that\nthis series of lab exercises answers is: How much photosynthesis\noccurs in a Bear Lake Utah in one day? This lake is a local, clear\nlake with which students are familiar and we further motivate\nthe problem by comparing it to a local, shallow, and very turbid\nreservoir impacted by high nutrient runoff from local dairy\noperations. We begin by asking students to think conceptually\nabout the causal factors that limit photosynthesis in natural\nenvironments like lakes. They do this by creating a concept map\n(see the webpages) of photosynthesis in a small group activity.\nThe instructor then leads a class discussion to simplify the\n(usually) complex diagrams.\n\nLight is certainly one of the important variables that determine\nlake photosynthesis, and the first step in answering the lake\nquestion is to aswer the question: How does light change with\ndepth in a lake? This lab exercise leads students to consider\ntwo quantitative models of extinction (linear and exponential\n\ndecrease with depth). The students must use elementary reasoning\nand visualization of functions to eliminate one of the\nequations.\n\nThe remaining equation, the Beer-Lambert Law, is examined\nquantitatively using aquaria, dye, and quantum light meters.\nLight is shone horizontally through a series of 3 aquaria filled\nwith water, and light intensity is measured at the light source\nand at end of each aquaria. The students are asked to determine\nthe quantitative differences between water columns with and\nwithout dye. This leads them to the problem of estimating the\nlight extinction coefficient in the Beer-Lambert equation.\nThey calibrate this equation using logarithm transformations and\nfitting their data to a straight line.\n\nThe second lab period answers the question with\nwhich the students were originally presented. Once the\nbehavior of light in the water column is understood, the\nstudents are asked to determine the effect of different\nlight levels on the rate of photosynthesis. To answer\nthis, they use Elodea in an inexpensive manometer exposed\nto different levels of light. The response variable is\nvolume of oxygen produced in a finite time interval.\nMeasurements of oxygen production are performed at fixed\ndistances from a light source.\n\nIn this preparation, the data typically show an\nasymptotic relation with increasing light levels (i.e.,\nmanometers near the light source). The students are asked\nto create an equation that matches this relationship.\nAgain, the students must estimate the coefficients of the\nequation from their data. This requires that they again\nuse a logarithm transformation to create a straight line\nrelationship.\n\nAt the end of the two lab periods, the\nstudents know how light changes with depth and how\nphotosynthesis changes with light.\n\nThe last step is a group problem-solving exercise done\nout of class to solve the problem of the lake. The\nstudents must synthesize their knowledge of the effect of\ndept on light and the effect of light on photosynthesis\nto determine the amount of photosynthesis at several\ndiscrete water depths. By adding the photosynthesis at\neach depth, they calculate total photosynthesis. As\nhomework exercises, they are given actual light\nextinction data from Bear Lake Utah with depth and area\ndata to calculate a final answer to the question.\n\nThe math skills they learn from this last step are: unit\nconversions, summation (integration), synthesizing two\ndifferent equations and experimental results, organizing\nand performing moderately complex calculations.\n\nThis is a three lab exercise that integrates\npredator functional responses and optimal foraging. The\nmotivating question and principle is: \"Do fish forage\noptimally?\"\n\nIn the first lab period, the general problem is\nintroduced with a discussion of the evolution of animal\nforaging behavior. This is followed by a discussion of\nfood item choice when a predator is faced with two items\nhaving respectively high energy content plus long\nhandling times (juicy hamburgers) versus low energy\ncontent plus short handling times (bags of peanuts). The\ndiscussion addresses the situations when the density of\neach is very low and very high.\n\nOnce the students' intuition is clear, they perform a\nseries of experiments that replicate and extend C.S.\nHolling's original disc equation experiments using\nsandpaper discs thumbtacked to white foam poster board.\nSee the lab webpage for details. The data from these\nexperiments are used to estimate handling times and\nattack rates. The experiments are performed so as to\nproduce Type I, II, and III functional responses.\nHomework exercises are assigned. Finally, the\nexperiments are repeated using discs with two energy and\nhandling time levels at different densities. The results\nillustrate that more energy is\n\ngained by consuming the\ndisc type that has the highest profitability (energy\ncontent divided by handling time), even if it has less\nabsolute energy content.\n\nIn the second lab period, the equations for optimal\nforaging are developed. These equations describe the\nenergy gained by three foraging strategies as density of\nprey changes. At low density, the strategy to consume\nall prey encountered returns the greatest energy rate.\nAt high density, the strategy to consume only the most\nprofitable prey returns the greatest energy rate. The\nprey density at which the lines cross is the density\nwhere the predator should change its foraging behavior,\nif it is an optimal forager.\n\nThis is a lot of algebra for the students, so at the end\nof the second lab and in preparation and practice for the\nthird lab period, students measure the handling times of\nguppies foraging on Daphnia or brine shrimp (depending on\nprey local availability).\n\nIn the third week, the theory is tested with experiments\nin which guppies are presented with two size classes of\nprey at 3 densities. After the experiments, the\ninstructor engages the students in a discussion of the\noriginal question. The students complete a short lab\nreport.\n\nThis is a two lab period exercise using computer\nsimulation and lectures. The primary learning goal is to\nhave students learn and apply basic hypothesis testing\nskills. The motivating question is: \"Did O. J. Simpson\ncommit murder?\"\n\nThe discussion begins with applications of a series of computer\nsimulations written in Java and delivered over the internet.\nThese programs simulate sampling from normal distributions with\ndifferent means, variances, and sample sizes. The purpose is to\nillustrate the resultant cumulative distributions that emerge\nfor the\n\ndifference between two samples. These distributions are used to compute the probability that the null hypothesis\nis false. Students are assigned homework based on the computer\nprograms.\n\nIn the second lab period, a lecture describes likelihood\nfunctions and develops the fundamental equation for the\nlikelihood that the DNA left at the crime was observed given\nthe suspect left the DNA. This begins with a discussion of\nconditional probabilities in the context of forensic evidence\nand the nature of legal guilt.\n\nThe plastochron and leaf plastochron indices are methods to\nmeasure the age of whole plants and individual leaves based on\ntheir morphology rather than chronological age. They have been\nparticularly useful for detailed studies of whole shoot and leaf\ndevelopment. Since the indices are based on measurements of\nexponential plant growth, they provide an opportunity to\ndemonstrate the value of applying mathematics to a biological\nproblem. In this exercise, students are presented the\ntheoretical basis of the indices followed by practice in\n\ncalucating the indices for Xanthium strumarium\n(cocklebur) plants of various ages. The exercise demonstrates\nthe potential variability in plant growth and the restuls of an\nexponential growth rate.\n\nThis exercise is distributed over several weeks in an\nornithology class. The exercise is assigned to small groups\nwithin the class. The motivating question is: \"How can small\nbirds migrate long distances without eating?\"\nFor example, more than 50 species of small songbirds and even the 3 g.\nRuby-throated Hummingbird fly 1000km (600m) across the Gulf of\nMexico. There are no stopping points along the way to rest or\nrefuel. This feat is so amazing that for a long time scientists\nbelieved that hummingbirds flew around the gulf and many\nbirdwatchers believed that they rode on the backs of larger\nbirds.\n\nThe mathematics is presented in a lecture format and results in\nbasic parabolic relationship between energy consumption and flight\nspeed. Then, given the amount of energy\n\navailable at the\nbeginning of the trans-oceanic migration, the distance that can\nbe traveled is computed.\n\nTo provide an empirical component, each group is given the\nthawed carcass of a small bird that migrates across the Gulf of\nMexico. Each group's problem is to determine for this bird\nduring a spring crossing of the Gulf\n\n1. what is the best choice for V (velocity of flight),\n2. what is this bird's range at the best speed,\n3. what is this bird's range when flying against a 25 mph headwind and\n4. under what conditions (its own physiological state and\nmeteorological conditions) should this bird initiate\nmigration?\n\nMost bacteria are capable of controlling the action of genes\nthat code for the production of enzymes that catabolize\n(breakdown) growth compounds (e.g., glucose). In particular,\nthe lac operon in E. coli is repressed in the presence of\nglucose to prevent the production of enzymes needed to\ncatabolize other, less energetically rich, compounds. When\nglucose is exhausted, the genes coding for enzymes of the\nsecondary substrate are transcribed. The experimental test for\nthis phenomenon involves growing bacteria in a combination of\nsubstrates (e.g., glucose and lactose)\nand periodically measuring beta-galactosidase activity.\n\nAn analysis problem arises because both activity level per\n\ncell and total bacterial population size increases during the\nexperiment. As a result, the experiment is analyzed using\nthe slopes of regressing enzyme activity against bacteria\ncounts. The slopes are the primary data of interest.\n\nThe quantitative component of the lab exercise involves the\nstatistical analysis of slopes. We present the statistical\ntheory and spreadsheet manipulations needed to test the\nstatistical differences among the slopes of different experiments.\n\nPhotosynthesis, like most biological processes,\nis dependent on temperature.\nThe question addressed in this lab exercise is:\n\"What are processes by which a leaf gains and loses heat?\" The\ntwo variables examined empirically are leaf size and stomatal\nconductance.\n\nThis is a two lab period exercise. In the first lab period the\nbasic equations of heat balance in a leaf are presented. The\nphysical processes considered are black body radiation,\nabsorbance, evaporative cooling, convection, and conductance.\nSome of these terms have positive or negative contributions and\ntheir sum must equal zero.\n\nAfter the theory is presented, the following variables\n\nare measured in the lab: leaf temperature, vapor pressure,\nwind speed, leaf size, stomatal conductance, and absorbed\nradiation. Other parameters are known physical\nconstants or are given to the students.\n\nThe students perform an experiment that varies leaf size and\nstomatal conductance to determine the temperature of the leaf.\nIn addition, they use a simulation program that allows them to\nvary key variables to observe their effects on leaf temperature.\n\nThis is a three part lab exercise with outside computer work.\nIn the first part, the Michaelis-Menten equations are derived\nfrom the basic chemical rate equations. In the second week,\nstatistical methods for estimating the two parameters are\npresented. This involves a discussion of linear regression.\nThe main point of the exercise is to compare parameter estimates\nfor different methods of transforming the Michaelis-Menten equation to a\n\nlinear form. In outside class homework,\nthese linear regression estimates of the parameters are compared\nto estimates from nonlinear regression using the SAS statistical\npackage. The third component is an experiment in which students\nmeasure enzyme activity and use the different methods to estimate\nthe parameters.\n\nThis is a 2 lab period exercise in which students physically\nsimulate organisms colonizing islands of different sizes and\ndistances from a mainland. Student data are then used to test\nthe island biogeography theory of MacArthur and Wilson.\nIn the first lab period, the basic theory is presented to show\nthat immigration rate decreases and emigration rate increases as\n\nthe number of species on the island increases. Students solve\nfor the equilibrium species number. They fit their data to\nthese lines based on a simulation of island colonization. The\ndata are obtained by throwing labeled plastic disks (petri dish\nhalves) at squares delineated by string on a lawn. Overlapping\ndishes represent extinctions; disc labels define species.\n\nStudents creat rules for the spread of a disease in terms of\nfrequency and spatial extent of infection. Using a plastic\ntemplate with hexagons, randomized infected and non-infected individuals\nare represented by marks on the template. The infection rules\n\ndetermine the numbers of infected individuals in the next\niteration. Mathematical models of the dynamics of infected\nindivdiuals are created, calibrated, and tested with additional\ngames.\n\n\"How long will a leaky bucket leak before the leaky bucket\nleaks no longer?\" Students are given plastic containers (milk\njugs) in whose side a small hole near the bottom has been\nfilled. They measure the rate of flow over time and fit these\n\ndata to a series of models one of which is based on Torricelli's\nLaw. They are then presented with a new bucket with a different\ntype of orifice (e.g., rectangular) and asked to predict the\nemptying time."}

The first is a one-week home inquiry, the second is a 4-week laboratory inquiry, the third is a two-week survey, and the fourth is a six-week final project that usually involves laboratory work, but may involve mathematical modeling. Each inquiry is designed and implemented by the student in consultation with course instructors. In addition to writing papers on each of their inquiries, students give three oral presentations: Inquiry II results, Research on a Topic of Social Importance, and Inquiry IV results.\n\nDescribe typical assignments related to Independent Inquiry.\n\nThe following are Inquiry IV topics from Spring 2010. All were chosen by the students in consultation with instructors. Does the probability distribution of craters on the moon depend on proximity to a volcano? Calculate the height a person reaches when jumping off a force plate from the force measured on the force plate. Measure the motion of heat through a metal rod sitting on a hot plate at one end and model the results mathematically. Determine the gravitational constant from streak photographs of a marble fired from a projectile launcher. Make sure to correct parallax in the photographs Find the force exerted by soap bubbles stretching between a metal ring and the surface of a liquid as a function of height Check Boyle's Law for the equation of state of air carefully and determine if there should be corrections. If so, find the best mathematical representation of the corrections. Are the solubility products of calcium and magnesium the same? How does plant growth depend upon soil alkalinity?\n\nPlease explain how at least one-third of the course grade is based on content related to Independent Inquiry.\n\n60% of the final course grade comes from evaluations of the written inquiries, proposals for the inquiries, and oral presentations.

{"text":"BASIC BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BEGINNING TEACHERS\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\"Where do I begin?\" is often the first thing that comes to mind when teachers delve into unexplored territory. It is also easy for teachers to fall into a rut and not try new things due to a lack of time, energy, money, or courage. We have all been beginning teachers at one time or another. Trying to incorporate biotechnology into \"traditional\" biology classes is also like beginning again. Remember that first year of teaching? To make it easier for neophyte teachers to incorporate biotechnology into their curricula, two groups of teachers were surveyed. The first group, beginning biotech teachers, were asked what they would like to know to make biotech teaching less stressful and more accessible to them. The second group, experienced biotech teachers, were asked for hints\/tips\/suggestions that they felt would make teaching biotech easier for someone starting from scratch. Listed below are some hints, tips, suggestions, resources, suppliers, and words of wisdom to make beginning biotechnology in your classroom more user-friendly.\n\nTARGET AGE\/ABILITY GROUP:\n\nVaries with each individual activity you choose.\nCheck teacher guide for more info.\n\nMATERIALS:\n\nVaries with the activities you choose to do. See teacher guides for each individual activity. Listed below is the bare minimum equipment needed to start teaching biotechnology-related activities in your classroom (according to experienced biotech teachers).\n\nBASIC EQUIPMENT:\n\n(prices are approximate, subject to change, and do not include shipping and handling)\n\nOne electrophoresis kit with power supply ($400) OR see Desktop Electrophoresis by Addie Jackson in this module to make your own inexpensive electrophoresis apparatus ($15).\n\nWHAT WORKS (IN THIS MODULE):\n\nDNA isolation\/spooling (calf thymus and lima beans)\n\nGenetic Code\n\nHow restriction enzymes work; recombinant DNA (will give students a concrete example of what they'll be learning in labs)\n\nGel Electrophoresis (directions should come with kit, see Desktop Electrophoresis in this module, or check DNA Science for description) AP students can do it on their own; do it as a demo for other levels of classes; have students make a video describing the process.)\n\nHow Electrophoresis Works (Food Coloring)\n\nKaryotyping\n\nTransformation of DNA\n\nDNA Models--The Use of Models in Teaching Biotechnology\n\nSerial dilutions made clear and easy\n\nCreative Genetic Engineering\n\nA Big Forensics Activity\n\nAnalogies used to teach biochemical concepts\n\nCreative ways to connect DNA and Evolution\n\nPlant Protoplast Lab\n\nEthnobotany, drug development, ethical issues\n\nTransgenic plants, Social\/Ethical Issues\n\nEpidemiology Model with candy and bacterial culture\n\nMONEY--HOW TO GET IT\n\nGrants are the way to go if your departmental, district, and\/or state school budgets are tight. Suggestions in grant-getting from a discussion with Dr. Donald Cronkite and teachers from this institute are listed below.\n\nLook through the grant-givers' glasses to see the world with their eyes. Money-givers have interests and goals for their programs. Think: What does the agency want to accomplish?\n\nLearn about the foundation. Look at literature about the foundations, read, see what's possible, talk to people in the foundation.\n\nRemember: grants are provided because the foundation wants something accomplished.\n\nFind a grant that fits you--don't try to fit yourself to the grant. Write an \"I wish . . .\" list with what you want to do and why (ex. more field trips, electrophoresis equipment, workshops for other teachers, etc. . .). Start with an idea first, then find the grant. Don't let the grant set your agenda.\n\nExplore what grant opportunities there are. Go to a college library and look at the Foundation Index and Grant Index. Look in the NSTA journal.\n\nStart early and find people to critique your grant proposals.\n\nYou can use the same info for some sections of grants (like the intro).\n\nFind successful people and talk to them. They can give you hints.\n\nWhen you get turned down, write your grant again (revise).\n\nDon't put salaries on budget--put money into supplies and equipment.\n\nOTHER SUGGESTIONS\n\nIf you teach physics or have access to power supplies, you may not need to order them for gel electrophoresis.\n\nBuy kits the first year just to get started--you'll have everything you need there, have less stress prepping for the first time, and \"you know it's gonna work.\"\n\nOther teachers said that \"I'm not proud of it\" but \"when you have nothing, kits give kids a good experience.\"\n\nBuy one set-up (ex. gel electrophoresis) the first year and use it as a demo. You can acquire more set-ups as money permits you to.\n\nUniversities and hospitals are possible sources of equipment and materials . . . see if you can talk to them and start a relationship.\n\nSome words of courage, \"It's not unusual to fail\" and \"You need attitude-I don't care if it fails or not\".\n\nAsk for brochures and info from biotech companies in your area, then show them to your students to let them know what's going on in the real world.\n\nGet used to using bacteria and viruses--it's cost-effective (just agar), results can be seen the next day, results can be kept in refrigerator for extended periods, students learn good, sound techniques.\n\nMany teachers said they share and rotate sets of electrophoresis equipment within a district--not always easy or practical to do but sometimes there is no other choice."}

Working in pairs, they need to answer 6 questions, write the question, the answer, and where they discovered the answerYoung geographers complete a research project. They list the physical features found in the American South. They then discuss the economy, culture, and geography found in the South. They work in groups to research one of the five physical features, prepare an oral presentation, and present their information to the class. Ask guiding questions to encourage listeners to assimilate what they heard and derive supporting evidence and reasons for speakers' claims.\n\nStudents participate in a scavenger hunt on the internet. Using a digital atlas, they find answers to specific questions related to plants found in Idaho. To end the activity, they share their results to the class to discover what happens to native fauna when unnative fauna is introduced."}
{"text":"CONCEPT: Plants are living things with specific needs, characteristics and uses.\n\nCONTENT OBJECTIVE: 1F2.00 To understand the uses of various plants and plant parts\n\nINSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES: The learner will:\n\n2.01 illustrate the major parts of a plant.\n2.02 classify some plant foods we eat as roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds.\n2.03 name some animals that use seeds for food.\n2.04 name some animals that use leaves for food.\n2.05 name some animals that use fruit for food. Some things may stay constant while others change.\n\n2.5b Cycles of change can be extended in scales of time, space, and material.\n\nBENCHMARK Changes occur in various ways and may be altered by controlling some variables.\n\nCLASSROOM CONNECTOR\n\nTIME REQUIRED:\n\nLesson One - two 45-minute sessions; Lesson Two - 30 minutes\n\nThis classroom connector addresses Instructional Objective 2.01.\n\nMATERIALS:\n\nPictures of different types of plants, trees, flowers; picture of a plant with each part labeled; lettuce leaf; toothpicks; untreated sweet potato; glass; food coloring; stalk of celery; small plant that has been growing several days; variety of fruits, such as orange, apple, peach and plum\n\nSET:\n\nToday we are going to learn the six parts of a plant and the uses of these parts. Did you know that when you eat peas or beans you are actually eating seeds? Those seeds have other uses. Let's see what these are.\n\nINSTRUCTION:\n\nWho can tell me what you see in these pictures. (Show pictures of different types of plants, trees and flowers.) Can you name some plant parts? (These responses can be listed on the board.) Plants are grown, not only for beauty, but also for many other purposes. Some of the foods we eat come from plants. Can you name some foods that come from plants? (Again - list the student responses on the board. Hold up a lettuce leaf.) What part of the plant is this? Yes, it is a leaf. Can you think of other leaves we eat? (Spinach, cabbage) We are going to talk about plants and find out how we use each part of the plant.\n\nWhere do the plant's roots grow? (pause) On top of or under the soil? (Have a picture of a plant with each part labeled.) Who can show me where the roots are? (Have children point tot he roots.) What do roots do? Yes, roots help to hold plants in place. What do you think would happen if plants did not have roots? (Have children discuss the roots of plants and what they do for the plant.) Roots also take food and water from the soil to feed the plants. We are going to watch some plants grow. Then you will know what they do.\n\nSUPERVISED PRACTICE:\n\n(Stick three toothpicks into the middle of a sweet potato. Balance the toothpicks on top of a glass jar filled with water so that one-half of the sweet potato is below water. Place it in an area where all the children can observe the changes.) Wait a few days and ask the children what changes they observed. (Sweet potato grew small roots)\n\nMONITOR AND ADJUST:\n\nWhat do roots do for the plant? (Take in food and water and holds plant firmly in place)\n\nINSTRUCTION:\n\nStems are also parts of plants. Someone come and show the class where the stem is on this plant. (Hold up picture of the plant with the parts labeled.) What does the stem do for the plant? (Hold up the plant.) The trunk of a tree is a stem. What do people use tree stems for? (Lumber that can be used to make furniture, build houses, many other things) Can you name some stems that we eat? (Celery, potatoes, broccoli, asparagus) Flowers have soft, thin stems. The trunk of a tree is a stem. (Have pictures of flowers and trees that show the stems of flowers and the trunks of trees.) How are the stems of these plants different? (response) How are they the same? (response) How do stems help plants? (response) Let's find out.\n\nSUPERVISED PRACTICE:\n\n(While the students watch, fill a glass with water. Add a few drops of food coloring. Place a stalk of celery in the colored water.) What do you think will happen to the stem and the water? (response) We are going to check the stalk of celery in about two hours. (The colored water will travel up the stem to the leaves.) What do you think would happen if the water did not travel up to the leaves and flowers of a plant that was still growing? (The parts would wither, dry up, and die)\n\nMONITOR AND ADJUST:\n\nTurn to your neighbor and tell him\/her where the roots and stems are on a plant and what each does for the plant.\n\nINSTRUCTION:\n\nA leaf is also a part of a plant. The leaf grows on the stem. A while ago, we talked about leaves that we eat. Can you remember what we saw? (Lettuce leaf) Can you name some other leaves that we eat? (Cabbage, collards, mustard, kale, spinach) What do leaves do for the plant? (response) Yes, the leaves make food for the plant. Leaves use air, water and sunlight.\n\nSUPERVISED PRACTICE:\n\nWe are going to watch the leaves on this plant. (Hold up a small plant.) We are going to place the plant near a window or door. What do you think is going to happen? (Write down the predictions to use later.) We are going to watch the plant for several days.\n\nINSTRUCTION:\n\nWhat is the prettiest part of a plant? (response) Yes, the flower. How do you think the flowers help the plant? (response) Yes, they produce the seeds that will grow into new plants. Someone point to the flower on this plant. (Hold up picture of plant with parts labeled.) Can you name some flowers that we eat? (Broccoli, cauliflower) Some plants make a cover for their seeds. The cover is called a fruit. Some fruits have many seeds inside, and some have only one seed. What fruits do you like to eat? (Have children name the fruits they eat.) What happens if you plant a seed? (New plant grows) What kind of fruit will grow if we plant an apple seed? (response) What about a plum seed? (response) Yes, a seed can only grow into a new plant that is the same kind as the plant in which it grew.\n\nSUPERVISED PRACTICE:\n\nWe are going to find the seeds in this orange, apple, peach and plum. (Have children help to find the seeds.)\n\nCLOSURE:\n\nWho can tell me what we have learned today? (pause) As I point to each part of the plant, please say that part with me. The parts of the plant are - starting from the bottom - roots, stems, leaves, flowers. Some flowers make covers called fruits. Inside the fruits are seeds.\n\nAny root, stem, leaf, seed, or fruit that is edible, pictures of animals which show plant parts being eaten, pictures of food prepared from plant parts\n\nSET:\n\nPlants help us in many ways. Raise your hand if you had cereal for breakfast. (response) Who had Rice Krispies? (response) Oatmeal? (response) Corn Flakes? (response) Then you had a part of a plant. Did you know that animals also eat parts of plants? (response) Today we will find out what parts of plants people and animals eat.\n\nINSTRUCTION:\n\nDid you know that humans can eat roots of some plants? (response) Raise you hand if you have ever eaten carrots or turnips. (response) Then you have eaten roots! Did you ever eat spinach or lettuce? (response) Then you have eaten leaves. If you have celery or asparagus, what part of the plant have you eaten? (Stem) Name some fruits we eat from plants. (Apples, oranges) The seeds we eat are oats, barley, rice, wheat, nuts.\n\nACTIVE PARTICIPATION:\n\n(Section off a bulletin board with a section for each plant part. Give a magazine to each pair of students.) Now that we've learned the plant parts we can eat, I want you to look through these magazines and, when you find a picture that will go on one of our bulletin board sections, cut it out and put it on the bulletin board.\n\nINSTRUCTION:\n\nSome animals eat seeds. Can you name some animals that eat seeds? (Birds, squirrels, cows, etc.) Some animals even eat leaves. Can you name some animals that eat leaves? (Worms and caterpillars, cows, deer, rabbits, chickens, etc.) We like to eat different kinds of fruit and so do some of the animals. Name some animals for me that eat fruit. (Monkeys, insects, birds, etc.)\n\nCLOSURE:\n\nPlants give us some of the food we need. We get food from stems, roots, leaves, roots and seeds of some plants. Tell your neighbor something you eat that comes from a plant and what part of the plant it is. Then name an animal for your neighbor that eats the same plant part that you eat.

A short history of the evolving interest in examining interactions between different \"brands\" of science within the natural Earth system is provided. Special problems of investigating the richly interactive Earth system in the context of an \"open scientific system\" - as opposed to a controlled experiment in the laboratory - are introduced. The special role of humans in Earth system science is also introduced.\n\nSystemic Thinking\n\nThis topic focuses on the rules of logic in investigating natural systems that we cannot control; and a most important aspect of examining the interactions between different cause-effect processes that operate within an open Earth system. Cause-effect processes in the biosphere may have significant interactions with cause-effect processes in the atmosphere, or hydrosphere. The science of the geosphere has important implications for climate and climate change. Weather and climate changes feed back into the behavior of the hydrosphere, and various biological systems living within. Teaching about the simplistic causeeffect relationships within a specific discipline is a perfect beginning for 21st Century Earth System Science Education, but is not the perfect ending. Teaching interactions, feedbacks, and implications are fundamental to Earth System Science Education (ESSE).\n\nEarth System Science Educational Strategies\n\nA brief introduction to strategies of initiating ESSE at colleges and universities is also provided in this section. Decisions about breadth and depth of a curricular track are the most fundamental aspect of curriculum design. Relationships between ESSE courses and collegiate requirements are important considerations."}

{"text":"Activity - Ecological Interactions: The Food Cobweb\n\nE&E IPM Standard: 4A, 4C, 7B, 10 A, 12 A\n\nSkills: Ordering, inferring, predicting, critical thinking\n\nIntroduction:\nPlants and animals live in interacting, intertwined communities. There\nis a characteristic set of species in different environments. For\nexample, certain species of trees, shrubs, ground cover, arthropods,\nreptiles, mammals, birds etc. live in a temperate forest environment. A\ncompletely different set of creatures live in a marsh, or a grassland\nor an agroecosystem. However, the relationships between these groups\ncan be defined by the ecological role they play, the flow of energy\nbetween them and the cycling of nutrients between them. This is a fancy\nway of saying \"everything is connected\"! And if you change one part of\nthe system, something else changes. In an ecosystem management\ndecision, you hope you know what those consequences of your actions\nare!) This is important in managing agroecosystems as well.\n\nMany organisms eat just about anything, plant or animal. These are\nomnivores, like my friend Bob. Organisms that feed primarily on\ndecaying organic matter are scavengers or detritivores. Each organism\nhas a certain way of making a living it its environment, that is it has\nits niche.\n\nA simple food chain, in which chemical energy and nutrients are passed along might be:\n1. GRASS \u2014> COW \u2014>YOU! (So thank the grass next time you eat a burger!)\nOR\n2. CORN PLANT\u2014> INSECT \u2014> BIRD \u2014> HAWK\n\nHow many other examples can you give?\n\nHowever, most transactions are more complex than these examples. Can\nyou make even these simple ones more complex? Once all the organisms\nthat rely on another are mapped out, the relationship looks more like a\nfood web than a straight-line chain.\n\nLet's see how organisms rely on each other within a system.\n\nLearning Objectives: 1. See in what ways living things are connected.\n2. Understand that systems are more or less complex in their connections.\n3. Learn what happens if certain living components of the system are removed.\n4. Construct a simple food web that might be found in an agroecosystem\n5. Consider the pest management implications of food webs\n\nMaterials Needed: o Pre-made cards showing the ecosystem, name of organism, classification, and food.\no Pre-made cards that have an arrow, stating \"Energy Flow\"\no Big pieces of paper for students to draw out their own food webs\no (You can also do this exercise with balls of yarn, see below.)\n\nProcedure: If using card layout\n1. Give students all the cards representing marsh ecosystem connections\n2. Lay out the species joined with \"Energy Flow\" arrow cards to each of their stated foods.\n3. Diagram the food web thus created.\n4. Pull out a species, thus erasing the connections it has to other species. What happens?\n\nIf doing the ball of yarn technique 1. Give the students the marsh ecosystem playing cards with the individual's role listed\n2. Each student has a card (Make as many cards as you have students.)\n3. Each student then identifies who they need to be connected to to live and takes a piece of yard\nthat they both hold onto. Repeat with as many different food types as they eat.\n4. Teacher reaches in and removes one species from the group.\n5. Students note what happens to them and everyone around them.\n\nIPM Application 1. Have the students create & explain their own food web in an agricultural or garden setting.\n2. Include species that are pests of the plants or animals; or weeds with their herbivores.\n3. Include predators upon these species\n4. Have students discuss how they would manage these pests without disrupting the environment.\n\nTimeline: Full class period for intro to food webs, A second period for IPM application.\n\nAnalysis: What happened when one of the organisms is removed from the food web?\nIs there the same amount of disruption for every species removed?\nWhat situations in the real world might impact members of the food web?\nWhat other factors can affect the system as a whole (not just individual species)?\n\nDiscussion:\nDiscuss the effect of biodiversity in a food web.\nCompare the agricultural ecosystem with the marsh ecosystem.\nAre some species more in danger of being knocked out of a system than others?\nWhy or why not?\nAre some ecosystems more fragile than others?\nWhat might determine this?\nWhat might the effect of an invasive species (plant, animal or disease) be on an ecosystem?\nWhat considerations might you take into account when choosing IPM\ntactics for management of pests in various ecosystems?"}

{"text":"\"Dioramas are the primary teaching resource tool at the American Museum of Natural\nHistory,\" says Lisa Breslof. She ought to know. Lisa came to the Museum seventeen years ago with an undergraduate degree in marine\nbiology, and since has earned an Ms.Ed. in Museum Leadership in Education from the Bank Street College of Education. Now a Supervising\nMuseum Instructor, Lisa works with students of all ages, from kindergarten through college. Created from collections brought back from\nthe farthest reaches of the Earth, \"the dioramas and exhibition halls are the Museum,\" Lisa explains. Their beauty and wealth of detail\nmakes them not just a favorite stop for visitors, but an invaluable tool for teaching observation skills.\n\nA diorama is a re-creation of a natural setting and a rendering of a specific moment in time. It represents the geography, geology,\nflora, and fauna of that place as accurately as possible, using hidden lights to simulate the lighting at that time of day, and invisible\nwires to capture the illusion of flight or movement. The world-famous dioramas in the Museum depict actual sites, like the bighorn sheep's\nhabitat high in the Rockies, or the Mexican landscape, where jaguars roam. In\nthe classroom, many teachers have helped students create shoebox dioramas of environments ranging from Native American villages to the\nAntarctic ice shelf. Terrariums, which are simply live dioramas, are also a common classroom fixture. These typically depict a natural\nsetting, such as a rotting log or other small-animal environment.\n\nThey have intrinsic value.\nThe dioramas at the Museum are of extraordinary quality and importance. \"First of all, they might contain important or rare specimens.\nAlso, many of them feature a particular place on Earth that many people might not ever visit,\" Lisa points out. \"Does everyone get to\nvisit the Kivu volcanoes in Zaire and see them stream lava?\" Dioramas are valuable because they expose people to realistic simulations of actual\nplaces and events, and give people the illusion of being present at the original scene.\n\nThey allow us to compare past and present conditions.\nA diorama shows the land and its inhabitants as they were originally encountered. \"By standing in front of the exhibition and talking\nabout the animals and plants in that environment, you can interpret the ecology of the area, how animals interact, and what's going on.\nA diorama can also be a useful resource to help discuss the health of an environment, and can be a good springboard to make comparisons to the\nsame environment today,\" says Lisa.\n\nThey help us make connections to the real world.\nUsing the exhibition halls, and their dioramas, for observation activities is so effective because they allow the teacher to make\nconnections for the students to the actual subject in the natural world. \"Students who want to know more about marine mammals and how\nthey behave could go into the Hall of Ocean Life and visit the blue whale,\nthe sea lion, or dolphin dioramas. There they could make comparisons and distinctions about marine mammals, or about particular\ngroups of whales,\" suggests Lisa. \"Also, seeing the subjects depicted in their natural habitat helps students to have a better\nunderstanding of where and how those animals live. It makes it real.\"\n\nDifferent Questioning Strategies Encourage Observation\n\nOne way classes can interpret the dioramas in the exhibition galleries at the Museum or in any informal science center is through\nthe inquiry process, which Lisa defines as \"the search for evidence in the exhibit to solve a problem.\" Students interact with each\nother and the exhibits as they search for evidence and answers. The process emphasizes investigation rather than the acquisition of\ninformation, and develops skills with wide applications. Lisa encourages students to stop and thoughtfully take in an exhibit, and\nto see connections between different objects in the display. \"That's done through asking questions like, 'Can you find evidence of\nrecently-hatched or very young birds in this exhibit?', 'What evidence can you find of any nests?', 'Can you come up with some\nevidence in this exhibit of how a parent bird feeds its young?'\" The answers aren't obvious, Lisa cautions. \"You have to stand\nthere and look for a while, as though you were out in the woods looking for birds with binoculars. With a diorama, you have the\ngood fortune of having that whole event right before you, captured for observation and study.\"\n\nFocused Questions Help Students Learn\n\nAs the observation progresses, teachers can help students acquire information by asking questions at different levels.\n\n1. Gather the Basics: Questions like, \"How many animals can you see in this\nscene?\" encourage the students to look carefully. They can then write their findings down or describe them orally. Other kinds of\nexhibitions and questions encourage the use of other senses, like touch or hearing, back in the classroom.\n\n2. Organize and Process Information: Questions at this level \u2014 like, \"Which\nanimals do you think are the best runners and why?\" \u2014 help students compare and contrast, analyze, explain, and summarize concepts.\nStudents can record their findings in various ways, such as drawing, circling words, listing, describing, and counting. \"If you\nwanted to record the behavior most widely depicted in Museum dioramas, an observation might be, 'What type of behavior is the\nostrich demonstrating in the ostrich-warthog diorama?'\" suggests Lisa. \"The students could describe that the ostrich is trying to\nprotect its newly hatched young from the warthogs entering the nesting area. They can draw the behavior, or they can first discuss\nit in a group and then write about it.\" Another set of questions might be, \"Can you distinguish between the male and female ostrich\nparent? What distinguishing characteristics might the answer be based on?\" These are just some ways in which data can be retrieved\nfrom a Museum diorama.\n\n3. Develop New Insight: At this level, educators can ask students to draw\non what they have gathered, and their own personal knowledge or imagination to articulate an idea or theory. For example, \"What do you\nthink the leopard is going to do next?\" \"How might this scene be different if it were winter\/summer?\" \"Does this region of the world\nhave seasonal change?\" Students can write or draw their answers, or express them aloud.\n\nObservations Can Lead to Future Research\n\n\"Recorded observations serve as the basis for follow-up discussions, either in the Museum or back in the classroom,\" notes Lisa.\nFor example, setting up a fish tank or terrarium to observe a small reptile or mammal could lead to a discussion of animal\nbehavior. \"From there, school projects can be created that would last a month or year, and would investigate all aspects of that\nparticular animal and its natural history.\" She points out that students can put information collected in the Museum to many uses:\n\"to write a short story, to develop a play, to conduct a laboratory study, or to organize an exhibit in the Museum, in the\nclassroom, in the home, or online. By observing items carefully over an extended period, the student not only formulates a clear\nvisual image of the objects or exhibit, but develops techniques of observation that can be used in the future.\"\n\nA Museum Visit Can Kindle a Passion\n\nFor Lisa, \"the most exciting part about teaching at the Museum is visiting different parts of the world in one place.\" She knows\nthat dioramas play a key role in awakening this sense of excitement. When students study these meticulously-created scenes, they\nlearn to look differently at the world around them, to notice details that otherwise might have escaped their attention, and, as a\nresult, perhaps bring a greater sense of anticipation and curiosity to the task."}

{"text":"Title\n\nResource Type\n\nViews\n\nGrade\n\nRating\n\nYoungsters create a list of grocery store items and then work together to categorize them as if they were setting up the shelves of the market. Then they are given a box of miscellaneous objects to practice categorizing. With these two experiences under their belts, you can then introduce them to the biological classification system and the use of a dichotomous key for identifying unknown organisms. The lesson is specific to Kentucky wildlife, but can easily be adapted no matter where you live.\n\nCheck this out! Part two of a set of slide shows about biological classification; this one zooms in on kindgom plantae and kingdom animalia. Attractive and informational slides cover details that make this most appropriate for advanced biology learners. Not only do they address general characteristics of each kingdom, they touch on reproduction, seed structure, symmetry, evolutionary trends, body cavity formation and embryo development. This may end up being your most preferred presentation!\n\nAn in-depth introduction to biological classification is presented at the opening of this presentation, dividing life into six kingdoms. Although it does not address the currently accepted level of domain, it is an outstanding exploration of the criteria for each kingdom and the unique characteristics of archaebacteria, eubacteria, protista, and fungi. Diagrams, graphics, and high-quality color photos enhance learning. Watch out for the final fungi photo; It is disgusting!\n\nTenth graders are introduced to the the use of similarities and differences in the classification process. Students will then learn how biological classification represents how organisms are related, with species being the most fundamental unit of the classification system.\n\nIn this classification worksheet, students will look at how biological classification began and how scientific names are used in biology. Students will use a table showing the classification of four organisms to answer 10 short answer questions. This worksheet also contains 6 matching questions and 9 true or false questions.\n\nMiddle schoolers explore diverse forms of life by using modern biological classification systems to group animals that are related. Students then study basic scientific groupings like genus, species, mammals, fish, birds, amphibians, and reptiles, and pair different vertebrate animals, identifying their common traits.\n\nThe author of this presentation elaborates on the details of insect classification, information apparently required to become a master gardener in the horticulture program at Oregon State University. Though lengthy (110 slides), it is an outstanding collection of photos, graphs, and diagrams to educate the viewer in basic entomology. Not only could this be used as a resource for horticulture classes, it can even stand as an introduction to a college entomology course.\n\nLearners create a dichotomous keys of common classroom objects. In this biology lesson, students investigate plant and animal classification using an interactive online website. They create booklets containing information about the organisms.\n\nThree lessons and five assessments are contained in this material. Various paper shapes are sorted as a simulation of biological classification. Learners gather a list of living things that they are familiar with and design a classification system for them. The third lesson in the series focuses on the outdated kingdom Monera. As long as you teach the more current name for the bacteria, the culturing and examination in this activity is applicable to the taxonomy theme."}

{"text":"Many instructional activities can promote learning in more than one\nsubject area. Connections made between two or more curriculum areas encourage\nstudents to make associations between the content covered in different\nsubjects. These connections work to reenforce the subject matter in the\nminds of the students.\n\nA biology lesson about the types of trees growing on a certain area\nof land does not have to be solely a science activity. Students can, for\nexample, do a writing assignment about what they observed while studying\nthe trees. A math lesson can be linked to the activity by asking students\nto create ratios comparing how many trees were observed from each identified\nspecies.\n\nJeanette Hopkins, a fifth-grade teacher at Roosevelt Middle School in\nCherokee, Iowa, uses this instructional strategy with her students. Hopkins\nwanted to develop an activity that would combine the science curriculum\nwith the language arts curriculum. The project she created with a team\nof teachers and community members is called A Sense of Place: The Red Tail\nRidge Wetlands Project. For this project, the students go on four or five\nfield trips to the Red Tail Ridge Nature Preserve near Cherokee to document\nthe changes that have occurred in the environment over time. The students\nthen use the information they learned and the observations they made to\nhelp them complete different science and language arts assignments during\nthe course of the school year.\n\nOther Roosevelt staff members helped Hopkins to develop the Sense of\nPlace project. They included teachers Rebecca Phipps, Dina Ringo, and Jill\nRapp, and principal Larry Weed. Mary Unsworth-Born and Amy Ahrends, two\nnaturalists associated with the Cherokee County Conservation Department,\nalso lent their expertise in ecological study. Other individuals working\non the project team included parents, biologists, local museum employees,\nand Area Education Agency personnel.\n\nOn Red Tail Ridge, the students perform several different science experiments\nrelated to the environment. Under the supervision of Hopkins and other\nadults familiar with the nature preserve, the students collect water samples\nand search for aquatic life in a pond. They also walk through the woods\nand grasslands, identifying different trees and grasses and gathering leaf\nsamples. Students are able to compare their information with the observations\nmade by previous fifth-grade classes in order to understand how the wetland\nareas change over time.\n\nWhen the students return to their classroom, they perform more activities\nthat are based upon the knowledge and information they had gathered in\nthe field. On one trip, for example, the students learned that not all\nthe birds in the area migrate south for the winter. Keeping that fact in\nmind, the students, with the help of parents and several community members,\nconstructed birdhouses like the ones they had observed near the nature\npreserve.\n\nThe Sense of Place project continues to expand as a multifaceted educational\nprogram. One activity the students undertook in March of 1995 involved\nwriting letters to a local committee in support of the Greenspace project.\nA number of houses on a local flood plain were scheduled to be moved, with\nthe land then to be used as greenspace where construction and development\nis prohibited. Students wrote letters to\nthe chairman of the Greenspace Project Committee in support of the idea.\n\nIn May of 1995, students from the fifth-grade class held a mock town\nmeeting at the Sanford Museum. They debated whether houses should be built\non a fictional marsh area. Students wrote papers\nand speeches, some arguing that the project would be beneficial to\nthe community and others arguing that the project would be harmful and\nunnecessarily destructive to the wetlands.\n\nJeanette Hopkins, Rebecca Phipps, and Amy Ahrends have written a\npaper describing the Sense of Place project. They discuss\ntheir objectives, the procedures they followed, and the resources they\nused in developing the program.\n\nThe Sense of Place project has proved to be a good learning experience\nfrom both a science and language arts perspective. Going to the Red Tail\nRidge Nature Preserve extends the science classroom into a natural environment\nwhere the biology lessons normally learned in the classroom take on a practical,\nhands-on significance. Students are given the opportunity to enhance their\nlanguage arts skills as they work on observational note taking, research\nprojects, and writing assignments. Because the activities are structured\nso that two different curriculum areas are emphasized, the educators involved\nin the Sense of Place project make it possible for students to use information\nnormally isolated in one subject to support and accent student growth in\nother subjects and areas of learning."}

{"text":"Investigating the Precipitation-Streamflow Relationship\n\nDescription\n\nGraph illustrating the relationship between precipitation and streamflow.\n\nThe intricate relationship between precipitation and streamflow is illustrative of the complexity and changing nature of the water cycle. These key aspects can be investigated to help understand the water cycle. The duration and intensity of the precipitation, soil porosity, the slope of the ground, and the time of year emerge as some of the potential factors in this investigation.\n\nStep-by-step instructions will guide you through the following processes: locating and downloading web-based streamflow and precipitation data, importing the data into a spreadsheet, and generating a graph that displays the day-to-day relationship between these two variables across a full year. The inquiry starts once the graph is complete. The patterns that emerge from the graph are sometimes predictable and sometimes quite puzzling. As you consider questions about this complex relationship and search for answers, you will develop a deeper understanding of some of the basic dynamics of the water cycle. There is no attempt in this chapter to quantify the precipitation - streamflow relationship.\n\nAlthough the particular case study in this chapter is valuable for introducing the procedures related to a precipitation\u2013streamflow investigation, you will have greater opportunities for inquiry if a local watershed is available for study. In a local investigation, you may have the opportunity to visit the watershed to gather information about factors such as slope, soil composition, and vegetation. You'll also have the opportunity to request information from local officials or environmental agencies.\n\nThis chapter is part of the Earth Exploration Toolbook. Each chapter provides teachers and\/or students with direct practice for using scientific tools to analyze Earth science data.

{"text":"Detective Technique Guide Classification\n\nClassification\n\nStudents will classify a variety of objects in order to compare and contrast.\n\nStudents will analyze previously collected data in order to place items into meaningful groups.\n\nTools And Materials\n\nStudents will need their list of observations from the previous activity.\n\nIf possible, students will again need to bring in their interesting items, or if unable to bring these items into class, they will need to bring photographs of these items.\n\nYou may wish to allow students access to computers with word processing software.\n\nTeaching Stratedgies\n\nStudents should now have a list of \"interesting items\", as well as a list of characteristics for each of these items.\n\nInform students that simply describing the items they have found is not sufficient for a truly diligent field researcher. Students must also find similarities and differences among items, and place these items into groups that reflect these comparisons.\n\nHave student groups gather and compare their lists of observations. For each type of observation they have created, have them create two or more categories in which to place each item. (The easiest two categories are simply \"does exhibit a specific trait\" and \"does not exhibit a specific trait\", although sometimes more degrees of meaning are necessary.)\n\nWhile student lists may vary greatly, the rules of classification are still the same for everyone. Students should try to group the objects into sensible categories based on important characteristics. Grouping all items that were dusty is not likely to be a meaningful category. However, grouping all items that are coins or grouping all items found in a box labeled \"Grandma\" may be.\n\nOnce students have a category for their observations, have them create a hierarchy of categories. Are some categories more important? Are some redundant (can the information they reveal be shown using other existing classifications)? Are some not as useful as they first thought? See how few categories they can use, but still identify each item uniquely (so that no item has the same categories as any other item). This scientific classification may remind students of how living organisms are classified.\n\nStandards From MCREL Standards\n\nStandard 2.11: Understands the basis of scientific knowledge\n\nKnows that scientific explanations must meet certain criteria to be considered valid (e.g., they must be consistent with experimental and observational evidence about nature, make accurate predictions about systems being studied, be logical, respect the rules of evidence, be open to criticism, report methods and procedures, make a commitment to making knowledge public).\n\nStandard 21.1: Understands and applies the basic principles of presenting an argument\n\nUnderstands that when people try to prove a point, they may at times select only the information that supports it and ignore the information that contradicts it.\n\nUnderstands that to be convincing, an argument must have both true statements and valid connections among them.\n\nEvaluates the overall effectiveness of complex arguments.\n\nStandard 21.6: Applies decision-making techniques\n\nSecures factual information needed to evaluate alternatives.\n\nPredicts the consequences of selecting each alternative.\n\nMakes decisions based on the data obtained and the criteria identified."}
{"text":"Teaching & Learning in the new information landscape\u2026\n\nWith all of this hype about Mars and the exploration of Mars, there have been many infographics about Mars and space exploration. I have found yet another that is very interesting. Using pixels, this infographic shows how far away Mars is. However, it is not as far away as it used to be.\n\nMost people who remember SPUTNIK and America's landing on the moon are retiring, so in order to get a first hand experience, most teachers will have to speak with parents or grandparents. But the goal is to get first hand memories of this momentous event that can be related to your students today. For instance, what was someone doing when they found out about these momentous events, what were their thoughts? What did children play with and what were children excited about?\n\nThen have your students imagine what it would be like to walk on Mars. Write a news article about the first Mars landing, or a diary entry as though they were the first person to walk on Mars. Have students discuss what landing on Mars would mean, and what they think will be the next goal after we do land on Mars.\n\nThis infographic, found on Cool Infographics, shows how the climate has changed over the past 2,000 years in seven regions of the world (nearly all five continents, but not quite). Each color change represents the 30 year mean, and the increase and decrease of the temperature over time can be viewed. How do you think the mean was found before modern technology?\n\nFirst of all, the infographic shows that North America and Antarctica share a similar temperate trend, and the five remaining regions share an opposite trend. On top of this, the arctic regions are experiencing a warm up and the other regions are showing a cool down. What could cause each of these phenomenon?\n\nShare this with your classroom while studying global warming and other long term weather changes. This is a good example of what global warming can lead to. However, it can also be noticed that the major changes in temperature in North America and Antarctica began around 1200, long before the modern chemicals that are blamed for these changes. What are other explanations?\n\nI have been working on the history of my home town, and the book I am using is organized by subject and time, making it a little difficult to keep track of events as they occurred. I just came across this great website that easily allows you to create a timeline. It can be useful for both you and your students.\n\nThis will allow you to create both events and time periods, categorizing items by color, and by creating new layers. This is a great way to organize history for your students, and it can be accessed at home as well.\n\nThis infographic found on visual.ly is a great infographic about major wars of since America became a country. It goes through every war, from the American Revolution to post 9\/11 and shows the amount of time spent in battle, the amount of money spent on war, and the number of lives lost.\n\nAccording to this infographic, America has spent half of it's its existence in war. Based on my knowledge of history, this is not terribly uncommon. Most countries have been in war in defense or offense over borders, money, or even love. Challenge your students to research some of the minor wars and find out the reasons behind them.\n\nThis infographic is also a great example of how to create an infographic. It uses a gun as a timeline, and a bulls eye to show lives loss. It is a great example of how to use implements from the subject to who information in an infographic.\n\nThe other day I came up with a great way to give extra credit while strengthening your students. Giving extra credit for bringing in necessary supplies, such as tissues, is great, but students who give an extra push that will help them later on in life should get rewarded. Tangible rewards are one of the best ways to motivate students.\n\nIn todays infographic, three major cities were surveyed based on the job skills employers in the cities seek. A lot of what was found was collaboration, project management, and internet skills. Well why not encourage your students to harness these skills in middle grades, upper grades, and even elementary grades, and reward them when they exhibit these skills.\n\nThis can be done in multiple ways. By having your students come up with their own marketable skills they already have and give them a confidence booster by rewarding them with these. You can also compile a list of marketable skills with you students, and have each student choose a few to work on, and then later assign them to students to give the students something to work on.\n\nDuring assessments, if the students choose to go for this extra credit, have them outline how they used these marketable skills to complete the task. For instance, with collaboration, how did the students divide the work evenly based on each students skills? How did the students then come back together to share what they learned and put it together. Offer this explanation as extra credit. Many curriculums are teaching these marketable skills, but taking this extra step allows students to realize that this is a marketable skill and share how they used it, as well as receive feedback from you the teacher. Possibly even bring in professionals to give feedback.\n\nA few decades ago, it was suspected that today we would be wearing metallic space suits and eating food in pill or goo form. But life has changed very little over the past several decades. Our food has become much more processed, but we more or less eat the same things. Styles have changed, but they are recognizable in fashion from the mid to late 20th century.\n\nThis makes me wonder where this infographic got their information (although it does have a list of sources at the bottom). According to this infographic, we will be eating bugs and wearing billboards in 10 years. What do your students think about this? Do any of your students wear Hollister and American Eagle now? They are now walking billboards. What about the delicacies of the future? Have any of your students traveled? What things have they eaten that would be considered strange by American standards? Maybe this infographic isn't too far off. Challenge your students to make their own guesses as to what the future will be like, with references.\n\nWhat is the most devastating storm in your memory? For me it was Hurricane Fran, which swept inland into the heart of North Carolina, causing power outages for days and even weeks, and kept us out of school for around two weeks. Trees feel everywhere, and many roads were impassible for weeks. Then there was the crazy snow storm when I was in high school. Two feet here in Raleigh, leaving us out of school for two weeks again. They ended up just telling us to go to school if we could, but absences wouldn't be counted against you. Power was out for days and even weeks again, but the aftermath wasn't as bad.\n\nWhat about for you? Depending on where you live, you may remember other storms. I don't remember Hurricane Katrina very well, except for deciding to drive home from college that weekend and there not being any gas Charlotte and West. But I'm sure those along the Gulf remember things very differently.\n\nThis infographic shares information on how devastating storms were each year. Some may not have affected you at all, and you may have been in the heart of others. For those that you didn't experience first hand, ask you students to find before, during, and after photos to get a better idea of the devastation. I did this for Hurricane Fran when I was in college. I found photos of flooded streets and had my father back home drive around and take photos of the same streets today, to show how busy the streets are. Everyone was very impressed and this particular project stands out in my mind.\n\nThis infographic, brought to us by Pediatrics After Hours, is brightly designed to grab the attention of one group in particular, kids. Germs are gross, and kids get sick the most often. They are often too preoccupied to remember to do simple things, such as cover their mouths when they cough, or wash their hands before they eat. So it is important to pass along the information that tells them why they need to do these things.\n\nThis infographic shares the major ways germs are spread, through touching, eating, drinking, breathing, and bites. It is important to be careful with everything that you do, from cleaning your home regularly, to drinking clean water. One thing one teacher did once was to put glitter glue all over her hands, and we watched how many things she touched. Everywhere the glitter was, we could pass germs.\n\nPost this infographic in bathrooms, by doors, and in eating areas. Make sure you get the word out so that your students can stay in the classroom and not constantly be out sick. Teach your students that we aren't trying to waste their time by making them wash their hands, it is truly for their own good.\n\nIt's no secret that there are larger cars on the roads now. The majority of cars on the road where I live are SUVs, and several decades ago these didn't even exist. Your students may not be able to imagine a time when they were unable to stand up in their cars. But ask you students to research the history of SUVs. Why were they created? How were they marketed to be so popular?\n\nThis infographic compares the same cars over a series of years to show how they have grown in length and height, as well as weight. What is the benefit of these larger cars? In science class, discuss aerodynamics, and try to figure out which cars have an advantage, cars from the 1950s, or todays cars. Try to find similar sized model cars and make a wind tunnel, showing students the stream of air. Use other things on cars, such as the slant of cars and spoilers to show them the benefit of these.\n\n2\/7\/13 - Gerry Roe posted a comment to this article, asking for the data source on this infographic. The designer did not include the data, which in my opinion, renders the graphic useless. Ryann has not yet commented below. She's busy with her other job and her graduate work.\n\nI did some googling and found three tables with identical data, but none of those documents sited valid sources. I am leaving the graphic up as an example of the critical importance of the basic literacy practice, \"Ask questions about the answers that you find.\"dfw\n\nTaxes are a constant debate among politics. Everyone wants lower taxes, but few people think about why taxes are necessary. Before you show this infographic, challenge each student to find five unique uses for tax money, and imagine what the world would be like without the government having that money.\n\nThis infographic shows that the US and Japan have the highest taxes in the world. Why do these two countries need such high taxes? What do each of the countries listed use their taxes on. What is their national debt like? How did they rack up these debts? Make sure your students understand why taxes are necessary, and brainstorm ways for the government to come up with the necessary funds without taxes."}

{"text":"The latest research from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University published in December 2012 has some truly astounding news. The megadroughts referred to in the paper published in Nature Climate Change happened around about 900 to 1300 AD and are so extreme that they have no modern counterpart for comparison (these megadroughts will be referred to in the following as the \"12th century megadrought\").\n\n'300 Years of Fossil Fuels in 300 Seconds' is a very unique and innovative clip that has attracted over 1 million viewers on YouTube. It provides the viewer with a broad outline of how Climate Change came to be and alerts of the immediate need to address the situation. Although it employs language that may be too advanced for some students, teachers would benefit from using this as a resource for their own learning about the topic as well as a stimulus for teaching ideas. Students would profit from viewing the clip and the illustrations that accompany the narration would help them make sense of the content, however it is fast paced so I would recommend a double viewing to enhance comprehension. The first run through could purely be for observation and the second run through could provide an opportunity for students to practice their note taking skills, thus creating a link to literacy. \"The impact of the internet has been global and far-reaching in its facility to disseminate information quickly to online users.\" (Winch, 2010, p. 400)\n\nTeaching Idea: Construct a timeline as a class of all the major events in history that have contributed to Climate Change\/global warming eg. Industrial Revolution, population growth & consumerism. There is a numeracy link here in which students are to come up with an appropriate scale for the timeline. (Students may have to conduct further research)\n\nAlternatively, a class discussion could take place surrounding an important quote from the clip \"We must live within natures budget of renewable resources at rates of natural replenishment.\" Ask students to elaborate on this \u2013 What does it mean? What are renewable resources?\n\nAssessment Task: Ask students to evaluate the positive and negative aspects of the effects of human changes on the environment. Divide the class into two and ask each student to contribute one response and allocate a scribe to put the ideas into a mind map. Students can then write an exposition (literacy strategy) using the points as cues in determining whether or not they believe the positives outweigh the negatives or vice versa.\n\nWhy climate change gets the silent treatment, and what we should do about it.\n\nThis week, in an encore broadcast, scientist Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication, joins Bill to describe his efforts to galvanize communities over what's arguably the greatest single threat facing humanity. Leiserowitz, who specializes in the psychology of risk perception, knows better than anyone if people are willing to change their behavior to make a difference... \n\nClimate Change is the RESULT not the cause. It is a combination of factors and behaviors we have been engaging in over the past centuries that have depleted and devasted our ecosystems, biodiversity and environments that have created an imbalance in our biosphere that it cannot absorb or maintain. Emptying our oceans; urban growth; CO2 emissions into atmosphere; destruction of nature's biodiversity balance; pesticides poisoning soils, species and water changing the eco and chemical balance. Big Agriculture and it's dependence on fossilfuels.\n\nDo we want to live in a world devoid of nature, wildlife, living off lab-created food and pharmaceuticals?\n\nOur body is part of the greater planetary body - it is designed to respond to the outer circumstances of the greater web of life. If we do not put our efforts to restoring it, we may well may become an extinct species on this planet by end of century.\n\nWithout our natural world we do not exist. To the degree She is sick and out of balance so are we.\n\nLet us beginning responding to course correct. Our fellow travellers (other species) on this planet are suffering and disappearing fast. This is within our power.\n\nAs the carbon dioxide in the air hits 400 parts per million for the first time in human history, some are arguing that the best way address climate change is to use the controversial practice of geoengineering \u2014 the deliberate altering of the Earth's ecological and climate systems to counter the effects of global warming. ...\n\nThe arguments for and against climate engineering revealing the extent of vested interests linking researchers, venture capitalists and corporations with Clive Hamilton, professor of public ethics at Charles Sturt University in Canberra, Australia, He's the author of Earthmasters: The Dawn of the Ag, e of Climate Engineering.\n\nThere's virtually no regulation of geoengineering. And when it comes to sulfate aerosol spraying, there's nothing to prevent a government, any government, or even a corporation or a billionaire with a messiah complex, from launching a program of taking control of the Earth's weather by installing this kind of solar shield. So the absence of governance, the absence of regulation and the exclusion, particularly of people from poor and vulnerable countries, is a very serious concern\u2026.\n\nWe are ALREADY messing with nature, absolutely and catastrophically. We must stop that, no question, as soon as possible, as fast as feasible. Whatever we do should NOT be used as a substitute for eliminating all fossil fuel burning. Full stop!\n\nBut it simply won't be enough to merely stop burning fossil fuels, because it is too late to stop the reinforcing feedbacks that will make things much much worse. If we don't do anything more, then we are giving up, we are admitting defeat and accepting all the worsening destruction that follows.\n\nTo restore nature, we have NO choice but to mess with nature some more in order to actively counter the effects and the causes of global warming and all the rest of our destructive practices. We must do it right, of course, and not make things worse. It is not enough to deal with just the symptoms of the problems, but we must get at the underlying causes. We must do it on a global scale, because the problems are global. It won't be a short term solution because these are necessarily long term problems that require long term solutions.\n\nWe MUST save the planet by messing with nature. But we also must solve a large number of other problems that allowed us to get into this mess. Unrestrained irresponsible exploitation of nature for the benefit of a few is at the root of all those problems.\n\nAL GORE : 400 PPM Yesterday \n\nTHIS IS THE YEAR 2012: And when the sand is gone, when the mining activity moves out, what will be left of this place? Some big empty rail yards, a pockmarked series of \"reclaimed\" sites no longer suitable for farming, and a bunch of homes nobody wants to live in any more? A post-mining wasteland and an even more depressed economy? That's what's happened in countless other mine-riddled communities.... \n\n\".\"\n\nA new study presents startling findings that rapid climate change may threaten many more species of plants and animals than previous measures have led us to believe. The study, one of the biggest of...Scientists are working hard to understand the life that teems within our soil and that is threatened by farming and development...\n\nForget the term \"dumb as dirt.\" The complex soil ecosystem is highly evolved and sophisticated. It processes organic waste into soil. It filters and cleans much of the water we drink and the air we breathe by retaining dust and pathogens. It plays a large role in how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere. Soil, with all of its organic matter, is second to the oceans as the largest carbon repository on the planet. Annual plowing, erosion and other mismanagement releases carbon in the form of carbon dioxide, and exacerbates climate change... \n\nThe mass clearing of trees for farmland disturbs the ecosystem of the rainforest by decimating rare and exotic flora and fauna. With the planting of a single crop plantation, the natural biodiversity of the rainforest is lost. The mono-crop culture that has long-plagued environmentalists in the west displaces or destroys most of the species in a single sitting, as they are unable to adapt to living within vast acres of a single crop. The environment, habitats and species that are destroyed have lived together since the dawn of the rainforest, and the damage caused by palm oil farming is irreversible \n\nAre we in the first act of a mass extinction that will end in the death of millions of plant and animal species across the planet, including us? Proponents of the \"sixth extinction\" theory believe the answer is yes.\n\nWhether Sweeden will achive their objective can be debated , but their resolve is backed by robust strategy and plan. And they are on path, even for the transport sector . FFV (Flexi-Fuel-Vehicle) is somethig that can inspire Public Private Partnerships even in the developinf countries"}
{"text":"Making a Bathymetric Map\n\nOverview:\n\nThe students will use a probe to measure the bottom of the \"ocean\" that the teacher creates. They will plot their measurements and draw isolines to depict the bottom. More advanced students will correct the measurements for tidal changes and horizontal positioning.\n\nMaterials:\n\nA large, deep, lightweight cardboard box with a lid. A department store gift box would be ideal.\n\nVarious objects of unequal height and shape to glue in the bottom of the box (half a tennis ball, a rock, a wedge, a cone, a wooden rectangle block, etc). Alternately, a piece of Styrofoam cut to the size of the box that will be carved to make measurable relief.\n\nStraws, or narrow diameter wooden dowels, or shish-kabob sticks longer than the box is deep\n\nGlue and markers\n\nSetup:\n\nDepending on what you will use for a depth finder (a straw, dowel, or stick), punch holes with an adequate diameter to insert the probe in the box lid. The holes should be aligned in a grid pattern. The distance between points should not be greater than 1 inch in any direction. Too close a grid will cause your box to fall apart!\n\nGlue the various objects on the bottom of the box, keeping in mind the grid that you have prepared for \"remote sensing\" of the bottom.\n\nTape the box lid to the box bottom, so that students won't be tempted to peek at the \"ocean\" floor.\n\nDepending on the age and ability of the students, you may pre-mark your measuring sticks or have students calibrate them as part of the exercise. Each unit will equal 1 foot, but there should be interim hash marks for fractional parts \u2026 at least 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 feet.\n\nPreparation of the Ocean Bottom\n\nHints: When preparing the bottom, you might consider placing a small narrow object that could easily be missed, or two objects near but not touching each other, that would give the illusion of a continuous surface if the space between is missed. This will illustrate the necessity of a closely spaced grid when many features are likely."}

{"text":"\"Children should use enquiry skills in context. These up-to-the-minute stories will captivate them\"\n\nAnne Goldsworthy\nPrimary Science Expert\n\nTopic: 5E Earth, Sun and Moon\n\nThe Trailblazer jacket is a new piece of clothing, fitted with satellite navigation, to track a child's position and inform their parents of their whereabouts to within four metres, 24 hours a day. It uses a system of satellites orbiting the Earth to figure out the child's position. This information is then sent direct to the home computer. Its makers believe it will help to secure children and make parents less anxious. However, many children believe we might be taking technology too far as it makes them feel like they are being spied on.\n\nIn this activity children will use data to determine positions using the same method as sat nav equipment. They will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this invention.\n\nYou will also need the latest version of the flash player to be able to play swf files.\n\n\u00b7 that the Moon orbits the Earth\n\nChildren will demonstrate this by completing the task on page 2 successfully.\n\n\u00b7 that satellites orbit the Earth\n\nChildren will demonstrate this by completing the task on page 2 successfully.\n\n\u00b7 that data from more than one satellite is needed to identify an exact location.\n\nChildren will demonstrate this by completing the task on page 4 successfully.\n\n\u00b7 that satellites can receive and transmit data back to Earth\n\nChildren will demonstrate this by completing the task on page 4 successfully.\n\n\u00b7 to appreciate the advantages and disadvantages of satellite navigation for humans\n\nChildren will demonstrate this by completing the task on page 5 successfully.\n\nScience:\n\nQCA Unit 5E Earth, Sun and Moon\n\n\u00b7 that the moon takes approximately 28 days to orbit the Earth\n\u00b7 about the relative sizes of the Sun, Moon and Earth\n\nScientific enquiry\n\u00b7 consider what sources of information to use to answer questions\n\u00b7 use observations, measurements or other data to draw conclusions\n\u00b7 deciding whether the evidence supports the prediction and suggesting explanations in terms of their knowledge of science.\nLiteracy\n\u00b7 speaking and listening - putting together a case for a choice and discussing it with a group\n\u00b7 persuasive writing - write a letter to support ideas\n\n\u00b7 Display Page 1 of the activity through a data projector or on an OHT. Look at the images of both the children and the mother and read through the words they are saying. Ask the children if any of their parents have a Satellite Navigation system (or Sat Nav) in their cars.\nCan the children explain what their parents use it for and whether it is a helpful gadget? Go on to explain how some scientists have been busy investigating a type of Sat Nav system for children to wear in order to try and increase their safety and try to reduce the number of children who either get lost or find themselves running late and with no way of telling their parents who are worrying back at home. Ask the children the questions presented at the foot of the page:\n- How does this new track-it jacket work?\n- Do you think this it is a good invention?\n- Why might this be a popular gadget for all children to wear?\n\nLeading the main activity\n\n\u00b7 Display Page 2 through a data projector or on an OHT. Using the children's initial responses from the previous page, assess and build on children's present knowledge and understanding by using the pictures and information identified. Highlight how, like the Moon, the satellites which have been placed in space by humans, orbit around the Earth and collect data sent up from the transmitter on the track-it jacket. Point out how more than one satellite can receive this data and they are those which are closest to the position of the child. Go on to explain how the satellites then send the data back down to Earth to the receiver within the mother's computer where it is combined to find an exact location within 4 metres.\n\nPractical investigation\n\n\u00b7 Display Page 3 of the activity through a data projector or on an OHT. Print off copies for the children. Look closely at the map and explain how this is the map of the local area in which the boys and mother live. Explain how this map is shown on the mother's computer and discuss the different places where the boys could be located. Explain how they are going to plot the information received from the satellites. Usually the receiver does this.\n\n\u00b7 Display Page 4 of the activity through a data projector or on an OHT. Print off copies for the children. Describe how this shows the information the computer will receive from the satellites. Redisplay Page 3. Model on the board how to use a pair of compasses to draw a circle radiating from the centre of the identified location and taking into account the scale shown on the map. Go on to tell the children that this single circle is representative of the data received from only one satellite and that they must now repeat the same procedure for all other satellites. Explain that the circles will intersect and this will give information about the location of the boys. This is what would be shown on the map when the mother looks at the computer screen, the receiver would have interpreted all the data automatically.\n\nOptional extension activity\n\n\u00b7 Display Page 5 through a data projector or on an OHT. Explain to the children that with all inventions there are always advantages and disadvantages and that different individuals have different opinions about whether they are appropriate or will be successful. Go on to explain that the overriding opinion of parents and children is that this jacket would be a good invention and that they should be made law for all children to wear. Tell the class that they are to write a persuasive letter to the Government minister for Health and Safety explaining how he should make it law for all children to wear the track-it jacket, using the recognised grammar and language features of this genre."}
{"text":"Today & tomorrow three middle school classes from Bridgman Middle School are connecting to the Bronx Zoo for their Awesome Adaptations program. The science classes have been studying adaptations and this program fits nicely into the curriculum.

She definitely makes them think!\n\nThe program includes demonstration of three live animals, as well as full screen text of scientific names, video clips, and still pictures. These visuals enhance students' understanding of adaptations.\n\nThe students were able to ask many questions during the program as well. This was a great program and I'm sure we'll be connecting to the Bronx Zoo again!\n\nToday Village Adventist Elementary School is doing my all time favorite videoconference: Magnificent Manatees from the Columbus Zoo. I love this program because of all the hands-on activities students do during the videoconference.\n\nThe class measures a paper cutout of the manatee (mailed ahead of time to the class) to help them understand the full size of the manatee. You can see it on the wall in the back of the classroom.\n\nThe students also all get on a bathroom scale until they have enough students add up to the weight of a manatee at the zoo. You can see the students lined up at the scale in the picture. This is a group of 1st and 2nd graders, so they aren't adding all the numbers. However I've seen this program with older students where the presenter asks all the students to add the weights of all the students.\n\nNext the partners work with a set of pictures showing the types of food that the manatee eats. The students have to pick out the foods they eat from the pictures.\n\nSeveral great activities, lots of information for the students, and wonderful live footage of the manatees swimming in their tank. These features make this program an excellent choice. The Columbus Zoo is VERY popular. This school year (2005-2006) they filled the whole year schedule by mid September. They open registration for the 2006-2007 school year on June 1. So plan ahead!"}

In this lesson on Earth's surface, students watch a video about the Earth's surface and use satellite images of the United States to identify various changes seem in the surface of the Earth.Fourth graders explore the Earth's changing surface. In this earth science lesson plan, 4th graders conduct a scientific experiment that replicates the wearing away of minerals. Students write paragraphs that make connections between the experiment and how the Earth's surface changes.\n\nFourth graders use sand, clay, and water to try and make the Grand Canyon. In this Earth's surface lesson plan, 4th graders discuss how the use of water when flooded can change the Earth's surface. They explore how it would change the look of sand or clay over time.\n\nFifth graders practice using the Internet for research. In this technology lesson, 5th graders navigate the Internet to find information on the surface of the Earth and how it is changing. They complete a worksheet.\n\nStudents depict the various layers of the Earth through an interactive art project. In this Earth's layers lesson, students listen to the book How to Dig a Hole to the other Side of the World and make speculations of why the center of the earth is made up of iron and nickel. Students use colored sand to create an art project showing the various layers of Earth.\n\nStudents research plate tectonics and the impact of changes to the Earth's surface. In this Earth science instructional activity, students visit the given websites to learn about plate tectonics. Students write a journal entry for the sites and then study a PowerPoint for the topic. Students complete a worksheet for the topic.\n\nFourth graders construct a concept map about Plate Tectonics. They include types of movement, names and effects of boundaries. They research plate tectonics, describe and name 3 types. They analyze the effect on the earth's surface of plate activity.\n\nStudents investigate how the earth's surface changes. In this geology lesson plan, students watch a simulation of how the earth changes by using sand and baby powder with a fan turned on high. Students note the changes and then conduct an experiment using sand in a baking pan with water. Students observe the changes as the water is poured into the pan. Additionally, students complete an observation worksheet."}
{"text":"Science Vocabulary Words for Third Graders\n\nScience vocabulary words for third graders can be practiced with games and activities. If you need some ideas to help your students learn these words, then you are in the right place.\n\nScience Vocabulary Words for Third Graders\n\nThe following 20 science vocabulary words for third graders are words that the students need to understand well. First, there is a study sheet for you to give to students, and then there will be some activities for the classroom. Here is the study sheet.\n\nScience Words:\n\nanemometer - An instrument that measures the speed of the wind\n\natmosphere - The mixture of gases and water vapor that surrounds a astronomical body, like the earth\n\nbarometer - An instrument that measures the pressure of the atmosphere\n\nconduction - Thermal energy moving from one object to another where they touch\n\nchlorophyll - A green chemical in the cells of a plant that allows the plant to make food using the Sun's energy\n\necosystem - An isolated group of living and non-living things that interact which each other to ensure each others' survival\n\nevaporation - The process of changing from a liquid to a gas\n\nextinct - When all animals of one species die\n\nforce - A push or a pull\n\ngreenhouse effect - The heating of the atmosphere caused by shortwave radiation passing through that in turn heats the earth\n\norbit - The path of an object as it moves around another object in space\n\nphotosynthesis - The process of plants making food by using energy in sunlight to change water and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and oxygen\n\nphysical change - A change in matter in which no new kinds of matter are formed\n\nprecipitation - Any kind of water particles that falls to the ground, such as snow, rain, hail, or sleet\n\nrevolution - One object moving around another object\n\nrotation - The spinning of any object on its axis\n\nsolar system - The sun and all the objects that orbit around it\n\nwater cycle - The movement of water from Earth's surface into the air and back to the surface again; precipitation, evaporation, and condensation\n\nActivities and Online Resources\n\nNow that you have the definitions for science vocabulary words for third graders, maybe you would like some activities for the classroom. Hangman is always fun to play. You would divide the class into two teams and read the definition. The player would have to give you the word.\n\nEcosystems are always fun. The class could divide into groups and each group would research an ecosystem and present its findings to the rest of the class. You would need to require some type of visual aid; drawings, shadow boxes, or anything else they can think of.\n\nThere are lots of science games to play online. Here are a couple of the better ones:\n\nUen.org has 14 games related to third grade science, like inventions, force, astronomy, living and non-living things, and simple machines.\n\nYou can find a great game, Third Grade Science Jeopardy, at Salem.K12.va. There is a link that gives you all the questions and answers, so you could adapt it for your classroom and add all the definitions on the study sheet. Of course, you could let a couple of kids play online, too. One student could know the host and have all the answers. Here's a sampling of the questions under the Water Cycle category:\n\n100 points: Rain, snow, hail and sleet are all examples of this part of the water cycle (precipitation)\n\n200 points: The origin of energy that drives the water cycle (the sun)\n\n300 points: During evaporation, a puddle of water becomes this (water vapor)\n\n400 points: When warm moist air meets cooler air, this part of the water cycle takes place to form a cloud (condensation)\n\n500 points: A natural or manmade lake used for the storage of water (reservoir)"}
{"text":"All Sorts of Rocks\nIn this lesson, students access their prior knowledge of sorting with a card sort and a book before being asked to apply their understanding of sorting to rocks. This will help students understand the concepts of hardness, texture, layering, and particle size as they relate to rocks.\n\nRock Hounds at Heart\nIntegrate literature with science by reading Sylvester and the Magic Pebble. Students will learn to describe rocks by using different physical properties.\n\nRock Star Centers\nStudents will complete a Rock Star Journal while studying the properties of their rock.\n\nThe Great Rock Sort\nStudents will learn to describe and sort rocks by their physical properties"}
{"text":"From \"The New York Times,\" this interactive multimedia package offers a thorough and complete coverage of the December 26, 2004 Tsunami. The site requires registration, but it's free, safe, and definitely worthwhile. The hour-by-hour presentation is particularly informative. This site is intended for teacher use only, as it does include graphic images of the tsunami's destruction that are not suitable for students.\n\nThe USGS offers these beautiful images of the Earth taken from the Landsat-7 satellite. Chosen on the basis of their aesthetic appeal, this collection of images provides amazing views of our planet the likes of which few have ever seen before. Look for indicators of tectonic activity in images of mountains, volcanoes, faults, etc.\n\nLooking for exciting (and scientific) pictures of the Grand Canyon, Hawaiian volcanoes, specimens from the Petrified Forest, or another national geologic wonder? This site offers access to over 250 beautiful geologic photos from the national parks. Search by park, year, state, and\/or keyword.\n\nSatellite images (urban areas are gray-white) detail the locations of faults with easy-to-see red lines. Be sure to view some of the close-up images. It could be interesting to have students notice how the topography aligns with the faults.\n\nSophisticated site featuring a glossary and an image gallery that includes hundreds of mineral photos, catalogued alphabetically. This site also aids in identifying mineral samples from results of color, streak, and hardness tests and visual observation.\n\nThis site immerses you\ncompletely in three undersea diving expeditions. Earth\nscientists explore the mid-ocean ridge and take you along\nfor the ride and a live look at the volcanic action at that\ntectonic spreading center.

They are the only creatures in\nthe world that can do this. They take sunlight, air, and\nwater, and voila! instant plant food.\n\u2022 Leaves are food factories for the plant. They take the\ningredients in their recipe (air, water, and sunlight) and\nmake them into food that the plant needs in order to\ngrow.\n\u2022 This is called photosynthesis.\n* Depending on your class level you\nmay want to go into more detail.\nDetails of Photosynthesis (Optional):\n\u2022 Sunlight strikes the plant and chlorophyll, a green\npigment in the plant, traps the light energy.\n\u2022 The leaves absorb energy from the sun and convert\nwater and carbon dioxide into energy-rich sugar called\nglucose.\n\u2022 This plant sugar is the source of food used by most\nplants.\n\u2022 The plant releases oxygen into the air and absorbs\nmore carbon dioxide to continue the process of\nphotosynthesis.\nDeveloped by WSU King County Extension - CHANGE\nUnit 1, You're the Chef: Cabbage Salad Roll-ups, 6, Grade 1-3\nHand Washing & Critical \u2022 Ask students to remind you about the appropriate\nThinking Activity (15 Min) behaviors to cook in the classroom.\n\u2022 Review where most germs on the hands tend to be for\n\u2022 Review Hand Washing hand washing (knuckles, finger nails, back of hands).\nand Cooking Behaviors\nCritical Thinking Activity\n\u2022 Critical Thinking \u2022 Teacher gives comparison between leaves and humans\nActivity writing assignment (can be written in leaf journal) and\ncalls on learning teams to wash hands.\n\u2022 As teacher has students wash hands, set up the\n\u2022 Set up Cooking Trays Cooking Trays for making the recipe.\n\u2022 Put Cooking Tray on each learning team table.

National Library of Medicine - National Institute for Science Education site features current topics in science - Unofficial page maintained by John Catalano - Richard Stafursky's comprehensive index of flora, fauna and microbes - Bruce Gittings, Department of Geography at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nBenefits\n\n. The National Science Foundation's Massive Digital Library for Education: Opportunities and Challenges for Teachers and Librarians.\n\n. The National Science Foundation (NSF) released its first call for proposals for the National Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology Education Digital Library (NSDL) program early in 2000.\n\n. Building on work supported under the multi-agency Digital Libraries Initiative, this program aims to establish a national digital library that will constitute an online network of learning environments and resources for science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education at all levels.\n\n. By FY98 the initial DLI had gained more partner agencies and under the umbrella of a new DLI-2 effort, a prototype program was conducted for two years to explore the application of digital library research to undergraduate science education test beds.\n\n. Spurred by both enthusiasm from the broad educational community and both the legislative and executive branches for the promise of digital libraries to enable improvements in education, the formal NSDL program ( was established in 2000.\n\nThis web site provides information about Earth science\/Geoscience education listservs in the United States.\n\n. Please of any listservs that should be added to this page Thomas McGuire cavecreekdigital@msn.com Listservs with a National Scope DLESE k-12 Listserv for Earth Science Educators An open DLESE listserv for educators active in secondary and primary Earth science education.\n\nThe Earth Exploration Toolbook Team The Earth Exploration Toolbook (EET) is a collaborative effort by individuals at the Center for Science Teaching and Learning at TERC, the Science Education Resource Center at Carleton College, the Complex Systems Research Center at the University of New Hampshire, and the Center for International Earth Science Information Network at Columbia University.\n\n. She has also been involved in Earth system science education activities.\n\n. Ledley has received NSF grants to develop an Earth System Scientist Network in which she works with scientists and educators to develop scientists' research projects for the participation of high school students; and to develop the Earth Exploration Toolbook which will provide teachers with step by step instructions on how to use Earth science datasets and tools in an educational context.\n\n. She is also active in the Federation of Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP Federation), the National Science Digital Library (NSDL), and in the Digital Library for Earth Systems Education (DLESE).\n\nDIGITAL LIBRARY OF EARTH SCIENCE EDUCATION ?\n\n. It offers information about developing digital collections and managing networked information for the benefit of scholarship, education, and cultural progress.\n\n. DREI QuestionAuthority is a forum, where various individuals in the reference community post their thoughts on current issues in digital reference education and training.\n\n. i-DLR is a web portal for Digital Library education.\n\n. DLESE is funded by the National Science Foundation and is being built by a community of educators, students, and scientists to support Earth system education at all levels.\n\n. Informedia project has pioneered new approaches for automated video and audio indexing, navigaiton, visualization, search and retrieval and embedded them in a system for use in education, information and entertainment environments.\n\n. Grade Level: K-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12  CONTENT: The Digital Library for Earth Systems Education (DLESE) is funded by the National Science Foundation and offers a database of quality teaching and learning resources about the Earth for a wide range of learners.\n\n. The top navigation bar offers access to the major areas of the site, and the search tool for locating educational resources is right on the front page.\n\n. A section for educators helps teachers make the most of the resources by providing information on teaching with data, evaluation and assessment, and integrating research and education.\n\nPlanning Testbeds and Applications for Undergraduate Education To continue the exploration of digital library research efforts and testbeds for undergraduate education, NSF anticipates providing up to $1 million for digital library projects submitted to the Special Emphasis: Planning Testbeds and Applications for Undergraduate Education within the Digital Libraries Initiative - Phase 2.\n\n. Areas of particular interest for DLI-2 proposals to NSF include: Planning grants for the construction, coordination, and maintenance of a national digital library for SMET education.\n\n. Proposals should address organizational structure, business models, user needs, integrative functions that will work in education context, and interoperability among existing and projected distributed components of the library.\n\n. Collection development refers to the development of validated, substantial, and coherent collections of resources for SMET education."}

{"text":"The science curriculum & elementary science lesson plan\n\nBetter science for kids\n\nImportant Scientific Concepts and the Science Curriculum\nin elementary science lesson plans\n\nMost everyone agrees that our school science curriculum needs to be improved and teachers need help developing good elementary science lesson plans. Scientific education and literacy are becoming increasing important, and but national tests show a disturbing lack of scientific understanding in school age children.\n\nAccording to The National Center for Improving Science Education, there are nine scientific concepts that elementary school children should learn and understand. These should certainly be incorporated into the school science curriculum, but parents can, and must, also play an important role in helping their kids learn science.\n\nThese nine concepts are:\n\n1. Organization. Science is the study of the natural world. To help them understand how things work, scientists organize and classify the objects and events they observe. For example, a hierarchy is a series which ranks each part according to some characteristic: an atom, molecule, stone, mountain, planet. Or they can be grouped based on shared characteristics: mammals, birds, reptiles, insects, etc. Elementary school children can learn the concept of organization by collecting and sorting things according to their characteristics, for example objects like rocks, leaves or flowers.\n\n2. Cause and effect. Science seeks to explain and understand the natural world. Things happen for a reason: there is a cause for every effect. Try to point these things out to your children during everyday activities. For example, plant growth. The grass grows because there is water and light. Without those things, the grass would die.\n\n3. Systems. A system is a group of related, interacting parts that together form an interdependent whole. In science, there are two kinds of systems. One kind is the a physical system involving matter and energy, and the way they move and react with the world and each other. The other is the system that we use to study the world, called The Scientific Method. Children can learn about systems by observing the changes in the various parts of the whole, using familiar things in their lives. For example, they can learn about equilibrium and balance by observing how an aquarium works.\n\n4. Models. A model is something that is used to represent another thing. A model can be physical object, or a description of a thing or system. This may be hard at first for young children to understand. But you can start by drawing a picture or diagram, and comparing it to the actual object. For example, draw a picture or make a clay model of a tree, including roots, trunk, branches and leaves, and show your child how it relates to a real tree.\n\n5. Scale. This refers to size and quantity. Playing with rulers and scales let children see that objects vary in quantity. Objects that are similar to each other can be larger or smaller, weigh more or less. For example, weigh and measure the heights of people, your family and friends. These differences will be obvious to children. There are other differences that are not obvious, but still exist and can be measured. For example, use a thermometer to measure temperature of warm and cold water, explaining that the temperature measures difference in the energy of the water."}

Using Lesson Planet, I am able to find amazing lesson plans at a moments notice that help to enrich their multiple grade levels. I continue to be astonished by the wealth of lessons and reproducibles.\n\nTitle\n\nResource Type\n\nViews\n\nGrade\n\nRating\n\nLisa Peters presents macroevolution as a large-scale family tree in her book Our Family Tree: An Evolution Story. She suggests the process from single-celled organisms to modern-day humans, and learners explore new vocabulary through the text. Review the following terms before reading: continents, generation, oxygen, shrank, and upright. Kids raise hands when they hear these, paying close attention to context clues. They make connections to familiar concepts using given comprehension questions (one for each word) and synthesize the information using the linked graphic organizers. Find the author's read on YouTube for something different!\n\nBeing able to test a hypothesis is a scientific must. AP Biology pupils can see the process of hypothesis testing through evidence for evolution as seen in natural selection. Slides contain solid information and excerpts from academic journals. However, the second-to -ast slide comically shows images of President Bush next to images of chimps making similar facial expressions. Editing the presentation may be required.\n\nEvolution is a controversial topic. Here is a series of lessons which attempt to present a positive and non-controversial view of the theory of biological evolution. Through journal activity, writing, lecture, and other activities, seventh graders are exposed to Darwin's theory of evolution. As the culminating activity, learners are required to examine other theories of biological evolution. This 24-page plan has everything you need to successfully implement the lesson plan and its activities.\n\nWalk your junior biologists through the evidence that supports evolution. The fossil record, anatomical record, and molecular record are explained and supported by colorful graphs and pictures. Extensive notes are provided for some of the slides.\n\nStudents are introduced to how the process of evolution works. As a class, they review the characteristics of natural selection and how those with advantageous traits reproduce and survive. To test this theory of natural selection, they test who can put nails into a block of wood without any modern day machinery. To end the instructional activity, they compare their results to see who was the fittest.\n\nStudents discuss controversies about evolution they are familiar with as well as the basic principles behind the theory of evolution. The notion of intelligent design is introduced and discussed before they begin research about the history of the response to the theory of evolution. An essay is written based on their research and intelligent design.\n\nThe extent to which \"Fittest\" can describe social success versus reproductive success is explored. Evolution may not always lead to a more desirable trait, just the one which best suits the current environment. The idea of intelligent design can be reconciled with evolution by acknowledging system design as a whole and the brilliance of adaptation. This video clearly avoids negating one argument for the sake of the other and highlights ways to incorporate both at a critical level of thinking.\n\nStudents recognize that achievements of human beings throughout human history can be considered part of the ongoing story of human evolution. They research settings such as the biosphere and Mars and write imaginative short stories using those settings.\n\nLearners will love a weeks worth of bone study. They use bones and characteristics of bones to explore the evolution of hominoids. Bones are compared, categorized, and considered. A great way to bring physical anthropology and material data analysis into the classroom.\n\nLooking at evolution in detail, this thorough instructional activity has complex questions requiring details and explanations of natural selection and diversity. Various examples of biological characteristics are available, and students choose the relevant theories they support from the multiple choice options. The second half of the instructional activity gives examples of fossils, prompting learners to relate the evidence to theories regarding common ancestors, acquired characteristic, and evolutionary relationships."}

{"text":"Energy and Force Learning Resources - this Week's Topic on the Gateway to 21st Century Skills\n\nThe NEED Project promotes energy consciousness and education\n\nEducating students about energy teaches them about the idea of transformation and change, as energy intrinsically changes from one form to another. But the theme of change by way of energy can be expanded externally as well, as kids explore and brainstorm ways that energy can enact social change in the form of newer, more efficient energy technologies. New types of technology and new ways of applying existing energy technologies are always fun to explore in the classroom, and some products in development may surprise you. For example, there is a current project to develop roads implanted with solar panels in order to melt snow. This type of idea may initially sound far-fetched, but it and other nascent energy technologies are actual products in development with exciting possibilities.\n\nThe resources selected this week focus on energy and force, two concepts that produce change. Each resource was created by The NEED Project, a nonprofit association dedicated to promoting energy consciousness and education. The NEED Project was launched in 1980 with a physics teacher from New York at its helm, and it works to bring balanced energy programs and curricular materials to U.S. schools. All of The NEED Project's lessons are aligned to national education standards, and each unit contains a teacher's guide as well as several labs and hands-on activities for students.\n\nThis week's Joann's Picks column on the Gateway's home page,  focuses on resources to help your students learn about energy and force. Peggy's Corner will discuss online tools and providers that can help you tackle this important subject with your students. Additional resources on the topic will be presented and discussed on the Gateway's Facebook and Twitter pages.\n\nExploring Magnets  Subjects: Physical sciences Grade: 1-4 Students explore the concepts of atoms and magnetic force with a variety of magnets and experiments, making predictions, recording observations and data, and drawing conclusions. The unit includes teacher demonstrations and center-based explorations for students.\n\nSecondary Science of Energy  Subjects: Physical science Grade: 9-12 This unit explores the various forms and sources of energy, the main things that energy enables us to do, and how energy is stored. Students will also explain energy transformations and trace the energy flow of a system. The unit includes a teacher demonstration and six lab stations\n\nAbout The Gateway to 21st Century Skills The Gateway has been serving teachers continuously since 1996.

{"text":"Examples of CAM in action include:\n\nAs part of the CAM project, we have developed a cross-disciplinary course at the upper undergraduate and graduate levels entitled Climate Change: Science, Communication, and Solutions.The course seeks to provide students with the tools and knowledge that they need to develop their own well-informed view of climate change. Because climate change is both impacted by humans and will increasingly impact society, the course takes a cross-disciplinary approach, integrating science, policy solutions, and media literacy as they relate to climate change.\n\nIn the first half of the course, students examine scientific concepts drawn from diverse fields, including atmospheric science, physical climatology, biogeochemistry, and ecology. Students learn about current and projected climate change and its impacts though inquiry-based analysis of climate data and visualization resources. The course then focuses on communication and policy solutions as they relate to climate change. Students work together in teams to produce a short video conveying their own perspective on a climate change science topic and its implications for society. Through this project, students both engage with science content and also improve their literacy in a medium that is emerging as a major means of communication. This literacy provides a means to:\n\nBecome more sophisticated consumers of media related to climate change\n\nProvide a vehicle for active exploration and learning about climate change science\n\nEmpower students to join the larger societal conversation about climate change\n\nFor middle and high school students, climate change is an issue that has always been present in their lives. During this five-week summer program for high school students, students were introduced to key concepts about climate change science, impacts, adaptation, and mitigation. The students then wrote, produced and edited a range of media projects, including a newscast, animation, music video, game show, and experimental film about the specific aspects of the issue that they wanted to communicate to the public. Their motivation and perspective on their work became clear when they named the program YEP! for Youth Educating the Public."}

Crowther, Associate Editor\n\nEditor's Note: Due to a directory change, the counter was\nreset again on 10\/21\/97.\n\nAn Ordinary Summer Field Trip for Middle School Students\nto the Minnesota River Starts an Interesting Chain of Events Drawing National\nAttention!\n\nSuch was the headline in the newspaper that read\nfrom an Associated Press release about mutated frogs in Minnesota. The\narticle continued:\n\nCindy Reinitz, now known as \"The Frog Lady\" since her middle\nschool students made the discovery,. . . and her students from the Minnesota\nNew Country School in Le Sueur, ( in the heart\nof the state's farm country, first reported the deformed leopard frogs\nduring a field trip to a wetland last year. They reported their findings\nto the pollution control agency, then to state lawmakers, and finally went\nworldwide by putting their information and pictures of the frogs on the\nInternet (\n\n\"When somebody caught a frog without one leg,\"\n13-year-old Jack Bovee told a state House committee this year, \"I\nthought, 'Houston, we have a problem.' \"\n\nScience education has taken a huge leap in the\npast few years with the help of electronic resources and the Internet.\nProbably the most fascinating issue that stems from Cindy Reinitz and her\nstudents' research is that a regular teacher with her students made a discovery\nthat has had incredible outcomes. Two major universities have taken up\nresearch in that specific area studying the mutations of frogs, but even\nmore so, through the use of electronic means have set up a data base for\ncollecting and distributing information about frog deformities across all\n50 states. Many researchers and interested people have united in this endeavor\nand now people can inquire and receive information about the frogs and\nresearch from this one middle level classroom.\n\nAnother example which has had more popularity is\nthe tracking of the Monarch Butterfly migrations across the U.S. into Mexico.\nIn its fourth year of an outreach program called the Monarch Watch (\nAn entomology professor, Dr. Orley R. \"Chip\" Taylor, from the\nUniversity of Kansas along with professors and colleagues from across the\nunited states are involving thousands of students and adults in a cooperative\nstudy of the monarch's fall migration.\n\nThese are just two, of many examples, of how the\nInternet has changed and improved science and science education by the\nuse of the Internet for students, teachers, scientists and the education\ncommunity. In this second issue we are proud to have Dr. William Kyle,\nthe distinguished Desmond Lee Family Professor of Science Education, University\nof Missouri, St. Louis and Editor of the Journal of Research in Science\nEducation (JRST) offer our editorial in conjunction with Charles\nD. Schmitz, Dean of the School of Education, and Elizabeth A. Schmitz,\nDirector of Assessment, Technology, and Planning for the Public Schools\nof Clayton, Missouri. Their editorial Possible Lives or Shattered Dreams?\nis an excellent commentary regarding the current state of science education\nand technology in our public schools.\n\nAfter reading about the frog discovery from\nthe students in Minnesota, I couldn't help but make a few comparisons with\nfrogs to what we are trying to accomplish here with the Electronic Journal\nof Science Education. We are currently going through a metamorphosis,\nchanges which will benefit both the readers and the researchers. A frog\ngoes through many changes before entering its adult form. Incomplete metamorphosis\ngoing from an egg through several changes from polliwog to an adult is\nnot dissimilar to what the journal is experiencing. Frogs are an indicator\nof the health of our environment. Many ecological hazards and pollutants\nwill show up in the water systems thusly effecting many of the aquatic\nand amphibious species therein. In addition to the ecological factors are\nthe pressures of natural selection and the evolution of species. Frogs\nhave changed to adapt to their environment and, as all species, are making\nthose gradual changes to better adapt to their surroundings. As far as\nan indicator of the science education environment, we hope to continue\nto evolve and reflect the needs of the science education community and\nthe technology that is available. We will continue to evolve as the technology\nand needs require us to do so. We invite everyone to join us in this exciting\ntime to take advantage of the technology and evolutionary progression in\nhow research is presented to the science education community.\n\nSome of those changes have already taken place since the first issue.\nThe Electronic Journal of Science Education (EJSE) goes beyond\nthe printed page and allows for the use of technology and collective information\nto be shared both in context of research as it is presented in the articles\nby allowing for links to other home pages and research areas on the Internet\nand by utilizing the technology of the Internet and the EJSE mailing\nlist to provide an interactive discussion about the research that is presented.\nBy clicking on the highlighted areas one could immediately E-mail the author,\nrespond to the EJSE list, or be taken to another location on the\nWorld Wide Web.\n\nFor the first time, EJSE readers will be able to respond through\nthe newly created EJSE mailing list about the research presented\nin the articles. EJSE readers are encouraged to join the mailing\nlist and then respond in both an academic and scholarly fashion to present\nresearch and references that discuss, support or evaluate the research\npresented. This is in no way to be an emotional outlet for personal\nbiases, but a scholarly discussion of research and ideas which stem\nfrom the ideas presented. We invite all to participate in the discussions.\n(Learn how to\nsubscribe\nto the EJSE mailing list.)\n\nFinally, we would like to encourage all\nreaders to consider submitting a manuscript to EJSE. This is an\nopportunity to tap into your technological creativity as manuscripts can\nbe submitted in HTML format with full color graphics, links, short run\nvideo, etc. In addition to submitting a non-HTML manuscript, any GIF, JPEG,\nor PIC files can be included to accompany your article including a photo\nof yourself. The options are wide open for exploring publication in this\nunlimited format. Please see our basic and somewhat fluid publications\nguidelines at the end of the issue for submitting procedures. We look forward\nto involving you in the future of scholarly publication and discussion.\n\nA general study that compared the academic efficacy beliefs of seventh\nand eighth graders from an inner city K-8 school with those from a suburban\njunior high school has produced data that may speak to enhancing children's\nachievement in science. The Morgan-Jinks Student Efficacy Scale (MJSES)\nwas developed to gain information about student efficacy beliefs that might\nrelate to school success and makes use of self report grades as a variable.\nThe scale was administered to a total of 570 students from the two schools.\nFactor analysis revealed two subscales (talent and effort) that are consistent\nwith the literature regarding self efficacy beliefs. The reliability coefficient\nas a result of using Cronbach's Alpha was .78 for the talent subscale,\n.66 for the effort subscale and .82 for the overall scale. Correlations\nbetween self reported science performance and the subscales of talent and\neffort were both positive and significant as was the correlation with the\nscale as a whole. Although preliminary in scope, these results suggest\nthat understanding more about students' sense of academic efficacy and\nthe role those beliefs may play in science achievement may have important\nimplications for both curriculum and instruction.\n\nStudent teachers on LabNet:\nLinking preservice teachers with a professional community\n\nThis article describes our preliminary exploration of a use for telecommunications\nin preservice teacher education. During the 1993 to 1994 school year, eleven\nstudent teachers at Tufts University participated in LabNet,\na project at TERC to develop a community\nof science and mathematics teachers who share an interest in \"project\nenhanced learning\" and who communicate with each other through bulletin\nboards and electronic mail (Spitzer & Wedding, 1995). This article\nreviews the student teachers' involvement in LabNet to suggest it benefited\nthem in several ways. In particular, it provided them specific, practical\nideas and advice, with respect to student projects and otherwise; a sympathetic\nand appreciative forum in which to discuss their own ideas and experiences;\nand the general support of a progressive, active group of teachers for\nexperimenting with innovative methods. The student teachers' participation\nseemed to benefit the LabNet community as well, stimulating topics of conversation\nveteran teachers might not otherwise have explored. Finally, we suggest,\nthis form of contact among intern and practicing teachers has further potential\nto provide continuity between preservice and inservice community and professional\ndevelopment."}

{"text":"good science relies on\nlogical conclusions drawn from dependable data.\n\nOBJECTIVES:\n\nStudents\nwill:\n\nGather data on heart rate\nduring exercise and at rest in three different positions (laying down, sitting, and standing);\n\ncompute male and female\naverages for each different heart rate and graph each;\n\ndraw conclusions based upon\nthe data about the heart rate differences of males vs. females;\n\ndraw conclusions about the\nimpact of exercise on heart rate and the relative body positions on heart rate;\n\ndiscussthe accuracy of the technology used;\n\npropose some alternative\nways to check the technology.\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nThis activity is an investigation\ninto the different variables that can impact a person's heart rate.Students have the opportunity to collect heart rate data using Polar\nwatches and pulse sticks, during exercise.The impact of body position on heart rate is also investigated.\n\nACTIVITIES:\n\n(Note:This is a unit plan that may cover several days to several weeks. Not all of the following\nactivities\/standards will appear in the video clips used.)\n\nASSESSMENT: The students\u00ed learning will be\nassessed by evaluating student responses on the activity sheet, evaluating their performance during\nthe activity, and their responses to the final unit assessment.\n\nTIMELINE & COURSE OUTLINE: This activity is the second activity in the\nHealthy Heart Unit. The first activity involved an exploratory pig heart dissection. This dissection\nserved as the jump off point for a discussion of the parts of the heart and how each part worked\ntogether to pump blood. Students have some intuitive notions about the function of the blood and heart\nbecause of their experiences. These experiences serve as the basis for this activity. Using heart\nmonitors, students are able to challenge their views of how the heart reacts to exercise. After these\nactivities are complete, students will role-play blood cells in their path through the heart. This\nrole-play will lead into a discussion of cells and an opportunity to see cheek and blood cells under a\nmicroscope. The unit is tied together with a variety of activities using blood pressure monitors to\ninvestigate blood pressure. The impact of high blood pressure and lifestyle choices have upon health\nare discussed as a conclusion to the unit.\n\nThis activity would normally\ntake three - four 45 minute long periods. Since we have blocked periods (90 minute long periods) this\nwill take two days.\n\nCOMMENTS: This is not a reenactment. Students began the\nactivity yesterday and used the heart rate monitors for the first time. This is the conclusion of the\ninvestigation of the impact of exercise has on heart rate. To facilitate the discussion, I did make a\ntable using the data students gathered yesterday and I handed it out at the beginning of class.\n\nThe first time I did this\nactivity, I had students count their own heart rates. This worked, but produced some inaccuracies due\nto students having a difficult time finding their heart rate.\n\nEach year this activity has new\ntwists and turns. Although students come up with similar data and explanations there are usually some\nunusual twists and additional experiments we do to answer student generated questions. One of the\ngreat side routes we took was when students questioned whether age made any difference to heart rate.\nThey devised an experiment to collect data from a variety of age groups and compared their findings.\nThey found that often younger kids have higher resting heart rates. They confirmed their findings in a\nRED CROSS CPR book listing average heart rates for infants and small children.\n\nTechnology Resources: The technology materials I used were Polar\nHeart Rate Watches and for the first time I used Pulse Sticks. I chose these resources\nbecause the PE department purchased sixteen PolarHeart Rate Monitors. This enabled me\nto move from \"manual\" heart rate monitoring. This year the PE department added Pulse\nSticks. I used these because they were available. I would not purchase Pulse sticks for my\nclass because they are so finicky. In addition the battery compartments corrode easily and then they\nbecome unusable. I like using the Polar Watches because it is a technology well within the\nreach of these students and allows them to obtain immediate accurate results on heart rate. Although\none can do this lab having students \"manually count their own heart rate\", kids are curious\nand motivated by the technology. When working with middle school students, motivation is everything.\n\nSchool Background Information: The town of Cedar falls,\nIowa has a population of 36,145 people. Most parents are employed in industry and\nservice occupations in the two adjoining cities.The enrollment preK-12 is 539 students. The percentage of students who have limited\nEnglish fluency is 2%.\n\nTeaching Strategy: I chose the teaching strategy of allowing\nstudents to collect their own data on heart rate because it is an inquiry method. I believe students\nlearn better when they collect information first hand and work to make sense out of the information\nthrough help from their instructor. Students need to construct their own meaning from their\nexperiences.\n\nTeachers are there to guide them\nand to provide the experiences that focus students attention on specific concepts.\n\nTechnology as Facilitator of\nQuality Education Model Components\nHighlighted in This Activity \n(Note: This is a unit plan that may cover several days to several weeks. Not all of the elements\nfrom the Technology as Facilitator of Quality Education Model that are described below will appear in\nthe video clips used.)\n\nIn the Principles of\nLearning, Active Involvement and Direct Experience are evident throughout the\nactivity. Students are collecting data on their own bodies and sharing this information with others.\nStudents are required to find Patterns and Connections in the data they have collected.\nThey have to connect the previous information about how the heart works as a pump with how it reacts\ngiven different body requirements. They have to reflect on the data and drawn conclusions from it. You\nalso see this Reflection when they question the validity of the technology they used and the\ndata they analyzed. Informal Learning can be seen throughout the activity with students helping\nstudents and discussing information. Teachers are learners in this classroom community and the\nstudents often share responsibility informally as the teacher. This activity presents students with a Compelling\nSituation, in that it requires them to investigate a topic near and dear to their hearts,\nthemselves. Young adolescents are just entering in a new facet of their lives where their bodies are\nchanging rapidly. Because of this, they are very interested in what their bodies do and why. Having\nthem study their bodies helps them cope with some of the changes they are beginning to experience.\nThis activity provides an Enjoyable Setting because it allows them to move around, communicate\nwith their classmates, and enter into lively class discussions.\n\nThe Information Processing\npart of the model, at first glance, doesn't appear applicable, but when viewed in the context of a\nscience activity essential parts of this section are evident. The Appreciation and the Presearch\nwere implemented in the heart dissection activity immediately prior to this heart rate activity.\nDuring this activity the Search, Interpretation, Communication, and Evaluation\nwere obvious. Students had to seek relevant information by collecting heart rate information (Search).\nThey had to interpret this information, communicate it to others in class discussions, and evaluate\nthe validity of their conclusions and the technology.\n\nManyContent Standards\nwere met during this activity. Students worked on the science standard Unifying Concepts and\nProcesses. They investigated the reaction of the cardiovascular system and how different factors\ninfluence heart rate (Systems, Order and Organization). The students also looked at the heart\nrate evidence and devised explanations for this evidence (Evidence, Models & Explanations).\nThey measured heart rate (Constancy, Change and Measurement) while at the same time used their\nprevious knowledge of the form of the heart to apply it to its function (Form and Function). In\nScience Content Standard A: Science as Inquiry, it is clear that in this activity students were\ndeveloping the abilities necessary to do scientific inquiry: asking questions about the heart,\nemploying tools , Polar watches, to gather data, use data to construct a reasonable\nexplanation, and communicate these explanations. In Science Content Standard C: Life Science,\nstudents look at the structure and function of the heart and its role in the cardiovascular system. (Structure\nand Function in Living Systems). In addition, they investigate the role of the heart in\nregulating the internal environment of the body by sensing needs within the body and changing rate to\nmeet those needs (Regulation and Behavior). In Science Content Standard E: Science and\nTechnology, when students evaluate the relative accuracy of Polar watches and Pulse\nsticks they learn that certain technological designs have constraints (Understandings about\nScience and Technology). Finally, as part of Science Content Standard F: Science in Personal\nand Social Perspectives, in this activity they begin to develop the experiences that will allow\nthem to see that choices they make impact the health of their heart (Personal Health). During\nthe discussion after this activity students started to bring up the fact that exercise may be good for\nyour health.\n\nThe last part of the model\ninvolves the Tenets of Democracy. In my classroom I work to get students to listen to\nother students, make eye contact, and refrain from negative comments (Tolerance). In the first\ndays of the year, our seventh grade team worked with the class so they could build their classroom\nexpectations. We realize that students want and need a voice in decisions. They came up with these\nexpectations: 1. Be nice to everyone.(Treat others how you expect them to treat you.) 2. Be polite. 3.\nListen in class & pay attention. (Be prepared.) 4. Do homework. 5. Chew gum responsibly. 6.\nRefrain from bringing bags or hats to class. Although these students honorable intentions, Tolerance\nis an attitude we continue to work on. Students have to use Critical Thinking and Decision Making\nto analyze their data. Through the class discussions we Think Together and Make Meaning.\nStudents are empowered in this activity as their data and conclusions drive the discussions. In the\nend students take Individual Responsibility to return equipment in proper condition.\n\nFor the Technologysection\nof the model, the students are still learning the Basic Technology Equipment Operations,\nstudents still look to me as the primary troubleshooter, and this is an area in which I need to\nimprove. I have a tendancy to go ahead and troubleshoot because I am more interested in getting\nstudents operational than teaching them how to troubleshoot.\n\nStudent Characteristics: Characteristics of students in this class that\naffect this activity are that they are extremely talkative, enjoy socializing and are eager to\nvolunteer answers. The boys tend to be more willing to volunteer and you can see I have to work hard\nto get answers from the girls in my class. I think it is critical to involve everyone in the\ndiscussion and the activity, so they will all see themselves as players in this community.\n\nEvolution of the Activity: The first time I did this activity, I had\nstudents count their own heart rate. This worked, but produced some inaccuracies due to students\nhaving a difficult time finding their heart rate."}

{"text":"It is year 2075 and our natural resources, such as gas, oil,\nand lumber, are harder to locate and, in some instances, are becoming scarce.\nThere is a push from big businesses, such as gas, oil and lumber companies, to\nloosen environmental laws that would help allow these companies to enter\nprotected areas. These laws were put into place to protect fish, wildlife,\nand plants that are listed as threatened or endangered. If these laws were\nnot in place, then companies could do as they pleased with the unprotected\nland. For example, they could drill for oil in the Alaska National\nWildlife Refuge or cut down all of the trees in a rainforest. Several\nnations will be holding a meeting in order to make a decision on what they\nshould do about the current environmental laws. They need your help!\nYou will be working with a team of four people and have been hired as\nresearchers. Your group's job is to research a threatened and an endangered\nspecie. You will then develop an information board and a short\npresentation about your findings. You will also make a suggestion about\nour current environmental laws.\n\nNational Science Education Standards, Standard 3, Physical Science,\ngrades Pre-K-4: Science subject matter focuses on the science facts, concepts,\nprinciples, theories, and models that are important for all students to know,\nunderstand, and use - Characteristics of organisms, Life cycles of organisms,\nOrganisms and environments.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of this WebQuest is to help the students understand why species\nin our world become threatened, endangered, and eventually, extinct. They\nstudents will be able to see evidence of this happening, explain why, and\nexplain what can be done\nto prevent a species from becoming extinct.\n\nPreceding\/Ensuing Events\n\nPrior to the WebQuest activity, the students will be introduced to\nenvironmental issues that our world faces today. The teacher will discuss\nbasic terminology that the students will encounter on their quest and introduce\nseveral species that are on the endangered list. The teacher will also\ndiscuss the difference between thriving, threatened, endangered and extinct\nspecies.\n\nFollowing this activity, the students will continue studying environmental\nissues. The teacher will introduce ways that they can help locally.\nThe students will write a letter to their local newspaper explaining their\nopinion on environmental laws and why they should or should not be changed.\n\nDebriefing\n\nThis activity will help the students gain knowledge about\nthreatened and endangered species. The students will begin to understand how their\neveryday actions can make a difference in the environment. This activity will\nalso help improve the student's research skills and critical thinking skills, and\nhow to work in a team environment.\n\nImproved\/Expanded\n\nThis WebQuest could be expanded by having the students research a thriving\nspecie and explain why it is thriving versus a threatened or endangered specie.\nThis WebQuest could also be expanded by adding a scavenger hunt that would\ninclude such items as environmental issues, ways to help\nthe environment, and interesting facts about different species.\n\nEach group will research a threatened and a endangered specie.\nYour group needs to decide what two species you will be researching. Each\nmember in the group will help with the research and answer several questions about their species. Each member of the\ngroup will also help in preparing an information board and participate in an\noral report. The information board should include facts about each specie,\na picture of the species, and the group suggestion on change to the\ncurrent environmental laws, if any.\n\nFor Each Group to Answer\n\n1. What is the name of your\nspecie?\n\n2. What is the scientific name\nof your specie?\n\n3. Tell us what your specie\nlooks like.\n\n4. What part of the world does\nit live in?\n\n5.

What are its breeding\nhabits?\n\n10. How does it protect\nitself?\n\n11. Should our current\nenvironmental laws be changed? Why or why not?\n\nAdditional Questions\n\nThreatened: Why is this\nspecie considered a threatened specie? What are we doing to protect\nit? Can anything else be done? Do you think it will become\nextinct? Why or why not?\n\nEndangered: Why is this\nspecie considered endangered? What are we doing to protect it? Can\nanything else be done? Do you think it will become extinct? Why or\nwhy not?\n\nAfter your group has researched its specie, it is now time to put it alltogether. First, prepare your\ninformation board. Remember, when making your information board, be\ncreative. You can do this by making your information board colorful;\ninclude lots of pictures or drawings, but do not forget to include the\nfacts.\n\nYour next step will be to prepare\nfor your oral presentation. As a group, you will need to decide what each\nperson is going to say. Remember, everyone has to participate in the group\npresentation. We will have a practice session during class. In order\nto do a good job you will also need to practice on your own. You can do\nthis by practicing at home with a family member.\n\nWhere and How to Start\n\n1.

You may\nchoose your species however you like. If you are having problems deciding\nor finding a species to research Click here\nfor suggestions. Once you start your research, you will need to keep track of all\nthe information you gather in your specie folder. Each group will find a\nspecie folder at their group workstation.\n\n2. Once you have chosen your\nspecie, you will need to begin your research on the Internet. Don't forget\nthat you will need to keep track of where you find your information. For\nthe Internet, you will need to write down the web address.\n\n3. Once you have finished\ngathering your information, your group will begin working on the information\nboard.\n\n4. After your group has\ncompleted the information board, the group will need to get together and write a\nrough draft of what each person will say in the group presentation. This\nwill be handed in to the teacher. The teacher will read the rough draft and\nthen make suggestions on how you might want to enhance your presentation.\n\n5. At home, each person will\npractice their part of the presentation.\n\n6. A practice session will be\nheld in class.\n\n7.

{"text":"Dominican International School\nSCIENCE\nCourse Syllabus\nSY 2010 - 2011\nGrade Level: 2\nTeacher: Ms. Estrellita Santos\nTEXT: McGraw\u2014Hill Science\nCourse Description\nStudents are actively engaged in exploring how the world works by observing,\ncounting, collecting, measuring, comparing, and asking questions. They begin to\nidentify parts of an object and recognize how these parts interact with the whole. In\nGrade 2, students use numbers for computing, estimating, naming, measuring, and\ncommunicating specific information. They use evidence to explain how or why\nsomething happens. Students begin to understand plant and animal interactions and\nprocesses as well as the changes on Earth. The students, as scientists, should have\nhands\u2013on, active experiences throughout the instruction of the science curriculum.\nTeaching Strategies\nLearning is an active process resulting from hands and minds on explorations in\nwhich learners construct their own knowledge. It is mainly in Science that every\nindividual student has the biggest opportunity to learn at their own pace and in their\nown unique ways of learning and exploring things around them.\nTeachers find out what students know, and use literature, photographs, real\nobjects, a demonstration or a \u2015hands-on\u2016 activity to introduce a concept, and to set up\na problem to be explored. All facets of learning will be built and reinforced upon the\nexperiences provided by the activity.\nAt the end, students will apply their new understanding to real-world examples\nas teachers help students see science as part of technology, society, personal\nexperience and life in general. Receiving a case or real-life problem, students in the\nPBL environment were provided with more opportunity to think, to explore, and to\ndevelop needed skills in analyzing problems and identifying various learning\nresources.\nPositive Reinforcement applied in the classroom is an essential aspect of\nmanaging young learner classrooms, and has related implications for encouraging\nprogress.\nLearning how to work in a team environment is beneficial to students for\nproblem solving, working under the pressure of a time limit, and learning how to\nwork with others.\nStudent Activities\nDifferent kinds of activities, especially hands-on activities, allow for differences\namong students and learning styles. If the first exposure material is moved out of class,\nthe class activity can then change to group work, role paying, games, and group or\nclass discussion that can concentrate on particular problems or arising from the first\nexposure material or further depth of the content.\nAssessment\nStudents will be assessed with class participation, observation, homework, class\nwork, objective quizzes\/tests, oral responses, and quarterly exams. The student's final\ngrade will be computed mainly based on three parts: performance tasks (homework\nand class work), quizzes and quarterly exams.

{"text":"Discussing and Presenting Your Research Results\n\nIn this unit, students will learn how to produce meaningful posters and make oral presentations to communicate the results of their research project. Scientists need not only do research, but also present the results of that research to the scientific community, the public, and policymakers. There are several means of scientific communication \u2013 journal articles, oral presentations, and posters. Here, students communicate the results of their work in the form of a poster which they will present to a larger group of students, parents, the public, or scientists toward the end of the school year. If students have kept good notes and saved the results from each of the previous units, making the poster will mostly be about summarizing and communicating that information and thinking a bit more about what it means. The poster will include all the stages of the research project \u2013 from gathering the background information, to designing the project, to data analysis, and drawing conclusions from the work. This last stage is key and allows the students to see the transition from data \u2013 which are 'facts' or hard numbers \u2013 to interpretation, which can be more subjective and bring in scientific reasoning, judgment, and thinking about trade-offs. For example, for fish-based research, did the research provide any insight as to whether the health benefits of Omega-3s from fish offset the potential health risk of mercury toxicity? Do students feel the current fish consumption advisory is adequate based on their data? What would they do differently or what would they investigate next time? The assessment piece allows students to become peer reviewers for others' posters, teaching them the skills of constructive criticism."}
{"text":"Grades K-2: Science Lesson Plan\n\nStreams in the Sand\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nObserve and record the erosion of soil by water in a local area.\n\nDescribe the effects of erosion.\n\nTeacher Background:\n\nIn this lesson, students will explore how erosion can change the land. Erosion is the gradual change or destruction of land caused by water, wind, ice, and the pull of gravity. Erosion is a natural process, but can be worsened by human activities that remove soil stabilizing elements, such as plant roots. By exposing the soil, humans make it easier for erosion to occur. Erosion can have negative effects on aquatic environments, because it introduces a large number of soil particles into bodies of water, making the water cloudy, or turbid. Increasing the turbidity of waterways can make it difficult for fish and other aquatic life forms to survive. In this lesson, students will explore erosion of sand by water; in this case, the water causes the sand to erode very quickly. You may also wish to give students other examples of forces that cause erosion, like high winds and the movement of soil materials down a slope."}

{"text":"Earth and Science\n\nQuick Fact Before satellites, scientists used balloons to gather data about our Earth. In 1967, the GHOST (Global Horizontal Sounding Technique) balloon was launched from New Zealand. It stayed in the air for one year and circled the southern hemisphere 25 times. The balloon carried an electronics package that transmitted a radio signal in order to track the balloon and gather data for global weather forecasting.\n\nEarth presents scientists with a strange sort of challenge. It's our home, the one place we know best of all. At the same time, however, there are portions of our world that are as alien to us as Jupiter or Mars. One of the least studied parts of Earth lies in the upper atmosphere. With StratoStar, your students can join the ranks of scientists around the world in pioneering the exploration of the edge of space. They can study the sun as a star with an experiment that will get them closer to our sun than otherwise possible. They can test their theories on atmospheric properties with an experiment floating in the atmosphere itself. There's no limit to the Earth and space science concepts that your students can study.\n\nTurbulence - Just like an airplane, the payloads experience turbulence going through the jet stream.\n\nFlight Velocities - Payloads can travel up to 200 mph in the jet stream and fall at speeds of over 100 mph.\n\nYour students' Earth and space experiment in near-space will make use of these tools:\n\nPlug and play flight sensors\n\nTemperature\n\nPressure\n\nHumidity\n\nGeiger Counter\n\nAccelerometer\n\nGyroscope\n\nCameras\n\nVideo\n\nStill\n\nEarth and space science concepts that can be explored in near-space:\n\nInvestigating the Sun as a Star\n\nPrinciples of Gravity\n\nDeep space Cosmic Rays\n\nPlanetary Weather systems\n\nAtmospheric Properties\n\nTeaching basic theory?

{"text":"Search form\n\nMain menu\n\nYou are here\n\nDo you see what I see?\n\nLight, sight, and natural selection\n\nWith the driving question \"Do you see what I see?\" this unit encourages students to think about how our perception of color depends on both the environment and our brain. Focusing on science research conducted in Dr. Becky Fuller's lab, the unit addresses key science standards connected to animal behavior, natural selection, and systems biology. The curriculum is accompanied by web-based resources including virtual activities such as a virtual eye dissection and an \"Ask a Scientist\" interview with Becky Fuller.\n\nLesson 1: What do you see?\n\nThis introductory lesson serves to motivate the unit, \"Do you see what I see?\" by targeting individual differences in visual perception. Here, students begin to examine the driving question by probing the basics of visual perception. The lesson activities are used to foster interest in learning more about what and why students see what they do. Activities include a color sorting activity, discussions of optical illusions, eye dissections and a traditional colorblind test. These activities introduce information about how humans perceive contrast and color as well as the anatomy of the visual system. Students return to these ideas throughout the unit as they develop a response to the unit driving question.\n\nLesson 2: What color do you see?\n\nIn Lesson 2, students test how environmental conditions influence color perception with the simple task of sorting colored candies such as M&Ms. During this activity, students test how lighting and background color can change the speed and accuracy of M&M sorting. Students attempt to remove all the M&Ms of a certain color under varying conditions. This activity is an opportunity for teachers to address key concepts of how the eye works, how we perceive color, and how we differ in these perceptions. This lesson builds on ideas introduced in Lesson 1.\n\nLesson 3: Is seeing believing?\n\nBy using spectrophotometers and prisms to investigate the absorption, transmission, emission and reflection of light, students explore differences between their visual perceptions and the physical properties that contribute to these differences. This lesson builds on ideas introduced in Lesson 2 and allows students to build on physiological basis of vision introduced in Lesson 1 and extend understanding to the basic optical principles that underlie vision.\n\nLesson 4: Data Collection, Analysis and Experimental Design\n\nStudents have learned how their own experiences (Lesson One) and environment (Lesson Two and Three) influence their perception of color, and in this lesson, they will discuss whether the same principles apply to fish color preference. Students have already begun to think about color perception as a complicated neurological process. Part 1 of Lesson 4 begins to provide evidence for students to use to explain why this is the case.\n\nLesson 4 Part 1: Do fish have a favorite color?\n\nLesson 4 uses a \"penny-pecking\" experiment as an engaging central activity to examine why guppies might be used as a model for color preference. In Part 1 of Lesson 4, students examine color preferences of guppies in an experiment and discussion data to build on knowledge about human color perception gained from prior lessons. This initial experiment prepares students for discussions about the interactions between color and the environment in Part II of the lesson. Discussions of data collection and interpretation are fundamental to this lesson. Students come to a consensus about experimental design before working in groups to run the experiment. Students work to interpret compiled class data during a whole class discussion focused on making meaning from all of the experiments.\n\nLesson 4 Part 2: What color do fish see?\n\nUsing the penny-pecking protocols established in Part I of Lesson 4, students examine in Part II how the environment impacts color prefererencesif fish not unlike the influence of environment in Lesson 2. Using findings from Part I of this lesson, students devise an experiment to test how the environment can change pecking behaviors in guppies. In addition to building connections between humans and other organisms, the activity encourages students to draw on what they learned about optics and sensory physiology in Lesson 3. Moreover, students investigate how variations in optical properties of the external environment can lead to variations in an animal's visual perceptions and, consequently, its mating and food preferences. In addition, the concept of variability within biological populations is addressed. Part II of this lesson emphasizes the development, testing, evaluation and revision of a hypothesis based on prior knowledge and intuition developed from related experiments.\n\nLesson 5: Why do guppies have favorite colors? Why do they care?\n\nNatural and sexual selection of color preferences are the focus of Lesson 5. Students play a game that uses principles of selection to explain why guppies are attracted to certain colors. Students analyze different sensory and coloration biases that help fish to survive such as being able to find different colors of food or being camouflaged to avoid lurking predators. Students also explore how these biases can influence sexual competition; for example, brightly colored fish or those that have body coloration similar to preferred foods might be more attractive to mates. By playing the \"guppy game\", students observe adaptation to different environments and the evolution of sex differences and make hypotheses about the habitats that will favor certain traits. By simulating different populations of guppies under different circumstances students can observe genetic drift in populations over time. One key element of Lesson 5 is the generation of whole classroom data sets that will be analyzed as a class and individually, exposing students to various approaches for data interpretation and expression.\n\nLesson 6: Why can't I see what you see?\n\nIn this culminating lesson, students use the knowledge they learned in the previous lessons to make inferences about the significance of color perception in many species.

{"text":"Exploring Creation with Biology is a 9th grade high school biology curriculum written from a Christian and creationist perspective. This almost 600 page hefty hardbound text has 16 Modules:\n\nBiology: The Study of Life\n\nKingdom Monera\n\nKingdom Protista\n\nKingdom Fungi\n\nThe Chemistry of Life\n\nThe Cell\n\nCellular Reproduction and DNA\n\nMendelian Genetics\n\nEvolution: Part Scientific Theory, Part Unconfirmed Hypothesis\n\nEcology\n\nThe Invertebrates of Kingdom Animalia\n\nPhylum Arthropoda\n\nPhylum Chordata\n\nKingdom Plantae: Anatomy and Classification\n\nKingdom Plantae: Physiology and Reproduction\n\nReptiles, Birds, and Mammals\n\nAcknowledging that most homeschool parents aren't comfortable teaching biology, the authors explain why Exploring Creation with Biology is \"ideal for such parents.\" The text is written in an easy-to-understand style, and most of the experiments can be carried out with household or easily attainable materials. The authors are dedicated to helping parents and students use their materials. Help is available via phone, email, or regular mail or on their website.\n\nEach module is roughly 30 pages long and takes about 45-60 minutes a day for two weeks to complete (except for module six, which takes three weeks). However, there is no exact breakdown of what should be done in a day or a week's time. This is intentional, as the curriculum is meant to be flexible (in tune with homeschooling in general). If one wants more direction in figuring out how much to do each day, the website has some guidelines.\n\nHere is what a module looks like. The conversational text addresses the student and is interspersed with excellent quality photos and graphics. Vocabulary, including pronunciation, appears in bold print. About 15 to 20 \"On Your Own\" questions, highlighted in yellow, are also scattered throughout. These are to be answered by the student as he reads, and the answer (printed at the end of the module) is to be checked immediately. I would suggest putting a sticky-tab bookmark on the answer page for ease in flipping to this page while reading.\n\nThere are also several experiments in the module to be done as the student encounters them. It is recommended that the student keep an experiment notebook to aid in the learning process and also as a record to show evidence of having taken this class to prospective college admission boards.\n\nSpecialized lab equipment is available for purchase, including a microscope, a slide set, and a dissection kit with specimens. Although the experiments requiring these items are optional, they are beneficial to the student.\n\nEach module ends with a \"study guide\" or quiz. It functions as a review, and students may use the text in answering the questions. Answers are found in the corresponding Solutions and Tests book (sold separately).\n\nThe textbook concludes with a glossary and three appendices. The first one is \"A Simple Biological Key,\" which is a duplication of a table that appears on pages 21-23 of the text. It is a flow-chart of sorts for determining the biological classification of a particular lifeform. Appendix B contains summaries of all the modules. These are fill-in-the-blank sentences that the student is to write out completely rather than just fill in. Answers to these are in the Solutions and Tests book. The last appendix is a complete list of lab supplies, organized by module and type of experiment. Lastly, you will find what every good textbook should have--an index.\n\nThe Solutions and Tests book contains teacher's notes, solutions to the study guides, answers for selected experiments, answers to the module summaries in Appendix B, module tests and answers, and quarterly tests and answers. The teacher's notes explain the teaching philosophy of the course, the student assignments and experiments, and the recommended grading procedure.\n\nA style note on the text: the module breaks are not easily found by flipping through the book. Indeed, it seems to flow from module to module, except for a bolded \"MODULE #8\" at the top of the page. I think a colorful graphic at the top of the page or in the margin extending to the edge of the page would be helpful to students.\n\nExploring Creation with Biology is a complete, beautiful, God-glorifying biology curriculum highly worthy of consideration for your high school student.\n\nProduct review by Kathy Gelzer, The Old Schoolhouse\u00ae Magazine, LLC, August 2008"}

{"text":"A TOPS Teaching Model\n\nIf science were only a collection of explanations and facts, you could teach it with blackboard and chalk. You could require students to read chapters in a textbook, assign questions at the end of each chapter, and set periodic written exams to determine what they remember. In fact, science is traditionally taught this way, often to its detriment. Students all study the same information at the same time. Class togetherness is the model, even when some students are struggling with boredom while others are struggling to keep up.\n\nBut science is more than facts. It is also a process, a dynamic interaction of rational inquiry and creative play. Scientists probe, handle, observe, question, hypothesize, test ideas, jump to conclusions, make mistakes, revise, synthesize, communicate, disagree and discover. Students can understand science as process only if they are free to think and act like scientists, in an environment that recognizes and respects individual differences.\n\nScience is both a traditional body of knowledge and an individualized process of creative inquiry. Science as process cannot ignore tradition. We build upon the achievements of those who have gone before. If each generation had to reinvent the wheel, there would be no time to discover the stars. Nor can traditional science move forward without new inquiry. Without this moving boundary, science would be static, dry and dead.\n\nSo here is a teaching model that combines both the content and process of science into an integrated whole, always available for change. We encourage your to use it in your own teaching practice, to adapt it so it works best for you.\n\n1: Selection\n\nStudents will usually select lab pages in sequence, since new concepts generally build on previous ones. But allow for variations: students might skip a lesson that is not challenging, or repeat a lab with doubtful results, or design an experiment to answer their own questions.\n\n2: Orientation\n\nAny student with basic reading skills can successfully interpret our thoughtfully designed instructions. If your class is new to TOPS, your students may not be accustomed to following directions by themselves or trusting their own problem-solving ability. When students ask you for help, first ask them to read what they don't understand. If they didn't read carefully the first time, this will usually clear up the confusion. Identify poor readers; when they ask, \"What does this mean?\" they may be asking in reality, \"Will you please read these directions aloud?\" Creating lab teams with at least one good reader is one way to boost independent work.\n\nCertain other concepts and skills may also be needed to complete some labs. Measuring length, for example, requires that students be able to use a ruler. Preview the lessons you'll use so you can anticipate and teach requisite concept and skills (if any) at the start of each class period. Primary students will need the most introductory support. Secondary students may need none at all.\n\n3: Investigation\n\nStudents work through the labs independently and cooperatively. If lessons are open-ended, they may decide upon their own experimental strategies. Encourage independence by helping your students only after they have tried to help themselves. You work as a resource, staying out of the center of attention, responding to questions rather than asking them.\n\nTo help students pace themselves as part of a cohesive group, announce well in advance when individualized study will end. Expect a frenzy of activity as the deadline approaches. While slower students finish the core activities you specify, challenge more advanced students with extension activities, or suggest they design original experiments.\n\n4: Write-up\n\nActivity pages ask students to explain the how and why of things. Answers may be brief and to the point, with the exception of those that require creative writing. Students may accelerate their pace by completing these reports outside of class.\n\nWhether students are working alone or in teams, each should prepare an original write-up, and bring it to you for approval. Avoid an avalanche of written work near the end of the unit by following a simple rule: each write-up must be approved before starting the next activity.\n\n5: Check Point\n\nStudent and teacher together evaluate each write-up on a pass\/no-pass basis. No time is wasted haggling over grades. If effort is consistent with individual ability, check off the lab on a progress chart. Students can keep these in notebooks, or in individual assignment folders kept on file in class.\n\nFace-to-face evaluations are efficient and effective. A few moments of your personal time has a greater impact than tedious margin notes that devour your evenings, and that kids may neither understand nor heed. You don't have to point out every error. Focus on particular weaknesses. If reasonable effort is not evident, request specific improvements and a follow-up check.\n\n6: Science Conference\n\nIndividualized study has ended. This is a time for students to come together, to discuss experimental results, to debate and draw conclusions. Slower students learn about the enrichment activities of faster classmates. Those who did original investigations or made unusual discoveries share this information with their peers, just like scientists at a real conference.\n\nThis conference is an opportunity to expand ideas, explore relevancy, and integrate subject areas. Consider bringing in films, news articles, and community speakers. This is a meaningful time to investigate the technological and social implications of the topic you are studying. Make it an event to remember.\n\n7: Review\n\nDoes your school have an adopted science textbook? Do parts of your science syllabus still need to be covered? Now is the time to integrate traditional science resources into your overall program. Your students already share a common background of hands-on investigation, and can now read the text with greater understanding, think and problem-solve more successfully, communicate more effectively.\n\nYou might dedicate just a day to review, or an entire week. Finish with a review of major concepts in preparation for the final exam. Our review\/test questions are a fine platform for discussion and study.\n\n8: Exam\n\nUse any combination of our review\/test questions and questions of your own to determine how well students have mastered the concepts they've been learning.\n\nNow that your class has completed a TOPS learning cycle, it's time to start a new topic. Those who messed up or fell behind don't have to stay there. Everyone begins again on an equal footing.\n\nDIARY OF A TOPS TEACHER\n\nThe day before:\n\nTomorrow school starts. I feel anxiety, but a nice sense of anticipation as I check that everything in my classroom is in good order. I've duplicated 32 copies each of the first few lessons in this TOPS unit. Each lesson sits in a numbered manilla folder on my desk. Hmm, I'll remember to bring a big box and a brick tomorrow \u2014 a \"filing cabinet\" for these and my students' work folders.\n\nWhat did I ever do before I discovered this organizing trick? Now I staple a page of graph paper inside the cover of each folder, and label it with a student's name. It's so easy to check off labs as we work through each unit. Their folders will become portfolios of the work they've completed.\n\nTomorrow I'll surprise the kids with their first lab page, and their folders. I'll show them the simple supplies laid out on the table in back, and suggest they get busy! This feels good. I haven't ever been quite so prepared.\n\nDay 10:\n\nMy class is humming along. Or maybe buzzing better describes this state of orderly confusion. I'm thrilled (and maybe a little exhausted) staying ahead of all the activity. Students have questions and problems \u2014 not all of them have learned yet to actually read the instructions before thinking they're stuck. Still, the lab pages set them in a clear direction. They know where they are and where they need to go.\n\nIt's exciting to see the kids come into the room and get straight to work where they left off the day before. Sometimes I have to pry them away from their investigations, even after calling for cleanup time. And when I ask the slower kids to assign themselves homework to catch up, some of them actually do it!\n\nThe assignment folders are working well, too. Kids point with pride at the growing list of check points on their progress charts, at the deepening layers of lab pages, data and write-ups. They are genuinely taking responsibility for their own accomplishments, and feeling more confident daily.\n\nDay 15:\n\nTwo lab teams have been competing. Today they have completed all 20 labs. Most of the others have at least a few labs to go. Since we have only three more days to devote to individualized activity, I'll choose three \"key concept\" labs for the slower students to complete. A couple of my most capable students asked if they could devise some experiments of their own. The others who have finished early can work on a few extensions suggested in the TOPS book. I'll ask whether any are interested in becoming coaches for the kids who are straggling.\n\nThe whole class is working hard to complete the labs. They know how much they finish will determine part of their grades, which will be weighted equally on number of lessons completed, attitude, and the exam.\n\nDay 18:\n\nAn easy day! Several students will report on their original investigations, then I've scheduled a video on the broader implications (practical applications) of this topic. On Friday we'll finish with an exam.\n\nKids are really involved \u2014 and so far, nobody has gotten bored, slacked off, or stirred up trouble. They're already bugging me about their grades. And asking what topic we'll be doing next! I have a couple of tempting topics in mind. Maybe I'll let them decide!\n\nI'm smiling as I write. Four weeks into the school year, and I'm eager for more. The students keep me hopping, for sure, but they are so engaged! Activity-centered teaching seems natural, effective. I respond to student questions, not the other way around. I've never had a teaching experience this satisfying."}

When the environment changes, some plants and animals survive and reproduce, and others die or move to new locations.\nAll organisms cause changes in the environment where they live. Some are detrimental, whereas others are beneficial.\nHumans change environments in ways that can be either beneficial or detrimental for themselves and other organisms.\n\nThe Characteristics of Organisms (K-4) Organisms have basic needs. They can survive only in environments in which their needs can be met.\n\nPopulations and Ecosystems (5-8) Populations of organisms can be categorized by the function they serve in an ecosystem. Food webs identify the relationships among producers, consumers, and decomposers in an ecosystem.The number of organisms an ecosystem can support depends on the resources available. Lack of resources and other factors, such as predation and climate, limit the growth of populations in the ecosystem.\n\nDiversity and Adaptations of Organisms (5-8) Extinction of a species occurs when the environment changes and the adaptive characteristics of a species are insufficient to allow its survival.\n\nContent Standard F: Changes in Environments (K-4) Changes in environments can be natural or influenced by humans. Pollution is a change in the environment that can influence the health, survival, or activities of organisms, including humans."}

Student groups will be responsible for making decisions about activities that may impact global climate. Students will be able to identify the various human impacts on the environment. Students will be able to explain how lifestyles may be altered to become more favorable to the environment. Students will examine the role of individual decisions and their impact on the natural environment.\n\nThis activity explores the potential for climate variability and change to trigger more frequent occurrences of El Nino, and the impacts that could result. Students will access information at remote sites using telecommunications. Students will identify impacts by reviewing past El Nino events. Students will analyze the data collected and predict what the consequences could be if, as some scientists predict, climate variability and change could create a permanent El Nino.\n\nStudents will be introduced to the concept of climate change and the greenhouse effect. Students will learn the common sources of greenhouse gas emissions that humans generate. Students will create a Global Warming Wheel Card which will enable them to see how their own actions generate greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to global warming. Students will learn ways that they might reduce their individual, family, school and community's production of these gases.

Author(s): No creator set physiology of the diving response can be studied in the laboratory, but investigating the behaviour of a diving mammal in its natural environment can be more of a problem. However, modern physiological techniques have made it possible to record continuously physiological variables (such as heart rate) and information on depth and position during the spontaneous dives in the wild that are part of the animal's normal behaviour. Most such findings show that the majority of an animal's dives the valencies in Table 1 have just been numbers that we use to predict the formulae of compounds. But in the case of covalent substances they can tell us more. In particular, they can tell us how the atoms are linked together in the molecule. This information is obtained from a two-dimensional drawing of the structural we have represented the electronic state of an atom as a collection of sub-shells. Now we turn to the states of the electrons within those sub-shells. Just as shells can be broken down into sub-shells, so sub-shells can be broken down into atomic orbitals. Each atomic orbital describes an allowed spatial distribution about the nucleus for an electron in the sub-shell. Here we shall only be concerned with their number.\n\nConsider the formula for the sub-shell electron capac idea that everything that we can see is an assembly of tiny particles called atoms is chemistry's greatest contribution to science. There are about 120 known kinds of atom, and each one is distinguished by a name, by a chemical symbol, and by a number called the atomic number. The meaning of atomic number is best understood from the Rutherford model of the atom provide you with a detailed understanding of some of the important problems and topics that are being studied by the chemists of today, and of the ways in which associated problems might be solved by chemical methods.

It can also be used to manipulate atoms and even to promote chemical reactions between specific atoms.

{"text":"Using Minnesota's Changing Climate in your educational setting\n\nMinnesota's Changing Climate was created with the following goals in mind:\n\nTo build awareness and interest in:\n\nMinnesota's natural environment\n\nThe impact of climate change\n\nTo provide educators and students with the tools necessary for active and lifelong stewardship.\n\nRecognizing the time constraints and standards-based school environment that exists today, WSF developed these six lessons to make them as useful as possible to educators. They are aligned to Minnesota State Science and Literacy Standards, as well as the Climate Literacy Principles. It is not meant to provide students with an in-depth introduction to the science of climate change, but rather as a review if they have studied it before, or an introduction if it is a new issue. For educators interested in providing students with a more in-depth study of climate change, our Grades 3-5 and Grades 6-12 Global Warming 101 Lessons provide this opportunity and can be downloaded for free at \n\nThis set of lessons will be most effective when used in their entirety, including the \"Journal Connection\" and \"Take It Outside-Connecting With Your Place\" sections, in conjunction with the online classroom. That said, these lessons could be used in a variety of educational settings. It can also follow a variety of different timelines such as over an intense week of study or once a week over the course of a month and a half. The following suggestions might be helpful when developing your plan of implementation for Minnesota's Changing Climate, but we also trust that as an educator you are the experts and will change and adapt lessons best for your situation. We would love to hear how you are using the curriculum in your classroom or school. Please share your stories, photos or videos with us.\n\nDocument, document, document\n\nThe first lesson of this curriculum is about starting a journal and includes examples of different ways of documenting and reflecting. This lesson was deliberately developed with the idea that a journal, science notebook or blog can provide students with an excellent means to practice reflection, observation and synthesis of information. In addition, if used throughout the implementation of this curriculum, the final product can provide educators with a great assessment of student learning.\n\nTeach Across the Curriculum\n\nSome schools work in team settings with different educators taking on different subject areas. While this is the norm in middle and high school, it can occur in elementary classrooms as well. If possible, break apart the lessons between educators or subject area teaching time, and emphasize the relevant content.\n\nFor example:\n\nLesson 1: What is a journal for?\nThis lesson is obviously well aligned with any English\/language arts course; however, many science classes have begun using science notebooks, and an art class could work on creating the stylistic\/graphic design. In addition, it could be possible to set up a blog for each or your students, putting an emphasis on technology skills.\n\nLesson 2: What defines Minnesota's biomes?\nThis lesson could fit well with life science, environmental science, earth science and physical geography, depending on what content you wanted to emphasize.\n\nLesson 3: What defines Minnesota's climate?\nEarth science, life science and math could address this lesson.\n\nLesson 4: What is climate change and what does it mean for Minnesota?\nAlthough this lesson presents students with climate science information, there is a big emphasis on communicating the information that would work well in any English or public speaking course or unit.\n\nLesson 5: What does the data show?\nThis lesson is very data- and graph-focused and therefore would work well with any earth science or life science unit focused on interpretation of information. It could also be used and extended in a math course.\n\nLesson 6: What can I do?\nSome schools have volunteer or service learning staff that might be able or interested in facilitating this lesson. Bringing together all the staff that participated, and making this the assessment for students that have completed this unit would also be an exciting possibility. Finally, students may be able to take on this part in an after-school setting through an environmental club.\n\nWe really mean it when we say \"Take It Outside!\"\n\nThe \"Take It Outside\u2014Connecting with Your Place\" section of each lesson is not meant to be an extension, but rather an integral part of each lesson. Connecting students with the biome in which they live and providing them with the skills to be eyewitnesses to the changing climate we live in is an important goal of this project. Not only do we think this is important, but research shows that getting students outside daily is beneficial not only to their health, but their ability to perform in school. (See  Suggestions of how to \"Take it Outside\" with your classroom include:\n\nMake an outing to your schoolyard once a week throughout the entire year to observe the same area and record changes in a journal or science notebook.\n\nSelect a weather reporter each day that records the temperature, precipitation, etc. as well as researches weather history via the Internet or an almanac. Record in the classroom and use data for different graphing exercises and compare year to year.\n\nAsk students to select an area to observe near their home and make weekly observations in a journal or science notebook.\n\nUse the Online Classroom\n\nThe Online Classroom designed in conjunction with this curriculum is a fantastic way to bring some of the content alive in the classroom in a educator-facilitated setting. Ideally, students will be introduced to the classroom and given time to explore it at school. Additional opportunities for assessment are available through the classroom, and if your students have the Internet available at home, exploring pieces of the classroom could be integrated as homework. We highly encourage educators and students to share what they have learned through this curriculum, and the online classroom is a place where students and educators can upload photos of their biome, journal entries and other observations, as well as see what other schools around the state are doing.\n\nDo an Action Project\n\nClimate change can be overwhelming and frightening. Students should understand the consequences and impacts of climate change in Minnesota, but then be offered the opportunity to discuss and learn about potential solutions. Facilitating a discussion of possible action projects, rather than selecting one for students to do, will make students feel more involved and empowered, as well as provide educators with a good assessment of what the students have learned and how much they have connected the causes of climate change with possible actions."}

Decide, with your students, which meridian line will be the Prime Meridian and which parallel will be the Equator. Mark them as 0 degree and then plot the meridians and parallels on either side on degrees of your choice. You can use construction paper numbers stapled to a suspended ceiling or hung from it, whatever seems to work the best. After the ceiling as been given its grid system, have students plot the coordinates where they sit, where the desk is, where various objects in the room are located. If the coordinates were given to an extra terrestrial to probe for a good idea of what your classroom was like, what coordinates and how many would have to be given?

But that's changing: 2013 brings us two comets, Pan-STARRS and ISON, and both may be visible to the unaided eye.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Comet Pan-STARRS<\/strong><br \/>\nThe first, comet Pan-STARRS, will be observable from the Northern Hemisphere in March, having already beguiled sky watchers in the southern half of our planet. Prime viewing days are predicted to be March 12 and 13. You'll need a clear view of the western horizon away from light pollution. Look for the comet at twilight, low on the horizon and not far from the sliver of the moon.<\/p>\n<p>You should see a bright point of light (predicted to be as bright as the stars in the Big Dipper) with a fuzzy tail pointing straight up\u2014although you'll likely need binoculars to see the tail. For comet enthusiasts, the chance to see a comet \"naked eye\" is a thrill\u2014and a notable experience for anyone\u2014but binoculars are a good idea nonetheless. As the month progresses and Pan-STARRS moves farther from the sun, it will become increasingly difficult to see, even with binoculars or a small telescope. But in April, it may be visible in the northern sky during the night.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Comet ISON<\/strong><br \/>\nIf Pan-STARRS is exciting, ISON could be breathtaking. It's a large comet and a \"sungrazer\" as well. On November 28 it will pass within about 600,000 miles (1,000,000 km) from the surface of the sun\u2014which, as cometary orbits go, is quite close. It's possible that it will be as bright as the moon, visible even during the day. And a huge tail to awe nighttime spectators may make it \"the comet of the century\" as some folks have already dubbed it.<\/p>\n<p>But ISON's close approach to the sun courts danger as well as glory. The sun's radiation and tidal forces have completely shattered comets that ventured too near. If ISON leaves the solar atmosphere unscathed, however, it will be seen for months in the Northern Hemisphere's night sky.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Comets: The Basics <\/strong><br \/>\nThe body of a comet, called the <em>nucleus,<\/em> is a mixture of dust particles, water ice, and ices of several gases. Comets travel around the sun in orbits that are mostly highly elliptical. If they near the sun, the solar heat releases gas and dust from the nucleus, which form a large temporary cloud, called the <em>coma,<\/em> around it. Solar radiation can push dust away from the coma, while the solar wind can push gases in a slightly different direction, creating tails that can extend for millions of miles.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where Comets Come From<\/strong><br \/>\nAn immense number of comets reside in the outer reaches of the solar system\u2014in the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud\u2014but only a few of them ever come our way. Of those that do, many show up only once in thousands or millions of years. Comets Pan-STARRS and ISON are both first-time visitors. Others are frequent guests of the inner solar system such as Halley's comet, which appears, on average, every 76 years, and Encke's comet, which goes around the sun about every 3 years.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why Comets Matter<\/strong><br \/>\nApart from the spectacular light show that a great comet provides, comets are scientifically important. Scientists think that comets were formed during our solar system's birth. Inhabiting the frigid fringes of the solar system, far from the sun and immune to the evolutionary changes that the earth and other planets have experienced, they may well contain the best-preserved record of our solar system's beginnings.<\/p>\n<p>But that's not all. A current study (published in the <em>Astrophysical Journal<\/em> March 10, 2013) has found that biological compounds can develop in space.

Amusement Park Physics was inspired by the Annenberg Learner series, The Mechanical Universe, and answers the question, \"How do physics laws affect amusement park ride design?\"\n\nAmusement Park Physics Subject: Science Grade Level: 9-12\nIn this interactive game, players are tasked with building a conceptual roller coaster using physics concepts that help design real roller coasters. At the amusement park, players also learn why bumper cars are a good way to look at Newton's second and third laws of motion, and why people get sick on rides.\n\nSports are a hit with kids both on the field and in the classroom. Teachers can bring the ball play inside with these engaging resources from KQED in PBS LearningMedia. Here are two great resources that connect baseball to physics. Take a swing at connections between your curriculum and baseball.\nBelow are two of the top resources California educators are cheering for.\n\nThe Physics of Baseball\nIn this video, adapted from QUEST, two scientists from San Francisco Bay Area institutions break down a few of the many different ways that baseball is a great way to learn about the physics of motion and energy, including aerodynamics and vibrations.\n\nAnatomy of a Homerun\nUse this resource to investigate the basic physics principles behind the techniques used by baseball players, understand how and why a curve ball curves, and gain information on the physics of hitting a ball.\n\nTo respond to the Do Now, you can comment below or tweet your response.

What would you change about how today's bicycles are designed? Share your thoughts and stories.\n\nIntroduction\n\nLearning to ride a bicycle is a strong memory from many of our childhoods. Bicycles have been around since the 1800s, although their design has changed from the earliest models. The Draisienne is one of the earliest two-wheeled machines. Made out of wood, it had two wheels of the same size mounted in a frame and handle bars to steer. There were no pedals, so people pushed themselves along with their feet.\n\nThe next model to come along was the Velocipede or Boneshaker in the 1860s. It was similar to the Draisienne, however it had pedals added to the front wheel. The wheels were still made of wood, and later metal. This bicycle earned its name \"Boneshaker\" from the movement riders received when pedaling over the cobblestone roads present during that time.\n\nTo respond to the Do Now, you can comment below or tweet your response.

{"text":"Click Here to see a PowerPoint containing an overview of the GEMS program and its educational effectiveness.\n\nGEMS is a leading resource for innovative science and mathematics education. Developed at the Lawrence Hall of Science, the public science education center at the University of California at Berkeley, and tested in thousands of classrooms nationwide, over 70 GEMS Teacher's Guides and Handbooks offer a wide range of supplementary learning experiences for preschool through 8th grade.\n\nGEMS Teacher's Guides\n\nGEMS Teacher's Guides are clearly organized, easy to use, and do not require special background in math or science. Each classroom session is outlined with an overview, materials list, and preparation requirements, followed by clear, step-by-step directions. Complete background information is provided for the teacher, along with photographs, illustrations, and often examples of student work. Throughout each guide there are comments on presentation strategies and practical advice to help the teacher, many of them suggested by teachers who tested the units.\n\nGEMS Development and Testing Process\n\nGEMS units are subject to rigorous local and national field testing. Initially, activities are mined from the enormous wealth of classes and programs developed at the Lawrence Hall of Science over the last 30 years. GEMS authors begin by testing potential units of activities in local classrooms. After these early classroom tests, the activities are revised by a group of curriculum developers. The unit is then typically classroom tested by 25 local teachers in diverse urban and rural settings. Feedback from the local trials is used to again revise the unit. Next, a National Trial Version is sent to sites across the country for a third round of testing. The data from these national trials is compiled and final revisions are made to the teacher's guide. Even after publication, GEMS units are revised and updated to incorporate feedback as more teachers use them in the field.\n\nGEMS units are widely known to be engaging and motivating for students. One of the central goals in the development and testing process is to maximize the interest and participation of all students. Captivating the imagination of students by challenging them is a strong emphasis of the GEMS approach. Students come away feeling that they can be successful at math and science. High student interest increases the quality of their learning and the likelihood that they will continue to study science.\n\nAll Teachers Can Be Successful with GEMS\n\nThe extensive classroom testing and review process deepens the educational content of each unit and ensures that all teachers can be successful presenting the activities. Due to their accessibility and rich content, GEMS units serve as exemplars to teachers, encouraging them to incorporate more inquiry-based learning into their teaching. GEMS units are frequently used as models in preservice and educational methods courses.\n\nGEMS Activities Utilize Readily Accessible Materials\n\nMost of the materials needed for GEMS units are everyday materials that can be either collected or purchased inexpensively. Certain materials can also be ordered from sources whose names and addresses are listed in the guides. All of the GEMS guides include session-by-session listings of materials required. In addition GEMS has published the GEMS Kit Builder's Handbook to assist teachers in kit-building and maintenance."}
{"text":"Operation: Monster Storms! Even the title sounds exciting! But wait until you see what The JASON Project, a unique nonprofit subsidiary of National\nGeographic, has to offer your students in the form of middle-school science curriculum designed to ignite a spark for learning about our world. The JASON Project was founded by Dr. Robert Ballard, whose discovery of the RMS Titanic generated thousands of letters from students who wanted to join his expeditions. Dr. Ballard saw the potential to engage students in learning science by providing them with access to experts in the field of science. If he could help create a passion for science and provide excellent materials to learn and apply that learning, the potential for the next generation of scientists would be exciting. In addition to being a subsidiary of National\nGeographic, The JASON Project also partners with NASA, NOAA, the U.S. Department of Energy, and other organizations to bring cutting-edge resources to students.\n\nThe Mission Center on their website,  serves as the launching pad to access the myriad activities. There are three core units, Operation:\nMonster Storms! (Exploring the Powerful Forces of Weather), Operation:\nResilient Planet (Protecting Our Ecological Future), and Operation:\nInfinite Potential (Restructuring the Energy Portfolio). All three units are available in their entirety on The JASON Project website, and, by the way, complete access to all of the materials online is free! All of the print materials are online, as well as the videos, lab sheets, activities, games, additional resources, etc. Or you can purchase a print copy of the curriculum ($24.99 for an Individual Student Edition workbook, $29.99 for an Individual DVD with all of the videos for the curriculum, or $80.27 for the Teacher Pack which includes the Student Edition workbook, the DVD, and a Teacher Edition of the workbook). While you are checking out the Core Curriculum, don't forget to explore the website for some of the other great resources, such as continuing education for science teachers, podcasts, Web casts, interactive computer games, and live chat sessions. And don't even get me started on the Argonaut program, where students and teachers spend time doing research with experts in their fields.\n\nThe JASON Project encompasses many avenues for learning that would require much more than this humble review to present, so I will focus on the print materials for one of the three available units, Operation:\nMonster Storms! After reviewing these materials, my family will never look at weather the same way again! The 118-page Student Edition workbook is just what you would expect from a marriage of National\nGeographic and a group of scientists who want to get kids excited about science! The book is filled with stunning full-color photographs, charts, graphs, and visual displays of every type to make the materials come alive. Illustrations guide the student to a deeper understanding of weather processes and keep kids engaged in learning. The materials are written at a middle-school level but could easily be adapted for younger or older students, especially using the extensive additional resources and materials in the Teacher Edition. Each unit is geared toward a five- to nine-week period, but it could be condensed or extended depending on your needs. The focus is on hands-on learning and using critical thinking skills to understand and apply the information to real-life situations. Operation:\nMonster Storms! is broken into five Missions, with an expert in the field guiding the students through the materials in each Mission. The DVD includes background information on the unit and each of the scientists, as well as the Argonaut students who participated in that unit. There are also Mission Briefings and various materials related to each particular Mission. After receiving the briefing, students read the materials and conduct experiments to apply their learning. Detailed instructions explain how to conduct each experiment. Lab kits are available for each unit, although the materials needed are generally common household items. Lab sheets and various worksheets are all available online so that students can keep track of their data and analyze what they have learned. The Teacher Edition contains a tremendous amount of additional material, so you do not need to have any prior experience to effectively teach these units. Online, there are even more wonderful Teacher Resources, including a Lesson Builder and Assignment Manager, Online Reporting, and an Assessment Builder, as well as links to additional resources. All of the units are aligned to National Science Education Standards and all state science standards.\n\nThe impressive list of awards, including the 2008 SIIA (Software & Information Industry Association) CODiE Award for Best Online Instructional Solution, and the 2008 Tech and Learning Award of Excellence, speaks for itself. But let me give a quick review of my family's impressions of The JASON Project. We were extremely impressed with the overall goal of the project, to \"connect to great explorers and great events.\" Isn't that really part of the passion of many of us as homeschoolers? We want to make history, literature, science, etc., come alive for our students and provide them with meaningful ways to understand their world. The staff that I spoke to from The JASON Project and the scientists on the DVDs were all passionate about helping kids learn and get excited about science. Another steady refrain was the importance of understanding extreme weather forces to save lives and property, thus showing kids that the concepts they are learning have applicability to the real world. We were also impressed with the high quality of the materials that would definitely help kids stay engaged and learn about the incredible forces of our weather. There is something here for every learning style, and these units would be excellent on their own or as part of a unit study. Everything that you need is already prepared and available in the books and online. There are extensive search options and teacher resources, making our job easier and allowing us to provide more in-depth learning or just pick and choose the needed materials. There are a few brief references to evolutionary ideas (such as millions of years and ancestral hominids), although these were certainly not prominent.\n\nI think the toughest decisions families will face with The JASON Project are which amazing unit to use first, and whether to use the materials online for free or purchase the beautiful print copies. Try not to get lost in these wonderful resources and spend a year on each unit, as this would be easy to do. My one complaint is that there are only three units available! I would love to see The JASON Project expanded to a full middle school, or even high school, science curriculum!"}

Lesson Set-Up and Management\n\nMaterials:\n\nThe living materials must have arrived for you to complete this\nlesson. In Appendix E, there are directions for care of all three of the\nliving organisms.\n\nIf you want students to pick up their own Volvox, you may want to\ndivide the specimen into more than one container for quicker\ndistribution.\n\nMake sure the students and teacher use a clean dropper for picking\nup the Volvox.\n\nThis student used the observation\norganizer to write about Volvox.\nThe organizer can be found at\nsciencenotebooks.org.\n\nStudent Management:\n\nMake sure students do not pick up their microscopes during the rest\nof the unit, while looking at their specimens. Everything will be in\nliquid. The specimen will slide off of the slide.\n\nStudents need to make sure they don't get too much of the liquid on\ntheir slide. When they adjust the focus, they may get it wet. Students\nwould then need to use a lens cleaner to dry it off.\n\nStudents should have a drawing and observations in their notebook.\nHave a circle pattern available to them to trace. This gives them a\nplace to draw the organism to scale. They can write their observations\nbeside it.\n\nVolvox are the slowest of the living organisms they will be looking\nat in this unit. If students are having trouble seeing or tracking the\nVolvox, provide them extra practice before going on to Blepharisma.\n\n4. Teacher Tips:\n\nInstead of having students read the information on Volvox first,\nhave a brief discussion about how observing something living might be\ndifferent from the nonliving things that they have observed in previous\nlessons. Students should have the experience of looking at the specimen\nbefore doing the reading.\n\nOnce students have their slide with Volvox, encourage them to try\nand see them with their naked eye. They are usually visible in the\nlight. If students don't see anything, you may need to get them a\ndifferent sample. (Their sample may only be liquid.)\n\nAfter students have made their observations and drawings, read the\nselection on Volvox together. Allow plenty of time for students to go\nback and make observations \u2013 trying to identify the properties and\nbehaviors of Volvox from the reading.\n\nMake sure you discuss how the Volvox travels (its flagella), and how\nit gets energy (the sun).\n\nThis is an example of a paste-in that\ncan be added to the students' notebooks.\nThis is a copy of a page on Volvox from the STC Discovery Deck.\n\n5.

So give kids the lowdown on how real scientists work. This engaging book shows you how to develop students' creative and critical thinking skills to make qualitative and quantitative observations, compare testable research questions and hypotheses, design an experiment, collect and analyze data, and present results and conclusions orally and in writing. In addition to handy reproducible pages, the book is packed with special features: an unusually large section on quantitative analysis and data interpretation, plenty of background for teachers inexperienced with statistics and data analysis, and a mix of both formative and summative assessment strategies.\n\nIdeas For Use\n\nThis curriculum is designed to be taught from beginning to end (Day 1 to Day 40).\nFor the teacher with limited time, however, we outline three \"Fast-Track\" options\non pages ix\u2013xi. Overall, the curriculum presents scientific inquiry skills in\na sequentially logical manner and creates opportunities for students to practice and apply the skills in a research project of their own.

Furthermore, it is great to find a program that requires very little tweaking. The authors' acknowledgement that some teachers will need to shorten the unit makes the book much more user friendly."}

{"text":"You are browsing the archive for climate change.\n\nTopic:\n\nIntroduce students to the importance of carbon and its cycling between the living and nonliving parts of the ecosystem and earth system.\n\nAudience:\n\nGrades 8 \u2013 12\n\nLength:\n\n20 to 45 minutes\n\nNJ State Standards:\n\n5.4.G \u2013 Biogeochemical cycles\n\nObjectives:\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\nModel the movement of carbon through different reservoirs.\n\nCompare and contrast fast and slow processes (short and long residence times) that move carbon.\n\nUnderstand that the path taken by an atom through a biogeochemical cycle is complex, not a circle, and provide an example of conservation of matter.\n\nPut processes such as photosynthesis and respiration in the larger context of biogeochemical cycling.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nStudents will take on the role of a carbon atom and record which reservoirs in the carbon cycle they visit. They will compare and contrast their trip with those of their classmates to discover information about sources and sinks, and residence times of the different reservoirs. Ocean processes are highlighted to allow the educator to define the biological pump and explain its importance to climate.\n\nBackground:\n\nUnderstanding the sources and sinks of atmospheric carbon dioxide is necessary to understanding the causes and consequences of climate change. The carbon cycle is complex, with many reservoirs both living and nonliving, each with a number of sources and sinks. To put the carbon cycle in the context of understanding climate change and the issues scientists are concerned with, we focus on the sinks of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and the fate of the carbon after it is removed from the atmosphere. As people burn fossil fuels for energy, large amounts of carbon dioxide are released into the atmosphere. This introduces a large source of both carbon, and a greenhouse gas. Scientists interested in the long term effects and possible outcomes of this source of greenhouse gas are interested in sinks that not only remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but provide a source of carbon to a reservoir with a long residence time. Understanding the connections between reservoirs, and the interaction between long and short residence times, is very helpful in understanding ongoing scientific research and its importance to concerns about climate change.\n\nProcedure:\n\nA. Print out the Carbon Cycle Game Dice (color or black and white, your choice):\n\nIt is helpful, but not necessary, to have more than one die for each station.\n\nB. Cut out the dice and crease along the lines between the faces.\n\nC. Tape the open edges together to make a cube.\n\nIt is helpful to weight the dice with a ball of scrap paper about the same size as the finished cube. Filled dice roll more easily than empty ones.\n\nD. Print out the Station Markers (color or black and white).\n\nE. Set up each station in a different location around the room. Each station should have:\n\n1. At least one die. (Duplicates are especially helpful for the Atmosphere and Surface Ocean stations; students will visit these often, and not having to wait in line to roll dice will make gameplay faster.)\n\n2. A station marker posted where students can easily see it once moving around the room.\n\n3. A cup filled with the corresponding color of beads.\n\nF. Cut lengths of string or lanyard for each student and knot one end.\n\nII. Activity\n\nA. Review with students why carbon is so important (to biology, and climate).\n\nB. Tell students they are going to pretend to be a carbon atom moving through the carbon cycle. Review the water cycle as a familiar concept, and introduce terms such as reservoir, source, and sink using the water cycle as an example.\n\nC. Go over what reservoirs will be included in the carbon cycle game.\n\nNote for students that there are many other reservoirs we are not including, such as fossil fuels.\n\nD. Review the rules of the game:\n\n1. Students will keep track of their journey by adding a bead to their string to represent each reservoir they visit.\n\n2. Students should add a bead first, so they don't forget, then roll the dice.\n\n3. Students should read the dice carefully for information about the process that is moving them from one reservoir to another, and then go to their next station as instructed by the dice.\n\n4. If a die tells them to stay in place for a turn, they should add another bead of that color before re-rolling.\n\n5. As students represent carbon, an element, they don't \"want\" to go to any particular place. There is no \"goal\" they are trying to get to and they should go where the dice take them. Each turn they should roll the appropriate die ONCE, and whatever it says is what they do.\n\n(Monitor students during game play to make sure they are not cheating, i.e. \"I wanted a ____ bead!\")\n\n6. Students should continue moving through the cycle until they have fifteen beads on their string.\n\nE. Give students their starting location. The carbon cycle is a large and complex topic, so how you distribute them is up to whatever connections you would like to make during the discussion portion.\n\n1. If you would primarily like to discuss residence time, start a couple groups of students in the atmosphere and surface ocean, and a couple in the sediments and deep ocean dissolved reservoirs.\n\nThis is where it is helpful to have duplicate dice for some stations \u2013 if you would like eight students to start in the atmosphere, you may want to make at least eight atmosphere dice.\n\n2. For the biological pump, start all students in the atmosphere and surface ocean. Be sure you don't let any students begin in deep ocean particles or ocean sediments.\n\n3. Once students get the hang of it, the game goes quickly, so if you have enough materials you can certainly run the game more than once, with a slightly different focus each time.\n\nF. Monitor students as they move through the cycle and remind them of the rules if needed.\n\nG. When students have finished their cycle, pass out worksheets and have them decode their string of beads back to which reservoirs they represent.\n\nH. Have students compare their cycle to their neighbors'.\n\nI. Use the diagram to represent the journey through the cycle as a series of arrows. Is a cycle a circle?\n\n2. Which reservoirs have long residence times? Which have short residence times?\n\n3. What are the processes that move carbon from one reservoir to another? (Choose a few to highlight.)\n\nUse the seltzer or soda to discuss carbon dioxide moving between air and water. Initially many students will use the terms \"evaporation\" and \"condensation\" when you ask them how carbon moves from one to the other; remind them that those are terms for the water cycle and for changes in state of matter.\n\nThe soda is helpful both to show that air and gas dissolves in water in the same way that solutes such as salt do, and to help them connect to the short residence time of gas in liquid (\"If I open this and leave it here overnight, will it still be fizzy tomorrow?).\n\n4. What processes move carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean sediments?\n\nDefine the biological pump for students. The biological pump is the set of processes in the ocean that sequester carbon (make it unavailable to be recycled back into the atmosphere for a long period of time).\n\nIdentify if any students were sequestered (Atmosphere \u2013 Surface Ocean \u2013 Ocean Plants \u2013 Deep Particles \u2013 Ocean Sediments. Can also stop at Ocean Consumers between plants and particles). Scientists are interested in areas of the ocean with a very efficient biological pump, as well as areas of the ocean where the biological pump is either less efficient than expected, or decreasing in efficiency.\n\nHigher level students can research iron fertilization experiments and make connections back to these concepts.\n\n5. Have students brainstorm what reservoirs and processes have not been included in the game (soils, fossil fuels, sedimentary rocks; burning of fossil fuels, subduction of sediment and volcanic eruptions for a few examples). As an extension, have students make sample dice to try and represent the sources and sinks for these reservoirs, and their fluxes and residence times.\n\nThis requires students to understand that a) each face of a die represents a sink from that reservoir, b) the larger the flux for a particular sink, the more faces of the die are assigned to it, and c) the longer the residence time the more \"roll this station again\" faces a die needs.\n\nExtension:\n\nFor upper level students who are spending more time studying biogeochemical cycles, challenge students to adapt the game for another element, such as nitrogen. Students can decide which reservoirs to include and how to represent the sources, sinks, fluxes, and residence times by varying the dice. They can play their created game to see how well they represented the cycle.\n\nOptional: If you don't have the materials to have the students use beads\/make bracelets to record their journey, you may use a simple worksheet to have them keep track of their journey as they go.\n\nReference:\n\nHelping students understand conservation of matter (in this case, carbon) in processes like photosynthesis and the carbon cycle as a whole is essential to their understanding of environmental issues surrounding clean energy and climate change\n\nSome of the planet's most beautiful and diverse ecosystems are at risk. With temperatures on the rise, coral reefs are at greater risk for coral bleaching. Using ocean observing system data from NOAA's National Data Buoy Center, this classroom activity examines ocean temperatures off Puerto Rico to see how coral reefs are being impacted and predict what's on the horizon. Brought to you by Sea Grant's Bridge website and COSEE-NOW.\n\nThis activity was developed in response to the 2005 massive coral bleaching event in the Caribbean caused by high sea surface temperatures. Using ocean observing system data, water temperatures can be monitored to evaluate the likeliness of other bleaching events.\n\nVia the COSEE-NOW online community, we were able to receive valuable feedback on making the graph of water temperature more user-friendly and expanding the discussion questions to evoke some higher level thinking from students.\n\nThis activity has been demonstrated to teachers at the National Marine Educators Association conference and Virginia Sea Grant professional development institutes; and to graduate students in several different settings."}
{"text":"Teaching and Learning\n\nLogin\n\nClassroom Use\n\nBrownfield Action was designed to expose students to the problem solving skills needed by environmental scientists in diagnosing sources of groundwater contamination. It was designed to be used with an accompanying sequence of lessons that work synergistically to maximize the educational value and impact of the experience students have while working within the simulated environment.\n\nPedagogical Approach\n\nThe underlying approach employed is that of problem based learning which is based on the constructivist learning theories of Vygotsky and Dewey and is frequently defined by:\n\nTeachers taking the role of facilitators, acting as guides to student-centered learning rather than deliverers of knowledge. As such, instructors in this approach are typically available to scaffold student skills \"just in time\", as needed in the lab, rather than supplying direct techniques or lessons ahead of time that students merely practice using.\n\nStudents work in collaborative groups and explore pieces of the problem via: investigative action, conversation, reflection and collaboration with each other.\n\nLearning is driven by challenging problems that have no obvious answer until certain discoveries are made that can lead to increasing confidence in student-designed solutions.\n\nUse Cases\n\nAs the laboratory foundation for Dr. Peter Bower's Introduction to Environmental Science course at Barnard College, students use BA over the course of a semester to explore the complexity and ambiguity of large-scale real-world environmental problems. The simulation has also been adapted for use in a variety of higher-education contexts. Faculty members at Connecticut College, Lafayette College, and Georgia College & State University have incorporated BA into their upper level hydrology and environmental site assessment courses. Outreach plans are also underway to find partners to help develop pedagogy and courses using BA in secondary schools and in environmental science professional settings.\n\nAn annual BA seminar is offered to new instructors interested in learning about BA's extensive features and range of pedagogy. If you are interested in trying out the simulation and using it in your own course, please contact us to discuss."}

{"text":"Overview\n\nThe Discovery Difference\n\nWhen you see the world through the eyes of Discovery, you see the world through the eyes of an explorer, a scientist, an adventurer. On a Discovery Student Adventure, we value the authentic interaction between cultures. With Discovery Education's unparalleled access on our educational adventures, you will explore the hidden treasures few tourists ever see. But most of all, you will interact with the local people, landscape, food, and wildlife. Real interaction. The kind that starts with a handshake and ends in friendship. The kind that can only happen when you let your curiosity be your compass, and discovery be your destination. And since our teacher-led trips are all-inclusive, you never have to worry about the travel details\u2014it's all taken care of for you. On a Discovery Student Adventure, the world is your classroom. So pack your curiosity\u2014you've got the world to see.\n\nLearn Adventurously.\n\nThere's a reason they're called Discovery Student Adventures. Every trip includes activities designed to pump adrenaline to the far reaches of your body. From rappelling down waterfalls in the Costa Rican rainforest to tracking real live game deep in the African bush to looking a great white shark straight in the eyes off the coast of South Africa\u2014your heart will be pounding, your palms sweating, and your sense of accomplishment overwhelming. Our student group tours may be educational, but they're also phenomenally good fun. So go ahead, jump right in and enjoy the challenge.\n\nOpen Your Eyes. And Your Mind.\n\nIt's a great big world out there, and each country has its own rich culture and fascinating history. No one appreciates this more than Discovery, a company that's always had the world as its focus. It's no surprise then, that instead of simply visiting Robben Island, the site of Nelson Mandela's incarceration during South Africa's apartheid era, you'll be guided through the prison by a former political detainee. Activities like these, and there are many, reveal the world in a whole new light. And this new understanding of the world will live with you long after the adventure is over.\n\nThe Ultimate Field Trip\n\nWhen it comes to science, there's no better way to learn than by experience. That's what field trips are all about. But on a Discovery Student Adventure, they're really kicked up a notch. Take our Arctic expedition. As you sail the Arctic waters, you'll join a crew of thirty scientists and experts who'll lead you through daily workshops in this fragile, frigid ecosystem. In Costa Rica, you'll join researchers working to preserve endangered sea turtle populations by helping to build or relocate hatcheries for their eggs. Taking what you've learned in the classroom and applying it to the real world is education at its best\u2014and most thrilling.\n\nGet in the Green Zone\n\nRespect for the planet has been at the very core of Discovery since its founding. Combine this reverence with an endless wonder, curiosity, and passion, and it's understandable why every Discovery Student Adventure has at least one activity dedicated to conservation and the environment. By watching polar bears in their natural habitat, you'll understand why this majestic animal now finds itself endangered. The more we know about our planet, the more we can help preserve it for others to enjoy. That's why our student group tours never leave a messy footprint. It's why we pack out what we pack in. It's about being more than a student abroad; it's about being a good steward abroad.\n\nChange the World. Change Yourself.\n\nIf it were just about going, observing, and leaving, it wouldn't be a Discovery Student Adventure. Instead, our trips provide you with unique opportunities to not only visit local communities, but also to serve them. In China, for example, you'll brighten the lives of sick children in the Songtang Hospice simply by reading to them in English. In Australia, you'll contribute to the coral research efforts of the Great Barrier Reef. Without question, you'll gain from whichever trip you go on. But you'll also have many chances to give back. And it's those interactions that change everyone for the better. And for good.\n\nTravel Abroad 2.0\n\nDiscovery Education's rich digital content can bring your adventure to life even before you board the plane. Online lessons, webinars, and videos will help set the stage for what is sure to be an unforgettable experience. Once there, harness the web to document your experience. Blogs, online diaries, photos uploaded to your favorite social networking site\u2014our students do it all. However you choose to stay in touch with your family and make your friends jealous is fine with us. On a Discovery Student Adventure, we are committed to technology enhancing the travel experience."}
{"text":"Calgary, AB, Pre-conjecture is a teacher's worst enemy. Students graduating from today's schools require the scientific knowledge to help them interpret their world. Alongside this scientific knowledge, technological knowledge is a complementary asset. Why, because students need current skills to understand and interpret their world.\n\nNew geologic findings based in observations from a well-known site offer new insights to how these students can interpret their world. This is significant. The exploration of critical thought is manifested when students receive inputs to learn from. Sometimes these inputs challenge conventional wisdom.\n\nTo become scientifically literate, students must grow. The growth requires further development of science and its relationship to modern advances. The world is increasingly global and to attain a competitive advantage students need current critical skills to think, to ponder and to understand. Science relates to technologies and science supports society.\n\nWhen students develop the broad-based skills required to identify and analyze problems from current geologic laws and principles and assess them against observed facts such as in the case study at Kidd Copper property they get tools. These tools help them explore and test solutions. 'In Defense of a Younger Earth' is a scientific report and reference material to help guide these senior students to further explore and test solutions. Only then can students seek to interpret and evaluate information.\n\nIf students are not allowed to be shown alternatives to the mainstream way of thinking, how will they ever expand? Critical sense of wonder is based on questioning the norm. A major scientific discovery refuting several geologic laws was attained because of these guidelines. If all students followed the same path, what unexplored possibilities exist for more discoveries to come to a better understanding of the world around them?"}

{"text":"Visitors enter the Earth Gallery on the main level. There, suspended before them, is a beautiful, shimmering sphere \u2014 Planet Earth. Moving around the sphere, they see several warmly glowing corrals where other visitors are engaged in activities. Through windows in the back of the gallery, they notice a small garden just outside the doors. To one side, they see a ramp that leads down to a large water tank on the lower level.\n\nGlobal Patterns is a digital media program that recreates the various cycles and patterns that characterize Earth as a system. On the entry side of the sphere, breath-taking and constantly shifting visual patterns will show well-known scientific phenomena such as precipitation, wind, temperatures, and pollution\u2014on a global scale.\n\nNarration by Stennis scientists will interpret these patterns and invite visitors to learn more in the galleries of INFINITY. On the opposite side of the sphere, visitors can use laser pointers to trigger audio clips providing more detailed information about these patterns. NOAA's Science-on-a-Sphere forms the basis of this exhibit.\n\nIn the Global Patterns exhibit a visitor:\n\nLearns about Earth as a series of dynamic, interconnected systems.\n\nLearns how global phenomena relate to local, observable patterns.\n\nLearns how scientists at Stennis study these phenomena and how they as visitors will be able to explore them at INFINITY.\n\nWatches a mix of narration, animations, and computer simulations that describe the multitude of cycles and systems that make up planet Earth.\n\nUses a laser pointer to hear additional information about these patterns at labeled hotspots throughout the sphere.\n\nAt the Deep Ocean Lab, visitors are able to use sophisticated technology to make a map of the floor of a large water tank. This helps to illustrate the basic principles of bathymetry.\n\nThese maps are then fed into a 3D simulation program that allows the visitor to visualize the area they just mapped.\n\nAt the Deep Ocean Lab, a visitor:\n\nLearns about survey boats and how they are used to map the ocean floor.\n\nLearns about the bathymetry of the Gulf of Mexico (in particular, the Viosca Knoll).\n\nLearns about typical features of the sea floor.\n\nScans a strip of the tank floor by navigating a camera on the tank's surface.\n\nViews a 3D fly through of the strip they scanned.\n\nNavigates through a 3D model of the entire tank.\n\nThe Environmental Monitoring exhibit provides a central conduit between Stennis and the outside environment. Live data feeds from all parts of the globe\u2014particularly the Gulf Coast region and the immediate surroundings at Stennis\u2014are used by visitors to explore their environment while also learning about the role of data collection in scientific research.\n\nAt the Environmental Monitoring exhibit, a visitor:\n\nLearns how scientists collect and use data.\n\nLearns about the extraordinary amount and diversity of data that scientists collect and use in their research.\n\nSelects a specific type of data (e.g., air quality, ocean buoy measurements, water quality) for collection.\n\nUses on-screen controls to locate and select a data-collection site.\n\nAccesses live environmental data from that site.\n\nThe Severe Weather Center is a team activity in which individuals learn the importance of different climactic variables for accurately predicting a storm's path.\n\nThe Severe Weather Center is an engaging activity that helps a visitor achieve a better understanding of the complexities of predicting a storm's path.\n\nWhile interacting with the Severe Weather Center, a visitor:\n\nIs introduced to the process of numerical modeling and climate prediction.\n\nLearns about key variables that influence hurricanes and their relative importance in hurricane prediction.\n\nLearns how data are collected and used in severe weather prediction.\n\nManipulates different climactic variables to see their effects on a storm's predicted path and landfall."}
{"text":"Teaching considerations\n\nPrior preparation will be necessary to ensure a successful and enjoyable field trip to a waterway.\n\nTesting for water quality and invertebrate life will not be possible if the waterways within your catchment are dry, however gathering information on the riparian vegetation and vertebrate life will still give an indication of the quality of the waterway environs. It will also give a reference point if and when water flows and you are able to test water quality. You could take samples of mud, soil or sand from the bed of the local waterway and add water to them back in the classroom and see if any life or evidence of life appears.\n\nRead through and become familiar with the information within Resource Sheets 8, 9 & 10. Some of this information can be adapted for student use or background knowledge.\n\nIf making your own dip net for taking a water-bug survey, do so before your field trip. 'Resource Sheet 16 - Making Your Own Dip Net' provides instructions.\n\nPerform the tests you expect the students to perform, prior to your visit to the waterway.\n\nVisit the waterway prior to your class trip to assess accessibility, safety, the best sites for sampling, and the best place to have a break\/snack.\n\nOrganise transport and parent helpers before the desired date of the trip. Discuss with your helpers the suggested activities and procedure for the trip, and the jobs you would like them to be responsible for.\n\nDepending on the size of your group and the distance needed to travel to your local waterway, discussion and organisation ideally carried out at the site may need to be done in the classroom before and after the field trip.\n\nBank Vegetation \u2013 Bank vegetation refers to trees, shrubs, grasses etc. actually growing on the bank. The canopy is the tree cover overhanging the water. This vegetation provides food and shelter for aquatic organisms in the form of fallen leaves, twigs, branches etc.\n\nVerge Vegetation \u2013 The stream verge is different from the bank. The verge is considered the section of land up to 30 metres from the water's edge. The verge vegetation can be quite extensive but many streams in urban settings have almost no verge vegetation at all.\n\nScience processes\n\ncollecting and recording data\n\nmeasuring\n\nobserving\n\nassessing\n\nSOSE processes\n\nunderstanding\n\nthink\n\nparticipate\n\ninvestigate\n\ncommunicate\n\nSequence\n\nTime: \u00bd \u2013 1 day\n\nOrientating\n\nThe purpose for the field trip should be quite clear to the students prior to the field trip. Check (by questioning) the students knowledge and understanding of the types of investigations to be performed. Ensure students have Resource Sheets 12, 13, 14 & 15 for the water-bug survey and riparian assessment.\n\nNominate (or students could volunteer) students to do the various tests and assessments:\n\ntemperature\n\nturbidity\n\nsalinity\n\nriparian vegetation\n\ninvertebrate and vertebrate\n\nMake a record of this somewhere in the classroom (corner of the blackboard, or on butchers' paper). Stress that records made during the field trip will need to be referred to for reporting back purposes.\n\nOrganise the students into groups for sampling and testing and go over the roles and responsibilities of each participant e.g.\n\nShare equipment.\n\nListen and value fellow students' ideas and attempts.\n\nBe responsible for carrying, using and returning equipment.\n\nBe sensitive to the environment with the view to minimal human impact, return rocks, bugs, where you got them from and avoid any action that will increase erosion.\n\nMake and keep a record of sample and tests.\n\nWork out of the sun as much as possible.\n\nAct on safety procedures for field trips.\n\nRemember your manners and that you are a representative of the school particularly when speaking to helpers, or are near other members of the public who are sharing the waterway.\n\nCheck everyone has:\n\nhat\n\nsunscreen, repellent\n\nequipment\n\nrecord sheets, pencils\n\nwater\n\nsnack or lunch\n\nfirst aid kit\n\nAssemble all and move to transport or to your waterway site.\n\nEnhancing\n\nOnce you have arrived at the site, place all equipment in a central place unless it has been possible for students to carry equipment with them. Revise who is working with whom and where the students need to go for their sampling. You may need to set a time limit and a reporting back time to a central position. Ensure students know the procedure if they need help.\n\nRemind students of minimal impact procedures (most likely identified in the student's code of Conduct - see Code of Conduct activity) e.g. take only what you need and put things back where they came from.\n\nSend students off to do their sampling and testing. If possible, have students test salinity, turbidity and temperature at more than one site along the waterway.\n\nStudents take samples following the procedure outlined in Resource Sheet 12.\n\nWhile students are assessing and taking samples, monitor how they are going; checking their procedure and enjoyment of the tasks.\n\nIf students break for a snack or lunch, ensure litter is disposed of properly or stored to be carried back to school.\n\nWhen sampling and assessing is completed you could report back initial students' findings at the waterway site rather than back in the classroom. This is particularly useful if, due to the size of your group and time constraints, you divided the tasks of assessing and testing between the students.\n\nSynthesising\n\nReturn to the classroom, report back and record the findings. You may wish to collate information on butcher's paper for class reference or use the student's record sheets.\n\nAsk questions related to the temperature, salinity and turbidity of a waterway from Resource Sheets 8, 9 & 10.\n\nAdditional learning\n\nCreate a Big Book on local waterways.\n\nSome students may plan to visit the waterway again or regularly. Nominate a time during the school day when they could talk to the class about their visits.\n\nGathering information about student learning\n\nSources of information could include:\n\nanecdotal notes about any student alternative conceptions or alterations to conceptions"}
{"text":"Dissection in veterinary and medical schools has sharply declined as they have switched to alternatives (Hart & Wood 2004). And the variety of dissection alternatives for grade school and high school students has greatly expanded over the last decade. We now have more technologically advanced options to learn anatomy and physiology, and studies have shown that we can learn effectively with these methods that are non-detrimental to the animals, the environment, and students (Rasmussen 2001).\n\nDissection often focuses on memorizing facts instead of teaching students critical thinking skills (Rollin 1981). On the other hand, alternatives teach students to ask questions, gather data, and problem solve. Alternatives demonstrate scientific concepts (Hart et al. 2008) including the structure and function of living systems at all levels of organization (cells, organs, tissues, organ systems, whole organisms, and ecosystems), the composition of body systems, and the regulation of an organism's internal environment and relationship with the external environment. Alternatives also demonstrate how form fits function, comparisons between species, and how the body systems work together and function.\n\nIn addition to better fulfilling the learning objectives in a timely, efficient, and interactive way, alternatives allow the students to reexamine an organism, unlike dissection, which destroys many of an organism's structures and their spatial relationship (Rosse 1995; Richter, Kramer, Lierse, Maas, & Hohne 1994; Balcombe 2001). Because the alternatives are reusable, a school can save thousands of dollars each year by using them and can reduce laboratory waste and disposal of hazardous biological or chemical preservatives.\n\nAs an example of what can be provided for the undergraduate program in biology, at the University of California, Davis, a course in Comparative Vertebrate Organology using alternatives, presents functional anatomy of the major organ systems in fish, birds, and mammals, from the cellular to the gross level. Engaging laboratories focus on each of the organ systems, offering three-dozen gross anatomy laboratory stations, which are available for a full day each week. The laboratories present reusable materials, combining an array of preserved specimens, prosections, microscopic slides, and diagrammatic presentations (Hart, Wood, and Weng 2005).\n\nTwo popular types of dissection alternatives are computer programs and models.\n\nComputer Programs\n\nComputer simulations give students the opportunity to learn interactively while controlling the lesson's focus, direction, and pace. Available software programs include simulations of the anatomy, physiology, and behavior of cats, crayfish, dogs, fetal pigs, frogs, humans, rats, sharks, and other animals. Some of these programs simulate the step-by-step performance of a dissection. In addition, many programs enhance the lesson by including critical thinking questions, data gathering exercises, and additional information on comparative anatomy, the physiology of the animal, and the environmental niche. Animated sections may comprise films of functioning systems at the organ, tissue, cellular, or molecular level. On-line self-evaluation quizzes are also available on many of these programs, allowing students to evaluate their learning and identify areas for further study.\n\nModels\n\nModels often have removable, labeled, and detailed parts that provide a realistic look at the anatomy of the organism. While preserved specimens are usually faded, monochromatic, and used only once, models are colored to reflect the appearance of a living organism and are reusable."}

{"text":"Science\n\nThe High School science program is centered on developing thinkers; students who can use the scientific method to question and discover explanations for the world around them. Students take a range of lab based courses such as Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Environmental Science and Anatomy during their time at Oak Hill School. Each course uses inquiry based labs and activities to develop student leadership and critical thinking skills. The classroom, labs and field work provide diverse arenas for the students to delve into different topics and find their passion for science.\n\nThe excitement of scientific experiments is a gateway for students to develop their authentic writing and presentation skills. Each course teaches and requires the use of formal lab reports in conjunction with smaller informal lab exercises throughout the week. Students are taught how to develop, write and test their experiments to answer a scientific question. Often students use multimedia to present their ideas to the class, the appropriate use of technology to convey findings is highly encouraged. Recently students have used PowerPoint, moviemaker, songs, and animations to present the concepts of photosynthesis, mitosis, and meiosis. In the future I am planning to utilize blogging as a forum for discussions of real world topics.\n\nOur campus allows for students to step right out of the classroom and into the field. Each course is able to take lab work a step further, collecting and observing cycles or specimens in the wild. Students thrive while collecting plankton from our pond, searching for arthropods in the forest, analyzing the abundance of monocots and dicots on campus and identifying plant an animal species on a hike. We are also able to tie the science field work we do on field trips such as the week long fall retreat to the Olympic Park Institute to our studies for the remainder of the year. Science is too important and to exciting to be contained to a desk, I want students to get involved in the learning process and make it their own.\n\nEach student is consistently challenged to develop their own ideas from in class discussions, nightly reading and experimental data. Students develop their writing skills throughout each course as a means to convey their ideas and educate their target audience. It is my mission to prepare each student for college through a love of science, an intrinsic desire to question everything and a strong background in the experimental process."}

These cover\nscience basics, biology, oceanography, meteorology (the\nstudy of weather and of the atmosphere), biology, chemistry,\nphysics, astronomy and space exploration, and a science\nreview and project course. Again, these courses include\nmany films and documentaries.\n\nAdditionally, the student will perform literally hundreds of\nexperiments and exercises, as the world he lives in, and the\nUniverse which surrounds it, becomes increasingly\ncomprehensible. At the end of his science studies, the\nstudent will decide which area of science interests him, and\nfollowing a step-by-step study guide, does a science project\nof their own. (In fact you, the parent, will\nnot\nbe allowed to assist! This is not a \"science fair\". The\nstudent must study, come up with a thesis in his area of\nscience, and an experiment to prove or disprove his thesis.\nThe student, in short, will be functioning as a scientist!)\n\nTHE END RESULT OF 'CONNECT THE THOUGHTS' SCIENCE STUDIES\nIS A STUDENT CORRECTLY LOCATED IN SPACE. THEY KNOW EXACTLY\nWHERE THEY ARE IN RELATION TO THE PLANET, THE SOLAR SYSTEM\nAND GALAXY.

{"text":"Geography\nVIII \u2013 X\nRationale:\nAt this stage, Geography like other components of Social Sciences has a distinct\nentity and an adequate space has been given to develop multiple perspectives on a few\nselected themes, so that one also develops a comprehensive view.\nGeography draws its content both from natural sciences as well as social\nSciences, therefore, unlike other Social Sciences, it does not study only human behaviour\nwhich is governed by 'reasons' it also studies physical phenomena which are governed\nby 'cause effect'\nFollowing the National Curriculum Framework 2005, contemporary India has\nbeen taken as the major area of study for a three- year course. 'Resource and\nDevelopment' is the theme for class VIII. In class IX a little of Physical Geography has\nbeen included but the main theme is 'India \u2013 Land and People', whereas in class X, 'India\n- Resources and their Development' is the main theme and Geography of Meghalaya' is a\npart included. In all the three classes (VIII \u2013 X) Disaster Management is also included.\nThe learners, at this stage prepared to take up more intensive study for developing a\ndeeper understanding of the socio-economic challenges before the nation.

{"text":"Essential Question\n\nStep 1 -- Connect (The Concept to Prior Knowledge)\n\nChallenge\n\nStudents examine the different aspects of their day-to-day survival. For example: How do they adapt to temperature changes? What do they eat? What do they drink? How do they travel from place to place?\n\nEach student draws a picture or lists the things that he\/she most needs for survival in their particular region of the country. This can include physical conditions like food and types of shelter. It might also include emotional things like friends and safety. It should take into account the regional climate, rainfall, seasons, etc.\n\nStudents watch the Ecuador slideshow from the Rainforest Alliance to get a feel for the bioregional characteristics of the tropical rainforest.\n\nHave students revise the list of their daily survival activities as if they were going to go to the rainforest to live. Would their needs be the same in the rainforest as in their current home?\n\nStudents select a plant or animal from their local bioregion and do a chart that lists all the things that animal or plant depend on in the environment (bees, water, soil, wind, etc.).\n\nStudents learn about bromeliads and discuss the concept of interdependence and survival needs for the bromeliad in the tropical biome and particular bioregion of the plant's location.\n\nTeachers bring in different examples of bromeliads (purchased at a local nursery) or photographs of bromeliads if plants not available. Students examine examples of bromeliads from a nursery. Students discuss the similarities and differences between the bromeliad and the plant species selected for observation from their own bioregion.\n\nRead aloud: Plants and Planteaters, by Michael Chinery (or another book with information about bromeliads and tree frogs)\n\nStep 3A -- Practice (Math and Learning Centers)\n\nChallenge\n\nStudents decide what is necessary to their survival and what could be removed from their systems of survival without causing any harm.\n\nTo better understand their level of dependence on certain systems in their home, students \"take apart\" their homes and identify the major systems it involves.\n\nStudents analyze where the energy comes from that is used to power these systems (hot water, air conditioning, heat, refrigeration, lighting, etc.).\n\nStudents discuss which 'survival' systems they might do without and the reasons why.\n\nConnect the concept to species survival. Refer to the example of the bromeliad and tree frog in Step 2. Ask students to consider if any part of the bromeliad\/tree frog system can be removed without harming one of the organisms.\n\nStep 3B -- Create (Performance Tasks Related to Standard Indicators)\n\nChallenge\n\nStudents consider the phrase: \"Chachi people consider the rainforest a living being.\"\n\nStudents research the Rainforest Alliance resources related to the Ecuador rainforest. Students discuss the different ways groups of people might think about land and its resources and consider different approaches to land use.\n\nStudents write an essay that explores the way they think about the place where they live. Students should address the way they think about aspects of the land. For example: What places do they consider 'useable'? Which places would they consider special? What are consumable resources in the place where you live? What aspects of the land would you consider off limits to development?\n\nStep 4 -- Present (Edit Work\/Students Present Projects)\n\nChallenge\n\nStudents consider the effects of removing certain plants or animals from their bioregion on their survival or quality of life.\n\nStudents write a story that traces the effect of removing bees from their landscape. Or what would happen if all the trees were removed?\n\nFrom Romel's point of view, students think about and discuss what might happen in the rainforest if the tall trees were removed? What if the land was cleared near a river?\n\nDiscuss with the class the idea of sustainable management of land, in which wood and other forest products can be harvested in a way that keeps the entire forest intact.\n\nHave students consider managing the land so that essential characteristics are left intact while others are used for resources.\n\nFor more information and case studies of companies which are involved in sustainable land management, visit the Profiles in Sustainability.\n\nThe Rainforest Alliance curriculum is unique in that it teaches science, math, language arts and social studies essentials while addressing the United States National Standards for Learning. These are the standards addressed in the fourth grade lessons.\n\nReadingKnows the organization of simple food chains and food webs.\nKnows the transfer of energy.\nKnows that changes in the environment can have different effects on different organisms.\nKn\n\nStandard 11 Level 2 Grade 3 - 5\nKnows that good scientific explanations are based on evidence (observations) and scientific knowledge.\nKnows that scientists make the results of their investigations public.\n\nStandard 13 Level 2 Grade 3 - 5\nKnows that people of all ages, backgrounds, and groups have made contributions to science and technology throughout history."}

{"text":"Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students research endangered animal species that have 'beaten the odds' as they continue to survive longer than scientists had expected. Students write individual pages for a class book about endangered species.\n\nAuthor(s):\nEric Miller, The New York Times Learning Network\n\nSuggested Time Allowance: 1 hour\n\nObjectives: Students will: 1. Brainstorm facts about endangered species. 2. Probe the phenomena of endangered species that continue to survive beyond expectations by reading and discussing, \"Extinction Turns Out to Be a Slow, Slow Process.\" 3. Research a selected endangered animal species and create an informational poster board. 4. Present their poster boards to the class. 5. Synthesize their notes into a written report following a standardized format for inclusion in a class book on endangered species.\n\nActivities \/ Procedures: 1. WARM-UP\/DO-NOW: Students respond to the following in their journals (written on the board prior to class): \"What are some of the factors that result in animal species becoming endangered or extinct? If possible, give specific examples of animals and environments.\" After five to ten minutes, students share their responses. Record student responses on the board in two columns (extinct animal species, endangered animal species). You may need a third column for animals that were previously endangered, but are no longer considered endangered.\n\n2. As a class, read and discuss \"Extinction Turns Out to Be a Slow, Slow Process,\" focusing on the following questions: a. In what ways have near-extinct species surprised scientists? b. Why have predictions of species extinction become an embarrassment to scientists? c. What is meant by the quote, \"To a species, a human lifetime is a little flicker.\"? How does this quote relate to the topic of the article? d. What are some of the primary causes of species extinction? e. What is the difficulty of using scientific data from previously extinct species to help with future predictions? f. What tools do scientists currently use to predict extinction rates? g. Why are biologists and paleontologists described as being at odds with each other? h. What does the article describe as the central challenge to scientists who are investigating endangered species? What are the proposals to help with this challenge? i. How can the perception that endangered species are always exotic be dangerous?\n\n3. Working individually or in pairs, students select an endangered animal species (or formerly endangered species) to research in greater depth. Students may choose from the following: Javan rhinoceros or Hawaiian po'ouli (both currently living near extinction), Puerto Rican parrot or North American gray wolf (both formerly in danger of extinction). Internet resources for these four species are provided below. Teachers may permit students to choose alternative species (from the class list brainstormed during WARM-UP activity, or from another list of endangered species). Using available resources students probe for answers to the following questions: \u2013What is the common habitat of this species? Where was this species located prior to endangerment? How has the habitat or location of the species changed since it became endangered? If this population has recovered, how has the habitat or location changed since recovery? \u2013What are some distinguishing characteristics or adaptations of this species? \u2013What are the known causes of reductions in the population of this species? If the species has recovered, what known factors have contributed to the recovery? \u2013What roles have humans and human developments played in the reduction of this population? \u2013What roles have humans played in attempting to save this species from extinction?\n\nStudents use their research notes to guide the creation of informational poster boards about endangered species. Students may include illustrations, maps, or charts to enhance their posters.\n\n4. WRAP-UP\/HOMEWORK: Students present their poster boards to the class. For homework, students write out their notes into full paragraphs (at least one full page in length). Students use a standardized organizational format (agreed upon in class) as they write up their research notes. These written reports will be combined to create a class book about endangered species.\n\nFurther Questions for Discussion: \u2013What plant or animal species are endangered in your local area? \u2013What responsibility do you think humans have for the extinction of plant and animal species? \u2013Is it possible for a species to become extinct \"quickly\" yet take a few hundred years to become extinct? What does \"quickly\" mean in the scale of evolutionary time? \u2013Do you think that more plants and animals are becoming extinct now than at other times in the history of the Earth? Why or why not? \u2013What role does mass media play in informing us about endangered species?\n\nEvaluation \/ Assessment: Students will be evaluated based on written journal responses, participation in class discussions, poster boards, poster presentations, and written reports.\n\nExtension Activities: 1. Explore the causes of species endangerment or extinction. What are the similarities and differences among the various causes of endangerment that impact different species? Create a chart that outlines some of the most predominant causes.\n\n2. Research to find out more about how fossils can be \"read\" to interpret patterns of species extinction and evolution over time. Present your findings in a written report. Visit a natural history museum or department of paleontology in a local university for more information. If possible, contact an archaeologist or paleontologist to get more information about fossils.\n\n3. Find out more about the World Conservation Union's \"Red List.\" What is this organization and what are their criteria for including species on the \"red list\"?\n\n4. Create a timeline that shows major periods of evolution and species extinction over time. Starting from the beginning of geologic time to the present, indicate major evolutionary shifts (emergence and extinction of dinosaurs, emergence of homo sapiens and other animal species, etc.) Be sure to consider your own lifetime in relationship to the history of the Earth.\n\n5. Learn more about the jobs of a Paleontologist and Conservation Biologist. Write an explanation of how you think these two jobs might be meshed together as suggested in the featured article.\n\nInterdisciplinary Connections: American History- Examine the history of the U.S. National Fish and Wildlife Service's Endangered Species Program ( How and why was this program formed? What are the primary goals and missions of this organization?\n\nCivics- Create a public service campaign to inform the public about endangered plant or animal species in your own local area. Create audio or visual media to promote your message.\n\nGeography- Select one of the endangered species suggested in the main activity and create a world map that shows where the species can be found today. Using a color code, indicate where the species would have been found before it became an endangered species.\n\nLanguage Arts- Create a children's book about an endangered species. If you have researched an endangered species already, try using the knowledge you have gained to make an age-appropriate children's book about this species. Clarify who your target audience will be, relevant vocabulary, the organizational structure of your book, and a plan for illustrations.\n\nMath- Examine the two most common methods for calculating current extinction rates and predictions: the species area curve and the population variability analysis. Develop a presentation to explain how these analyses work. Use actual or sample data to demonstrate how the calculations forecast species extinction rates.\n\nOther Information on the Web: The Endangered Species and Wetlands Report ( is a monthly newsletter covering the Endangered Species Act, wetlands, and developments in Congress, the courts, and at federal regulatory agencies.\n\nTRAFFIC ( is the wildlife trade monitoring program of the World Wildlife Fund for Nature and The World Conservation Union.

{"text":"Featured Post\n\nWiggio: Group Collaboration made easy...\n\n0\n\nWhat it is:The Office of Naval Research has a great interactive site filled with science and technology exploration for students. On the site, students can explore oceanography, space, and blow the ballast. Each section of the site has sub categories that let students narrow down their focus. The majority of the site is purely informational with accompanying images and short quizzes. My favorite portion of the site is the seasonal constellations. It really is the star of the site (no pun intended). The constellation interactive focuses on the constellations that can be viewed during each season. When students click on a season, they will see the constellations and options to show\/hide the pictures, lines and names of the stars. The explanation of constellations and the seasonal impact on what students will see in the night sky is fantastic. In the Teacher's Corner, you will find great animations for each topic (space, oceanography, and submarines). These are fantastic visualizations of complex concepts made simple for students.\n\nHow to integrate Science and Technology Office of Naval Research into the classroom:The Science and Technology Office of Naval Research isn't the flashiest site I've seen. In fact, it looks a whole lot like a site that was created in 1995. I recommend it, in spite of the aged design, because of the wealth of information that it offers students and the student-friendly language and explanations it uses. This is a great site for students to conduct a research project in the early years. The information is concise, easy to understand, and offered in bite-size chunks. Students can approach the topic of oceanography, submarines and space independently.\n\nAs I said above, the constellations based on season is pretty neat. It shows students the constellation and allows them to overlay the image with additional information as they want it. If your students are studying seasons or constellations, this is a nice visual and description. Students could explore the constellations on classroom computers, or better yet, together as a class on a projector-connected computer or interactive whiteboard. Google Sky is amazing, but sometimes it can be overwhelming with detail before students understand the basics of what they are looking for in the night sky. The images on this site are a great first step that can lead to a next level of detail in sites like Google Sky. I love that technology lets us bring the whole universe into our classrooms as a smaller scale planetarium. As a side note, if you have an iPad\u2026go download Go Skywatch now. You will thank me!\n\nBe sure to check out the animation section, these are wonderful for introducing students to complex concepts. The animations would be great on classroom computers as part of a science center rotation. They are perfect for sharing with the whole class on an interactive whiteboard! At Anastasis, students keep a running vocabulary collection where they create a \"glossary\" that they can refer back to. They do this in Evernote, these animations are perfect for linking to within the glossaries so that they can refer back to an illustration of the word.\n\n4\n\nWhat it is: Goal Book is a platform, currently in beta, that helps educators come together to create and track student goals. The interface is very Facebookesq in feel. Teachers can create and track student goals from within Goal Book, sharing those goals with any other team member that works with the student. Each time a goal or progress of a goal gets updated, the entire team that works with a student is updated. Educators can keep each other updated with progress of goals, celebrate students, and share messages in Goal Book. In addition to updating educators, parents are now in the center of the conversation. They can see all progress, communicate with the education team that works with their child, celebrate successes and send private messages from within Goal Book.\n\nHow to integrate Goal Book into the classroom:Goal Book is a fantastic way to keep every part of an education team up to date with IEP goals and progress. No more keeping track of email threads, assuming someone else is taking care of a particular portion of the goals, or wondering what progress a student has made with another team member. Goal Book brings all communication to one, easy to manage place. I like that teams are fluid in Goal Book. Here, the assumption isn't made that every student has the same group of educators working on their goals. The students you have input in are listed in one place and the team members associated with that student show up as well.\n\nGoal Book isn't just for students with IEP's, all students benefit from creating and tracking learning goals! Ask your students to think of a goal they would like to make for themselves for the semester\/quarter\/trimester in each discipline. Record the goals and progress with students throughout the semester\/quarter\/trimester. Celebrate with students when they have reached their goals and share these with parents.\n\nAt Anastasis Academy, we hold parent\/teacher\/student conferences at the beginning of each block. We call this conference \"Meeting of the Minds\". This is a time where parent, teacher and student come together to write learning goals for the upcoming block based on the progress that was made the previous block. Students play a big part in creating their learning goals. One thing I would like to see from Goal Book is the ability to include students in the goal making\/tracking process. It is important to include students in the planning and tracking of THEIR learning goals. Kids have to have ownership in their learning!\n\nTips: The Goal Book blog is worth subscribing to and following if you plan to use Goal Book at your school or in your classroom. The blog will keep you up-to-date with the latest updates and information about Goal Book.\n\nPlease leave a comment and share how you are using Goal Book in your classroom!\n\n12\n\nWhat it is: Ideas to Inspire has been a favorite of mine for years, it recently got a design boost that makes it even more useable! Ideas to Inspire comes to us from @markw29, Mark invites teachers from around the world to share their inspiring ideas for using technology in the classroom. These are pulled together as a presentation that teachers everywhere can benefit from. Ideas to Inspire has a handy new filter tool that let's you find the exact resources and ideas you are looking for easily. Inspiring ideas include: Amazing art, A to Z of ITC, audio, books to engage boys, ideas for classroom blogging, games to enhance learning, creative geography, geography gaming, get to know your new class, GIS and GPS, Google forms, Google maps, Google search, ICT control and modelling, ICT in the early years, interesting images to use in the classroom, incredible science, inspiring writing, interactive math, Internet safety, iPad, iPod Touch, learning platforms, making your lessons ESL\/EAL friendly, mobile phones, Moodle, netbooks, Nintendo DS and DSi, Non-tech strategies, ways to present Internet research, Prezi, Primary Pad, Purple Mash, QR Codes, student voice, super science investigations, super snow day activities, supporting math, supporting spelling, techy tips for non techy teachers, things to do with digital images, Twitter, using backchannels in the classroom, using video conferencing to support the use of quality texts, Wallwisher, webcams, web conferencing, Wii, wikis, Wordle, document cameras, supporting writing, search engines, marvelous music, interactive whiteboards, Google docs, ICT shopping list, creative curriculum topics, pocket video cameras, teaching reading comprehension, Voicethread, YouTube and (if you can believe it) more!\n\nThe new filter let's you filter by curriculum linked presentations or interesting ways to use: hardware, software or online tools in the classroom.\n\nThis great resource is not to be missed!\n\nHow to integrate Ideas to Inspire into the classroom: Sometimes we could all use a little inspiration. Ideas to Inspire is just the place to stop for some guaranteed inspiration! I love that the ideas shared on Ideas to Inspire are collected from classrooms and teachers around the world. That tool you have been using forever in your classroom? Someone, somewhere has thought up a great new innovative way to use it in your classroom for learning! Does not get better than that!\n\nFor those of you who are enjoying the last few weeks (gulp) of summer, be sure to stop by Ideas to Inspire while you have some time to be inspired and make plans for the upcoming school year.\n\nTips: Fair warning: this website will suck you right in and make you want to spend hours exploring.1\n\nWhat it is: Science Fix is a fantastic video blog that I learned about from my friend and PLN colleague Kyle Pace. The videos are all recorded science experiments and demos from middle school science teacher Darren Fix. The majority of the videos are chemistry related but there is also some good physics videos in there as well. The videos are hosted on YouTube so if you don't have access, you may have to use one of those tricky ways to download and save from home. (See Tips below for ways to do that.)\n\nHow to integrate Science Fix into the classroom:Science Fix is a great place to find demos and science experiment videos to share with your students. These videos will help your students better visualize and understand the concepts that they are learning in your class. We don't all have robust resource budgets, sometimes we have to pick and choose what we will be able to demo for our class live. These videos are a big help in bringing those experiments to our classrooms when budgets don't allow us to do it live. There are great descriptions and additional links and resources along with each video.\n\nTips: For those of you who don't have access to YouTube in your building, you can still use these awesome videos in your classrooms with a little bit of pre-planning. Download and save YouTube videos so that you can show them at school without accessing the YouTube site. UseKeep and excellent from"}

It's a valuable and essential guide for teachers at those levels, especially with its updated links and reference section.\n\nThe book is divided into three sections\u2014activities, readings, and resources. Activities are organized under three broad astronomical concepts\u2014Earth's position in the solar system, Earth's unique properties, and Earth's characteristic phases and seasons. The 11 activities help students to understand concepts such as Earth's seasons, light year as a distance, phases of the moon, and effects of greenhouse gases. Each hands-on activity comes complete with a student section and a teacher's guide and is planned with materials that are readily available or inexpensive to purchase. Each activity is systematically presented so that students can complete it independently.\n\nLesson features include questions to determine students' preconceptions as well as post-assessment suggestions, planning charts for easy reference, and science safety notes. In the second section, there are 13 readings that are from one to three pages long. The readings provide background information on the underlying concepts required for understanding the activities presented in this volume. This is an excellent feature of the book.\n\nThere are four categories of additional resources\u2014curricular and activities, software, websites, and NASA resources. Educators will find this large collection to be very valuable. I also recommend this book to elementary gifted and talented teachers and those using differentiated instruction."}

By breaking concepts down as simply as possible we solve several problems: Students learn the material faster, students have less questions, and it makes it easier on teachers.\n\nFull Audio Narration: Using full audio narration, teachers don't have to do as much work to teach and makes it easier for students to learn. Natural Science features a male voice actor for the Earth Science part, and a female voice actress for the Life Science part.\n\nInteractive Diagrams, Videos, Galleries, and Quizzes:\nUsing diagrams, videos, galleries, and quizzes; under our tests students learned the same material 2-3 times faster than a traditional text book. With students processing interactive visual information, students can understand concepts more quickly and have a better understanding much faster than static material.\n\nLiving Document with an Unparalleled Learning Experience:\nIf you're a parent or teacher that would like to see additional material covered, just contact us and we'll add it.

If you know from survey data how much bottled water is consumed at your school in one day, you can incorporate that number of bottles into the display for a great visual impact. You can make any shape you want by fastening the bottles together with hot glue guns and\/or tape, or you can simply load the bottles into clear garbage bags to display in a large pile.

Discuss how avoiding bottled water is a step toward a more sustainable lifestyle and brainstorm about other small steps the students can take to live more sustainably (carpool, walk, reduce waste, use reusable containers and cloths, turn off lights, etc).\n\nAsk the students to list all the disposable things they use in a day or week. Have the students draw a picture of the things they throw out, cut out pictures of items they throw out, or make a collage out of pieces of disposable items they use. Alternatively, ask the students to bring in a recycled shopping bag to collect their trash for an entire day. For homework, have the students categorize the trash at the end of the day and graph the data. Finally, students can bring their trash back to school the following day to see the total amount generated by the class in one day.

{"text":"Students read about Los Angeles and Southern California and the need to access increasing supplies of water from terrestrial sources despite their proximity to the vast Pacific Ocean and hundreds of miles of coastal estuaries, wetlands, and marshes. The unit also focuses on where water is located, whether that water is available for human use, what goods and services water ecosystems provide for people, and ways that people manage water for the present day and for the future. Students learn about the water cycle, availability of fresh water, salinity and density of water, and the interaction of humans with freshwater, coastal, and marine ecosystems. They also learn how water management practices on land contribute to some of the changes occurring in marine ecosystems.\n\nThis unit provides students with the opportunity to explore two primary ways water moves through the water cycle-evaporation and condensation-and how this movement of water is connected to humans and human communities. Students use their experiences with the water cycle to build a real-world understanding that natural systems proceed through cycles that humans depend upon, benefit from, and can alter. In doing so, students learn about the relevance of the water cycle to human communities and their own lives.\n\n5.3.c. Science\nPrecipitation, People, and the Natural World\n\nThis unit teaches students about precipitation and its importance in California. Students learn about the many different natural precipitation patterns that exist in California and the rich variety of ecosystems that depend on these precipitation patterns for their proper functioning. For example, fresh water from precipitation is vital to California's important agriculture industry. Residential centers such as Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento, and San Francisco would not have been possible without snowfall in the Sierra Nevada. Students also learn how human activities influence the quantity, distribution, and chemical characteristics of the precipitation.\n\n5.3.d. Science\nOur Water: Sources and Uses\n\nMost people in California live in areas where precipitation is low. This unit teaches students to identify sources of fresh water and describe the reservoirs of Earth's water and the variations in the ten hydrological regions of California. They learn that water moves from one natural reservoir to another over time. Students brainstorm about ways in which humans use water and learn that the availability of fresh water is limited because some of it is trapped in ice at the poles, in glaciers, and in the atmosphere and that most of Earth's water is comprised of ocean salt water. The lessons provide students with a broader perspective of fresh water resource management, in which natural systems and human communities interact.\n\n5.4.1. history-Social Science\nHuman Settlement and the Natural Regions of the Eastern Seaboard\n\nStudents explore the human settlement and natural features of the eastern sea board, including the physical locations of the American Indian nations and the 13 colonies from the 1600s to 1763. Students act as \"naturalists,\" recording examples of flora and fauna native to the eastern seaboard through excerpts from primary sources. Knowledge of the plants, animals, and the ocean services in the \"New World\" helps students understand what made the region attractive to Europeans and American Indians alike, and what made permanent settlement possible. The development of early economic systems in the Americas, particularly the staple crop economies, are discussed and the increased likelihood of European encroachment into lands occupied by American Indian nations is introduced.\n\n5.8.4. history-Social Science\nNature and Newcomers\n\nThrough the perspective of the overland trail settlers in early American history, this unit teaches students to uncover connections between the natural environment (natural systems and resources) and the built environment (the ways that human beings attempt to influence the natural world). Students learn about the experiences of settlers on the trails and the factors that influence human beings when making decisions about natural resources, natural cycles, and natural processes. While investigating the physical landscape, vegetation, and climate of the major western overland trails, as well as the effects of natural cycles and processes upon the settlers, students understand the settlers' motivations for moving west."}

The use of the \"community\" as a context for service and learning has long been explored in science education. There are many examples of service learning initiatives which generally fall under the heading of community-based education.

The National Science Foundation's Massive Digital Library for Education: Opportunities and Challenges for Teachers and Librarians.\n\n. The National Science Foundation (NSF) released its first call for proposals for the National Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology Education Digital Library (NSDL) program early in 2000.\n\n. Building on work supported under the multi-agency Digital Libraries Initiative, this program aims to establish a national digital library that will constitute an online network of learning environments and resources for science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education at all levels.\n\n. By FY98 the initial DLI had gained more partner agencies and under the umbrella of a new DLI-2 effort, a prototype program was conducted for two years to explore the application of digital library research to undergraduate science education test beds.\n\n. Spurred by both enthusiasm from the broad educational community and both the legislative and executive branches for the promise of digital libraries to enable improvements in education, the formal NSDL program ( was established in 2000.\n\nThis web site provides information about Earth science\/Geoscience education listservs in the United States.\n\n.

She has also been involved in Earth system science education activities.\n\n. Ledley has received NSF grants to develop an Earth System Scientist Network in which she works with scientists and educators to develop scientists' research projects for the participation of high school students; and to develop the Earth Exploration Toolbook which will provide teachers with step by step instructions on how to use Earth science datasets and tools in an educational context.\n\n. She is also active in the Federation of Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP Federation), the National Science Digital Library (NSDL), and in the Digital Library for Earth Systems Education (DLESE).\n\nDIGITAL LIBRARY OF EARTH SCIENCE EDUCATION ?\n\n. It offers information about developing digital collections and managing networked information for the benefit of scholarship, education, and cultural progress.\n\n. DREI QuestionAuthority is a forum, where various individuals in the reference community post their thoughts on current issues in digital reference education and training.\n\n. i-DLR is a web portal for Digital Library education.\n\n.

A section for educators helps teachers make the most of the resources by providing information on teaching with data, evaluation and assessment, and integrating research and education.\n\nPlanning Testbeds and Applications for Undergraduate Education To continue the exploration of digital library research efforts and testbeds for undergraduate education, NSF anticipates providing up to $1 million for digital library projects submitted to the Special Emphasis: Planning Testbeds and Applications for Undergraduate Education within the Digital Libraries Initiative - Phase 2.\n\n. Areas of particular interest for DLI-2 proposals to NSF include: Planning grants for the construction, coordination, and maintenance of a national digital library for SMET education.\n\n. Proposals should address organizational structure, business models, user needs, integrative functions that will work in education context, and interoperability among existing and projected distributed components of the library.\n\n. Collection development refers to the development of validated, substantial, and coherent collections of resources for SMET education."}

INV S3.7 conducts their own investigations and makes judgements based on the results of observing, questioning, planning, predicting, testing, collecting, recording and analysing data and drawing conclusions\n\nBackground information compiled from:\n\nNSW State of the Environment 1997 and 2000 NSW Environment Protection Authority, 1997 and 2000\n\nWhat is a Catchment?\n\nA catchment is the land area from which all the water flows to one point. As well as rivers, lakes and creeks, the catchment includes the land contained within its physical boundaries. Everything in a catchment is linked. What happens in one part of a catchment will have an effect downstream. A catchment also includes the stormwater drains and pipes that carry water that runs off roofs, driveways, roads and other impervious surfaces.\n\nNSW River Catchments\n\nThe headwaters of most NSW rivers are in the Great Dividing Range, from which they flow east to the Pacific Ocean or west to the Murray-Darling system. The east-flowing streams generally have higher, more reliable flows than those in the west, because of higher precipitation on the eastern slopes. NSW coastal rivers discharge almost three times the amount of water than do rivers flowing inland. Average coastal river discharge is 28 million megalitres per year. Average inland river discharge is 10.5 million megalitres per year.\n\nRiver Systems\n\nRivers may be large or small, but they all follow the same rules of drainage. Rivers may begin from underground water coming to the surface (springs), from rainfall, from snowmelt or drainage from a wetland or a lake. Some creeks dry up during periods of low rainfall. These are called intermittent streams.\n\nAs creeks increase in flow and join with other creeks, a branching network is established. This network from headwater streams to the river mouth is called a river system. A catchment is made up of smaller sub-catchments that feed into the river system.\n\nImpact of Urbanisation\n\nUrbanisation increases the area of impervious surfaces (such as roads and roofs) in a catchment. This causes rainfall that previously infiltrated into soil or flowed off catchments at a slow rate, to flow off the catchment quickly and in greater volumes.\n\nIn urban areas, many small creeks have been replaced with piped and lined drainage systems. This accelerates the rate at which stormwater is carried and increases flooding and erosion problems. The concentration of pollutants such as oil, grease, sediment and organic matter running off urban surfaces causes deterioration in the water quality downstream."}

The kids started planting seeds in the fall. They water them and watch them sprout, then bloom and flower. Right now we are enjoying picking, washing and eating two kinds of lettuce, carrots, and sugar snap peas. The cosmos are blooming in different shades of pinks and white. After we are done harvesting these vegetables, we will plant cilantro, tomatoes and other veggies to make a yummy salsa. It is the best kind of science for 4 year olds, something we can do with all of our senses!\n\nKINDERGARTEN\n\nKindergartners are naturally curious about the world in which they live. Science ideas and opportunities for scientific exploration are embedded and integrated throughout the Kindergarten Language Arts and English Language Development programs we use. The students have a chance to learn about weather and the changing seasons, as well as the life cycle changes of a butterfly, in our ELD unit, Changing Times. Our Open Court and Foro abierto units on Shadows and The Wind allow us to explore more Earth Science standards.\n\nThe Foss kits in our Science Center contain everything the students need to explore the properties of materials such as fabric, wood and paper. Springtime planting and year round garden boxes give the Kindergarten students the chance to observe and measure new plant growth. Animals and insects are always favorite subjects with our young learners. Foss kits and an integrated Language Arts curriculum provide our students with the opportunity to have fun exploring these topics.\n\nFIRST GRADE\n\nThe first grade's science focus is on the scientific exploration of solids and liquids, plants and animals, and air and weather. The students experience hands on experiments in the science lab as well as in their classroom. The lessons provide opportunities for the students to observe, explore, and record their findings. Through science, the students develop their reading and writing skills and enhance their vocabulary.\n\nDuring the solids and liquids investigation, the students observe, describe and record the properties of solid, liquids and gases. Students compare basic needs of plants and animals when they study the plants and animals unit. During Air and Weather unit, students explore the properties of air and observe the weather from day to day and over the seasons.\n\nSECOND GRADE\n\nSecond graders have a very exciting hands-on, interactive science program here at Grand View. They learn about earth, physical and life sciences doing actual scientific investigations. Earth science focuses on learning about rocks and fossils. Physical science teaches students about balance and motion. Life science centers around animal camouflage, plants and insects\u2014that means LIVE insects, boys and girls! In addition, students work in our science lab, school garden and participate in a school-wide science fair.\n\nTHIRD GRADE\n\nTHIRD GRADERS will participate in four hands-on investigations during the Structures of Life Module. In our school garden students will observe and compare properties of seeds and fruits. They will investigate the effect of water on seeds. Students will also observe and become familiar with different organisms such as crayfish, snails, and beetles, etc. The module will culminate in a fieldtrip to LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes where students will participate in the Edible Teaching Garden and Culinary Arts program.\n\n5th grade students at Grand View get to be chemists, biologists, astronomers, meteorologists, and more! Topics in fifth grade science focus on learning critical science skills and include units on the following: Matter, mixtures & compounds; Living organisms and their processes & systems; and the Solar System, our water planet, the water cycle, and weather. Each unit includes hands-on, minds-on, research-based kits that give students opportunities to \"do science\" while learning science vocabulary, concepts and skills. Each unit also equips students to improve their reading and writing skills."}

{"text":"Ohio's Academic Content Standards in Science\n\nBy the end of grade 12\n\nStudents demonstrate an understanding about how Earth systems and processes interact in the geosphere resulting in the habitability of Earth. This includes demonstrating an understanding of the composition of the Universe, the Solar System and Earth. In addition, it includes understanding the properties and the interconnected nature of Earth's systems, processes that shape Earth and Earth's history. Students also demonstrate an understanding of how the concepts and principles of energy, matter, motion and forces explain Earth systems, the Solar System, and the Universe. Finally, they grasp an understanding of the historical perspectives, scientific approaches and emerging scientific issues associated with Earth and space sciences.\n\nIndicators for grade 12\n\n1.\n\nExplain how scientists obtain information about the universe by using technology to detect electromagnetic radiation that is emitted, reflected or absorbed by stars and other objects. (ORC Resources)\n\n2.\n\nExplain how the large-scale motion of objects in the universe is governed by gravitational forces and detected by observing electromagnetic radiation. (ORC Resources)\n\n3.\n\nExplain how information about the universe is inferred by understanding that stars and other objects in space emit, reflect or absorb electromagnetic radiation, which we then detect. (ORC Resources)\n\n4.\n\nExplain how astronomers infer that the whole universe is expanding by understanding how light seen from distant galaxies has longer apparent wavelengths than comparable light sources close to Earth. (ORC Resources)\n\nDescribe how scientists estimate how much of a given resource is available on Earth. (ORC Resources)\n\nLife Sciences\n\nStudents demonstrate an understanding of how living systems function and how they interact with the physical environment. This includes an understanding of the cycling of matter and flow of energy in living systems. An understanding of the characteristics, structure, and function of cells, of organisms and of living systems are developed as well as a deeper understanding of the principles of heredity, biological evolution, and the diversity and interdependence of life. Students also demonstrate an understanding of different historical perspectives, scientific approaches and emerging scientific issues associated with the life sciences.\n\nIndicators for grade 12\n\n1.\n\nRecognize that information stored in DNA provides the instructions for assembling protein molecules used by the cells that determine the characteristics of the organism. (ORC Resources)\n\nExplain that the Sun is essentially the primary source of energy for life. Plants capture energy by absorbing light and using it to form strong (covalent) chemical bonds between the atoms of carbon-containing (organic) molecules. (ORC Resources)\n\n4.\n\nExplain that carbon-containing molecules can be used to assemble larger molecules with biological activity (including proteins, DNA, sugars and fats). In addition, the energy stored in bonds between the atoms (chemical energy) can be used as sources of energy for life processes. (ORC Resources)\n\n5.\n\nExamine the inheritance of traits through one or more genes and how a single gene can influence more than one trait. (ORC Resources)\n\n6.\n\nExplain how developmental differentiation is regulated through the expression of different genes. (ORC Resources)\n\n7.\n\nRelate diversity and adaptation to structures and functions of living organisms at various levels of organization. (ORC Resources)\n\n8.\n\nBased on the structure and stability of ecosystems and their nonliving components, predict the biotic and abiotic changes in such systems when disturbed (e.g. introduction of non-native species, climatic change, etc.). (ORC Resources)\n\n9.\n\nExplain why and how living systems require a continuous input of energy to maintain their chemical and physical organization. Explain that with death and the cessation of energy input, living systems rapidly disintegrate toward more disorganized states. (ORC Resources)\n\nTrace the historical development of a biological theory or idea (e.g., genetics, cytology and germ theory). (ORC Resources)\n\n12.\n\nDescribe advances in life sciences that have important, long-lasting effects on science and society (e.g., biotechnology). (ORC Resources)\n\nPhysical Sciences\n\nStudents demonstrate an understanding of the composition of physical systems and the concepts and principles that describe and predict physical interactions and events in the natural world. This includes demonstrating an understanding of the structure and properties of matter, the properties of materials and objects, chemical reactions and the conservation of matter. In addition, it includes understanding the nature, transfer and conservation of energy, as well as motion and the forces affecting motion, the nature of waves and interactions of matter and energy. Students also demonstrate an understanding of the historical perspectives, scientific approaches and emerging scientific issues associated with the physical sciences.\n\nIndicators for grade 12\n\n1.\n\nExplain how atoms join with one another in various combinations in distinct molecules or in repeating crystal patterns. (ORC Resources)\n\n2.\n\nDescribe how a physical, chemical or ecological system in equilibrium may return to the same state of equilibrium if the disturbances it experiences are small. Large disturbances may cause it to escape that equilibrium and eventually settle into some other state of equilibrium. (ORC Resources)\n\n3.\n\nExplain how all matter tends toward more disorganized states and describe real world examples (e.g., erosion of rocks, expansion of the universe). (ORC Resources)\n\n4.\n\nRecognize that at low temperatures some materials become superconducting and offer little or no resistance to the flow of electrons. (ORC Resources)\n\n5.\n\nUse and apply the laws of motion to analyze, describe and predict the effects of forces on the motions of objects mathematically. (ORC Resources)\n\n6.\n\nRecognize that the nuclear forces that hold the nucleus of an atom together, at nuclear distances, are stronger than the electric forces that would make it fly apart. (ORC Resources)\n\n7.\n\nRecognize that nuclear forces are much stronger than electromagnetic forces, and electromagnetic forces are vastly stronger than gravitational forces. The strength of the nuclear forces explains why greater amounts of energy are released from nuclear reactions (e.g., from atomic and hydrogen bombs and in the Sun and other stars). (ORC Resources)\n\n8.\n\nDescribe how the observed wavelength of a wave depends upon the relative motion of the source and the observer (Doppler effect). If either is moving towards the other, the observed wavelength is shorter; if either is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (e.g., weather radar, bat echoes, police radar). (ORC Resources)\n\n9.\n\nDescribe how gravitational forces act between all masses and always create a force of attraction. Recognize that the strength of the force is proportional to the masses and weakens rapidly with increasing distance between them. (ORC Resources)\n\n10.\n\nExplain the characteristics of isotopes. The nucleus of radioactive isotopes is unstable and spontaneously decays emitting particles and\/or wavelike radiation. It cannot be predicted exactly when, if ever, an unstable nucleus will decay, but a large group of identical nuclei decay at a predictable rate. (ORC Resources)\n\n11.\n\nUse the predictability of decay rates and the concept of half-life to explain how radioactive substances can be used in estimating the age of materials. (ORC Resources)\n\n12.\n\nDescribe how different atomic energy levels are associated with the electron configurations of atoms and electron configurations (and\/or conformations) of molecules. (ORC Resources)\n\n13.\n\nExplain how atoms and molecules can gain or lose energy in particular discrete amounts (quanta or packets); therefore they can only absorb or emit light at the wavelengths corresponding to these amounts. (ORC Resources)\n\n14.\n\nUse historical examples to explain how new ideas are limited by the context in which they are conceived; are often initially rejected by the scientific establishment; sometimes spring from unexpected findings; and usually grow slowly through contributions from many different investigators (e.g., nuclear energy, quantum theory, theory of relativity). (ORC Resources)\n\n15.\n\nDescribe concepts\/ideas in physical sciences that have important, long-lasting effects on science and society (e.g., quantum theory, theory of relativity, age of the universe). (ORC Resources)\n\nScience and Technology\n\nStudents should recognize that science and technology are interconnected and that using technology involves assessment of the benefits, risks, and costs. Students should build scientific and technological knowledge, as well as the skill required to design and construct devices. In addition, they should develop the processes to solve problems and to understand that problems may be solved in several ways.\n\nIndicators for grade 12\n\n1.\n\nExplain how science often advances with the introduction of new technologies and how solving technological problems often results in new scientific knowledge. (ORC Resources)\n\n2.\n\nDescribe how new technologies often extend the current levels of scientific understanding and introduce new areas of research. (ORC Resources)\n\n3.\n\nResearch how scientific inquiry is driven by the desire to understand the natural world and how technological design is driven by the need to meet human needs and solve human problems. (ORC Resources)\n\n4.\n\nExplain why basic concepts and principles of science and technology should be a part of active debate about the economics, policies, politics and ethics of various science-related and technology-related challenges. (ORC Resources)\n\nScientific Inquiry\n\nStudentsDerive simple mathematical relationships that have predictive power from experimental data (e.g., derive an equation from a graph and vice versa, determine whether a linear or exponential relationship exists among the data in a table). (ORC Resources)\n\nStudents realize that the current body of scientific knowledge must be based on evidence, be predictive, logical, subject to modification, and limited to the natural world. This includes demonstrating an understanding that scientific knowledge grows and advances as new evidence is discovered to support or modify existing theories, as well as to encourage the development of new theories. Students are able to reflect on ethical scientific practices and demonstrate an understanding of how the current body of scientific knowledge reflects the historical and cultural contributions of women and men who provide us with a more reliable and comprehensive understanding of the natural world.\n\nIndicators for grade 12\n\n1.\n\nGive examples that show how science is a social endeavor in which scientists share their knowledge with the expectation that it will be challenged continuously by the scientific community and others. (ORC Resources)\n\n2.\n\nEvaluate scientific investigations by reviewing current scientific knowledge and the experimental procedures used, examining the evidence, identifying faulty reasoning, pointing out statements that go beyond the evidence and suggesting alternative explanations for the same observations. (ORC Resources)\n\n3.\n\nSelect a scientific model, concept or theory and explain how it has been revised over time based on new knowledge, perceptions or technology. (ORC Resources)\n\n4.\n\nAnalyze a set of data to derive a principle and then apply that principle to a similar phenomenon (e.g., predator-prey relationships, properties of semiconductors). (ORC Resources)\n\n5.\n\nDescribe how individuals and teams contribute to science and engineering at different levels of complexity (e.g., an individual may conduct basic field studies, hundreds of people may work together on major scientific questions or technical problem). (ORC Resources)\n\n6.\n\nExplain that scientists may develop and apply ethical tests to evaluate the consequences of their research when appropriate. (ORC Resources)\n\n7.\n\nDescribe the current and historical contributions of diverse peoples and cultures to science and technology and the scarcity and inaccessibility of information on some of these contributions. (ORC Resources)\n\n8.\n\nRecognize that individuals and society must decide on proposals involving new research and the introduction of new technologies into society. Decisions involve assessment of alternatives, risks, costs and benefits and consideration of who benefits and who suffers, who pays and gains, and what the risks are and who bears them. (ORC Resources)\n\n9.\n\nRecognize the appropriateness and value of basic questions \"What can happen?\" \"What are the odds?\" and \"How do scientists and engineers know what will happen?\" (ORC Resources)\n\n10.\n\nRecognize that social issues and challenges can affect progress in science and technology. (e.g., Funding priorities for specific health problems serve as examples of ways that social issues influence science and technology.) (ORC Resources)\n\n11.\n\nResearch how advances in scientific knowledge have impacted society on a local, national or global level. (ORC Resources)"}

{"text":"Linking QCA Unit 3C 'Introduction to databases'\n\nto Science in Year 3\n\nPam Marsh, St. Mary's Catholic Primary, Whitstable\n\nI began the unit in the usual way by explaining the idea of a database as a way of quickly finding information. We looked at a set of card-based records on different countries and discussed the language of a database, i.e. 'records' and 'fields'. We experimented with searching this database.\n\nNext, in the computer suite, in pairs the children worked for two sessions on an exercise consisting of using the 'Search' and 'Sort' facilities on a prepared database of children in Information Workshop. They found it useful to be able to see the information in the different 'views'. Having done this, they then set their partner searches to complete.\n\nThe next stage was to compile a class database. The children took photos of each other using the digital camera. Although our network is peer-to-peer, we have a shared area known as the G-drive, and I saved the photos to a folder in this area so that the children would be able to access them from the computers in the suite or the classroom.\n\nFor this database we used the 2Investigate program from the Junior Video Toolkit, which has the facility to insert a picture or photo into each record. We discussed what information should be included in the database then each child completed their own record, importing their photo"}

{"text":"Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students reflect on the uses of superconductors and their properties and develop an understanding of the B.C.S. theory of superconductivity uses of electricity and the impacts of electrical resistance. 2. Learn about two key properties of superconductivity by viewing video clips that demonstrate them. 3. Learn about the history and concepts of superconductivity by reading and discussing the article \"When Superconductivity Became Clear (to Some).\" 4. Create a two-page spread about superconductivity for a high school physics text book.\n\nActivities \/ Procedures: Note to teachers: Due to the difficulty of the article and the concepts involved in superconductivity, this lesson is suitable for a high school or higher-level physics audience. Prior to this lesson, students should have knowledge and understanding of electrical conductivity and resistivity, atomic structure and the forces of attraction and repulsion. Computer accessibility to allow the class to view the suggested video clips is also highly recommended.\n1. WARM-UP\/DO NOW: Upon entering class, students respond to the following prompt in their journals (written on the board prior to class): \"What are the uses of electricity in our society? What is electrical resistance and how does it affect the transportation of electricity from a source to places of use? Why would people want to reduce electrical resistance to zero?\"\nAfter a few minutes, have students share their answers with the class. Record students' responses on the board. Explain that as electricity moves through wires, some of the energy is lost as heat due to electrical resistance. This is similar to the concept of friction. Decreasing electrical resistance results in less energy being lost and a more efficient system. How would this be valuable in today's energy conscious society?\nTell students that zero electrical resistance is possible at extremely low temperatures. Do you know what this is called? Introduce students to concept of superconductivity, defined as the flow of electricity without resistance. Invite students to share what they may already know about superconductivity and its applications.\n2. Tell students that, prior to reading a New York Times article about superconductivity, they will be previewing some of the difficult concepts explained in the article. Explain that students will be watching and discussing two video clips that illustrate the properties of superconductors and explain the B.C.S. theory. Prior to class, prepare each video clip for viewing.\nVIDEO CLIP 1: Property of Perfect Diamagnetism\nThe first video clip will demonstrate that superconductors expel a magnetic field. Explain that students will be watching a short video clip of a strong magnet being placed on top of a superconductor. Have students predict what will happen in their journals.\nInvite students to share their predictions. Then show a video clip demonstrating the Meissner Effect, such as the one on the University of Oslo Department of Physics Web site ( or on YouTube ( As students watch the video clip, have them jot down answers to the following questions in their journals: -What do you see happening? -Why do you think the magnet is floating above the superconductor? -What do you think the liquid and gas shown in the clip are? What is the purpose of this liquid?\nInvite students to share their ideas about the video clip. Explain that the Meissner Effect demonstrates the property of superconductors called perfect diamagnetism. This means that superconductors are not affected by magnetic fields. The magnetic field of a superconductor is actually zero. When a strong magnet is placed above a superconductor, the magnet acts as if the superconductor is reflecting the same force back at it, causing a repulsive force that makes the magnet levitate. The liquid in the video is liquid nitrogen. Liquid nitrogen cools the ceramic disc until it acts as a superconductor.\nDiscuss the applications of this property of superconductors. How do you think the Meissner effect might be used in society? Why is it a problem that superconductors need to be kept at very low temperatures? Explain that this effect is important to the technology behind a Maglev train and MRI machines.\nVIDEO CLIP 2: Property of Zero Resistivity\nExplain that a second property of superconductors is that they have zero electrical resistance. Tell students that three scientists (Dr. John Bardeen, Dr. Leon Cooper and Dr. J. Robert Schrieffer) developed a theory, known as the B.C.S. theory, to explain why superconductors have zero resistance.\nHave students watch the video explanation of the B.C.S. theory found on the Australian Multimedia for Physics Students Web site ( Instruct students to take notes on how the B.C.S. theory works. Provide the following questions for students to answer as they watch: -What causes resistivity in a regular conductor? -How do cold temperatures affect the atomic motion in the conductor? -How do electrons move through super conductors without resistance? How is this different from regular conductivity? -How do Cooper pairs form, and how are they facilitating zero resistivity?\nAfter watching this video clip, discuss B.C.S. theory with students. Also, provide students with the New York Times graphic on Low-Temperature Superconductivity ( Discuss the graphic to reinforce the concepts highlighted in the video. As necessary, provide simple analogies to help students understand these concepts, such as those found online at  or \n3. As a class, read and discuss the article \"When Superconductivity Became Clear (to Some)\" ( focusing on the following questions: a. What experiment led to the discovery of superconductivity? b. Why is superconductivity compared to a \"real-world perpetual motion machine\"? c. How was the B.C.S. theory received by the scientific community? d. How does the simile \"like balls in a diminutive pinball machine\" help you visualize electrical resistance? e. How do the electrons in superconductors behave differently than they do in a typical conductor? f. How did the Meissner Effect provide a clue about the nature of superconductivity? g. What contribution to the B.C.S. theory was discovered by Dr. Bardeen and Dr. Pines? h. How did Dr. Cooper's realization further the understanding of Superconductivity? i. How does Dr. Schrieffer's analogy about \"a line of ice skaters\" help you understand this final piece of the B.C.S. theory?\n4. WRAP-UP\/HOMEWORK: Individually, students will use the class activities, videos and article to create a spread on superconductors and superconductivity designed for inclusion in a high school physics textbook. Science concepts and ideas to be highlighted in the text book spread should include: -a definition of superconductivity -an explanation of the properties of superconductors (diamagnetism and zero resistivity) -an explanation of B.C.S. theory -key scientists in superconductivity research -uses of superconductors -future applications of superconductors \u2013explanation of why a superconductor at room temperature would be an extremely useful, revolutionary invention\nEncourage students to include the use of graphics, diagrams, text boxes, photographs and analogies to make the information visually appealing and interesting to read.\n\nFurther Questions for Discussion: -Where is the future of superconductivity heading? -What are the applications of superconductors? -What are the latest theories about high-temperature superconductors?\n\nEvaluation \/ Assessment: Students will be evaluated based on participation in the initial exercise, thoughtful participation and discussion of the article, responses to video clips and creation a text book spread for homework.\n\nExtension Activities: 1. Research one of the physicists mentioned in the article. How did their research impact the study of physics? Write a short biography telling about the scientist and his work.\n2. Make a timeline showing the history of superconductivity. What were the events that led to our current knowledge of superconductors? How will physicists continue to build on these discoveries in the future?\n3. Make a glossary of terms related to superconductivity, including superconductors, electricity, electrical resistance, magnetic field, diamagnetism, absolute zero, quantum mechanics, current, electrons, atoms, energy, attract, repel, Cooper pairs, low-temperature superconductors and high-temperature superconductors.\n4. Compare and contrast Type I and Type II superconductors. Make a Venn diagram showing the differences and similarities between them, including the uses and drawbacks of each. Then write a response to the following questions: Why is the discovery of Type II superconductors seen as a stepping stone to discovering superconductors that work at room temperature? Why would room temperature superconductors be an incredible innovation?\n5. Conduct research to learn about the applications of superconductors, such as in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines, NMR imaging, Maglev Trains, or SQUID magnetometers. Make a How-It-Works poster illustrating and explaining one of these uses of superconductors.\n\nInterdisciplinary Connections: Language Arts \u2013 Write and illustrate a children's book explaining superconductivity and its applications to a younger audience.\nMathematics \u2013 Look at a graph showing the effects of temperature on conductivity, such as the one found at  What happens to the resistance of superconductors at the critical temperature? Write a paragraph explaining the graph.\nTeaching with The Times \u2013 Read the Science Times section every week for two months, clipping articles that explain scientifically advanced or complex concepts, like superconductivity, to the Times readership. Note some of the ways the reporters make the concepts understandable, such as the use of metaphor and simile, as well as simple language and sentence structure. Then choose a topic you have learned about in science this year (or find out about science projects executed by fellow students) and, using the techniques you have learned from the Times articles, write an article for your school newspaper. To order The New York Times for your classroom, click here.\nTechnology \u2013 Research the use of superconductors to make Josephson devices. What are Josephson devices? What is their potential impact on the future of electronics and computer technologies? Make a presentation telling about these devices and how you think they will affect the future.\n\nAcademic Content Standards:\nGrades 9-12 Science Standard 10 \u2013 Understands forces and motion. Benchmarks: Knows that magnetic forces are very closely related to electric forces and can be thought of as different aspects of a single electromagnetic force; the interplay of these forces is the basis for electric motors, generators, radio, television, and many other modern technologies; Knows that the strength of the electric force between two charged objects is proportional to the charges and, as with gravitation, inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them; Knows that electromagnetic forces exist within and between atoms; Knows how different kinds of materials respond to electric forces (e.g., as insulators, semiconductors, conductors, superconductors); Knows that materials that contain equal proportions of positive and negative charges are electrically neutral, but a very small excess or deficit of negative charges in a material produces noticeable electric forces; Understands general concepts related to the theory of special relativity Science Standard 15- Understands the nature of scientific inquiry. Benchmarks: Knows that conceptual principles and knowledge guide scientific inquiries- historical and current scientific knowledge influence the design and interpretation of investigations and the evaluation of proposed explanations made by other scientists; Knows that scientists conduct investigations for a variety of reasons"}

However, they may not have thought\nabout how these food chains and webs change with the seasons. For example,\nduring spring in the Northern Hemisphere, lengthening and strengthening\nsunlight and rising temperatures boost plant photosynthesis, which increases\nthe amount of food they produce.\n\nLaying\nthe Groundwork\nAsk small groups of students to make a list of five changes they think\nthe sun will bring about as winter wraps up and spring springs forth in\ntheir community.

Have the class create a master\nlist of these changes along with questions they have.\n\nExploration\n\nExample\nof Webbing Activity (Click Image to Enlarge)\n\nAsk students\nto review their list and discuss what kinds\nof impact each physical change (e.g., ice melting, more daylight hours,\ntemperatures warming) might have on living things \u2014 particularly\non their ability to make or get food. Consider introducing or reviewing\nthe concept of food chains. You might, for instance, ask, What\ndo plants need to grow and thrive (e.g., sun, warmth, water)?As they grow, what does it mean for animals that depend on plants?\nFor animals that eat other animals?\n\nAs the\nclass discusses ideas, use a large piece of paper to begin to create\na Web to illustrate them; use the sun as a starting or center point\n(see the example, right). Help students explore connections between\nsunlight and changes\nin living things as spring emerges.\n\nAs spring\nprogresses, read updates from Journey North and keep a running list\nof new connections students discover between sunlight and spring events.\nHave them use another marker color to add these to their Web.

{"text":"REPORT OF THE\n\nEARTH SCIENCE TASK FORCE\n\nJune 2003\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nA basic understanding of Earth processes is essential for\ncitizens to make informed decisions and to vote intelligently on\ncomplex issues facing the United States, Texas, and the world\ntoday. The Earth Science Task Force has met six times since being\nappointed on June 28, 2002 and has carefully evaluated the earth\nscience content in the high school and middle school curricula.\nThe Task Force finds that the current high school curriculum is\nextremely deficient in earth science content and that the middle\nschool curriculum is deficient in some areas.\n\nThe Task Force recognizes that the optimal solutions to the\nproblems with earth science education in Texas require time for\ndevelopment; however, some immediate changes will result in major\nprogress towards achieving earth science literacy for Texas public\nschool children. The Task Force has three recommendations that\nshould be enacted immediately to improve earth science literacy\nand five long-term recommendations that, when enacted, will allow\nTexas students to compete with the best in the nation.\n\nRECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTION:\n\nRecommendation I: The Task Force recommends that\nthe StateRecommendation II: The Task Force recommends\nthat the State Board of Education require four years of science\nfor the Distinguished Achievement Plan, one of which should be\nearth science.\n\nRecommendation III: The Task Force recommends\nthat the State Board of Education implement an eighth-grade\nscience assessment that includes an earth science objective\ntesting Earth and Space Science concepts.\n\nRECOMMENDED LONG-TERM ACTION:Recommendation IV: The Task Force recommends that\nwhen the science TEKS undergo revision, the middle school TEKS for\nEarth and Space Science be revised so that they will be better\naligned with the National Science Education Standards.\n\nRecommendation V: The Task Force recommends that\nEarth and Space Science concepts and objectives be tested on the\nhigh school exit level TAKS.\n\nRecommendation VI: The Task Force recommends that\nthe State Board of Education (SBOE) direct the Texas Education\nAgency (TEA) to redesign and augment the TEKS for Geology,\nMeteorology and Oceanography (GMO), to incorporate core concepts\nof the present GMO with other important aspects of earth science.\nAn expert panel should be convened by the TEA to provide\nscientific guidance for the revision of the TEKS.\n\nThe Task Force further recommends that the State Board of\nEducation direct the TEA to develop an Earth Systems course\nspecifically designed to provide students with an integrated\nscience experience.\n\nRecommendation VII: The Task Force recommends\nthat four years of science be required for high school graduation,\nand at that time, earth science should become a required science\ncourse that is assessed on the TAKS test.\n\nREPORT OF THE EARTH SCIENCE TASK FORCE\n\nJune 2003\n\nThe Earth Science Task Force was appointed by the Texas State\nBoard of Education (SBOE) on June 28, 2002. The charge to the Task\nForce from the Committee on Instruction of the SBOE is to study\nthe earth science curriculum in the state's high schools and the\ngraduation requirements for science. The chair of the Committee on\nInstruction, Mrs. Geraldine Miller, instructed the Task Force to\npresent its recommendations to the SBOE in June 2003.\n\nThe Task Force met six times: July 22, 2002 (Austin), October\n14, 2002 (San Antonio), December 2, 2002 (Dallas), February\n3rd and 4th (Houston), March 3rd\nand 4th (Harlingen) and April 4, 2003 (Lubbock). At\nfive of those meetings public comment was solicited and received\n(see pages 39-41). In addition to the regularly scheduled\nmeetings, members of the Task Force have made presentations to\nvarious groups about their work and findings and have solicited\npublic comments from the State Governor's Conference (Austin), the\nannual meeting of the Texas Earth Science Teachers Association (El\nPaso), Texas Science Educators Leadership Association (El Paso),\nTexas Science Summit (San Antonio), Geological Society of America\nannual meeting (Denver), and others. Summaries of the mission and\nwork of the Task Force have been published in Geotimes\n(American Geological Institute), The Explorer (American\nAssociation of Petroleum Geologists), GSA Today (Geological\nSociety of America) and the newsletters of several other\nprofessional groups. It is the intention of the Task Force to keep\npeople informed and to continue to seek input from diverse\ncommunities.\n\nThe Task Force has carefully studied the earth science content\nin the high school and middle school curricula with special\nemphasis on the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) and\nthe Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS). The content\nin earth science in the state curriculum has been compared to the\nNational Science Education Standards. This comparison and the\nexpert opinion of members of the Task Force demonstrate that the\ncurrent high school curriculum is extremely deficient in earth\nscience content and that the middle school curriculum is deficient\nin some areas. The National Science Education Standards include\nEarth and Space Science equally with Life Science (biology) and\nPhysical Science (chemistry and physics) in the high school\ncurriculum. The Task Force strongly supports this position.\n\nThe Task Force recommends changes that will strengthen earth\nscience in the curriculum of the state's secondary schools and\nincrease the science literacy of all students. Even though the\noriginal charge given to the Task Force was to study earth science\nin the high school and make appropriate recommendations relating\nto it, it was necessary, in the opinion of the members of the Task\nForce, to study the middle school curriculum as well. An important\nlinkage exists in student learning of science content and concepts\nbetween grades 6 - 8 and grades 9 - 12; therefore, several\nrecommendations are made that will improve science in the middle\nschool.\n\nAs indicated above, the Earth Science Task Force conducted this\nstudy in an open forum so that those who are interested would be\nkept informed and encouraged to provide input in the process.\nFormal meetings were held at different geographic areas in the\nstate to provide access to diverse communities. Forty-five\nindividuals made public comments during these meetings (pages\n39-41). Even though there were different points of view expressed,\nalmost all of those who spoke were strongly supportive of\nreturning earth science to the core curriculum in high school, of\nenhancing earth science content in the secondary curriculum, and\nof adding earth science objectives to the appropriate\nassessments.\n\nIn addition to public input during the formal meetings, members\nof the Task Force received comments from many constituencies\nthroughout the state. Discussions about earth science in the\ncurriculum were conducted at the various meetings listed above as\nwell as at conferences, workshops, symposia, and other meetings of\nteachers and administrators. The responses to the work of the Task\nForce were positive in all cases.\n\nFour professional organizations have written position papers\nsupporting the recommendations of the Task Force: Texas Earth\nScience Teachers Association (TESTA), Texas Environmental\nEducators Association (TEEA), and the Science Teachers Association\nof Texas (STAT), Texas Science Education Leadership Association\n(TSELA). Their support is important to the eventual implementation\nof these recommendations (pages 23-30).\n\nThree recommendations are presented that require immediate\naction as well as five recommendations that require longer term\naction; however, they should be enacted as soon as possible. Each\nrecommendation is followed by a short statement of rationale. In a\nnumber of cases, additional supporting or explanatory information\nis included in the appendix of the report. The Earth Science Task\nForce wishes to thank the members of the State Board of Education\nfor supporting this study. We urge you to approve the\nrecommendations and to implement them as soon as possible.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FROM EARTH SCIENCE\n\nTASK FORCE\n\nRECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTION\n\nRECOMMENDATION I\n\nThe Task Force recommends that the\nStateWe have examined the TEKS for\nBiology, Chemistry, Physics, and Integrated Physics and Chemistry\nand find them seriously deficient with respect to earth science\nfacts, concepts, principles, theories and models. This is\nunacceptable in the State of Texas because: (1) earth science\nplays a crucial role in the Texas economy; (2) earth science\nprocesses affect Texas citizens in their everyday lives; (3) earth\nscience is the best subject for demonstrating the integrated\nnature of biology, chemistry and physics in an applied context;\nand (4) earth science is essential to the scientific literacy of\nTexas students (see Appendix I-A, pages 10-11).\n\nThe recommended courses (GMO and\nAPES) were chosen following a detailed study of the TEKS, or\ncourse outline, for Aquatic Science, Astronomy, AP Environmental\nScience, Environmental Systems, and GMO. The criteria used to\nevaluate each course are given in Appendix I-B (pages 13-14). The\nmethodology employed and the conclusions reached are given in\nAppendix I-C (page 15).\n\nRECOMMENDATION II\n\nThe Task Force recommends that the State Board of Education\nrequire four years of science for the Distinguished Achievement\nPlan, one of which should be earth science.\n\nRATIONALE\n\nAs the Minimum Graduation Plan\nbecomes the exception and the Recommended Plan becomes the norm,\nthe Distinguished Achievement Plan should have an appropriate\ndifference in science requirements among these graduation\nprograms. This will require four years of science for a student\ngraduating from a Texas high school under the Distinguished\nAchievement Plan; the Recommended Graduation Plan already requires\nthree years of science and the Minimum Graduation Plan requires\nonly two years of science. This enhancement of the Distinguished\nAchievement Plan will encourage students who take biology,\nchemistry, and physics to complete their journey toward scientific\nliteracy by applying their science background knowledge and skills\nin a study of earth science.\n\nRECOMMENDATION III\n\nThe Task Force recommends that the State Board of Education\nimplement an eighth-grade science assessment that includes an\nearth science objective testing Earth and Space Science\nconcepts.\n\nRATIONALE\n\nStudents need to be scientifically literate. An eighth-grade\nscience assessment allows students to be tested on the cumulative\nknowledge of integrated sciences taught in middle school. Having\nthe eighth-grade assessment include Earth and Space Science is\ncrucial because, at present, it is the last time all students in\nTexas public schools will be tested on these subjects before they\ngraduate. Many national assessments test science at the\neighth-grade level, including National Assessment Project (NAP),\nNational Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), Trends in\nInternational Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), and Program\nfor International Science Assessment (PISA). Additional material\nfor Recommendation III is present in Appendix 2 (page 17).\n\nRECOMMENDED LONG-TERM ACTIONRECOMMENDATION IV\n\nThe Task Force recommends that when the science TEKS undergo\nrevision, the middle school TEKS for Earth and Space Science be\nrevised so that they will be better aligned with the National\nScience Education Standards.\n\nRATIONALE\n\nSeveral important concepts necessary for understanding the\nEarth, specifically plate tectonics, the interior of the Earth,\norigin and composition of soils, and effects of living organisms\non Earth systems, are not currently covered in the middle school\nscience TEKS. Earth science literacy, which prepares Texas\nstudents to make informed decisions, requires the understanding of\nthese important concepts. (See Appendix 3, pages 18-19).\n\nRECOMMENDATION V\n\nThe Task Force recommends that Earth and Space Science concepts\nand objectives be tested on the high school exit level TAKS.\n\nRATIONALE\n\nEarth and Space Science concepts are important components of\nstudent learning in science and they must be included in the Texas\nAssessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS). Although not all\nstudents will take an earth science course in high school, they\nshould be able to successfully answer questions about Earth and\nSpace Sciences from their previous learning in middle school and\nthe minimal earth science content included in biology and\nintegrated physics and chemistry. Adding an earth science\nobjective to the exit level assessment in high school will ensure\nthat students in the State of Texas are exposed to this science\ncontent.\n\nRECOMMENDATION VI\n\nThe Task Force recommends that the\nState Board of Education (SBOE) direct the Texas Education Agency\n(TEA) to redesign and augment the TEKS for Geology, Meteorology\nand Oceanography (GMO), to incorporate core concepts of the\npresent GMO with other important aspects of earth science. An\nexpert panel should be convened by the TEA to provide scientific\nguidance for the revision of the TEKS.\n\nThe Task Force further recommends that the State Board of\nEducation direct the TEA to develop an Earth Systems course\nspecifically designed to provide students with an integrated\nscience experience.\n\nRATIONALE\n\nThe Earth Science Task Force evaluated all existing earth\nscience courses and found that only GMO and APES satisfied the\nagreed on criteria. By augmenting the TEKS of GMO, students would\nreceive a more comprehensive course of study that includes plate\ntectonics, geochemical cycles, natural and human-induced hazards,\nthe development of Earth's oxygen-rich atmosphere, the history of\nlife on Earth, the Geologic Time Scale and astronomy. The Earth\nSystems course, when developed, could be used as a capstone for\nthe Distinguished Achievement Plan or a four-year core science\nrequirement. (See Appendix 4, page 20).\n\nRECOMMENDATION VII\n\nThe Task Force recommends that four years of science be\nrequired for high school graduation, and at that time, earth\nscience should become a required science course that is assessed\non the TAKS test.\n\nRATIONALE\n\nTo enable the students of Texas to improve their scientific\nliteracy will require four years of science in high school. Now,\nand more importantly in the future, the citizens of Texas must\nhave a broad understanding of the content, concepts, and methods\nof science in order to live effectively in a society that is\nbecoming more complex scientifically and technologically. All high\nschool graduates must learn about the Earth and its processes\nthrough a course in earth science.\n\nRECOMMENDATION VIII\n\nThe Task Force recommends reinstating a certification program\nin earth science to fast-track qualified earth science\nprofessionals to become earth science teachers.\n\nRATIONALE\n\nThe implementation of recommendation I will require a pool of\nqualified earth science teachers larger than is presently\navailable at the high school level. The loss of an earth science\ncourse as a core course requirement for the Advanced and Advanced\nwith Honors Program in 1998 has resulted in an attrition of\nqualified earth science teachers at the high school level. The\nreinstitution of earth science as an option for a science high\nschool requirement; however, cannot be effectively accomplished\nunless there are enough qualified teachers to teach earth science.\nA continuing education program and a certification program should\nbe expanded\/reinstituted to fast-track interested and qualified\nearth science professionals to become high school earth science\nteachers. Additional material explaining and supporting this\nrecommendation is included in Appendix 5 (pages 21-22).\n\nAPPENDIX I-A\n\nWHY EARTH SCIENCE IS IMPORTANT\n\nRECOMMENDATION I\n\nEarth science data and concepts are\nessential to understanding the complexities of water resources,\nwetlands, beach erosion, foundation problems, land subsidence,\nflooding and soil conservation. Simply put, citizens should know\nabout earth systems because those systems affect our everyday\nlives.\n\nEarth science plays a crucial role\nin the discovery and production of oil, gas, coal, iron and\nuranium, and in the mining of raw materials used to produce\ncement, concrete, brick, glass, building stone, sheet rock and\nmany other products essential to our daily lives.\n\nAs noted by Governor Perry in\nOctober of 2001, Texas by far leads the nation in oil and gas\nindustry employment, which provided approximately 422,300 jobs in\n2001 and contributed more than $75 billion to the state's economy.\nMining produced another $28 billion and 70,000 jobs. If you\nconsider those industries that use natural resources as their\nbasic feedstocks (petrochemicals and building materials like\ncement and sheet rock, for example), the total contribution of\nearth science-related industries to the Texas economy is at least\n$150 billion annually and half a million jobs.\n\nAmong other responsibilities, the\njob of high schools is to give students the best science education\npossible in order to produce a scientifically literate\npopulation.\n\nThe National Science Education\nStandards have the explicit purpose of assisting the states in\nachieving higher levels of scientific literacy for all students.\nAs a policy document the standards define what constitutes\nscientific literacy, and they provide content benchmarks to assist\nthe states in developing their own standards. The standards\ncorrectly divide all of science into three equally important\nrealms: Physical Science, Life Science, and Earth and Space\nScience. Moreover, the standards spread the facts, concepts,\nprinciples, theories and models of all three realms across levels\nK-4, 5-8, and 9-12. Nationwide, experts agree that Earth and Space\nScience is the best subject for demonstrating the integrated\nnature of all the sciences in an applied context. Texas should\ntake advantage of that fact.\n\nWhy earth science? Because the\nscientific literacy of every student in Texas is at stake and we\nmust do our best by those students. Because those students are our\nfuture voters and they are sure to be challenged by a variety of\nenvironmental and resource issues. As Astronaut Jim Reilly\ntestified in January, 2002, \"When they become the stewards of our\nplanet, our children will need to understand just what it takes to\nsafeguard an ecosystem, to build an environmentally sensitive\nindustrial plant, or to comprehend the complex interactions\nbetween our planet and the life that it hosts.\"\n\nAPPENDIX I-B\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA\n\nRECOMMENDATION I\n\nCurrently the Texas Education Agency\nrecognizes five earth science courses as elective credit for high\nschool graduation - - - Aquatic Science, Astronomy, AP\nEnvironmental Science, Environmental Systems, and Geology,\nMeteorology and Oceanography (GMO). Which of these courses, with\nno more than modest revision, are appropriate for required science\ngraduation credit?\n\nIn order to answer that question we\nconstructed a decision matrix in which the TEKS for each course\nwere weighed against seven criteria as explained below. The first\nfive criteria focus on course content and the last two deal with\ninstruction. Each course was scored on each criteria using the\nfollowing scale: (1) = poor, (2) = marginal, (3) = acceptable, (4)\n= good, (5) = excellent. The criteria used are enumerated and\nexplained below.\n\n1. Does the course integrate and\napply major concepts from Biology and IPC (or Physics and\nChemistry) in the context of Earth systems? This is one of the\nprincipal reasons for requiring an earth science course and it\nshould figure prominently in our decision. Specifically, to what\nextent does the earth science course illustrate tangible examples\nof Newton's Laws, Newtonian mechanics, wave motion,\nelectromagnetic fields, biological evolution, conservation of\nenergy and energy conversions, properties of gases, liquids and\nsolids, changes of state, renewable and nonrenewable resources,\nglobal changes, the principles of taxonomy, spectral analysis,\natomic structure, chemical bonding, fission and fusion reactions,\nradioactive decay, and the carbon, oxygen and water cycles.\n\n2. Does the course help students\nto become citizens capable of casting informed ballots on critical\nsocietal issues? This is another principal reason for\nrequiring an earth science course. Such a course should prepare a\nstudent to understand the complexity of issues like the protection\nand allocation of water resources, tradeoffs in the utilization of\nvarious energy sources, and the relative importance of human and\nnatural impacts on ecosystems.\n\n3. Does the course highlight the\nunique scientific perspective provided by the study of Earth and\nspace? For example, does it address measurement of long times\nand large distances, the age and origin of the Earth and Solar\nSystem, extinction events and their possible causes, and the\nthought patterns needed to interpret the conditions of an\nalready-completed experiment from an examination of the products\nproduced by that experiment?\n\n4. To what extent are the course\nTEKS aligned with the National Science Education Standards for\nEarth and Space Science? The NSES correctly divide all of\nscience into three equally important realms: Physical Science,\nLife Science, and Earth and Space Science. Moreover, the national\nstandards spread the facts, concepts, principles, theories and\nmodels of all three realms across levels K-4, 5-8 and 9-12. At the\nhigh school level students are expected to understand: (1) energy\nin the Earth system, (2) geochemical cycles, (3) origin and\nevolution of the Earth system, and (4) origin and evolution of the\nuniverse.\n\n5. To what extent does the course\ndeal with all four domains of the Earth system: geosphere,\nhydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere? Although specialty\ncourses focused on a single domain have merit, they should follow\nan introductory course that addresses all four domains and their\ninteractions. This is especially true for students who are just\nbeginning to develop the intellectual maturity needed for in-depth\nstudy.\n\n6. Does the course lend itself to\nan inquiry-based laboratory and field approach? This approach\nis strongly emphasized in the national standards.\n\n7. Do students and teachers have\nadequate access to data derived, stored or manipulated by\ntechnology so that students can utilize technology to aid their\nunderstanding of earth science questions? Perhaps in no other\nfield is there such a rich array of data, accessible only by\ntechnology, like that obtainable from NASA, USGS, NOAA, EPA, DOE,\nNWS, TNRIS, ESRI, EARTHSCOPE, and GLOBE.\n\nAPPENDIX I-C\n\nMETHODOLOGY and CONCLUSIONS\n\nRECOMMENDATION I\n\nA subcommittee composed of Heydrick,\nHovorka and Dunn (Chair) was charged to evaluate all existing high\nschool earth science courses in order to determine which should be\ndesignated as satisfying the third year science graduation\nrequirement in the Recommended and Distinguished Achievement Plan.\nThe Task Force approved seven criteria the subcommittee would use\nto evaluate all the courses (Appendix I-B).\n\nEach member of the subcommittee\napproached the evaluation differently and arrived at the rankings\nindependently. Two reviewers used the five-point scale described\nin Appendix I-B. The third reviewer evaluated the TEKS for each\ncourse against each and every item in each criterion - - -\ntherefore the third reviewer's score for each criteria was an\naverage of several components. The third reviewer assigned a value\nof (5) if the TEKS \"guide the teacher to meet the objective the\nTaskforce approved\", (4) if the TEKS \"provide partial or indirect\nguidance to meet the objective\", (3) if the TEKS \"would permit a\nmotivated teacher to meet the objective\", (2) if the TEKS \"would\nhave to be stretched or greatly exceeded to meet the objective\",\nor (1) if the TEKS \"do not include the objective.\"\n\nIn spite of the different\nmethodologies used, the rankings converged. The numerical rankings\nare given in Appendix I-D. We agreed that GMO, with modest\nrevision, and AP Environmental Science satisfy all seven criteria\nand are appropriate for high school science graduation credit. The\nother courses fail to satisfy three (Environmental Systems) or\nfour ( Aquatic Science and Astronomy) of the criteria and should\nremain as electives.\n\nThe recommended high school earth\nscience courses satisfy the admission entrance requirement in\nscience at the overwhelming majority of colleges and universities\nin the State of Texas.\n\nAPPENDIX I-D\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS OF CONTENT\nANALYSIS\n\nRECOMMENDATION I\n\nAquatic Astronomy AP Env.

The student knows the\nstructures and functions of Earth systems. The student is expected\nto: (A) summarize the rock cycle; (B) identify relationships\nbetween groundwater and surface water in a watershed; and (C)\ndescribe components of the atmosphere, including oxygen, nitrogen,\nand water vapor, and identify the role of atmospheric movement in\nweather change.\n\n(7.14) Science concepts. The student knows\nthat natural events and human activity can alter Earth systems.\nThe student is expected to: (A) describe and predict the impact of\ndifferent catastrophic events on the Earth; (B) analyze effects of\nregional erosion, deposition and weathering; and (C) make\ninferences and draw conclusions about effects of human activity on\nEarth's renewable, non-renewable, and inexhaustible resources.\n\n(8.13) Science concepts. The student knows\ncharacteristics of the universe. The student is expected to: (A)\ndescribe characteristics of the universe including (changed from\nsuch as) stars and galaxies; (B) explain the use of light years to\ndescribe distances in the universe; and (C) research and describe\nhistorical scientific theories of the origin of the universe.\n\n(8.14) Science concepts. The student knows\nthat natural events and human activities can alter Earth systems.\nThe student is expected to: (A) predict land features resulting\nfrom gradual changes including (changed from such as) mountain\nbuilding, beach erosion, land subsidence, and continental drift;\n(B) analyze how natural or human events may have contributed to\nthe extinction of some species; and (C) describe how human\nactivities have modified soil, water, and air quality.\n\nAPPENDIX\n3\n\nRecommendation IV\n\nWhen the TEKS are next revised, a number of changes should be\nmade.\n\n1) The middle school TEKS are well aligned with the National\nScience Education Standards in most areas, but a few crucial\ntopics are omitted. These omissions should be rectified as soon as\npossible. Earth science literacy requires the understanding of\nthese important concepts.\n\nThe omitted concepts and most appropriate grade level for them\nto be taught are:\n\nThe solid earth is layered with a lithosphere; hot,\nconvecting mantle; and dense, metallic core. (Add to 7th\ngrade)\n\nLithospheric plates on the scales of continents and oceans\nconstantly move at rates of centimeters per year in response to\nmovements in the mantle. Major geological events, including\nearthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and mountain building, result\nfrom these plate motions. (Add to 8th grade)\n\nSoil consists of weathered rocks and decomposed organic\nmaterial from dead plants, animals, and bacteria. Soils are\noften found in layers, with each having a different chemical\ncomposition and texture. (Add to 5th grade)\n\nLiving organisms have played many roles in the earth\nsystem, including affecting the composition of the atmosphere,\nproducing some types of rocks, and contributing to the\nweathering of rocks. (Add to 6th grade)\n\n2) When the above subjects are added to the TEKS, the first\nthree concepts should be made part of a TAKS earth science\nobjective and be assessed along with the other earth science\nconcepts discussed for Recommendation III..\n\n3) In many of the middle school TEKS, earth science concepts\nare used in \"such as\" clauses which makes the teaching of them\noptional. Each of these should be changed to including when\nthe revision occurs.\n\n4) Individual elements of a single earth science topic in the\nTEKS should be covered together in a single grade to provide a\nmore cohesive understanding of the subject.\n\nFor example, the water, carbon and nitrogen cycles are covered\nin fifth and eighth grades with some related information being\ncovered in sixth grade:\n\n5.6 (B) identify the significance of\nthe water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles.\n\n6.14 (C) describe components of the\natmosphere, including oxygen, nitrogen, and water vapor&.\n\nFor this and many other concepts in the TEKS, it would be\nbetter to cover all of these aspects in one grade; students are\nmore likely to remember the concept and related facts if taught\ntogether than if taught in a piecemeal fashion.\n\nAPPENDIX 4\n\nRecommendation VI\n\nThe revised (or new) course would be aligned with the National\nScience Education Standards for grades 9-12 which emphasize energy\nin the Earth system, geochemical cycles, the origin and evolution\nof the Earth system, the origin and evolution of the universe,\nnatural resources, environmental quality, and natural and\nhuman-induced hazards. Because these topics cannot be addressed\nwithout utilizing many facts and concepts first encountered in\nBiology and IPC, the course would reinforce the integrated nature\nof science and serve the goal of enhancing science literacy in all\nstudents.\n\nEvery effort should be made to insure that the course content\nis current and important to Texas students. For example, the TEKS\nshould promote the use of satellite imagery, real-time earth and\nspace observations, and technology like Geographic Information\nSystems (GIS). Special emphasis should be given to earth science\ntopics of particular relevance to Texas including coastal\nprocesses, flooding, groundwater resources, and the past, present\nand future of hydrocarbon production.\n\nAPPENDIX 5\n\nRecommendation VIII\n\nFuture teachers are anticipated to come from the following\ngroups.\n\n1) Elementary School and Middle School Earth Science\nTeachers. Because earth science is still part of the grade\nschool\/ middle school curriculum, most teachers with an interest\nin earth science are currently teaching at the middle school\nlevel. Some of these teachers may be interested in teaching a more\ndetailed course at the high school level and may need additional\ncourse work and certification. A large-scale movement of middle\nschool teachers to the high school level, however, may deplete the\nteaching pool needed at the middle school and elementary school\nlevels.\n\n2) High School Science Teachers. Science teachers at the\nhigh school level may be interested in teaching earth science as\nwell as those sciences for which they are already certified. There\nwill be a need for professional development and additional\ncertification. Programs through TEA are currently available to\nhelp develop additional certifications. There is a state-wide\nshortage of science teachers. TEA estimated a shortage of 1139\nscience teachers just to meet the needs for the additional\nstudents taking biology, chemistry and physics. If earth science\nbecame an option for a core course requirement, the overall need\nfor qualified science teachers will increase. Additional teachers\nwill be needed from outside the current population of high school\nscience teachers.\n\n3) Earth Science Professionals. A significant number of\nearth science professionals have retired or left the profession\nand they might be interested in high school teaching as a second\ncareer. They have the technical scientific training, but lack\nbackground in pedagogy skills. This group of already educated\nearth science professionals may have the greatest potential for\nincreasing the number of high school earth science teachers.\nSeveral earth science professional societies (e.g. American\nAssociation of Petroleum Geologists) have already developed\ncontinuing education programs as \"requirements of the job.\"\n\nEarth science professional societies may be interested in\nworking with SBEC to develop continuing education\/certification\nprograms to alleviate this potential shortage. For example, the\nEllison Miles Geotechnology Institute at Brookhaven College\n(Dallas, Texas) has a 6-month teacher certification program that\ndevelops teaching skills (how to teach the subject, how it phases\nin with the TEKS and the state testing requirements for students)\nfor geologists interested in retraining into the teaching\nprofession. Similar efforts to alleviate teacher shortages in\nother disciplines are already underway.\n\nProspective teachers can be certified by SBEC if they have a\nbaccalaureate degree and relevant work experiences. Between 1995\nand 2000, over 1800 permits were approved. Several initiatives\nhave been developed at Texas universities and funded through grant\nprograms. A similar approach could be used to help provide earth\nscience teachers through these types of continuing education\/\ncertification programs. Professional earth science societies might\nalso consider additional approaches such as developing remote\ninternet courses, or providing adjunct or \"informal\" science\neducators on as need basis.\n\n4) A fourth group of potential earth science teachers are\nstudents at various Texas universities and colleges working toward\ndegrees in teaching or geology. College students working toward\neither earth science degrees or teaching degrees should be\nencouraged to work toward dual degrees in both earth science and\nteaching. Universities should also be encouraged to develop dual\ndegree programs if they are not available. This fourth option may\nbe considered as the primary long-term approach for increasing the\nnumber of secondary teachers certified in earth science.\n\nPosition Statement of the Texas Earth Science Teachers\nAssociation\n\nEarth Science as a Core Science\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Texas Earth Science Teachers\nAssociation urges the Texas Education Agency and the State Board\nof Education to work together to re-designate Earth Science based\nclasses as core courses to satisfy the third year of mandated\nscience instruction for high school graduation.\n\nUnder current standards, all Earth Science based classes are\ndesignated with elective status only. With this\ndesignation, students are not allowed to enroll in any Earth\nScience based class to meet the graduation requirement of three\nyears of science. Students who have successfully completed the IPC\nand Biology courses have already studied the required objectives\nfor the 11th grade Science TAKS test for graduation.\nYet, the only course options that these students have are to\nenroll in Chemistry and Physics classes for their third year of\nscience. Additionally, with the current designation all Earth\nScience based courses would be limited to senior level course\nstatus for students who choose to enroll in four years of science.\nThe only exception to this is students who take IPC classes in\n8th grade. However, this is not recommended since these\nstudents miss one-third of the state-mandated earth science TEKS\nfor middle school science. This arrangement further limits the\nstudent's exposure to Earth Science based concepts and issues at a\ntime when most of Texas's high school graduates are leaving school\nwith a minimal understanding of the world around them Geology,\nMeteorology and Oceanography (GMO), Marine\/Aquatic Science, and\nEnvironmental Science classes. Awareness of earth science concepts\nis integral to all students' ability to understand the problems\nand challenges that are of primary importance to today's world.\nStudents who have studied the scientific facts student's enrolling in Earth\nScience based courses has undergone a decline from a high of\n46,894 students in 1997-98 to 40, 512 in 2000-2001. Within this\ndeclining enrollment in the Earth Sciences classes, the overall\nnumber of students enrolled in any science class has steadily\nincreased from 645,950 in 1996-97 to 723,896 in 2000-2001. TESTA\nfeels that this decline is a direct result in students being\ndiscouraged from taking an elective designated class over a core\ncredit designated class as required by the Recommended High School\nProgram.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Texas Earth Science Teachers\nAssociation urges that the Texas Education Agency and the State\nBoard of Education join the growing contingency of states (New\nYork, Ohio, Florida, Colorado, North Carolina, etc.) who have\nalready adopted the National Science Education Standards as set\nforth by the National Academy of Sciences\/National Research\nCouncil in identifying Earth Science as a core science curriculum.\nBy re-classifying the course level designation of Earth Science\nbased classes from elective to core status, Texas will be\nacknowledging the need and importance of a strong Earth Science\nbased curriculum for our students.\n\nPosition Statement of the Texas Association for\nEnvironmental Education\n\nSupporting Earth Science as a Core\nScience\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Texas Association for\nEnvironmental Education joins the Texas Earth Science Teachers\nAssociation in urging the Texas Education Agency and the State\nBoard of Education to work together to designate all Earth Science\nbased classes as core courses and to allow those courses to\nsatisfy the third year of mandated science instruction for high\nschool graduation.\n\nUnder the current standards, all high school Earth Science\nbased science classes are designated with an elective\nstatus only. With this designation, students are not allowed to\nenroll in any Earth Science based class to meet the graduation\nrequirement of three years of science. Students who have\nsuccessfully completed the Integrated Physics and Chemistry (IPC)\nand Biology courses have already studied the required objectives\nfor the 11th grade Science TAKS test for graduation.\nYet, the only course options that these students have are to\nenroll in Chemistry, Physics or Principles of Technology classes\nfor their third year of science. Additionally, with the current\ndesignation, all Earth Science based courses would be limited to\nsenior level course status for students who choose to enroll in\nfour years of science.\n\nTAEE strongly supports the National Science Education Standards\ndeveloped by the National Academy of Sciences\/National Research\nCouncil and the American Association for the Advancement of\nScience. These national standards identify Earth Science as a core\nscience curriculum area that integrates chemistry, physics and\nbiology in an applied context at all grade levels. Earth Science\nbased courses include Astronomy, Geology, Meteorology and\nOceanography (GMO), Aquatic Science and Environmental Systems.\nTAEE supports the belief that the addition of Earth Science based\ncourses to the core science curriculum for high school students\nwill provide students a better understanding of the environmental,\nenergy and water issues that are challenging our state, nation and\nworld.\n\nAwareness of earth science concepts is integral to all\nstudents' ability to be scientifically literate and to understand\nthe problems and challenges that are of primary importance to\ntoday's world. Students who have studied the scientific knowledge\nand processes of geology, hydrology, meteorology, oceanography,\nastronomy and the interdependence of the world's ecosystems, will\nbe better prepared to critically analyze the information provided\nby special interest groups and make informed decisions that are\nbased upon scientific fact.\n\nThe number of students enrolling in Earth Science based courses\nhas undergone a 14% decline from the 1997-98 to the 2000-2001\nschool years. Within this same period of time, while the Earth\nScience based courses have shown decline, the overall number of\nstudents enrolled in any science class has increased over 11%.\nTAEE joins TESTA in their belief that this decline is a direct\nresult in students being discouraged from taking an\nelective designated science class over a core credit\nscience class, as required by the Recommended High School\nProgram.\n\nThere is a growing contingency of states who have already\nadopted the National Education Standards as set forth by the\nNational Academy of Sciences\/National Research Council in\nidentifying Earth Science as a core science curriculum. By\nclassifying the course level designation of all Earth Science\nbased courses from elective to core status, Texas'\neducational leadership will be acknowledging the need and\nimportance of a strong Earth Science based curriculum for our\nstudents. TAEE represents a diverse group of over 350, (K-16)\nformal and informal science educators and science leadership from\nacross the state. TAEE respectfully urges the Texas Education\nAgency and the State Board of Education to take action on this\nmatter.\n\nPosition Statement of the Science Teachers Association\nof Texas\n\nSupporting\n\nEarth Science as a Core Science\n\nAdopted 1-18-03\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Science Teachers Association\nof Texas joins the Texas Earth Science Teachers Association in\nurging the Texas Education Agency and the State Board of Education\nto work together to designate Earth Science-based classes as\none of the options to satisfy the third year of mandated\nscience instruction for high school graduation.\n\nUnder current standards, all high school Earth Science-based\nscience classes are designated with elective status only.\nWith this designation, students are not allowed to enroll in any\nEarth Science based class to meet the graduation requirement of\nthree years of science.

General Goal - This lesson\nwill have the students begin to explore and hopefully understand the\nidea of Island Biogeography.\n\nBiodiversity - Summary\n- Students will select outdoor sites and measure the number of plant\nspecies, animal species and relate the results to human disturbance.\nGeneral Goal -To give students experience in collecting and interpreting\nfield data; to provide hands-on work showing the concept of species\ndiversity and to correlate the affect of human disturbance on each site.\n\nCricket Adaptations - Summary\n- Students will observe crickets to determine what mating behaviors\nare noticeable. General Goal - Students will observe that animals have\nadaptations that help them reproduce. They will also conduct a scientific\ninvestigation to study an adaptation they observe.\n. Dandelion Seed Fecundity -\nSummary - This lesson is designed to engage students in determining\nthe rate of seed production for dandelions and the corresponding rates\nof viable offspring. General Goal - Through the activities of this lesson,\nstudents will utilize and discover the principles of natural selection,\npopulations, limiting factors, exponential growth, adaptations, and\nseed dispersal.\n\nFlower Power! - Summary - Students\nwill compare various germination stages of bean seeds and analyze the\ndifferent growth stages of flowers found together on a bush bean plant.\nGeneral Goal: Flowers Are for Reproduction. Students will recognize\nthat the purpose of a flower is to reproduce a plant.\n\nHorse poop; Look what's on it!\n- Summary - Students will compare the patterns of succession that occur\non 2 different piles of Horse Manure. One that is totally fresh, and\none that was scooped up 3-4 hours after falling! General Goal - The\noverall goal is for students to understand succession, by their observations\nand analysis without being told what succession is.\n\nInvestigating the Biodiversity of the\nBaldwin Woods Nature Reserve Habitat and Fuller Preserve - Summary\n- Ecology students will make detailed observations of the tree species\nthat inhabit Baldwin Woods, a remnant of the Black Swamp landscape of\nthe 1800s. They will also make observations of the trees of Fuller Preserve,\na mature woody forest patch occupying land cleared in the 1800s. Students\nwill have the opportunity to experience and ask questions about the\ntree biodiversity of these two habitats. After observing types, numbers,\nand relative distributions of tree species, students will ask one or\nmore specific questions based on their observations, and then formulate\ntestable hypotheses from which they can draw reliable conclusions. General\nGoal - This exercise is intended to have students demonstrate understanding\nof the ecology of one of the last remaining parcels of near virgin Black\nSwamp forest in Northwestern Ohio and how it may have changed due to\nhuman interaction.\n\nIs a parking lot an ecosystem? -\nSummary - While observing the characteristics of a parking lot, students\nwill gather data to support or refute the hypothesis that a parking\nlot is not an ecosystem. General Goal - Students will identify even\nthe most unlikely habitats and recognize them as ecosystems. Students\nwill identify organisms' abilities to adapt to extreme changes in an\nenvironment. Students will determine the characteristics of an ecosystem\nand the resources utilized in the ecosystem by organisms. Students will\ndevelop skills of observation, prediction and hypothesizing, collection\nand analysis of data. Students will synthesize hypotheses and ideas\nof how biodiversity relates to adaptability of organisms in any ecosystem.\nStudents will recognize where parking lots take place in nature (i.e.\nlava flows). Students will process the idea of disturbance and how the\nprocess of succession comes into play. Parking lots? Disturbance? Succession?\n\nMeasuring Species Diversity\n- Summary - In this activity students will inventory species diversity\nin two different areas on the property of Midpark High School. General\nGoal - To introduce students to the concept of biological diversity;\nshowing that differing habitats have different characteristics, and\nthe ways the differences can be studied and measured. (YOU ALSO NEED\nTO DOWNLOAD ACTIVITY WORKSHEETS\nAND DATA TABLE).\n\nNow You See Me.... - Summary\n- Students will investigate the cryptic coloration and shape (crypsis)\nof insects in their habitats.

General\nGoal - The purpose of this lesson is for students to begin to develop\nan understanding of the nature of science by observing many different\nliving organisms and non-living things to determine characteristics\ncommon to all living and once-living organisms. The students will experience\nthat nature is conserved and that all living things can be described\nusing the same general characteristics of life.\n\nThoreau Walk: Getting to Know a Piece\nof Cincinnati Landscape - Summary - In the spirit of Henry David\nThoreau and E.O. Wilson students are asked to plot a walk consisting\nof at least 50 meters around their house. Initially they are asked to\nplot their path on graph paper, to scale, showing their path. indicating\nN,S, E and West. Students walk this path once a week during the entire\nschool year recording in their laboratory notebook the kinds of plants,\nanimals and other forms of life they encounter. Observations that involve\nthe use of their five senses are recorded at first. Quantitative measurements\nregarding the number and kinds of species follow. The students are asked\nto write questions regarding their observations. Students eventually\nwill test one hypothesis that they construct themselves from their observations.\nSharing of their walks will take place once a week, in assigned groups\nand as a classroom discussion. The culminating activities consist of\ndesigning a path that will increase local biodiversity and answer the\nthesis question, was Henry David Thoreau a scientist? General Goal -\nThe goal of the project is to immerse the urban student into the natural\nlandscape and reinforce the concept of biodiversity. Both scientific\nand social inquiry are reflected in the execution of the project since\nstudents will recognize human alteration of the landscape and our impact\non biodiversity, followed by their construction of a landscape design\nthat increases local biodiversity. Students appreciation for nature\nshould also increase.\n\nWhat are the parts of a Tree?

{"text":"264\nResources for Teaching Middle School Science\nPART 3\nOVERVIEW\nPart 3, \"Reference Materials,\" consists of annotated lists of reference books and periodicals to which the middle school science teacher can turn for assistance in teaching hands-on, inquiry-centered science. The lists are as follows: \"Books on Teaching Science,\" chapter 7; \"Science Book Lists and Resource Guides,\" chapter 8; and \"Periodicals,\" chapter 9.\nChapter 7, \"Books on Teaching Science,\" includes almost 50 titles that offer guidance in learning theory and pedagogical techniques. The reference materials selected for this chapter vary in length, style, purpose, and approach. A few of the many topics that they address include these:\nscience standards, their implementation in the classroom, and their implications in terms of the special educational needs of students with disabilities;\nthe theory and practice of activity-based, inquiry-centered science learning and teaching;\nassessment in science education for early adolescents, the role of assessment in science education reform, performance-based assessment strategies, and the improvement of techniques for measuring and evaluating outcomes of science instruction in the classroom;\npractical issues, such as organizing barrier-free classrooms, assuring laboratory safety in grades 6 through 12, and keeping small animals in the classroom;\n\nOCR for page 265\nResources for Teaching Middle School Science\nstrategies for helping middle school science teachers incorporate cooperative learning effectively and develop lessons and activities that encourage problem-solving and higher-level thinking skills; and\nprofessional development needs and opportunities for middle school science teachers.\nChapter 8, \"Science Book Lists and Resource Guides,\" focuses on almost 40 directories and guides produced by organizations as diverse in their expertise as the World Wildlife Fund, the Smithsonian Office of Education, the American Library Association, the California Foundation for Agriculture in the Classroom, and the Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant Consortium. The authoritative reference works annotated in chapter 8 provide teachers with titles, reviews, and recommendations for books, materials, and other resources, as well as information on how to select and obtain what they need for teaching middle school science.\nAmong the directories annotated in the chapter are\u2014\nbibliographies and reviews of publications and films for middle school students, including lists of trade books highly recommended to satisfy the interests and academic needs of students in grades 6 through 8 in science and mathematics;\nguides to science equipment and material resources;\nguides to resources in electronic formats, including a comprehensive directory of computer software for preschool through college;\na directory of Internet resources, including science resources suitable for K-12 students;\ndirectories of key personnel at various organizations, including educational research centers, environmental organizations and conservation agencies, and state and federal agencies of interest to those in middle school science.\nA final category of reference materials is presented in chapter 9, \"Periodicals.\" This chapter contains annotations for almost 60 magazines. It includes titles not only for middle school science teachers but for their students as well. The annotations indicate the grade level for which each title is recommended.\n\nOCR for page 266\nResources for Teaching Middle School Science\nThe periodicals annotated in chapter 9 were chosen for their excellence as instructional tools, for the quality of their articles and stories on scientific topics, for their appeal to young adolescents, and for their adaptability to classroom use. They offer current information in the sciences, ideas and activities for science teaching, and engaging reading matter for students. The variety of periodicals annotated in chapter 9 includes, for example\u2014\nmagazines for middle school science teachers that include features on \"big ideas\" in mathematics and science education; a periodical containing articles by teachers about hands-on learning, problem solving, and a multidisciplinary approach to teaching science and mathematics;\nan international journal of research in science education; a journal designed to further understanding of intermediate education and the implementation of effective practices at the middle school level; a periodical on innovations in science teaching, current developments in science, and classroom projects and experiments; a journal that addresses the needs of both new and veteran middle school teachers;\npublications by science educators and scientists that cover news, research, and issues related to specific disciplines or fields, such as aerospace, astronomy, biology, chemistry, physics, and earth sciences;\npublications on electronic learning that focus on educational technology, including in-depth reviews of software and hardware, information on new products available to educators, coverage of all aspects of precollege educational technology such as telecommunications\/distance learning, computer literacy, and hypermedia\/multimedia;\nstudent periodicals that cover a wide range of topics\u2014from science news, science careers, and competitions and experiments to natural history, marine biology, the environment, wildlife, space travel, technology, and achievements of young people and adults.\nThe listings in chapters 7 through 9 are not exhaustive. Teachers are encouraged to\n\nOCR for page 267\nResources for Teaching Middle School Science\nkeep their eyes open for new or other publications for their own lists of references. The absence of any volume or periodical from these lists is not intended as a comment on its quality or usefulness.\nInsofar as possible, the most current edition of a publication is annotated in part 3. However, later editions of some volumes, particularly annual or biannual directories, may have appeared after the text of Resources for Teaching Middle School Science was completed.\nOrdering Information\nPrices for the books and periodicals in chapters 7 through 9 are given in the annotations. Costs for shipping and handling are not included. The addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses, when available, for publishers of these materials are in appendix A, \"Publishers and Suppliers.\"\nEvery effort was made to provide accurate, up-to-date ordering information. However, because of frequent changes in company names, addresses, and telephone and fax numbers, readers may wish to consult annually updated directories, such as NSTA Science Education Suppliers (see 8.22), or standard reference directories such as Books in Print from their local libraries or bookstores.\nLikewise, because prices and availability may change, readers should check the prices of publications or supplies listed before placing an order. They are encouraged to contact publishers directly for current ordering information (including shipping charges).

This program immerses middle and high-school science teachers in research being conducted at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science and the Center of Marine Biotechnology. The ultimate goal of this program is for teachers to learn to use current research to deliver stimulating lessons to students.\n\nIn Spinicchia's case, that will mean introducing his students to a state-of-the-art environmental diagnostic test and connecting their observations of DNA under classroom microscopes to real-world environmental issues in their backyards.\n\nWhile a fellow at the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory in Solomons, MD, Spinicchia worked under the guidance of Dr. Carys Mitchelmore, who works to develop novel biomarkers - early warning diagnostic tools using molecular techniques - to detect environmental problems before they cause disease, genetic defects, or death. She involved Spinicchia in the research needed to develop and optimize a test called the Comet Assay for use with blood cells from reptiles.\n\n\"This test has been used to detect DNA damage in many fish and invertebrate species, but never with reptiles,\" Spinicchia said enthusiastically. \"Dr. Mitchelmore is planning to publish our results to show that it can be used with reptiles.\"\n\n\"The test reveals nonspecific genotoxic damage - single-strand breaks in the DNA,\" Spinicchia explains. \"It is called the Comet Assay because, at the end of the process, the damaged strand of DNA leaks out of the cell membrane and looks like a comet tail. The longer the tail, the greater the damage,\" he says.\n\nOnce scientists have been alerted to an environmental problem by observing DNA damage, they can use specific tests to determine the causes.\n\nSpinicchia is looking forward to using this project to teach his students about DNA and new lab technologies. \"One of the hardest things is teaching students how to make scientific inferences. If I can teach them with something concrete like this, something they can visualize, they can learn to make [these] inferences,\" he says.\n\nWhile many high school teachers spend their summers catching a bit of sunshine, John Spinicchia spent six weeks of his in a dark laboratory at the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory.\n\nMaryland Sea Grant Extension Program\nUniversity of Maryland\nCollege Park, MD 20742"}

To reinforce this idea, do the following\ndemonstration:\n\n6.\nHold up a slice a bread and tell students that one slice of bread\ncontains approximately 100 calories of energy. If they eat the bread,\nthey will get all 100 calories of energy to use for moving,\ngrowing, and making heat.\n\nNow cut the bread into 10 pieces. Explain that if a cow eats the\nbread instead, and students then eat a burger made from that\ncow's meat, they would get only 10 percent of the energy from\nthat slice of bread. (Hold up one of the bread pieces.) That's\nbecause the cow uses 90 calories or 9\/10 (90%) of the energy in\nthe bread to move, grow, and make heat. Only 10 calories or 1\/10\n(10%) of the energy from the bread gets stored in the cow's\nmeat and is available to students when they eat the hamburger.\n\n7.\nAsk students:\n\nWhat happens to all the trash you throw away at lunch?\nWhere does it go? What happens to it there?\n\nWhat happens to the energy stored in uneaten food\nand in dead plants and animals?\n\n13.\nHave students draw pictures of the living things mentioned in the\nvideo. On a bulletin board construct a huge food chain, using\nthese organisms and others that might be found in the ocean,\nto show how energy flows through this ecosystem.\n\n14.

We need this information to help us with climate, weather, and ocean research. They are being used in the Southern Ocean on the Our Far South expedition. Argos are like Underwater Robots that float around at about 1000m (1 km) below sea level. They float here for 9 days, then sink down to about 2 kilometres of depth before they come up to the surface.

Science Live\nThis site is a great place to look for science presenters, shows and workshops for your school. You can search by region, theme and much more. There is also impartial reviews from teachers so you can see if they are any good. Check out the site and our 5 star reviews here. ScienceLive.net\n\n2. Centre of the Cell\nOne of our recent finds, this site is brilliant if you are trying to find resources on cells and alternative \/ different careers in the health service. The website has games, interactive resources, case studies of patients, a cellpedia with explanations of everything to do with cells and curriculum links. You can also book to visit the Centre of the Cell centre in London! You can also follow them on twitter @CentreoftheCell\n\n3. Cosmonline\nIf you pick up the free metro newspaper (available on buses and trains), you may read a feature called MetroCosm which explains lots of physics stories such as space missions and nuclear physics. I know, tough going if you are reading it on the way to work in the morning. However the guy that writes and draws the feature (@Ben_Gilliland ) does a fab job of making it easy with simply pictures and explanations. CosmOnline is his website version of the articles and stories as well as resources and competitions for schools.\n\nWe also love this site as we are going to be a guest blogger for the site with our Physiology in Film blogs! These will explain anything physiology based that appears in a film, such as when Daniel Craig is poisoned with Digoxin in James Bond \u2013 Casino Royale.\n\n4. Science Oxford & Science Oxford Next\nIf you are based on Oxford and the surrounding areas, these websites are for you. The provide STEM resources as well as run a public science centre. Our favourite part of their website is the LifeLab which is a careers resource for pupils to use to find different jobs in their favourite STEM subjects. There are profiles of real scientists and information on what they do, how they got there and how much they earn. You can also follow them on twitter @scienceoxford\n\nThis site is great resource which runs events several times a year where pupils have the opportunity to ask questions directly to scientists via a video link up. It is a bit like the X-Factor for scientists! All you have to do is visit the site and register for the next event. There are some great videos explaining how it all works and what it is all about. Follow them on twitter @imascientist\n\nOk, this is our own website and blog which you will probably already know about. BUT did you know we have a YouTube Channel called ClassroomMedicsTV ?\n\nYou can watch free videos on careers, science resources and post workshop activities for those that have used our workshops. We are constantly adding to the videos and have a lot of exciting plans for the next few months.\n\nYou will soon be able to download a PDF resource with lesson plans and links to videos from our main website. Keep an eye out for news on this! You can also leave us a comment below asking us to create a resource of video that explains something biological, medical, health or career related and we will see what we can do.

But we, too, have wondered\u2014how can we do better\nat teaching kids to answer their own questions? How can we assist classroom\nteachers in teaching their students to \"do science?\"\n\nThe life\/earth sciences\nactivities described in the web pages that follow represent our initial effort\nto aid young students in acquiring the inquiry skills needed to do science.\n\"Inquiry-centered science\" [2] is crucial to the development of\nthese skills. Although each of the activities we outline has its associated\ncontent, all modules have at their center a 45-80 minute long hands-on activity\nthat engages kids. We want them to DO science. While recognizing\nthat there are questions in a number of areas that science cannot answer,\nquestions about the way the natural world works are ideally suited for scientific\ninvestigation.\n\nScience doesn't\nhave to be complicated and jargon-rich (especially for elementary school students).\nIn all activities we emphasize that science as a process is fairly straightforward.\nIn fact, our favorite definition of science comes from the physicist Richard\nFeynman, who described science as \"a special method of finding things\nout.\" [3] Very challenging, but pretty simple.\n\nThe phrase \"THE\nscientific method\" may be a bit misleading. Biologists study variation\nin the traits of organisms, and the very methods that scientists use to ask\nand answer questions might be viewed as a variable trait. Some scientists\ndo things one way, some another; some emphasize experimental tests, some observations,\nsome complex mathematical models. But there are fundamental steps in the scientific\nprocess that almost all scientists use, and those steps are what we highlight\nas \"the methodS of science.\" The integral components\nare: observing, wondering, did we say observing?, hypothesizing or predicting,\nexperimenting, analyzing, concluding, inferring, communicating, observing,\nwondering\u2026Unfortunately there is no explicit step in the method(s) for\n\"having an idea\" or \"creativity\" or \"imagination.\"\nBut basically science in the absence of imagination isn't science, as\ncreativity is a necessary component in every step of the process of \"doing\nscience.\"\n\nAll the activities we\nuse to teach students how to \"do science\" stress the following components\nof the Methods of Science:\n\nObservation of nature\n\nWondering why?\n\nForming hypotheses\n(in an \"If... Then...\" format) and making predictions\n\nBy using the scientific\nmethod repeatedly in a variety of hands-on science activities over the course\nof a school year we hope that students and their teachers will view \"doing\nscience\" as not only an enjoyable activity, but also a useful method\nto use to learn about nature and how things work.\n\n[1] In an underwater \"caged death match\" the shark will win.\n[2] Science for All Children, 1997, National Academy Press.\n[3] The Meaning of It All: Thoughts of a Citizen Scientist. 1998.\nMichelle and Carl Feynman.

{"text":"Description\n\nIdeas For Use\n\nThoughtful placement of fiction and nonfiction picture books within the BSCS 5E Instructional Model can motivate students to learn about science, allow them to evaluate their findings in the light of alternative explanations, and help them understand scientific concepts and vocabulary without taking away from the joy of discovery.\n\nChallenge students to accept and share responsibility for their own learning.\n\nTeachers provide students with the time, space, and resources needed to learn science.\n\nCreate a setting for student work that is flexible and supportive of science inquiry.\n\nCustomer Reviews\n\nbasic introduction to 5Es\n\nReviewed by: Tina Harris (Bloomington, IN) on December 31, 2012\n\nThis chapter goes over the 5E's of inquiry and what each looks like in a classroom through examples and tables that provide examples of what teachers and students should and should not be doing at each step.\nWhile it does not sound like it, this is a guideline for perfect 5E lessons, not how to get there. Other chapters may provide that information, so as long as teachers new to this mode of teaching understand that it may take several lessons focusing on different aspects of the model to finally be able to describe their lesson characteristics as being totally inquiry (according to this model) and work towards this goal, then this is a useful guide! Remember both the teacher and the students need time to be comfortable with this pedagogy but it does give students more ownership for their own learning and that is worth the effort.\n\nExcellent resource!\n\nReviewed by: Kendra Young (Lake Stevens, WA) on December 5, 2011\n\nI would highly recommend this resource to anyone who is unfamiliar with the 5E instructional model. It not only gives a down-to-earth description of what should take place in each phase of instruction, but also gives some very helpful descriptions of how the roles for students and teachers change in this method, which (if done correctly) ensures true inquiry in your classroom.\n\nMore Picture Perfect Science\n\nReviewed by: Kathy Renfrew (Barnet, VT) on April 7, 2011\n\nThis is one of the best books to help teachers begin to implement inquiry science and also teach some literacy skills.\nWhen I use one of the tradebooks and\/or lessons that are included, I use it as part of a bigger unit, but as I said before, it's a great way to get some beginning science into the classroom.\n\nGood overview of 5E Instruction\n\nReviewed by: Wendy Ruchti (Pocatello, ID) on March 26, 2011\n\nI love the Picture Perfect books and this chapter serves as a concise overview of the instructional model used (5E) in each of the chapters of the book."}

{"text":"Standards Central Fordham's Reviews from the U.S. and Abroad\n\nGeorgia\n\nOverview\n\nThe extraordinary unevenness of the Georgia standards reflects the disorganization of the parts. Some areas are strong and some adequate, while others lag badly. Although the end product is mediocre, better editing and a bit more attention to detail could significantly improve the standards.\n\nOrganization of the Standards\n\nGeorgia presents its science learning expectations by grade for K-8 and by course for high school. Content standards and \"characteristics\" (or inquiry) standards are presented for each grade and course. Grades K-5 each cover earth, life, and physical sciences. Sixth grade focuses exclusively on earth science, seventh grade on life science, and eighth grade on physical science.\n\nAt the high school level, the Georgia standards offer a bewilderingly large number of courses. In addition to the traditional biology, chemistry, and physics courses, there are astronomy, botany, earth systems, ecology, entomology, environmental science, epidemiology, forensic science, geology, human anatomy and physiology, meteorology, microbiology, oceanography, physical science, and zoology. As these courses fall outside the conventional, much broader core science curriculum\u2014and as we have no idea when and how these myriad specialized courses are worked into students' learning plans\u2014we have focused this review solely on the four core subjects.\n\nThe Peach State also presents a series of framework documents, one for each grade, K-8, and for physics, chemistry, biology, and physical science in high school. Within each of these documents is a strange mixture of classroom activities, lesson plans, common misconceptions, and key questions. The presentation within these documents is so sketchy, and the organization so chaotic, that a full evaluation is impossible, if not inappropriate. We therefore limit our discussion to the standards documents.\n\nContent & Rigor\n\nGeorgia has produced a frustratingly spotty set of standards that range from excellent (life science) to pretty bad (physics and chemistry). When good, the material is well written, concrete, and thorough, with ambitious but not unreasonable expectations for what students ought to know, in both the lower and upper grades. Unfortunately, such moments are not the norm. In too many instances, the material is sloppily presented, unfocused, or poorly supported.\n\nScientific Inquiry and Methodology\n\nThe Georgia standards contain good, clear statements on process. For example, in fifth grade: \"Similar scientific investigations seldom produce exactly the same results, which may differ due to unexpected differences in what is being investigated, unrecognized differences in the methods or circumstances of the investigation, or observational uncertainties.\" Well put.\n\nPhysical Science\n\nThe physical science standards are decidedly mixed. Some content is covered with depth and rigor. For example, the first-grade handling of light, sound, and magnetism is quite good. The standards take note of the fact that magnetic force is not blocked by paper, for example. Second grade introduces energy, but never deals with the question (tricky at this level) of what energy is. In third grade, heat is introduced nicely, and magnetism (introduced two grades earlier) is expanded. The introduction in fourth grade of optics\u2014including mirrors, lenses, and prisms\u2014is excellent.\n\nTwo specific examples will suffice to show how very good the standards can be. In eighth grade:\n\nStudents will have the computation and estimation skills necessary for analyzing data and following scientific explanations.\n\nAnalyze scientific data by using, interpreting, and comparing numbers in several equivalent forms, such as integers, fractions, decimals, and percents.\n\nFind the mean, median, and mode and use them to analyze a set of scientific data.\n\nApply the metric system to scientific investigations that include metric to metric conversions (i.e., centimeters to meters).\n\nDecide what degree of precision is adequate, and round off appropriately.\n\nAddress the relationship between accuracy and precision.\n\nUse ratios and proportions, including constant rates, in appropriate problems. (grade 8)\n\nAnd at the high school level:\n\nStudents will explore the nature of matter, its classifications, and its system for naming types of matter.\n\nCalculate density when given a means to determine a substance's mass and volume.\n\nPredict formulas for stable binary ionic compounds based on balance of charges.\n\nUse IUPAC nomenclature for transition between chemical names and chemical formulas of\n\nApply the Law of Conservation of Matter by balancing the following types of chemical equations:\n\nSynthesis\n\nDecomposition\n\nSingle Replacement\n\nDouble Replacement. (high school physical science)\n\nSadly, as often as they are this good, the standards fail to outline sufficiently the content that students need to learn. For instance, gravitation is introduced in Kindergarten, but in a way that is likely to confuse more than clarify. Specifically, students are asked to \"observe and communicate effects of gravity on objects,\" and to:\n\nRecognize that some things, such as airplanes and birds, are in the sky, but return to earth.\n\nRecognize that the sun, moon, and stars are in the sky, but don't come down.\n\nExplain why a book does not fall down if it is placed on a table, but will fall down if it is dropped. (Kindergarten)\n\nIs the Kindergartner to conclude that gravity affects books always, airplanes sometimes, but stars never? In the child's first encounter with a phenomenon, it is best to present the simple and obvious first, and then move on to the complications.\n\nThen in fifth grade, students are presented with this statement: \"In simple terms, a chemical change cannot be reversed and a physical change can.\" Clearly, however, neither part of this statement is true. The melting of butter is an irreversible physical change, while the chemical reaction 2Hg + O2 \u2194 2HgO is readily reversible.\n\nAnd here is the sum total of the eighth-grade coverage of mechanics:\n\nStudents will investigate relationship between force, mass, and the motion of objects.\n\nDetermine the relationship between velocity and acceleration.\n\nDemonstrate the effect of balanced and unbalanced forces on an object in terms of gravity, inertia, and friction.\n\nHigh School Physics\n\nThe high school physics course is divided into five major concepts\/skills: kinematics, energy and its transformations, electricity, magnetism, and wave properties. To the physicist's eye, this is a very strange\u2014and illogical\u2014division. Kinematics without dynamics is pointless; electricity and magnetism belong together (as indeed they are in Georgia's standards for the lower grades); and heat and thermodynamics are missing, as are optics and pretty much all of modern physics.\n\nGetting down to detail, Newtonian dynamics is telescoped into a few words; nuclear fission and fusion are introduced without preparation, under an \"energy\" standard that precedes the standard containing the basics of the work-energy theorem, energy conservation, and the mere mention of potential energy. The rest is mere chaos, ending with a section devoted to relativity.\n\nHigh School Chemistry\n\nOnly about a page and a half of the standards are dedicated to actual chemistry content; predictably, much essential content is missing. For instance, there is nothing on the important topic of gases. Nor is there anything about Lewis dot structures or how they can help predict the shape and polarity of molecules. The topic of chemical bonding is reduced to \"compare and contrast types of chemical bonds (i.e., ionic, covalent).\" Hydrogen bonding and metallic bonding are completely missing. Also missing is any mention of oxidation\/reduction. The important topic of chemical equilibrium (and Le Ch\u00e2telier's principle) is reduced to a meaningless standard asking students to \"explain the role of Equilibrium in chemical reactions.\" There is no mention of carbon (organic) chemistry, and the periodic table section is inadequate. If basic topics like groups (chemical families), periods, metallic, nonmetallic, and metalloid regions, and so forth, are not taught in primary and middle school grades, then they need to be addressed in high school chemistry. (High school physical science contains some topics, like specific heat and conductivity of solutions, that should have been included in chemistry.)\n\nEarth and Space Science\n\nThe earth and space standards taken alone (that is, ignoring the framework documents) are well written, reasonably ambitious, and complete. The standards for Kindergarten through eighth grade have some weaknesses in rocks and minerals and details of plate tectonics. The high school material is contained in a large collection of high school courses. Though none of the courses related to earth and space material addressed all our suggested content, each was well written and could lead to an interesting and serious semester course. It is not clear, however, which or how many students would take those courses.\n\nGeorgia offers some particularly nicely written entries, for instance:\n\nStudents will model the position and motion of the earth in the solar system and will explain the role of relative position and motion in determining sequence of the phases of the moon. (grade 4)\n\nDemonstrate the relative size and order from the sun of the planets in the solar system. (grade 4)\n\nCompare and contrast the Earth's crust, mantle, and core including temperature, density, and composition. (grade 6)\n\nRelate the Nature of Science to the progression of basic historical scientific models (geocentric, heliocentric) as they describe our solar system, and the Big Bang as it describes the formation of the universe. (grade 6)\n\nEach of these examples displays good knowledge of the subject and how students might demonstrate deep understanding. The entry on the layers of the solid earth calls out the specific properties of each layer that sixth graders should be able to understand. Modeling the geometry of moon phases is a great way to demonstrate an understanding of motions in the solar system. Relating the progression of historical ideas about important models is a sophisticated way to address the science behind current understandings.\n\nLife Science\n\nUnlike the other disciplines, the presentation of life science material is quite good, typified by the systematic treatment of evolution in middle school. It begins with a fine general statement in the benchmarks covering sixth through eighth grades:\n\nDuring middle school, several lines of evidence are further developed. The fossil evidence can be expanded beyond extinctions and survivals to the notion of biological history. Sedimentation of rock can be brought in to show relative age. However, actual age, which requires an understanding of isotopic dating techniques, should wait until high school, when students learn about the structure of atoms. Breeding experiments can illustrate the heritability of traits and the effects of selection. (grades 6-8)\n\nFurther, Georgia's standards are one of the few to discuss Darwin prior to the high school level:\n\nExplain that physical characteristics of organisms have changed over successive generations (e.g., Darwin's finches and peppered moths of Manchester).\n\nDescribe ways in which species on earth have evolved due to natural selection.\n\nTrace evidence that the fossil record found in sedimentary rock provides evidence for the long history of changing life forms. (grade 7)\n\nHigh school biology coverage is sound and generally complete, tackling organelles, mitosis and meiosis, Mendel's Law, and photosynthesis well (to name a few subjects). The standards' focus on the cell and molecular-level content offers thoughtful overviews and good specific examples. Unfortunately, the strong seventh-grade coverage of evolution is not carried along to high school, where coverage of evolution is missing such key concepts as DNA or the sequences of amino acids\u2014though it does include coverage of molecular and anatomical evidence.\n\nClarity & Specificity\n\nAs is the case with the content and rigor of Georgia's standards, much inconsistency of quality is seen in terms of clarity and specificity. When they are good, the Georgia standards offer information accurately and in simple prose. We have cited several examples of this fine work above. But when they are bad, they produce brief and vapid expressions, as in: \"Explain the role of equilibrium in chemical reactions\" (high school chemistry). More detail is ardently desired, yet none is forthcoming.\n\nIn some places, the standards' brevity leaves the reader confused, as in the following example:\n\nMeasure and calculate the magnitude of frictional forces and Newton's three Laws of Motion. (high school physics)\n\nThis is both an illogical combination and a mighty tall order to compress all of Newton's laws (e.g., all of dynamics) into half of a fourteen-word statement. The result, of course, is neither clear nor specific. And then there's this:\n\nDetermine the heat capacity of a substance using mass, specific heat, and temperature. (high school physical science)\n\nThe intent, doubtless, was something like, \"Calculate the quantity of heat absorbed or given out by an object when its mass, specific heat, and temperature change are known.\" But as written, the passage is not only confusing, it's simply wrong."}

{"text":"This unit of lessons is designed to bring scientific process\nskills and current research into the high school classroom. The unit revolves\naround the question: how extensive is the alien plant invasion in the\nKing's Canyon Wash area? Kings Canyon Wash is located in the Saguaro National\nPark. The students contribute to the Park's management efforts by identifying\ninvasive plant species, determining the range and abundance of the invasive\nplants, studying their impact on the local ecosystem, and participating\nin management techniques (such as removal or monitor distribution). The\nstudents identify common native plants and invasive species, conduct a\nfield study at the Park, and collect and analyze their data. By collecting\ndata over long periods of time, they can begin to see the effects management\ndecisions and invasive plant species have on the local ecology. The students\nare also encourage to propose other research projects.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMy\npurpose for designing this class project is threefold: first, to help\nstudents connect science knowledge and \"doing\" science; second, to involve\nstudents in research, and third, to help students contribute to their\ncommunity. In the past, many of my students have learned about science\nby reading, listening, and doing labs that demonstrate an already known\nconcept. I would like them to be involved in real science--looking at\na problem and solving it through the scientific method. By involving them\nin current research they will see how scientists work and how each of\ntheir contributions helps a bigger puzzle be placed together. What they\nlearn about the local ecology will benefit both the National Park Service\nand other students. Finally, I want the students to feel they have made\na difference or done something that is valuable for the community.\n\nThe vehicle I am using to accomplish these three goals\nis a field study project at Saguaro National Park West in Tucson, Arizona.\nThe park monitors the organisms that live there in order allow the natural\necosystems to be preserved for the future. The park rangers are constantly\nsurveying and studying the populations to identify management techniques\nthat need to be used to fulfill this purpose. The students would be assisting\nin this effort while they learn and contribute to their community. They\nwould be learning and using the scientific method, and gaining knowledge\nabout plants, the desert, and population interactions (ecology) through\na dynamic, hands-on, authentic approach.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe student will be able to:\n\nDescribe the purpose of National Parks and Monuments.\n\nDescribe three ways alien plant species affect native\npopulations of plants and animals.\n\nProperly set up a study plot.\n\nMeasure and lay out stakes\n\nMeasure plant diameters.\n\nMake a map of the plot.\n\nCalculate percent coverage of native plants and aliens.\n\nUse a computer spreadsheet to calculate individual\nplot and class group results.\n\nUse a computer graphing program to graph results.\n\nIdentify 10 native plants excluding grasses from live\nor pressed specimens by common name.\n\nIdentify 5 grasses from live or pressed specimens by\ncommon name.\n\nDescribe three types of control for plants.\n\nI would like for this project to be a continuing research\nexperience for my classes. Once the students have quantified the problem\nin King's Canyon, they will be able to apply some mechanical control in\npart of the plots, and allow other plots to continue untouched. A few\nmonths later they can measure and see how effective the control was. Next\nyear's class can assess how effective the previous class was and continue\nto monitor the area. Ten years from now we might know how best to control\nalien plant species in King's Canyon!!"}

Use \"Pick a\nStudent\" button in CPS to select 2 -3 students to share their\nanswers.\nWhat are some of the differences in the way you regard the\nSun, and the way an ancient Egyptian teenager would have\nregarded it?\n(Note: Use \"Pick a Student\" button in CPS)\nPRESENTATION\n1. The Sun's Energy\na. The Source of the Sun's Energy\n(1) Hermann von Helmholtz and Lord Kelvin\nproposed that the source of the Sun's energy\nwas a very slow gravitational contraction \u2013\nshrinking caused by the force of gravity.\n(2) Einstein proposed his special theory of\nrelativity, and scientists began considering that\nmass can be converted to energy, and energy\ninto mass.\nb. The Nuclear Fusion Power of the Sun\n(1) An atom's nucleus, which is most of the atom's\nmass, is made up of two kinds of particles:\nprotons, positively charged particles; and\nneutrons, particles with no electrical charge.\n(2) In nuclear fusion, two nuclei combine to form a\nlarger nucleus. They \"fuse.\"\nLesson One, The Sun and Its Domain\n129\nChapter Three, The Sun and the Solar System\n(3) The primary source of the Sun's energy, then, is\na series of nuclear fusion reactions.\n2. The Sun's Core, Atmosphere, and Sunspots\na. The Sun's Equilibrium\n(1) The Sun is in a state of equilibrium, or balance,\nneither noticeably contracting nor expanding.\nThe equilibrium conditions in the Sun are\nknown as hydrostatic equilibrium.\n(2) The gas at the center of the Sun is supporting\nthe weight of the gas all the way out to the\nsurface, so you should expect great pressures at\nthe center. This tremendous pressure pushes\nprotons close enough together that hydrogen\nfusion can take place.\n(3) The fusion reactions in the core provide a heat\nsource. When a gas is heated, it tends to\nexpand. The Sun exists in a state of\nequilibrium, with the force of gravity balanced\nby forces tending to expand the gas.\nb. The Three Modes of Solar Energy Transfer\n(1) Conduction is the transfer of energy in a solid\nby collisions between atoms and\/or molecules.\nIn order for conduction to take place, the\nparticles of the substance must be in close\ncontact. This is rarely the case in stars, so\nconduction is not a significant factor in\ntransporting energy from within the Sun.\n(2) Convection occurs when the atoms of a warm\nliquid or gas move from one place to another.\nIn the case of the Sun, this condition is met only\nin the region within about 125,000 miles of the\nsurface. In this region, convection constantly\nmixes the solar material as hot gas rises and\ncooler gas descends.\n(3) Radiation is the transfer of energy by\nelectromagnetic waves. Radiation is the\nLesson One, The Sun and Its Domain\n130\nChapter Three, The Sun and the Solar System\nprincipal means of energy transfer inside the\nSun.\nc. The Three Layers of the Sun's Atmosphere\n(1) Photosphere is the visible part of the Sun and\nthat part of the solar atmosphere that emits\nlight. The photosphere is about 250 miles thick.\nThe variation in brightness is a result of hot\nareas within the photosphere rising and falling\nwithin the region \u2013 variations in temperature\nproduce variations in brightness.\n(2) Chromosphere is the region between the\nphotosphere and the corona. This is where\nsolar flares and eruptions come from.\n(3) Corona is the outermost portion of the Sun's\natmosphere. This region extends for hundreds\nof thousands of miles from the Sun and can be\nseen during total solar eclipses.\nd. The Solar Wind\n(1) Solar wind is a continuous outflow of charged\nparticles from the Sun, mostly in the form of\nprotons and electrons.\n(2) Moving at about 249 miles per second near\nEarth, it plays a significant role in space weather\nactivity.\n(3) One of its effects is to cause comet tails to point\naway from the Sun as its particles sweep comet\nmaterial along with them. Another dramatic\neffect is the auroras you can see near the Earth's\npoles.\ne. The Impact of Sunspots and Solar Flares on Earth's\nClimate\n(1) Sunspots are the dark spots appearing\nperiodically in groups on the Sun's surface.\n(2) Alexander Wilson proposed in the late\neighteenth century that sunspots were actually\nLesson One, The Sun and Its Domain\n131\nChapter Three, The Sun and the Solar System\nwindows of a sort, showing glimpses of a cooler\nsurface beneath the hot outer layer of the Sun.\n(3) William Herschel suggested that the interior of\nthe Sun might be cool enough to support life.\n(4) Between 1645 and 1715, scientists saw very few\nsunspots. At the same time, the Earth went\nthrough a \"little ice age.\" These incidents\nsuggest a clear connection between changes in\nsolar activity and the Earth's climate.\n(5) A solar flare is an explosion near or at the\nSun's surface, seen as an increase in activity\nsuch as prominences (bulges). In just a few\nseconds, flares can heat solar material to tens of\nmillions of degrees. They also eject solar\nparticles at very high speeds. In the largest\nflares, these particles reach Earth in less than an\nhour. They not only cause spectacular auroras,\nbut also disrupt radio transmissions on Earth.\n3. The Solar System's Structure\na. Sizes of Planets and Distances From the Sun\n(1) The Sun makes up more than 99 percent of the\nSolar System's mass. It is 10 times larger in\ndiameter than Jupiter, the largest planet. The\nSun's diameter is about 862,000 miles. In other\nwords, the Sun's diameter is about 110 times\nthat of Earth.\n(2) Think of the Sun as an object the size of a\nbasketball, a sphere 9.4 inches in diameter.\nNow consider the distances between the planets.\nPut the basketball (the Sun) at one end of a\ntennis court. A pin at the opposite end of the\ntennis court would be Earth. A one-inch ball\none and a half football fields away would be\nJupiter. Pluto would be a grain of sand a\nkilometer (6\/10 of a mile) away.\nLesson One, The Sun and Its Domain\n132\nChapter Three, The Sun and the Solar System\nb. How the Solar System Formed\n(1) There is no single evolutionary theory for the\nsolar system's origin. But there are several\ntheories that share common ideas about how the\nsolar system came to be as part of a natural\nsequence of events.\n(2) Ren\u00e8 Descartes in 1644 suggested that the Solar\nSystem formed out of a gigantic whirlpool, or\nvortex, in some type of universal fluid.\n(3) Catastrophe theory does not refer to a disaster.\nRather, it refers to an unusual event. In 1745,\nGeorge Lewis de Buffon proposed the passage\nof a comet close to the Sun. The comet pulled\nmaterial out of the Sun to form the planets.\nAstronomers now know this was not possible,\nbut it seemed plausible at the time.\n(4) More recently, some thought that perhaps the\nSun was once part of a triple-star system \u2013 three\nstars revolving around one another.\n(5) Catastrophe theories have been nearly\nabandoned in favor of modern evolutionary\ntheories. These hold that the formation of the\nSolar System resulted from gravitational forces\nand pressures on heat and mass.\n(6) In the 1940s, German scientist Carl von\nWeizsaecker showed that different areas of a\ngas disk rotating around the Sun would not all\nrotate at the same speed. The inner portion\nwould move faster than the outer. Eddies would\nform as a result.\n(7) The farther from the Sun, the larger these eddies\nwould be. These eddies are the beginnings of\nplanet formation.\n(8) Scientists now believe that stars such as the Sun\nform from vast clouds of interstellar gas and\ndust. When the cloud collapses, any rotation\nthat it had at the beginning greatly increased in\nthe central portion.\nLesson One, The Sun and Its Domain\n133\nChapter Three, The Sun and the Solar System\n(9) Newton's laws predict this increase, which\nresults from the law of conservation of angular\nmomentum. This law says an object will spin\nmore slowly as resistance increases and spin\nfaster as resistance decreases. Over millions of\nyears, the material in the central portion\nbecomes a star.\nc. Classifying Objects in the Solar System\n(1) The four innermost planets \u2013 Mercury, Venus,\nEarth and Mars \u2013 are called the terrestrial\nplanets because of their similarity to Earth. The\nnext four planets \u2013 Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and\nNeptune \u2013 are called the Jovian planets because\nof their similarity to Jupiter. Pluto is now\nconsidered a dwarf planet.\n(2) A planet is a celestial body that orbits the Sun,\nhas sufficient mass for its self-gravity to\novercome rigid body forces so that it assumes a\nnearly round shape, and has cleared the\nneighborhood around its orbit.\n(3) A dwarf planet has the same first two qualities\nlisted above, but has not cleared the\nneighborhood around its orbit. In fact, Pluto\nactually crosses inside Neptune's orbit for about\n20 years of its 248-year orbital period.\nCPS Learning Check Questions (3 - 4)\nNote to teacher: Ask the following questions using the\nCPS:\n3.

There's a site I came across, Anatomy Corner, that enables you to relive your high school bio days.\n\nIt is also good for kids doing projects that require knowing about the human body. There's a Powerpoint presentation on an \"Introduction to Anatomy and Physiology,\" if you slept during high school biology class, and illustrations galore!\n\nWe still have the good old-fashioned Gray's Anatomy: The Anatomical Basis of Medicine and Surgery [R 611 GRA] for your nonvirtual anatomy study needs in our reference section or the Atlas of Anatomy [611 ATL], which may be borrowed. And for elementary school-age kids there's The Body Atlas by Steve Parker [J 611 PAR]."}

{"text":"Teacher Sheet\n\nActivity #38: A Magnet as a Magnetometer\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nTo make the student aware of the nature and significance of the earth's magnetic field. To show\nhow local fluctuations in this field can be used to locate underground materials having magnetic\nproperties.\n\nTIME\n\nPreliminary discussion 15 minutes, activity 40-50 minutes.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe magnetometer is an instrument which measures the strength of the earth's magnetic field.\nThis magnetic field is not uniform, but varies from place to place around the earth.\n\nIn one type of magnetometer, the proton magnetometer, an electric current is applied to a coil\naround a bottle containing a fluid such as kerosene. The electric field produced in this coil\nrealigns the protons in the fluid. When the electric current is shut off, the spinning protons again\nrealign to line up with the earth's magnetic field. In so doing, they generate a signal which is\nproportional to the strength of the immediate (local) magnetic field. This signal is amplified\nelectronically and measured by the use of counter circuits. The reading then appears on the digital\ndisplay of the instrument.\n\nOnce the magnetometer is adjusted for the area where it is to be used, it becomes an instrument\nfor detecting many buried features which affect local magnetism. Because compaction\nconcentrates magnetic particles in the soil, the magnetometer will indicate ancient roads and\ndwelling places. Since heating magnetizes clay particles used in brick making, walls of long\nburied buildings can be located. Since rocks are more compact than soil, making them more\nmagnetic, the magnetometer can detect the walls of long forgotten cities now buried. Certain ore\ndeposits are readily found with this instrument. It is the basis of the military mine detector.\n\nThe magnetometer is currently being used to detect buried drums which may contain hazardous\nwaste materials. Because these drums are made of steel, they have magnetic properties to which\nthe magnetometer is sensitive.\n\nMagnetometers measure magnetism in units called gammas. In Maine, the earth's magnetic field\nis normally 55,000 gammas. When this number is discounted, any change in magnetometer\nreadings is due to local effects, that is, objects or formations which have magnetic characteristics.\n\nMATERIALS\n\nStudents should work in groups; each group will need the following: a large flat plastic container\nseveral inches deep and at least 2 feet in the longest direction, loose filler material such as dry\nbeach sand or sawdust, iron object(s) at least 4 ounces in weight, a spring scale sensitive to .5\nounces, suspension apparatus (movable rack, see Appendix E for sample row and station\nassembly), a horseshoe or similar magnet capable of being held easily by the spring scale,\ntoothpicks, ruler, pens, and notebooks.\n\nPROCEDURE\n\nPlace the solid iron object(s) at random in the container and fill the container with the filler\nmaterial to a depth sufficient to completely cover the objects.\n\nHave students trace and mark a three-inch grid on the surface of the filler. Use toothpicks to\nmark the grid points. See line and station sequence on student sheets.\n\nBe certain the students keep the magnet a fixed distance above the filler when they make their\nreadings.\n\nSPECIAL SAFETY PRECAUTIONS\n\nNone\n\nFOLLOW-UP ACTIVITIES\n\nAfter several normal trials, start reducing the size of the objects buried and find the lower limits\nto the sensitivity of your \"magnetometer.\"\n\nConstruct a profile along one of the lines by using the scale readings as one axis and the reading\nstations as the other axis. Construct profiles for the other lines. Discuss any anomalies and\nexplain why these profiles are so useful.\n\nHave student teams bury objects and have other teams try to find them. The team hiding the\nobjects should try to develop \"strategy\" so that the hidden objects are not found. All objects must\nbe iron however.\n\nMATERIALS\n\nPROCEDURE\n\nYour teacher has buried at least one four-ounce iron object in the filler material in the tray. You\nwill construct a grid in the tray using toothpicks for markers. Follow the pattern below (two\ninches between lines and three inches between stations in the line.\n\nPATTERN FOR GRID\n\nLine A\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\nLine B\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\nLine C\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\nStation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nSet the first toothpicks one inch in from the edge of the plastic tray when establishing the first\nline. Be careful to make your grid very uniform in size and shape.\n\nAfter your grid is established, hang the magnet from the spring balance away from any metal\nobject, and record the weight of the magnet in the data table. This is your \"natural\" magnetic\nfield. Now move the magnet down each line stopping at each station. Make sure the magnet and\nspring are not moving. Observe the weight of the magnet at each station and record this value in\nyour data table. Be certain to keep the magnetometer a fixed distance above the sand.\n\nThe number of both lines and stations will depend on the overall size of your box. The above\npattern will grid a box 6 inches wide and 16 inches long.\n\nData and Observations:\n\n1. Record the \"natural\" weight of your magnet: ____________________________________\n\n2.

The idea of systems provides a framework in which students can investigate the four major interacting components of the earth system\u2014geosphere (crust, mantle, and core), hydrosphere (water), atmosphere (air), and the biosphere (the realm of all living things). In this holistic approach to studying the planet, physical, chemical, and biological processes act within and among the four components on a wide range of time scales to change continuously earth's crust, oceans, atmosphere, and living organisms. Their study of earth's history provides students with some evidence about co-evolution of the planet's main features\u2014the distribution of land and sea, features of the crust, the composition of the atmosphere, global climate, and populations of living organisms in the biosphere.\n\nThe material offering guidance for the standard explicitly ties the earth's history to the history of life:\n\nEarth's History\n\nThe earth processes we see today, including erosion, movement of lithospheric plates, and changes in atmospheric composition, are similar to those that occurred in the past. Earth's history is also influenced by occasional catastrophes, such as the impact of an asteroid or comet.\n\nFossils provide important evidence of how life and environmental conditions have changed.\n\nThe standards for grades 5\u20138 cover the nature of science in the section on the history and nature of science:\n\nAs a result of activities in grades 5\u20138, all students should develop an understanding of:\n\nScience as a human endeavor\n\nNature of science\n\nHistory of science\n\nThe guidance accompanying this standard offers the following discussion of these issuesIn areas where active research is being pursued and in which there is not a great deal of experimental or observational evidence and understanding, it is normal for scientists to differ with one another about the interpretation of the evidence or theory being considered. Different scientists might publish conflicting experimental results or might draw different conclusions from the same data.

{"text":"Teacher Sheet\n\nActivity #40: The Scoop on Slope (y=mx+b)\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nStudents will construct a slope measuring device, measure a series of slopes, and relate the\nconcept to physical structures around them.\n\nTIME\n\nOne 45 minute period, students working in groups of three.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nWhat do a mud slide, an avalanche, or an extreme erosion event all have in common? All are\ncommon tragedies in the newspaper or on television. They also have one physical character in\ncommon, and that is the concept of slope. Slope may be defined as a measurement of the\nsteepness of a surface. Students may also have definitions of \"rise over run\" and \"vertical drop\nover horizontal distance\" depending on their math experiences. The measurement of slope is a\ncommon practice with engineers, surveyors, foresters, housing contractors, architects, and\nnumerous other professionals. It is also found in laws and established standards for road\nconstruction, building access ramps, mining, and many environmental factors.\n\nIn this exercise students will construct a simple slope measuring device (clinometer) and measure\na series of slopes within their own school's area. Professionals may measure slope in a number of\ndifferent units. Two units are used in this activity and will be compared later in the exercise.\n\nMATERIALS\n\nEach group of three students will need the following - a soda straw, a piece of stiff cardboard,\nsome string, paper and white glue, masking tape, a small weight (quarter-ounce lead barrel\nsinkers work well), copies of clinometers (see attached sheet), and scissors. Each student will\nalso need pens and their notebook.\n\nPROCEDURES\n\nHave students glue model A or B from Figure 2 to the piece of cardboard and cut out around the\noutside margin. Using the tape, attach approximately 12 inches of string to point X on the\nclinometer you have selected to work with. Attach the small weight to the end of the string; the\nstring must swing freely from point X. Using two or three pieces of tape, attach a soda straw\nalong the straight edge of the scale. This will be your sight. See Figure 1 for steps 2, 3, and 4.\n\nHave students select three slopes around the school grounds. One of the group will act as a\ntarget; this person stands at the top of the slope. Another student sights through the clinometer at\nthe nose of the target student (see Figure 1). The third partner reads and records the position of\nthe string as it crosses the scale. Students should swap jobs so all have a turn using the\nclinometer. See data table on student pages.\n\nSPECIAL SAFETY PRECAUTIONS\n\nNone.\n\nFOLLOW-UP\n\nHave the students describe some of the variables that will affect the accuracy of their\nmeasurements (e.g., a four-foot student viewer using a six-foot student target).\n\nDetermine and discuss how slope is applied to:\n\nThe crown of a road\n\nSwitchbacks on steep mountain roads\n\nA flight of stairs\n\nMudslides in California\n\nRain runoff on your lawn\n\nThe entry ramp at the grocery store\n\nErosion in a plowed farm field\n\nBuilding a railroad\n\nHave students locate a copy of your town or city building codes for house lots or roads and\ndetermine if there is any reference to slope in the standards. If there are references, have students\ndiscuss why they are there.\n\nSlope may be measured in degrees, but engineers use percent slope for their unit of measurement.\nIf students used different units to measure slopes, have them compare these measurements and\ntry to mathematically relate % slope to slope in degrees.\n\nSOURCE\n\nActivity developed by James H. Barden, in conjunction with the 1991 CREST intern program.\n\nStudent Sheet\n\nActivity #40: The Scoop on Slope (y=mx+b)\n\nPURPOSE\n\nTo construct a device to measure slope and use this device to find out the slope of structures in\nyour immediate school environment.\n\nMATERIALS\n\nFor this activity you will work in groups of three. Each group will need the following: a soda\nstraw, a piece of stiff cardboard, a piece of string about 1 foot long, paper, white glue, masking\ntape, a small weight, a paper copy of the clinometers (Figure 2), a diagram of the finished\nproduct (Figure 3), and scissors. Each student will need their pens and notebook.\n\nPROCEDURE\n\nA device which measures a slope is called a clinometer. The following steps apply to the\nconstruction of the clinometers you will use in this exercise.\n\n1. Glue EITHER model A or B from Figure 2 onto a piece of stiff cardboard and cut out around\nthe outside margin.\n\n2. Using tape, attach approximately 12 inches of string to point X on the clinometer model you\nhave chosen to work with.\n\n3. Attach the small weight to the end of the string; the weight and string must swing freely from\npoint X.\n\n4. Using two or three pieces of tape, attach the soda straw carefully along the straight edge of\nyour scale. This will be your sight. See Figure 3 for steps 2, 3, and 4.\n\nThe next steps apply to using your clinometer to take slope readings.\n\n5. With your partners, select three sloped areas around the school ground to measure.\n\n6. With one of the partners as a target at the top of the slope, a second partner sights through the\nstraw at the NOSE of the target partner (see Figure 1). The sighting partner needs to hold the\nclinometer very steady.\n\n7. The third partner reads and records the position of the string as it crosses the scale.\n\n8.

Like most insect curricula, it is based on the premise that one of the best ways of reducing negative feelings toward insects is to provide people with positive experiences with insects while they are still young. However, whereas most entomology curricula are meant to be used as part of a one or two week insect \"unit,\" our curriculum is designed to enhance instruction on various biological themes that educators are required to teach anyway. (For example, the scientific method, classification, ecosystems, adaptations, etc.) In addition, all lessons are coordinated to the Florida Sunshine State Standards and provide activities that enhance FCAT skills. Currently the curriculum is targeted for 4th and 5th grade classrooms, although activities can easily be adapted for older and younger children, and can be used by 4H volunteers and county extension agents, or by any other informal educator."}
{"text":"At the beginning of each section of Biology Walls for Key Stage 3 is a page of 'building blocks' which acts as a checklist for learning. After a vocabulary page, which students can fill in as they work through the material, comes a series of worksheets to be completed.\n\nThese worksheets are highly illustrated and full of tasks and activities. They offer a straightforward way to set targets for pupils, as well as an efficient method of monitoring each student's progress. The worksheets are ideal to be photocopied and used within class as the material can easily be incorporated into the syllabus already in use in school. Alternatively, worksheets can be distributed to the pupils as homework or for revision purposes, as the book even includes information for parents, to enable them to become increasingly involved in their son or daughter's education. With such positive steps towards successful learning, the students self confidence within the subject grows and so their grades improve.\n\nBiology Walls for Key Stage 3 is designed to provide the opportunity for the enhancement of teaching style, as well as cross-phase continuity.

{"text":"How do we learn about the world around us? (Seeing, hearing, etc.) The ways that you have named can be called senses. In this lesson we are going to learn more about our senses, and how they help us to learn using our body parts.\n\nINSTRUCTION:\n\n(Each classroom connector will be introduced with an activity related to the sense taught.)\n\nThis classroom connector addresses Instructional Objective 2.01.A.\n\n1. Close your eyes. If I hold up pictures could you identify them without peeking? (No) Then could you identify with your eyes open? (Yes)\n\n2. Now will you please close your eyes and move around the room without running into anything. Was it hard to move around the room without running into things when you had your eyes closed? (Yes)\n\nA great deal of our learning is based on our ability to see what is happening around us. Therefore our eyes are very important to our learning. When you cannot see you are said to be blind. Point to the body part we are discussing and name other ways you can use your sight. (Make a chart and hang it in the room.)\n\nThis classroom connector addresses Instructional Objective 2.01.B.\n\n1. (Place earphones over the children's ears so they can experience life without hearing.)\n\n2. (Play an activity record and do not turn up the sound. Tell the children to follow directions as given by the record.)\n\nOur hearing is also important for learning to take place. If a person cannot hear they will not learn to talk. When you cannot hear you are said to be deaf. Many deaf people use hearing aids and sign language in order to communicate. Point to the body part you use to hear. (Make a chart of the things you hear in school and hang it in the room.)\n\nThis classroom connector addresses Instructional Objective 2.01.C.\n\n1. (Show sugar and salt. Identify by sight. Then taste to confirm the observation.)\n\n2. (Have a \"tasting party\" of snacks. Identify foods by taste only. Include foods such as fresh fruits, nuts, cheese, vegetables. Include familiar foods as well as some foods that may be new to the children.)\n\nWe use our tongues for tasting. Taste buds are located on our tongues and they help us to determine if foods are sweet or sour. Point to your tongue. Name other things that you can taste. (Make a chart and hang it in the room.)\n\nThis classroom connector addresses Instructional Objective 2.01.D.\n\n1. (Place different foods in small opaque containers with perforated lids. Have children identify foods by smell and then match the smell with a picture of the food, or the real food. Use chopped onions, lemon wedges, tuna, vanilla extract, etc.)\n\n2. Our sense of smell is something we might take for granted. Just imagine all of the wonderful smells we would miss if we did not have this special sense. Do you remember how good the kitchen smells when mother is baking a cake? (response) Point to your nose. Name other things you can smell in the room. (Make a chart and hang it in the room.)\n\nThis classroom connector addresses Instructional Objective 2.01.E.\n\n1. (Make a \"feel box\" or bag. Have students identify object by feeling.)\n\n2. (Try to discriminate containers of warm and cold water without touching.)\n\nOur sense of touch sometimes helps to keep us from hurting ourselves. If we feel the heat from a stove, we will not touch it. If we start to feel cold we get a sweater or coat to keep us warm. Our sense of touch lets us enjoy petting a soft kitten or feel the cool water in a swimming pool on a hot, summer day. Point to your hands. Name some other things you could touch in the room. Make a chart and hang it in the room.\n\nINSTRUCTION:\n\n(After discussing with the students each activity and what we learn from each, compare learning with and without senses. Explain that the senses are necessary for human beings to experience the world around them.)\n\nACTIVE PARTICIPATION:\n\n(Have children list ways each sense is beneficial. Show pictures and have children respond the sense which is used.)\n\nCLOSURE:\n\nHearing, seeing, touching, smelling, and tasting are our senses. We use these senses to learn about the things around us. Tell your neighbor one of your senses and point to the body part you would use. Have children cut out pictures in magazines to put in each part of their individual book.\n\nThis is the\ntime this file has been accessed since 03\/01\/97.\n\nThe University of Tennessee at Martin is not responsible for the information or views expressed here."}

The carbon footprint step will take less than an hour, and can also be completed at home. The group discussion can serve as the introduction to creating the podcast, and the process of making the podcast should last around three-four days depending on how long you would like them to be. I think it would be beneficial for the groups to play their podcasts to the rest of the class once all of them are complete. This will be fun for the class, and they can compare their final products to the rest of the group.\n\nTeacher involvement is important throughout the days during this WebQuest.

{"text":"RELATED LINKS\n\n@ BIOINTERACTIVE\n\nThe Biology Project is an interactive online resource for learning biology, developed at the University of Arizona. Although designed for college-level biology students, it is also useful for high school students, medical students, physicians, science writers, and the public. The website includes tutorials on eight subject areas\u2014biochemistry, cell biology, chemicals and human health, developmental biology, human biology, immunology, Mendelian genetics, and molecular biology\u2014that are found in an introductory biology course. The tutorials contain real-life applications of biology. For most topics, the tutorials are structured as a series of problem sets, based on multiple-choice questions, that direct student learning. Correct answers are reinforced with a brief explanation, while incorrect answers are linked to tutorials with text and graphics to explain the concept being assessed. The developers say that the multiple-choice format creates an interactive learning instrument rather than a testing instrument. Teachers can assign problem sets for review before exams, or may want to assign an activity (such as DNA profiling) before students cover that topic in their laboratory. Several tutorials are available in Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian as well as in English. In addition to the biology units, the website also contains a variety of lesson plans and activities\u2014such as \"The Behavior of Ants\"\u2014developed for middle and high school teachers. The Biology Project, which started in 1995, received the 2009 Biology Classics Award from MERLOT, an online community of educators and institutions working to increase quality Web-based resources designed to enhance teaching and learning.

Teachers can enroll in online courses during the school year or during the summer, earning credit toward a master's degree or participating in a non-degree program; and\n\nMaster's degree in General Biology, which takes place almost exclusively over the summer, so that teachers need to complete only minimal course work while they are teaching. Teachers in the master's degree program take courses during the first summer of the program; during two subsequent summers, they do research under the supervision of University of Arizona biological sciences faculty. They write and defend a thesis, and create, classroom test, and disseminate to other teachers a lesson unit based on their research experiences."}

{"text":"Abstract\n\nThis article\ndescribes a study of bones undertaken by 5-year-old children in\na bilingual school in Mexico City. The article discusses the process\nand shows the results achieved by the children during the three\nphases of the project through photographs and other documentation\nof the children's work. The article concludes with reflections\nby the author and parents.\n\nBackground Information\n\nEton School is a bilingual\n(Spanish-English) institution in Mexico City. The school's population\nmainly consists of Mexican children who do not speak English at\nhome. In the Early Childhood Department that serves children ages\n2 to 6, children are instructed only in English. Our school becomes\nbilingual from 1st through 12th grade (ages 7-19). Because our\nyoung children are just starting to be exposed to English,\nmany teachers feel that it would be virtually impossible for them\nto hold discussions or ask questions in the language they are\nlearning. However, this article indicates that project work can\nbe done with young children who are schooled in a full immersion\nprogram in a second language.\n\nEmerging Project and Preliminary Planning\n\nDuring September,\nthe kindergarten children had been working on a theme about the\nhuman body. The children started telling personal stories about\ntheir experiences with doctors and getting hurt, and they expressed\na special interest in accidents and broken bones.\n\nThe teacher brought\nin several X-rays, a pair of crutches, and some items such as\nknee braces and air casts that the children could use for role-playing\nactivities. She wanted to see if the children's interest in this\ntopic was intense enough to start an in-depth study. She explored\nwhether she could invite an expert and whether it would be possible\nto visit an X-ray room at a clinic or a hospital. Everything fell\ninto place, and the teacher decided to take on this topic to pursue\na project.\n\nFigure\n1. Liam tried on an air cast.Figure\n2. Teli pretended to hurt her arm.\n\nPhase 1\n\nThe teacher and principal\ndiscussed the interests of the children and the conversations\nheld by the children during role-play, which the teacher had recorded\nas she walked around the classroom with a notepad. Together they\nmade a web to visualize the possibilities for developing the topic.\n\nFigure\n3. The teacher and principal created a topic web\nabout bones based on the children's conversations.\n\nThe principal came\nto the classroom and told a story about how she hurt her ankle.\nShe explained why she needed to wear an air cast and demonstrated\nhow to put it on.\n\nFigure\n4. The principal told a story about how she hurt her ankle.\n\nChildren\nstarted telling personal stories about their family members or\nfriends breaking a bone. Teli, one of the girls in the class,\ntold a story about breaking her collarbone when she fell from\na cart at the supermarket.\n\nFigure\n5. Teli told a story about breaking her collarbone.\n\nThe children made\nmemory drawings of their bones and then shared their drawings\nduring a class meeting.\n\nFigure 6. The children made memory drawings of their bones. Figure\n7. The outside of the body. Figure\n8. The inside of the body.\n\nThe children started\nasking questions about bones, and the teacher wrote them down\nand displayed them on a poster board in the classroom.\n\nHow many bones\ndo we have?\n\nWhat is inside\nour bones?\n\nHow does the doctor\nknow when a bone is broken?\n\nWhat things does\na doctor use?\n\nAre people's bones\nthe same as dogs' bones?\n\nWhat does an X-ray\nmachine look like?\n\nHow does an X-ray\nmachine work?\n\nHow does a cast\nget hard?\n\nAre there many\ncolors of casts?\n\nWhat happens when\na cast gets wet?\n\nHow can a person\ntake a cast off?\n\nWhat kind of shoes\ndo you wear when you are wearing a cast on your foot?\n\nDo many children\nhave broken bones?\n\nWhat animals have\nbones?\n\nHow can we take\ncare of our bones?\n\nA girl brought an\nX-ray of her dog, and we compared it to an X-ray of human bones.\nWe made a Venn diagram to record the data.\n\nFigure\n9. The children compared an X-ray of a dog with an X-ray of human\nbones.Figure\n10. The teacher made a Venn diagram with the information the children\ndictated.\n\nThe principal brought\nin some chicken bones, and the children looked at them using a\nmagnifying glass. Next, they shared their predictions of what\nthey thought was inside bones, and they drew and labeled drawings of bones.\n\nFigure\n11. Some children predicted that \"Each bone has a different\ncolor of plastic inside.\" Figure\n12. Some children thought that what is inside our bones changes\nas we grow: \"A girl has rocks inside her bones because she is 2 years\nold. The boy has plastic inside his bones because\nhe is 5 years old. The boy has sticks inside his bones because\nhe is 11 years old.\"\n\nAfter a couple of\ndays, we broke open the chicken bones and put them under a magnifying\nlens. The children carefully examined them and made an observational\ndrawing. Later on, they compared their predictions to what they\nsaw. They enjoyed this activity immensely, and when they shared\ntheir findings during group time, all the children laughed\nat their predictions.\n\nFigure\n13. A child looked at the inside of chicken bones through a magnifying\nlens. Figure\n14. The children made observational drawings of the inside of\na chicken bone.Figure\n15. Observational drawing.\n\nOne group of children\nwas interested in finding out how many children at school had\nbroken bones at that moment. They designed a form to conduct a\nsurvey, and they surveyed all the classrooms. They found out\nthat one child had a broken arm.\n\nFigure\n16. As this survey form shows, the children\nfound a girl with a broken arm in the pre-kindergarten 1 class.\n\nPhase 2\n\nIn preparation for\nour field visit, the children predicted what they thought they\nwere going to see at the clinic. The teacher displayed their predictions\non a poster board in the classroom so that they could revise their\npredictions after the trip. Most of the children were particularly\ninterested in seeing the X-ray machine. Before the trip, they\nmade predictions as to how long the machine would be. The measurement\nwas estimated by calculating the number of children that would\nmake up the length of the machine.\n\nFigure\n17. The children predicted how long the X-ray machine would be.Figure\n18. The children lined up to estimate the length of the X-ray\nmachine.\n\nWhen we arrived at\nthe clinic, Teli's grandfather, a doctor who works there, was\nwaiting for us in the parking lot. He first took us to visit the\nlab. There, children were able to look at blood samples through\na microscope. Children recalled that bone marrow is inside their\nbones. The teacher commented that blood cells are produced inside\nour bones.\n\nFigure\n19. The children looked at blood samples through a microscope.\n\nSome children made\nobservational drawings of the microscope and what they saw.\n\nFigures\n20-21. Photograph and field sketch of a microscope.Figure\n22. \"This is what I saw through the microscope.\"\n\nThen, we proceeded\nto the Radiology Department. The children had a chance to see\na computer monitor where doctors look at X-rays. We saw images\nof how different bones look. Some children found this\nexperience interesting and decided to take field notes.\n\nFigure\n23. This child made a field sketch of the\ncomputer, the physician, and what was displayed on the monitor.\n\nNext, we went to see\nthe X-ray machine. The doctor demonstrated how the machine worked\nand how he took X-rays.\n\nFigures\n24-25. Photograph and field sketch of Teli on the X-ray machine.\n\nThe children were\nallowed to stay in the room for a while to make field sketches\nof the machine and the room itself and to take field notes.\n\nFigure\n26. The children made sketches and took notes.Figure\n27. Field sketch made during the visit.\n\nThen, the children\nsat in the X-ray room, and the doctor answered the questions that\nthey had dictated to the teacher at school.\n\nThe children measured\nthe X-ray table by lining up beside it to see whether their predictions\nmatched the machine's real measurements. Carolina, who had predicted\nthat the machine would be 100 children long, said,\"What I\nsaid at school was really silly, now I know that the machine is\nonly nine children long.\"\n\nFigure\n28. The children measured the X-ray table by lining up beside\nit.\n\nAfter the visit, the\nchildren retold the story of their field experience. They recalled\nwhat they saw and compared their narration of the trip to the\npredictions made before the trip. They concluded that they did\nsee sick people, doctors, nurses, and the X-ray machine, but they\ndid not see doctors' offices or tools.\n\nAfter retelling the\nstory, children worked on journal entries that expressed what\nhad interested them most during the visit.\n\nThe following day,\nas we held our morning meeting, we realized that we had a lot\nto do. Children and teachers suggested work that needed to be\ndone. We formed several groups, and the children selected what\nthey wished to work on.\n\nRepresenting Knowledge\n\nWriting a Thank-you Letter to Teli's Grandfather (the doctor\nwho took care of us at the clinic). A group of children talked\nabout the visit and what they wanted to write about. Some of them\nwrote about the bones and X-ray machine, and others drew pictures.\n\nFigure\n31. The children wrote a thank-you note to the doctor.Figure\n32. Children wrote about their experience or sketched.\n\nBecoming Bone Experts. Some children were interested in finding out names of bones and\ntheir location in our body. They worked in pairs and labeled a\ndiagram of the skeleton by looking for information in books. Each\nof the children learned some names and shared his or her knowledge\nwith the rest of the class at the end of the day when each group reported what the group had worked on during the session.\n\nFigure\n33. The children labeled a diagram of a skeleton.\n\nA group of bone experts\nwanted to find out the length of different bones and proceeded\nto measure them using Unifix cubes. Some children measured the\nfemur, others the humerus, others the radius, and so on. The teacher\ndemonstrated how they could use a ruler to measure the length\nof their bones.\n\nFigure\n34. Children measured the length of bones using Unifix cubes. Figure\n35. The children recorded the length of bones in Unifix\ncubes and centimeters.\n\nThe children found\nout which bones in the body are the smallest and the biggest as\nwell as the number of bones that make up the human skeleton.\n\nChildren\nin one group made observational drawings by looking at photographs\nin books.\n\nFigure\n36. Comparison of the first memory drawing\nand the observational drawing of the same child.\n\nFigure\n37. Observational drawing.\n\nBuilding Bones. One group of children first drew a big plan of what they wanted\nto do, which showed the outside and the inside of the bone. They\nlabeled the different parts of a bone and included words such\nas bone marrow and red blood cells.\n\nFigure\n38. A group of children drew the outside and inside of the bone.\n\nNext, the children\ndecided which bone each wanted to build by looking at a diagram.\nThe teacher wrote their names beside the bones they selected so\nthat they would have a visual reference when working.\n\nFigure\n39. The teacher wrote the children's names\nnext to the bone they wanted to investigate.\n\nThe children selected\nthe things they needed and started building different bones. They\nused recyclable materials for the outside and sponge for the inside.\nThey later painted their creations and labeled them. This group\nof children worked for four sessions until their bones were completed.\n\nFigure 40. Juan Pablo built the foot using cardboard tubes and\nplastic forks. Figure 41. One of our mothers helped Alvaro build a skull. Figure\n42. These children showed their creations to their classmates.\nThey placed them on top of the bones they intended to build.\n\nBuilding an X-Ray\nMachine. Some children looked at the pictures of the X-ray\nmachine taken during the field visit. They discussed them and\nmade a list of things they needed in order to build the machine.\nThen they proceeded to number the pictures so that they could\neach be in charge of building a specific part. Next, they\ndrew an enlarged floor plan of how the machine should look.\n\nFigure\n43. The children created a list of things needed to build\nthe X-ray machine.Figure\n44. The children looked at the pictures taken during\nthe field visit. They selected the part they were interested\nin building.\n\nOne child thought\nabout the length of the machine and represented it with Unifix\ncubes. \"I want the machine to be 48 Unifix cubes long.\"\nThe teacher used a meter stick to measure the cubes that were\nlined up on the floor in order to model for the child how things\ncan be measured in different ways. The child helped her, and the teacher said,\n\"48 Unifix cubes is the same as 1.9 meters.\"\n\nFigure\n45. The teacher used a meter stick to measure the\nUnifix cubes a child used to represent the length of the machine.\n\nThe children selected\nrecyclable materials and started to work on their machine. They\nobserved the pictures closely because they wanted it to resemble\nthe \"real thing\" as closely as possible. They labeled\nthe parts of the machine and wrote down each part's purpose. The\nchildren completed this piece of work after six sessions.\n\nFigure\n46. The children looked for boxes that matched the parts\nof the machine that they intended to build. Figure\n47. Dan used a hammer to add on a piece of wood in order\nfor the machine's table to be the length that he had decided\non.Figure\n48. The children completed the machine in six sessions.\n\nWe were all amazed\nby the resemblance of the children's creation to a real X-ray machine.\n\nFigures\n49-50. The children wrote a label that read: \"This part of\nthe machine controls light.\" Figures\n51-52. The children indicated that film for the X-ray machine\nis introduced through the slit on the machine.\n\nFigures\n53-54. The children were very happy with their creation.\n\nNew Questions Arise: Who Has Bones?\n\nAt the beginning of\nthe work session, the teacher held a group meeting. Sharian had\nbrought some human bones, and she wanted everyone to see them.\nSeveral children commented that their parents had animal bones\nat home. The teacher encouraged the children to bring the bones\nto class, and she added that the bones could be displayed for\neveryone to see. A discussion started about whether all animals\nhad bones, and children mentioned some animals that did and some\nthat did not. The teacher then asked if they thought fish had\nbones. One child collected the data of who thought fish did or\ndid not have bones. She used tally marks as she asked every child.\nThen she counted the tally marks in order to find out what most\nchildren thought. The teacher then asked,\"How can we find\nout if a fish has bones?\"\n\nXimena: \"We can\nask a vet.\"\nVictor: \"We can ask a doctor.\"\nValeria: \"We can get a fish and open it to see.\"\n\nMost children seemed\nvery interested in the last option, and the teacher agreed to\ntry it out.\n\nSome children made\nmemory drawings of what they thought was inside a fish. One child\nwas thinking to himself for quite a while. The teacher approached\nhim and asked, \"Eddy, is something wrong?\" He shook\nhis head to say no. \"What do you think is inside a fish?\"\nEddy said, \"a skeleton,\" so the teacher encouraged him\nto draw what he thought the fish's skeleton looked like, and the\ndrawing in Figure 55 is what he came up with.\n\nFigure\n55. A child made a memory drawing of the inside of a fish.\n\nDuring the next work\nperiod, the children were able to find out firsthand whether fish\nhave bones by opening one in the science lab.\n\nFigure\n56. The children touched the bones. Figure\n57. The children looked closely at the bones and counted\nthem to find out how many bones make up a fish's skeleton.\n\nThe children made\nobservational drawings of the fish and wrote down the number of\nbones they counted.\n\nFigure\n58. The children made observational drawings of the fish.\n\nAs the children continued\nto talk about animal bones, they brought some from home and were\nable to share them with their classmates. They also weighed animal\nbones and compared the data.\n\nFigure\n59. The children weighed a bull's bone. Figure\n60. A child showed a bone she brought from home that her\ngrandmother used to make beef broth.\n\nSome children decided\nto write a book about animals that have bones. They made it by\ndrawing the animal's skeleton on an acetate sheet and the animal\non paper, and then they made them overlap.\n\nFigure\n61. The cover of a book the children made about animals\nthat have bones. Figure\n62. Author's page\nof the book. Figure\n63. One of the pages in the book.\n\nSeveral children were\nstill insisting on finding answers to some of their previous questions\nthat were unanswered so we decided it was time to ask an expert\nto come to our classroom. The teacher talked to an orthopedist\nand asked him to focus on answering the child's questions that\nshe posed to him prior to his visit.\n\nWhat is a cast\nmade of?\n\nWhat colors of\ncasts are there?\n\nWhat happens if\na cast gets wet?\n\nHow do you get\na cast off?\n\nHow long does\nit take for a cast to get hard?\n\nHow are bones\nheld together?\n\nHow can we take\ncare of our bones?\n\nWhy do we have\nbones?\n\nWhat is each part\nof the X-ray machine for?\n\nFigure\n64. Andrea volunteered to have a cast placed on and removed\nfrom her arm. Figure\n65. The doctor showed the children the different colors\nof casts.\n\nThe orthopedist placed\na cast on a child's arm. The children looked at a clock to find\nout how much time it took for the cast to get hard. The orthopedist\nalso explained how we can take care of our bones. He answered\ntheir questions, and they also got a chance to look at his tools.\n\nFigure 66. \"This is the saw the doctor used to\nremove the cast from Andrea's arm\" field sketch.\n\nA New Area of Interest: Taking Care of Our Bones\n\nThe day after the\nphysician's visit, a child brought a helmet from home. He explained\nthat he used it when he rode his bike and that it helped him take\ncare of his skull. During the next few days, several children\nbrought in diverse gear that protected their bones against injuries.\nThey tried on the gear and used the equipment for role-play.\n\nFigure 67. The children played with equipment that protected their\nbones.\n\nWhile the children\nwere role-playing with the equipment, we were surprised by an\nunexpected visitor. She was one of our former preschool children\nwho had a broken leg. We invited her into our classroom, and she\nshared her personal story with the children. She also\nallowed the youngsters to use her crutches.\n\nFigure\n68. One of our former preschool children shared the story\nof her broken leg. Figure\n69. The children tried the girl's crutches.\n\nBecause\nthe children's interest focused on how to take care of their bones,\nthe teacher brought in several food items that contain calcium.\nThey cooked macaroni and cheese and tasted different dairy products.\n\nFigure\n70. The children made macaroni and cheese and tasted different\ndairy products.\n\nA group of children\ndecided to become calcium detectives, and they looked for the\nword calcium on labels and boxes of food products to\ndetermine whether they were good for their bones.\n\nFigure\n71-72. A group of children wrote a list of products that contain\ncalcium.\n\nThe calcium detectives thought that it would be a good idea to\ntell their classmates about products they could eat to make their\nbones strong. They designed \"Strong Bone Menus,\" which\nthey shared with their peers. The menus were later displayed in\nthe classroom for everyone to see.\n\nFigure\n73. The children designed a \"Strong Bone Menu.\"\n\nThe whole class contributed\nto writing an original poem about bones, which all of the children\nlearned.\n\nFigure\n74. The class wrote a poem about bones.\n\nI Have Bones\nThere are bones\nin my arm.\nThere are bones in my hands.\nThere are bones in my leg\nand hips too.\nI have a skull in my head.\nI have ribs in my chest.\nWhen I go to sleep my bones grow.\n\nOriginally, the last\nline of the poem read \"When I go to sleep my bones rest,\"\nbut one of the children argued that while we sleep our bones grow.\n\nGetting Ready for the Bone Museum\n\nBecause the children\nhad brought so many items related to the topic and had done so\nmuch work, the teacher started to wonder about how she could display\neverything. She came up with the idea of putting together a bone\nmuseum. The children received her suggestion with much enthusiasm,\nand they began to think about the work that needed to be done\nand the items that needed to be included. After a few discussions,\nthey formed committees in order to divide the workload. The different\ngroups were in charge of writing labels for the displays, designing\nthe invitation, making a big sign with the title of the exhibit,\ntaking care of snacks, and putting together the display cases.\n\nFigures\n75-76. The children wrote labels and explanations describing the\ndifferent items displayed.\n\nFigure\n77. A group of children worked on a sign for the exhibit.\n\nFigures\n78-79. Lucette designed the invitation that was sent to parents.\nShe attempted to write every letter in the shape of a bone.\n\nFigure 80. The teacher and one of our mothers helped the\nchildren make bone-shaped cookies to serve as snacks during the\nexhibit. Figure 81. The children set up display windows using\nwooden blocks and a large piece of transparent plexiglass.\n\nPhase 3: The Bone Museum\n\nAfter six weeks of\nintense and productive work, our children's parents came to school\nto share with their children all that the children had learned\nabout bones and to see their work.\n\nThe children sang\na song and performed a dance about bones. Next, the teacher shared\npictures and samples of work through a PowerPoint presentation,\nwhich she had used to document the project since its beginning.\n\nFigure\n82. Every child wore a badge that read \"Bone Expert.\" The children greeted their parents by performing a bone dance\nand singing a song.\n\nAfter the PowerPoint\npresentation, the Bone Experts shared their knowledge with their\nparents by answering the parents' questions. They were also able\nto ask the audience questions, and they had a lot of fun when\ntheir moms and dads did not know the answers.\n\nFigure\n83. The children answered their parents' questions.\n\nParents were then\ninvited to visit the Bone Museum with their children. Figure 84. The Bone Museum. Figure\n85. Children's work was displayed in a sequential order\nof things that happened throughout the first two phases\nof the project. Figure\n86. Guests enjoyed the bone-shaped cookies made by the children.

This display case included human and animal bones.\nThe children specified which were real and which were made out\nof plastic.\n\nConclusion\n\nI had tried to do\nseveral projects in our school during the previous years. My knowledge\nabout the Project Approach was based on reading all the books\nI could find on this subject. I had heard a few lectures at the\nNational Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC)\nconferences, and I subscribed to the Project-L listserv. Because I am the principal of the Early Childhood Department\nat my school, it is my duty to motivate and instruct my teachers\nin order to provide the best education possible for our children.\nI knew that project work was the option I wanted them to follow.\nI tried to communicate my enthusiasm and my knowledge to my teachers\nas best as I could. A few teachers were successful, others were\nnot, and some never concluded the projects they started. Many\nof my teachers argued that it was impossible to carry out project\nwork in a second language with such young children, and they gave\nup even before trying. Our energy was renewed this year after\nDr. Sylvia Chard came to teach a three-day workshop at our school.\nMy teachers were excited, and I felt better prepared to guide\nthem.\n\nOne of the teachers\nwanted to start doing project work right away, and together we\ncarried out the Bone Project. At the beginning, our children had\ndifficulty asking questions, and we wondered whether this difficulty\nwas caused by the language barrier. However, as the study progressed,\nwe understood that the children were not used to inquiring because\nmost of the information had always been given to them. Once we\ndid enough modeling, they started wondering and asking all sorts\nof questions. They would mix in words in Spanish if they did not\nhave enough vocabulary in English, but they were able to express\ntheir thoughts and their ideas quite clearly. We now know that\nproject work can certainly be carried out in a second language\nwith young children.\n\nThroughout the Bone\nProject, the kindergarten children were able to apply basic skills\nto solve real-life problems. They not only touched upon the requirements\nfor their age and grade level, they surpassed our expectations\nof the knowledge they gained and the skills they acquired.\n\nThis project made\na difference at our school because the children's self-motivation,\nexcitement, interest, willingness to work hard, and their display\nof creativity and problem-solving abilities amazed other teachers\nwho were reluctant to try project work.\n\nFamilies had not been\ninformed that we were working in a different way. Nevertheless,\nall of them knew that something had changed because the interest\ntheir children showed for this topic was reflected at home. Some\nparents shared these comments with us after the conclusion of\nthe project:\n\nAs parents, we had\nalways asked our son what he had done in school. His answer\nhad always been the same\u2014\"nothing\" or \"I\nplayed\"\u2014up until the time when his class started learning\nabout the topic of bones. We knew what he was doing at school\nright away because he would come home and talk about it. He\ngot the whole family involved by sharing his knowledge and asking\nall kinds of questions. He spent time at home looking for meaningful\nthings related to the project that he could take to school.\nOur son was extremely motivated, and we were amazed to see all\nthat he had learned. (Fernando's parents)\n\nI've always enjoyed\nsharing what my child does at school, but I was truly surprised\nwhen I saw Ines and her classmates take on a topic from so many\ndifferent perspectives. They applied many skills: musical, manual,\nanalytical, deductive, observational, scientific, culinary,\nand linguistic. This is the kind of education I want for my\nchild: learning by pursuing her interests and not by memorizing\nirrelevant facts. (Ines' mother)\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI wish to\nexpress my gratitude to Dr. Sylvia C. Chard for all that she has\ntaught me and for her guidance and support, which enabled me to\nfully understand and fall in love with the Project Approach.

{"text":"By RICK FRITZ\n\nRick Fritz\nAAPG Executive Director\n\nAAPG Looks to Grow K-12 Program\n\nOne of my favorite activities is to visit my kid's school and talk about earth science. I often wear my geology garb and talk about rocks and dinosaurs.\n\nOne of the kid's favorite experiments is building stratigraphic layers with dirt, sand and gravel in a large clear plastic container. Then we compress the sediment from the bottom and side to make faulted blocks. Finally, I let them run water on the model and develop streams and a little lake.\n\nI let them do most of the experiment and it helps them understand a little about geologic processes. This includes small chicken bones for \"fossils.\"\n\nThe only problem is when I am done I have a plastic container that weighs about 150 pounds! It is a lot of fun to try and get it out of the school.\n\nBoth the AAPG Association and Foundation are considering expanding our K-12 programs. Based on surveys of members it is clear that earth science education is a high priority.\n\nAAPG's primary involvement has been support of Earth Science Week and the AGI K-12 curriculum program. AAPG's Foundation has provided direct support for program development and the Association supports it through AGI dues. AAPG is one of many entities that has supported the AGI programs, and we believe that their curriculum is one of the best.\n\nI cannot talk about AGI's program without mentioning the work of Marcus Milling, past AGI executive director. Marcus recently passed away and will be greatly missed. He had a great passion for K-12 education and leaves a tremendous legacy of building a world-class K-12 program.\n\nNow that AGI has built earth science curriculum for all grades through high school we feel it is important to make sure AAPG supports its application in as many schools as possible. As a result, AAPG is talking to AGI about how we can assist them in making sure their K-12 program reaches teachers and students.\n\nAn important part of that effort is making sure that we teach the teachers. AAPG President Lee Billingsley and first lady Joanne, have made geoscience education of teachers a high priority this year.\n\nOne of the other programs AAPG supports is the \"Rocks in Your Head\" short course for teachers that is taught by Janie Schuelke. It should be noted that this course was developed by Patty Holyfield. She passed away in 2002 and is recognized as a pioneer in developing the course to teach teachers earth science.\n\nAAPG provides regular support of this course especially to Section meetings. We encourage societies to consider scheduling a \"Rocks in Your Head\" course and request support from both the AAPG Association and Foundation.\n\nAAPG's Youth Education Committee (YEA) continues to develop ideas to \"increase the knowledge and appreciation of geoscience among students and teachers.\" The committee works to expand participation in the Rocks in Your Head program and manages the Earth Science Teacher of the Year Award and Teachers' Days at national and Section meetings. The committee also assists and coordinates earth science and energy programs of national youth organizations.\n\nWe want to expand and take advantage of emerging opportunities in earth science education. To accomplish this, the AAPG Foundation is making K-12 education a key component of its fundraising focus.\n\nIf you are interested in supporting AAPG activities or would like to be involved in YEA activities, please\ncontact YEA committee chair Robert W.

Each slide takes the students through a explanation step by step and a voice-over is available to help students who may have difficultly reading the text. Each presentation also includes questions to check the students' comprehension of the topic that they are working through.\n\nInvestigations\n\nInvestigates are open-ended activities designed to encourage the students to evaluate the information that they have been given and formulate their own theories or explanations. Questions in the investigations are desgined to test the skills required by the Common Core Standards.\n\nMany investigations also include the use of the specially designed STEM interactive simulators.\n\nAssessmentss\n\nThe assessments are a series of questions about the current topic.\n\nStandards Mapping\n\nEach lesson is linked directly with the appropriate standards so a teacher can choose lessons based upon which New York Science Standard she needs the students to learn, or which Common Core Standard must be covered."}
{"text":"Across Time, Across Curricula\n\nby Connect Staff\n\nJust mention the word ocean to a group of first graders or middle school students and their responses will suggest a vast number of interdisciplinary learning opportunities. From showing off a shell collection to studying deep-diving robots, to exploring the many forms of literature about the sea, the options are amazing.\n\nMathematics is everywhere from the area of sail on a racing boat to subsurface mapping, pressure gradients at various depths, data on ships and shipping. Weather data alone offers many practical math opportunities. Compare the weather on land to the data from automated buoys anchored at sea. Track storms as they move across oceans.\n\nThe science and math learning that can be found in any study of oceans can also help us to look at human history and at many cultures. When the \"land bridge\" existed, connecting modern Siberia to Alaska, many humans migrated across it to North and South America. Why were ocean levels so low at that time, permitting a crossing? Where was all that H2O?\n\nWhat were the navigation skills used by Pacific islanders to travel vast distances to other islands? What do we know about the amazing Chinese exploring fleets whose ships were far bigger than European boats of the time?\n\nThe Egyptians, Greeks and others were skilled at sailing the Mediterranean both for trade and for war. They fished extensively as have almost all cultures with access to the sea. What did they trade for? What fish did they catch? How did they preserve those fish and other foods?\n\nCenturies later, as trade grew to global proportions, people imagined digging vast canals and eventually completed them: the Erie and others that moved products to a seaport, then the Suez and Panama to connect seas. In studying canals alone, the science, math and technology opportunities are huge, as are the historical elements. In the age of European empires, ocean-going ships were the main means of transport to and from colonies. How did canals between oceans change these empires? What is the value of the same canals today?\n\nThese topics and questions are only hints and any one of them can be approached on a simple level or with greater complexity. Ask your students for their ideas about oceans. Your studies could take you in any direction!"}

{"text":"Mini Medical School\n\nKU Medical Center understands that time and resources are often limited for teachers which can lead to limited opportunities for students' futures. The goal of Mini Medical School is to provide resources that teachers can use to supplement and enhance the curriculum that has already been established. The ultimate benefit for the students is an exposure to various aspects of the health field while working on fun and exciting projects.\n\nMini Medical School was originally designed as a community education tool for adults and was later restructured to shift the focus to the high school science classroom.\n\nWhat is Mini Medical School?\n\nPhysicians and experts serving as faculty for KU Medical Center and Kansas State University have helped to create seven modules with 10 corresponding DVD lectures that focus on different aspects of the health field. Each module includes a hands-on, teacher-developed activity with all the necessary supplies included.\n\nThe seven modules include the following topics: Click on \"+\" after each topic for a description\n\nOrthopedics and Sports Medicine\n\nActivities in this module were created to demonstrate the importance of collagen in the bone. Students will also examine the relationship between structure and function in bone and analyzing the effect of diet and weight-bearing activities on bone mineral content and therefore bone strength and bone health.\n\nBrain Function\n\nWith this module the use of positron emission tomography (PET) images are used to help understand the function of the brain.\n\nThe Ear and Hearing\n\nIn this unit, students will learn about the different parts of the ear and their role in hearing. They will also learn about common disorders of the ear and the profession of audiology. The activity will focus on Noise-Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) through testing the decibel levels of different areas.\n\nDiabetes, Obesity, Nutrition and Exercise\n\nThere is very strong connection between diet and the potential for the development of diabetes. This activity gives students a look into their own diet and encourages them to think about how the choices they make affect their health.\n\nImmunology, Vaccination and HIV\n\nIn this activity, students will demonstrate the natural antibiotic resistance that has developed in certain bacteria commonly found in everyday life.\n\nMalaria\n\nOne of Mini Medical School's two newest modules, the malaria module teaches students about the transmission of malaria through mosquitoes, the global impact of the disease, and the efforts being made to control and prevent the spread of malaria. During the module, students can look at the different stages of a mosquitoes life cycle and watch how malaria is being researched in the United States.\n\nInfluenza\n\nThe second of Mini Medical School's newest modules, the Influenza module builds on students' understanding of DNA and RNA structure and function, the general virus structure and function, and antigen\/antibody interactions. Students are lead through a case study involving an interactive step-by-step progression of an epidemiological study as professionals unravel the mysteries of a new influenza virus (H3N2).\n\nWhat's in it for you?\n\nIf you participate in the Mini Medical School program, you will receive a kit that includes a videotaped presentation given by a physician or faculty member for each of the 5 modules and all of the materials and instructions for the accompanying hands-on activities. Teachers have the freedom to use any or all of the modules at their convenience and work them into their lesson plans as their curriculum allows. Evaluation forms are included in the kit for each module, for both teachers and students to complete and return to the KU Area Health Education Centers. All of the materials for the program meet criteria from the National Science Education Standards, the Kansas Science Standards and Benchmarks, the National Healthcare Foundation Standards and Accountability Criteria, and the Kansas Health Science Education Standards.\n\nMini Medical School aligns best with higher level biology classes such as Anatomy and Physiology or with a Health Science class. Presently, Mini Medical School is used in 17 high schools across the state."}

{"text":"Background For Teachers: Evaporation is the process by which water is converted from its liquid form to its vapor form and thus transferred from land and water masses to the atmosphere. Evaporation from the oceans accounts for 80% of the water delivered as precipitation, with the balance occurring on land, inland waters and plant surfaces.\n\nCondensation is the change of water from its gaseous form (water vapor) into liquid water. Condensation generally occurs in the atmosphere when warm air rises, cools and looses its capacity to hold water vapor.\n\nIt is important to remember that condensation and evaporation are both types of a process in the water cycle.\n\nStudent Prior Knowledge: Students should have a review or introduction to the water cycle. A short brainstorm session of where our water comes from would be a great place to start the activity.\n\nIntended Learning Outcomes: Students will be familiar with evaporation and condensation\nStudents will design their own experiment and share with others\nStudents will be able to draw real world conclusions between the experiment and uses for water\n\nInstructional Procedures: Note: The day before this lesson, place a jar of water and measure its level in front of the students and leave it in the front of the room. Demonstrate how you measured the water level on day one (by placing masking tape and drawing a level) and how you will measure it today.\n\nPART 1\n\nEngage the students by having a large bowl of soapy water in the front of the room and washing your face in front of them and toweling off or wash your hands.\n\nInvite students to talk about what use they had for water today. Students can write these down in the front of the room, each student can come up with one use. Also allow students to ask questions such as \"did my orange juice have water\" at this time when thinking about uses for water today.\n\nAsk students in small groups to discuss ideas from where all the water comes from, give them 4 minutes to brainstorm in a journal.\n\nDiscuss their ideas into a diagram of the water cycle (some of their answers will say the water came from the sky for example).\n\nPART 2\n\nProvide three easy demonstrations for vocabulary reviews, evaporation with a tea kettle or electric kettle and condensation with that same kettle and a hand mirror or a plate or clear glass pyrex brownie tray. Also pull out an icy cold soda can from your cooler and talk about any locations of water droplets on it.\n\nExplain to students which equipment is in the classroom today on the equipment table. Each group will need 1 of each thing listed in the materials except the sharing of the hair dryer (since you probably have only one).\n\nPART 3\n\nAfter the students have seen your demonstration, challenge them to create their own condensation given what is on the table. Give them about 10 minutes.\n\nExplain to the students for the 2nd part of their experiment they are free to use different types of water (temperature) and the cups.\n\nChallenge the students to start an evaporation experiment. Students should create a hypothesis of what could evaporate water the MOST. They are to put this in their journals. Have them choose 4 locations for water around the room. (Inside cabinets are ok!). Students will be reminded that in order to make measurements in two days, they will need to make initial measurements. This can be demonstrated with the teacher jar at the beginning of class.\n\nPART 4\n\nAfter students have cleaned up, save one of the jars with ice. Use the hair dryer to evaporate the water droplets on the jar and have a discussion about evaporation again.\n\nPART 5\n\nStudents the next day or two days later or 1 week later should collect their cups and record their data.

{"text":"Tracking Hurricanes\n\nThis activity provides an interesting way to give students practice with plotting on a coordinate plane and using latitude\/longitude. It uses real-time weather data; in this case hurricanes which are likely to be in the news.\n\nMaterials: Other than internet access, you only need the Hurricane tracking chart which can be printed off the web. Note latitude and longitude are given along the sides and a grid across the map will make it easier to plot locations.\n\nK12\n\nFollow the track of the hurricane each day. There are several web sites you can use to do so. For this activity, you only need the lat\/long of the hurricane. You may also wish students to see the size of the hurricane so they realize it extends quite a long ways beyond that one point (and its affects extend out quite a ways as well). The lat\/long given should represent the center of the eye.\n\nYou can also check the forecast. Plot the forecast positions on the day you start. As you plot the progress of the hurricane see how the track compares with that original forecast. To find the forecast positions, see the \"Discussion\" from:\n\nHow does the uncertainty in hurricane forecasts affect people who have to decide whether to order an evacuation? people who live on the coast?\n\nAsk the students a couple days before landfall, what they would do if they lived along the coast and why. Obviously if a forced evacuation was ordered, they would not have a choice. However, if they could make their own decision would they risk staying or take the safe choice and leave? Do they think that the local government should be able to force people to evacuate or should it be each family's choice?\n\nThis is a good activity to accompany the Weather Eye Hurricanes lesson in which students role play different members of the community each of whom has input into the decision of whether to evacuate or not. I thought this was an excellent lesson on decision making and helps students to better understand all of the factors that enter into a decision to evacuate."}
{"text":"Natural History\n\nIt's the rare child (or adult) who isn't fascinated by dinosaurs. The ancient creatures capture the popular imagination in a way quite unlike anything else. Through the study of dinosaurs, students learn about what life on Earth was like long ago, and the many changes that have occurred in geography, geology, and climate since then.\n\nWith all of the news coverage of the recent tsunami and its aftermath in Japan, many teachers are looking for ways to explain the phenomenon to their students. Students are seeing videos and pictures of the devastation in Japan, and many of them don't completely understand the science behind this type of weather disaster. This lack of understanding can lead to fear in students (and teachers) of all ages. Joann has been collecting resources for The Gateway to help teach students about tsunamis. The resources she is featuring in her column and social media posts this week look at tsunamis from many different angles. She has found a really nice variety of resources, and I really like the way they integrate the study of tsunamis into subjects ranging from art to science.\n\nThere have been at least six well-documented mass extinctions on Earth over the past 500 million years, a phenomenon that has both puzzled and intrigued scientists for centuries. Various types of organisms on Earth become extinct fairly frequently, but mass extinctions are distinguished by the large numbers of species that become extinct over a relatively short period of time. The Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction, responsible for the demise of the dinosaurs some 65 million years ago, is perhaps the most famous mass extinction. It's forever branded into our brains from being the topic of feature films, artists' paintings, and numerous books."}

The category names \"bundle\" information, providing a means of improved communication and organization; for example, the term conifer efficiently denotes the group of all trees with needles and cones.\n\nIn the book Classroom Instruction that Works, the authors cite research that the ability to identify similarities and differences, which is at the heart of classification, is basic to human thought (Marzano, Pickering, and Pollock, 2001).\n\nHow Can You Make It Happen?\n\nClassification lessons can begin with a large set of items to be classified. Students discuss the similarities and differences of the items, decide how they will be organized, and place them into groups. They discuss the distinguishing features of each category, and review the items to be sure each is in the correct category. Discussions can include the questions: Are there items that don't fit? Is there a more useful way to classify these items? How can the categories be improved?\n\nTo provide more structure in younger grades, students can be given the items and categories. Once the students have mastered classification, give them the items and have them determine the categories to complete the classifying activity. Review the categories that were chosen and discuss how meaningful and useful they are.\n\nWhen students have an understanding of classifying items into groups, ask them to identify the features that distinguish one category from another and ask them how they decide if something fits into a particular category. Students should be able to defend their classification systems and to identify items that don't fit and explain their reasoning.\n\nClassification can also be used to identify an unknown object by looking at its characteristics and then using a dichotomous key, which is a tool consisting of a series of questions about the features of an item to help identify the item. This is most often used in science to identify items in nature such as shells, rocks, or fish. Players of \"20 Questions\" are familiar with the use of such keys"}

Activity: Gilligan's Island \u2022 \"Survival Skills,\" Divide the group into small groups of 3-4 participants. Each group should have a Backpacker Magazine, piece of paper and a writing utensil. June 1995.\n\nPresent the following scenario to the groups: You have been ship wrecked on an\n\nisland that is exactly like where you are right now. It has the same climate,\n\nvegetation, and weather. You must survive on this island for seven days.\n\nUnfortunately, the wreckage of the airplane has disappeared. You only had time to\n\ntake three things out of the airplane to help you survive. Your group may take any\n\nthree items you can think of, but all of the items must fit into a small backpack. Tell\n\nthem that electronic devices used to contact others for help do not work on this\n\nisland. What three items did you take?\n\nGive the group about 10 minutes to discuss which three items they would have taken\n\nfrom the airplane to help them survive. When the groups are done with their\n\ndiscussions, each group will present their three items to everyone. The groups should\n\nlist their three items and give reasons why they choose each item. Other groups are\n\nwelcome to ask them questions. Discuss the merits of each group's answers and the\n\npro and cons of their selections.\n\nActivity: Top Ten Survival Items\n\nThis final activity assists the youth in applying this information to an imaginary\n\nsurvival situation. When all the groups are finished, present the \"Top 10 Survival\n\nItems\" that the experts believe are important in a survival situation. The three items each group decided on may or may not be on this list. By presenting the \"Top Ten\" list, it gives the youth a chance to analyze the decision of survival skills \"experts.\" After the list is presented, you may want to give the youth time to talk about the list and if they agree or disagree with the items and their importance.\n\nIf possible, it is nice to collect the ten items (or pictures of the items) in advance and place them in a bag. As you discuss an item, pull it out of the bag and show it to the group.\n\nTALK IT OVER Reflect: \u2022 What is the most important thing to remember in a survival situation? \u2022 What piece of information will you most likely remember? \u2022 If your group was really stranded on an island, what would have been the most helpful thing to remember? \u2022 How did your small team perform during this activity? Were you an effective team?

Where else could you use them in your life?\n\nHELPFUL HINTS You may switch the order of the activities by facilitating the \"Gilligan Island\" activity first. In this method, the youth would be involved in a hands-on activity at the start of the lesson. By facilitating the lesson in the order presented (Gilligan Island activity after the Seven Basic Needs activity), the youth have an opportunity to use the knowledge they learned about basic needs and apply that to their group decision in \"Gilligan Island.\" The order of activities is left up to the individual facilitator.\n\nBecause this lesson is meant to encourage the development of teambuilding skills and youth\/adult partnerships in its participants, it's a good idea to keep the following ideas in mind: \u2022 Youth who have pre-existing knowledge or experience in the area of survival skills can be recruited to co-facilitate some of the activities or give examples of their personal experiences in survival or semi-survival situations. These youth can also serve as team leaders or \"resources\" for the groups during the Gilligan Island activity. \u2022 If possible, know your group ahead of time; have an idea of what size small groups will facilitate effective teamwork. Sometimes groups of three work well, other times groups of five may work better. Split the entire group into the optimum-sized small groups for the Gilligan's Island activity. \u2022 Front-load the lesson and individual activities with tips for good teamwork. For example, before the Gilligan's Island activity, you can highlight traits of effective teamwork: listening to each other, using all the team members' skills, using a group decision-making process, and engaging all team members in the discussion. \u2022 If desired, you can break the entire group into small groups for the Seven Basic Needs activity. Each small group may be asked to come up with a basic need as a group and then present their answer to the entire class. When the youth are working in small teams, walk around and facilitate effective teamwork through questions and short discussions. Ask the entire team to present their answers, not just one spokesperson.\n\nIn any survival situation, the following seven basic needs must be met. 1. PMA (Postive Mental Attitude, or \"Don't lose your head!\"): The most important thing in any survival situation is not to panic. Your brain is your best tool for inventorying what resources you have and for coming up with a plan to provide for your needs. Panic can lead to making irrational, counter-productive decisions that actually make the situation worse, not better. How long? 3 seconds. If your car breaks through the ice on a frozen lake and you panic, you may waste time pounding against the windows when you should be rolling them down. People have saved themselves by popping the trunk, pulling down the back seats and swimming out. 2. AIR (oxygen): Although we take air for granted, in a drowning, choking, or toxic fume situation it becomes critical to maintain an adequate supply of oxygen to the brain. How Long? 3 minutes. After that, brain cells begin to die. 3. SHELTER: A shelter is used to conserve the heat your body already has. Clothing is considered shelter because it traps a layer of warm air and holds it next to your body. Shelters do not add heat. Fires or electric blankets may add heat. Would you be warmer standing outside in winter in a swimsuit next to a fire, or in a parka and snowpants with no fire? The best way to keep warm is to keep from losing heat. How long? 3 hours. If you are wet and exposed to wind and\/or cold temperatures, failure to seek shelter can lead to fatal hypothermia. Keeping yourself dry and out of the wind are the two most important assets of any shelter. 4. WARMTH: If you are in an extended survival situation that may last for days, shelter alone may not be enough to prevent frostbite and\/or hypothermia. Warmth can be added through building a fire or drinking hot liquids. Physical activity of any kind will increase blood flow and raise body temperature. The body heat from a warm person can be used to add heat to a cold person. How long? 3 hours-3 days: The length of time varies, depending upon conditions. 5. REST (sleep): Any physical activity will burn calories \u2013 energy that cannot be used later. Resting will conserve calories so that they may be burned slowly for warmth over time. Before any activity, make sure to weigh the benefits and costs, especially if you have no food to give yourself more energy. How long? 1-3 days: Variable, depending upon conditions. About 24 hours without sleep or rest will lead to fuzzy thinking and bad decision making for most people. 6. WATER: It is possible to survive a full three days without water, but as the body dehydrates it begins to function less efficiently. Water loss can occur through breathing, sweating, and evaporation. How long? 3 days: Especially in winter, people forget to drink because they are not hot. Drink even before you are thirsty! Thirst is a warning signal telling you that you are already dehydrated. If snow is the only source of water, melt it first so you do not cool your body temperature by eating snow. 7. FOOD: In most survival situations, food is not a top priority. However, food helps your body stay warm by adding calories to burn and raising body temperature by activating your metabolism. How long? 3 weeks: Without food, your body will burn fat reserves as fuel. After fat reserves are used up, the body will begin to metabolize protein, burning muscle as a food source. Essentials to Put in Your Daypack Here are 10 essential items that you will want to take with you on a hike . . . plus five extra optional items.\n\n1. Knife: a small, folding model with a locking-blade will do. All-purpose knives are big and bulky and tend to get left behind. 2. Cigarette lighter: The plastic variety. The striker won't work if wet, so keep it dry and warm. 3. Garbage bag: You can use it as a sack for an unplanned \"bivouac.\" You can use it as a rain jacket when you're caught in a storm. You can even use it as an insulating layer by putting it on, then stuffing it with leaves or grass. It also works well for carrying water. 4. 1-2 full bottles of water. 5. High-energy food like a sports bar, candy bar, or dried fruit. 6. Map and compass. 7. Rain gear. 8. Extra warm clothes. 9. Whistle and mirror for signaling. 10. Small medical kit. 11. Sunglasses. 12. Headlamp with spare batteries and bulbs. 13. Fire starter. 14. Iodine for treating water. 15. Emergency kit with everything from fish hooks to nylon cord."}

I do a lot of digging for resources and tools for our inquiry block at Anastasis Academy. I thought it might be about time I shared the love here! If you find it useful, I may include some more of these kinds of posts periodically.\n\nRight now our students are learning about how the world works. They are inquiring into animal habitats and needs.\n\nPlant and Animal Habitats from BBC has students working with the Sarah Jane Adventures team to complete a habitat interactive activity where students match aliens with the best habitat based on clues about both creature and habitat.\n\nRemember cootie catchers? Or fortune tellers? They are easily folded out of a regular 8.5\u00d711\u2033 piece of paper. Students can use cootie catchers to show their knowledge, and quiz each other, about habitats. Ask students to each choose a different habitat to create their cootie catcher about. Each flap can have a different word that describes the habitat (for example: desert might say \"dry\", \"barren\", \"extreme temperatures\", \"low vegetation\"). The next flap can have a type of animal that lives in that type of habitat. The last flap can include a fact about why that habitat is perfect for the animal. To play with the cootie catcher, one student chooses a word and the other spells the word out while opening and closing the cootie catcher. The first student chooses a new word and the second student spells the word out while manipulating the cootie catcher. On the final turn, the student chooses a flap to be opened to reveal the fact.\n\nThere are SO many fun ways to explore habitats and animals\u2026if you have outdoor space at your school, send students outside to explore the habitats they walk right by every day.\n\nComments (5)\n\nJennifer Autensaid on 20-01-2012\n\nI love this set of websites and activities about habitats. I will be doing that unit with my 2nd graders in April. Now I have a whole new set of websites to check out this weekend.

{"text":"Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students research certain elements and then analyze their potential bonds with other elements in a \"dating game\" where the dating pool is comprised of the elements featured on the Periodic Table.\n\nAuthor(s):\nGeorgia Scurletis, The New York Times Learning Network\nAndrea Perelman, The Bank Street College of Education in New York City\n\nSuggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes \u2013 1 hour\n\nObjectives: Students will: 1. Speculate about why two recent Periodic Tables differ. 2. Learn about the retraction of Element 118 from the Periodic Table by reading and discussing \"Sometimes, the March of Science Goes Backward.\" 3. Research certain elements and their potential bonds with other elements in a \"dating game\" of the elements. 4. Synthesize their understanding of chemical bonding by drawing compounds of combined elements or by describing different potential compounds for certain elements.\n\nResources \/ Materials: -copies of WebElements.com's Periodic Table (one per small group) [to be downloaded and printed from WebElements.com's Web site ( -copies of ChemicalElements.com's Periodic Table (one per small group) [to be downloaded and printed from ChemicalElements.com's Web site (  -pens\/pencils -paper -classroom blackboard -copies of \"Sometimes, the March of Science Goes Backward\" (one per student) -resources for researching the elements (science and chemistry textbooks; encyclopedias; books on the elements; computers with Internet access)\n\nActivities \/ Procedures: 1. WARM-UP\/DO NOW: Prior to class, arrange desks into small groupings, and place copies of each of the two Periodic Tables in each group. Write the following prompt on the board (for small groups to respond to upon entering class): \"What do you have in front of you? Which symbols on these tables do you recognize? How do these two tables of differ? Considering that they are both recent examples, why do you think they differ?\" After each of the small groups has answered the discussion questions, have each group report its answers to the class. Is it possible that the Periodic Table featuring fewer elements is the more recent table? If so, how could this be possible?\n2. As a class, read and discuss \"Sometimes, the March of Science Goes Backward,\" focusing on the following questions: a. According to the article, why was ununoctium's half-life described as \"disappointingly brief\"? b. How was the element ununoctium's existence called into question? c. How did the term \"transfermiums\" originate? d. Why is it difficult to determine whether transfermiums are \"created\" or \"discovered\"? e. How did the addition of No.118 change the appearance of the periodic chart? f. What is the role of Iupac in deciding an element's name? g. Why was Iupac reluctant to name an element after Dr. Seaborg? h. According to the article, what is the \"ultimate message\" behind the Periodic Table's design? i. How did Dr. Seaborg justify his use of the word \"creation\" in relation to the synthesization of an element?\n3. Explain to students that today they will be acting as \"dating game\" matchmakers between the elements. In other words, they will be researching certain elements and their potential bonds with other elements. Divide students into partnerships and assign each twosome an element. (The elements assigned should provide potential opportunities for creating a variety of chemical compounds.) Using all available resources, each partnership should create a written \"dating profile\" for their element that includes the following information (written on the board for easier student access): \u2013a drawing of an atom of your element indicating the nucleus, orbitals, protons, neutrons, electrons \u2013the physical properties of the element (description of what the element looks like, density, melting point, state of matter, metal, non-metal, metalloid, crystalline structure, hardness, etc.) \u2013the chemical properties of the element (description of how the element reacts with other elements, such as whether an element is corrosive, combustible, or flammable)\nOnce the profiles of the elements have been completed, half of the partnerships should fold their profile papers so that no information about their element is exposed; they should then deposit the folded profiles in a bag. Next, the remaining partnerships will each choose a folded profile from the bag in order to determine their element's \"blind date\" for the class. Each pair of students who created a \"dating profile\" that was put in the bag should now join the pair of students who chose theirs out of the bag, thus forming groups of four. Each group of four will then analyze whether the date can produce a successful match (i.e. chemical compound). If a \"match\" is possible, the group will determine the potential bonding combinations for the two elements. If a \"match\" is not possible, the group needs to explain why the two elements could not bond in a compound.\n4. WRAP-UP\/HOMEWORK: For those groups that determined that their blind dates ended in successful matches between their elements, each student now draws a compound formed from a combination of the two elements. (For the matches that produced more than one potential bond, each group member could draw a different compound or molecule.)\nFor those groups that determined that their blind dates could not end in successful matches between their elements, each student now writes a \"personal ad\" in search of the perfect chemical bond for the original element he or she researched.\n\nFurther Questions for Discussion: \u2013How are the elements named? \u2013How has the Periodic Table changed over time? \u2013How are compounds and molecules formed between elements? \u2013What is the difference between covalent and ionic bonds? \u2013How were Seaborg and Fermi involved with the Manhattan Project? \u2013How have the discovery of certain elements made medical advances possible?\n\nEvaluation \/ Assessment: Students will be evaluated based on their thoughtful participation in group and class discussions, participation in their research of a specific element, and their final analyses of potential chemical bonds between elements.\n\nExtension Activities: 1. Create a memory game for your classmates to play that will require them to match the names of the elements with their symbols from the Periodic Table. On one set of index cards, write the full names of the elements. On the second set, write the symbols of the elements that are used in the Periodic Table. Shuffle the cards and place them face down in a random order spread out across a surface. Players will take turns turning over any two cards. If a correct match is not found, the cards are turned face down again and the next player takes a turn. The player with the greatest number of correct matches at the end of the game is declared the winning chemist.\n2. Write the discovery story of the element you researched in class. Who discovered the element? Where and when did the discovery take place? What are the current uses of the element?\n3. Research Dmitry I. Mendeleyev's invention of the Periodic Table. How has the table changed since its 19th century inception? Create an illustrated timeline of the table's changes.\n4. What's in a name? How did the elements of the Periodic Table get named? Learn the stories behind several of the elements' names and then choose a few that you find most interesting. Create a poster that displays these stories in a creative manner.\n5. What is the difference between a covalent and ionic bond? Create a \"How it Works\" poster that explains these two types of chemical bonds between the elements.\n\nInterdisciplinary Connections: American History- Research the roles of Enrico Fermi and Glenn Seaborg in the Manhattan Project for the development of nuclear energy and the atomic bomb. Research the first controlled nuclear reaction that took place under University of Chicago's Stagg Field. Pretend you are writing the screenplay for a film on the Manhattan Project. Who would play Fermi? Seaborg? Write a dialogue between the two scientists' characters, or describe how you would shoot the scene depicting the reaction under Stagg Field.\nFine Arts- Create a \"knockoff\" of the Periodic Table in order to organize items in a field of your personal interest. For example, you could create a Periodic Table of music, cars, or horses. Include symbols for the included items (and a key for the symbols) and color-code the categories within your chart.\nHealth- Research Glenn Seaborg's discovery of radioisotopes. How are radioisotopes currently used to battle cancer cells? Write an essay explaining how Seaborg's discovery has indirectly affected the lives of millions of cancer patients.\nMedia Studies- Visit the University of Kentucky's Chemistry Department's Web site \"The Periodic Table of Comic Books\" to see comic book references to the various elements (  Use this site as an inspiration to write a comic strip of your own that features an element.\n\nOther Information on the Web: WebElements ( is an online Periodic Table extensively linked to essential data, adjacent elements, and chemical and physical data as well as background, crystallographic, nuclear, electronic, biological and geological information.\nChem-4-Kids ( is a beginner's look into the states of matter, atoms, reactions, and other elements of chemistry.\n\nAcademic Content Standards: Grades 6-8 Science Standard 10- Understands basic concepts about the structure and properties of matter.

{"text":"The science program at Conway has as its major purpose the involvement of students with the world about them from a scientific point of view. The scientific point of view encompasses the use of the process skills in all science activities. These process skills properly used will dictate a program which is heavily \"hands-on\" oriented. The seven major process skills to be used are as follows:\n\nObserving: taking in information about the world through our senses. Classifying: arranging objects or events in order according to some property. Measuring: thinking about properties in a quantitative way. Inferring: interpreting and explaining what we observe. Predicting: forecasting what will be observed in the future based on inferred data. Experimenting: changing objects and events to see what happens. Communicating: putting the information obtained from our observations into a form that someone else can understand.\n\nFrom this approach, a body of scientific knowledge should be developed which becomes the base for the use of cognitive and critical thinking. The Conway School program is not limited to a factual knowledge textbook approach. The specific topics in science at each grade level are listed under grade level sections on our website."}

In response to requests from other science education professionals, they have created the perfect vehicle for implementing and assessing this concept of whole-class inquiry.\n\nWhole-Class Inquiry provides firsthand descriptions of Joan's aims and observations\u2014as well as her introspective analysis\u2014while she skillfully moves her chemistry class toward the ultimate goal of whole-class inquiry. Dennis's commentary and research affirm the value of the process. On the two included DVDs you can see and hear the subtle details and methods involved in the transformation as the class completes three different projects onscreen.\n\nWhole-class inquiry works in middle school classrooms, too, and for preservice as well as inservice science teachers. Anyone interested in exploring and learning about, or just vicariously experiencing, this rewarding method will enjoy the book and DVDs\u2014and reap the benefits of the whole-class inquiry approach."}
{"text":"Force of Nature\n\nDavid Suzuki is a master of science and an educator who makes learning intriguing and exciting. Above all, he manages to make connections for his audience to the science he teaches in a way that makes it meaningful and memorable.\n\nThis video goes beyond a simple presentation. It drives home the message of importance that David Suzuki considers his legacy; the urgent need for us, as inhabitants of our planet, to reconsider our use and misuse of the natural resources we have been given. Perhaps more compelling is the biographical portion of this video that interweaves his life story and historical events therein with the choices and path he took as a scientist. This video is not only compelling in its message to its viewers, but also presents viable arguments to support David Suzuki's views.\n\nThe video transcends the school environment and could even be used outside of the classroom in club settings. It presents opportunities for discussion and could be used in classrooms depending on which clips were selected from upper elementary levels through the college setting. Forces of Nature is done so tastefully that it draws in the viewer and makes them feel as if Dr. Suzuki is speaking directly to them. This aspect of the movie makes it a valuable part of any teacher's collection. David Suzuki has also set the price of this video to make it affordable for every school to have a copy. This video is a treasure and a must have for every teacher of science. The personal and social perspectives presented throughout the video will resonate in the minds of every student who sees it and may even encourage students to find a new career in order to follow in the footsteps of this great scientist of the modern world!"}

{"text":"Modern Alternatives to Dissection\n\nAcross the board, comparative studies have found that modern non-animal science learning methods, such as interactive computer software, teach students anatomy and complex biological processes as well as\u2014and in most cases better than\u2014the cruel and crude use of live or dead animals. Research shows that these methods are associated with increased learning efficiency, higher examination scores, and student confidence and satisfaction. In fact, in 2008, the National Science Teachers Association amended its position statement to reflect the effectiveness of non-animal learning methods and to encourage their use.. The following are just a few of the ethical, effective, and economical resources for studying anatomy and physiology without harming animals:\n\nDigital Frog International offers the Digital Frog 2.5 software. In addition to providing virtual dissection, Digital Frog 2.5 contains a comprehensive anatomy and physiology section with human anatomy comparisons. This includes high-quality videos of muscle contractions, including in the frog and human hearts, and nerve impulses.\n\nV-Frog is the world's first virtual reality-based frog dissection software designed for biology education. Using a simple mouse and basic personal computer, a student can pick up a scalpel, cut and open the skin of the frog, and explore anatomy, physiology, and evolution, just like he or she would with a physical frog.\n\nZahourek Systems offers a variety of \"Anatomy in Clay\" skeleton models. Students can use special clay to sculpt muscles and organs onto durable, reusable skeletons. As the Anatomy in Clay designers point out, a major failing of traditional dissection is \"that it is difficult to understand the construction of anatomy when approached from the outside in. \u2026 If the system is built first, and then dissected, the value of the dissection is increased tremendously.\" A variety of skeletal models with clay and resource materials are available.\n\nThieme Medical Publishers offers a number of physiology simulations. According to the company, \"The Virtual Physiology series consists of 5 interactive simulation CD-ROMs: SimNerv, SimMuscle, SimVessel, SimHeart and SimPatch. The series covers the entire field of nerve-muscle physiology and simulates all of the classic experiments conducted by medical, dental, veterinary, zoology, and science students.\"\n\nSheffield Biosciences offers physiology computer learning packages that are superior alternatives to the use of live animals, including \"Nerve Physiology,\" \"Muscle Physiology,\" and \"Frog Heart\" programs"}

It is appropriate for more advanced students who are learning about research and ways to analyze data.\n\nObjective\n\nStudents will learn how to estimate age and size of turtles, and understand variability in scientific data.\n\nMaterials\n\nLive turtle or turtle shell\n\nFlexible transparent ruler with millimeter scale\n\nCopies of two diagrams: Measuring Turtle Length and Estimating Turtle Age from Scutes\n\nProcedure\n\nIdentify the parts of the shell including carapace (back), plastron (underside), and scutes (scales).\n\nRefer to the diagram to show students how to measure the length of the turtle's plastron along the midline from one end to the other. Then demonstrate how to measure the carapace length using first the straight-line method and then the curved-line method.\n\nHave students measure the length of each turtle shell and record their measurements.\n\nPoint out the lines on the scutes of either the carapace or plastron. Use the diagram to demonstrate how to count the lines on one scute. The number of lines on each scute represents an estimate of the age of the turtle.\n\nHave each student independently measure the turtle's carapace length and record the measurement on a piece of paper. Be sure that everyone uses the same method, either straight-line or curved. Also have each student count the number of lines on a scute and record the estimate of the turtle's age.\n\nAssign two people the job of reading the measurements off the slips of paper and recording them in tables on the board. Did everyone use the same units of measure? If not, convert the values to the same units. Calculate the average of the measurements for the length and age of the turtle.\n\nIdentify the maximum and minimum values reported for length and age of the\nturtle. These values will give the students an idea of the variability involved in measuring. Have the students talk about exactly how each person measured the\nshell and compare techniques. The variability in how they measured the shell is a type of sampling error. It always occurs in sampling and can be a problem for\nscientists trying to gather exact information. Some of the sampling error is due to mistakes, whereas some is due to differences in researcher technique. Discuss with the students how they might reduce this sort of variability. For example, teachers might provide clearer directions for taking measurements, or researchers might practice on a model or separate animal first.\n\nAsk the students to identify other kinds of variability that might affect the accuracy of their results. For example, turtles may not add exactly one growth line per year, so counting the lines may not give an accurate measure of age. Also, as turtles get older, their shells often get so worn that some or all of the growth lines may be obliterated.\n\nHave the students take the entire range of sizes recorded and divide it into five equal intervals. Draw a graph with the size intervals on the x-axis and numbers on the y-axis ranging from zero to the total number of students. Have the students plot the total number of measurements that were recorded by them within each of the size intervals. This is a graph of the distribution of the variability of the measurements. If all the measurements were the same, there would be only one point on the graph. Usually, however, you will see a bell-shaped curve, with the most measurements occurring at the average size and a few measurements near the minimum and maximum sizes. This is the famous bell curve of a normal distribution. In general, the more measurements you have, the\nsmoother the curve.\n\nFinish by talking about why there might be more measurements near the average size. Much of the statistical analysis that researchers perform begins by examining the information in the same way that the students have just done"}

The strength and support offered by religious values is certainly not specific to science content; however, the support received from their beliefs highlights a potential area for further exploration. Given the importance of increasing participation by students from diverse backgrounds into science fields, it is critical to recognize how some of these differences may be the key factors influencing the way these students look at the world. This study offers evidence that science educators need to consider what role religious beliefs have for students who may be considering science or science education as a future career, particularly for those students from underrepresented groups.The value of mangroves and mangrove ecosystems has not always been recognized. In fact, mangroves were historically regarded largely as wastelands with little or no value. Over time, humans began to recognize the multiple ways in which they could be used, particularly through development, making the mangrove ecosystem vulnerable to destruction and depletion, a globally alarming issue. Mangrove depletion is presented here as socioscientific issue cases with activities designed to promote and strengthen ocean literacy. Through these activities, students can explore scientific concepts relating to mangrove ecosystems while fostering moral and ethical reasoning to determine what is affected and valued, and who shares responsibility.

The kits provide families an opportunity to read at home while connecting the enjoyable experience to science content and skill development through associated activities. The kits should be constructed using easy-reading books and aligned to developmentally appropriate academic science standards. Most importantly, they should be designed in a manner so that all family members are participants rather than expecting the adults to teach the expected outcomes. The activity kits can be completed as stand-alone experiences for interested students, used by students who are ready for an additional challenge, or adapted for an entire classroom of students as part of a teacher's normal curriculum. (Contains 1 table, 6 figures, and 3 resourcesEstablished in the early 1970s, the talent search model has garnered strong theoretical and programming support for addressing the academic needs of highly able students. The two main components of the talent search model are discovery (identification) and development (programming) of academic talent. Discovery of academically talented elementary and middle school students occurs via the process of above-level testing, usually offered through university-based centers. The essence of talent search program intervention is acceleration, which has robust research support as the most effective intervention for high-ability students. Whereas talent search identification and programming are university based, talent search participants receive nearly all of their instruction in K-12 settings, where academic acceleration is less likely to be implemented. In this investigation, a large sample of talent search participants (n = 5,844) were asked questions designed to measure the various ways in which the students study mathematics, science, and language arts (writing and reading) in the K-12 setting. More than two thirds of the study sample reported that they were taught in the regular classroom, learning the same material, at the same level and pace as nongifted peers. The type of curriculum differentiation or program delivery model (e.g., small-group instruction) reported by the students varied according to subject area, with the greatest percentage of reports of differentiated delivery in mathematics. Main effects were found for gender, grade, and ability. Implications for school-based accelerative interventions are presented. (Contains 5 tables and 1 figureExposing students to the application of math and science through a design-based activity can make them more technologically literate and teach integration between the STEM disciplines at an early age. This article discusses an activity that originated as a portion of a green residential house project conducted by the authors with their high school level students. The windmill portion was specifically targeted and broken down by the authors to work with elementary school students studying alternative energy at Kipps Elementary School in Blacksburg, VA. This activity can be completed at the upper elementary level as students enter Piaget's concrete operational stage and possess the fine motor skills to complement their logical thinking. This activity shows that teachers at any level, but specifically Grades 3-6, can be innovative in adapting lessons to promote technological literacy.Note:The following two links\nare not-applicable for text-based browsers or screen-reading software.Show\nHide\nFull Abstract"}

In this soil composition activity students participate in soil sedimentation and filtration activities. The students discuss what non-living and living things are in soil and why it is so important.\n\nStudents are introduced to the differences that exist in soil properties with depth. They are introduced to the factors that influence a soil's development (soil forming factors). Pupils are introduced to the impact of soil of soil compositional differences on land use.\n\nStudents determine the soil composition of soil layers in their area. They collect soil samples, calculate the percentage soil water content, analyze data, and evaluate each site for future tree growth.\n\nStudents complete activities to learn about soil composition. In this soil composition lesson, students complete eight days of activities to learn about soil composition, the Earth's climate and soil composition, and various related lab and journal activities.\n\nFifth graders study erosion and its impact on the Earth. For this erosion study lesson, 5th graders watch a PowerPoint that illustrates examples of erosion. Students create a vocabulary matrix for related terms and complete a graphic organizer about soil compositions. Students complete a creative writing activity as a piece of soil or sand on a journey.\n\nWhat a great lesson! Learners experiment with different types of soil (clay, silt, and sand) to see how water moves through these substances. As an additional activity, they add marbles to the mix, and see what happens. Afterward, they discuss the results.\n\nBegin with the third slide to help earth science learners investigate one of our most valuable natural resources: soil. Straightforward and fact-filled slides define soil, describe its formation and composition, and explore reclamation and conservation practices. This is most appropriate for high school or college-level geology courses when beginning a unit on soil science.\n\nFourth graders examine soil to find its contents, and how much water and air they can measure. In this soil composition activity, 4th graders perform three experiments and record their results. In one experiment they examine the soil for mineral matter with a hand lens. The others test for air and water content."}

To\nparticipate in the My Environment, My\nHealth, My Choices curriculum development project, I needed a topic related\nto at least one of these regions. From a history perspective, acid rain\ninterested me because it has impacted the last 25 years of Canadian history, it\naffects both Canada and the United States (with each country causing problems for\nthe other), and it is a vital issue to both New York State and its provincial\nneighbor, Ontario, Canada.Acid rain is\nalso a current topic; in the last few years, New York and other states have\ntaken legal and diplomatic steps to address the issue\n\nThis\nsocial studies unit was designed as one part of an interdisciplinary\nproblem-based environmental health unit for middle school students.But, if teacher expectations for student\nperformance are raised, the unit could easily be used for high school students.I have used the entire unit in my social\nstudies class.Because of the unit's\ninterdisciplinary approach, portions of this unit could be completed in science\nand English classes.For example, the\noral reports and letter writing could be done during English classes.Research on acid rain, perhaps with\nsupplementary laboratory activities, could be done in science classes.\n\nThis\nunit explores a complex, current topic that shows the international,\n\"borderless\" nature of certain environmental health issues. It is particularly\nsuited to a social studies curriculum involving the study of Canada and the\nUnited States.In addition to the basic\nscience knowledge required to understand acid rain, this unit also requires\nstudents to explore human health and environmental justice issues, and to use\ngeography, research, writing, and public speaking skills.As an interdisciplinary unit, it also\nincorporates English language and science standards.\n\nAndrew Ragan\n\nRush-Henrietta\nHigh School\nINTRODUCTION:\n\nThis 11- day unit uses\nintegrated\/interdisciplinary problem-based learning to focus on acid rain: its\nsources, environmental effects, health effects, economic impact, political\nimpact, and potential solutions in the United States and Canada.The introductory problem, \"Killing Killer\nRain,\" asks students to research specific questions about acid rain in order to\nmake recommendations to government officials about the future of coal-burning\npower plants, a major source of the acid rain. Questions raised are:\n\nWhy do we\nhave acid rain?\n\nWho is\naffected by acid rain?\n\nHow\ndangerous is acid rain to our health?\n\nAre\nAmericans and Canadians willing to make energy consumption sacrifices in\norder tackle the acid rain and problem?\n\nStudents\nare challenged to define the problem, to work in teams to research questions\nrelated to the problem, and to present their reports and recommendations to the\nclass. For this unit, the class is divided into six research groups, each with\nstudents of mixed ability. Each group researches and reports on acid rain from\na different perspective.Each group is assigned\none of these six areas:\n\n1.Sources,\nGeography and Geology\n\n2.Potential\nSolutions\n\n3.Environmental\nImpact\n\n4.Economics\n\n5.Politics\n\n6.Human\nHealth\n\nWithin each group, individual students do research on specific\nquestions and then report their analysis of the research to others in their\ngroup.The group then uses this\ninformation to make recommendations for problem solutions and presents a report\non their recommendations to the class.\n\nGOALS &\nOBJECTIVES:\n\nThe goals and\nobjectives of this curriculum are:\n\nTo raise awareness among students\nabout an environmental health issue that affects their lives\n\nTo introduce students to a real\nworld problem whose solution requires knowledge of geography, history, politics,\nsociology and economics.\n\nTo engage students in active learning and problem\nsolving through a problem-based learning scenario.\n\nTo aid students in their search for information using\nboth print and electronic sources, help students analyze information for\nauthenticity and relevancy, and provide models for proper documentation of\nsources.\n\nTo teach students how information can be used to help\nsolve a problem.\n\nTo encourage collaborative learning, interpersonal\ncommunication, and organizational skills through group work\n\nTo encourage student participation in and understanding\nof current events, public debate, civics, and advocacy approaches.\n\nTo promote writing and public speaking skills through\nclass presentations on group findings and recommendations.\n\nUNIT OVERVIEW:\n\nDay One: Introduction to Environmental Health\n\nStudents discuss the definition of\nenvironmental health in small groups.They brainstorm a list of things they could do to improve the\nenvironment and reduce environmental health risks.\n\nTeacher\nInformation\n\nHandout\n#1 - Canada Map Assignment\n\nAnswer\nKey to Canada Map Assignment\n\nDay Two: Canadian Geography\n\nUsing a cooperative classroom activity\nand a homework assignment, students establish their current level of knowledge\nof Canadian geography and gather new information. A classroom game is used to\nenhance knowledge.\n\nTeacher\nInformation\n\nHandout\n#2 - Canada Geo Game\n\nAnswer\nKey to Canada Geo Game\n\nDay Three: Exploring the Problem as a Class\n\nThe class reads and discusses the Killing Killer Rain scenario.\n\nTeacher\nInformation\n\nHandout\n#3 - Killing Killer Rain\n\nDay Four: Exploring the Problem in Small Groups\n\nStudents are divided into six groups of\nthree to four students to brainstorm questions about acid rain and\nenvironmental health.

Groups are assigned a topic with related\nquestions. They develop a research plan.They work in groups to conduct Internet and library research, or\norganize the results of their research, and to develop group reports.\n\nTeacher\nInformation\n\nHandout\n#6 - Killer Rain Group Questions\n\nHandout\n#7 - Sources of Information about Acid Rain\n\nHandout\n#8 - Citation Formats\n\nDays Eight,\nNine and Ten:Presenting research\n\nGroups present their findings and\nrecommendations to the class.After\ngroup reports are presented, discuss what students have learned and how\nstudents can make a difference.Students are then asked to write a draft letter stating their opinion\nregarding whether new coal-burning power plants should be built and whether\nanti-pollution requirements for older power plants should be reduced.\n\nTeacher\nInformation\n\nHandout\n#9 - Killer Rain Summary Report Assessment\n\nHandout\n#10a or #10b - Write a Letter!\n\nDay Eleven: Write a Letter\n\nTeacher returns the draft letters to\nstudents for peer review and revision. Students then write final letter and\nmail it to public officials.\n\nHandout\n#11 - Write a Letter Grading Rubric\n\nUNIT ASSESSMENT:\n\nStudents\nare graded for this unit based primarily upon the individually written summary\nreports contributed to their groups, the group presentations, the letters\nwritten to a public official, and participation in class discussions and group\nwork.\n\nThe Killer Rain\nSummary Report counts for 50% of the unit grade. It is scored out of 100\npoints as per the rubric provided.\n\nHomework counts for\n15% of the unit grade. There are two formal homework assignments worth a\ntotal of 134 points.\n\nThe\nHomework Canada Map is worth 84\npoints\n\nThe\nWrite a Letter homework\nassignment is worth 30 points. A rubric is provided for the. Write a\nLetter\" homework assignment.\n\nParticipation counts\nfor 15% of the unit grade. Students are given 5 points for each day they\ncontribute to group or class discussions.\n\nTEACHER\nREFLECTION:\n\nBy teaching this Environmental Health\nunit, I achieved my primary goals. My students gained an understanding of the\ninternational nature of some environmental issues through their study of acid\nrain, they realized the complexity of the issue from the economic, health, and\npolitical perspectives, they noted the different ways Canada and the U.S.\napproached the same issues, they sharpened their research and public speaking\nskills, they reinforced their U.S.-Canada geographical knowledge, and, perhaps\nmost importantly, they came to understand the importance of discussing and\ntaking action on public issues. In fact, as an added bonus, the class received\na congratulation letter from The Adirondack Council in the spring term for\ntheir participation in the process that led to a significant U.S. EPA ruling\nthat should result in major cuts to emissions that cause acid rain.\n\nThe Killing\nKiller Rain scenario engaged my students primarily because most of them had\ntheir own stories from the Blackout of 2003 to share. The geography component\nestablishes, early on in the unit, the shared boundaries and natural features\nof Canada and the U.S..\n\nI was pleased with the level of\nsophistication many of the students reached in their understanding of the\nissues on all sides of the acid rain debate. Some of the reports were quite\ncomprehensive. Moreover, many of the students used the information they had\ndiscovered quite well (and passionately) in their letters to public officials\nregarding energy and environmental policies currently being debated. Many also\nheard back from the public officials they wrote, including President Bush,\nSenator Charles Schumer, and Representative Louise Slaughter.\n\nAndrew Ragan\n\nAllendale\nColumbia School\n\nRochester, NY\n\nNEW\nYORK STATE EDUCATION STANDARDS\n\nThe Killing\nKiller Rain unit correlates with the following New York State education\nstandards:\n\nEnglish\nLanguage Arts:\n\nStudents will listen,\nspeak, read, and write for information and understanding.

As listeners and\nreaders, students will analyze experiences, ideas, information, and issues\npresented by others using a variety of established criteria. As speakers and\nwriters, they will use oral and written language that follows the accepted\nconventions of the English language to present, from a variety of perspectives,\ntheir opinions and judgments on experiences, ideas, information and issues.\n\nSocial\nStudies:\n\nStandard 2: Information Systems\n\nStudents will access,\ngenerate, process, and transfer information using appropriate technologies.\n\nStandard 3:Geography\n\nStudents will use\na variety of intellectual skills to demonstrate their understanding of the\ngeography of the interdependent world in which we live - local, national,\nglobal- including the distribution of people, places, and environments over the\nEarth's surface.\n\nStandard 4: Economics\n\nStudents will\nuse a variety of intellectual skills to demonstrate their understanding of how\nthe United States and other societies develop economic systems and associated\ninstitutions to allocate scarce resources, how major decision-making units\nfunction in the U.S. and other national economies, and how an economy solves\nthe scarcity problem through market and nonmarket mechanisms.\n\nStandard 5: Civics, Citizenship,\nand Government\n\nStudents will\nuse a variety of intellectual skills to demonstrate their understanding of the\nnecessity of establishing governments; the governmental system of the U.S. and\nother nations; the U.S. Constitution; the basic civic values of American\nconstitutional democracy; and the roles, rights, and responsibilities of\ncitizenship, including avenues of participation.\n\nMathematics,\nScience and Technology:\n\nStandard\n4\n\nStudents will understand and apply\nscientific concepts, principles, and theories pertaining to the physical\nsetting and living environment and recognize the historical development of\nideas in science.\n\nKey Idea 7:Human decisions and activities have had a profound impact on the\nphysical and living environment.\n\nIntermediate Level:\n\n\u00b7Performance Indicator 7.1Describe how living things, including humans, depend upon the living and\nnonliving environment for their survival.\n\n\u00b7Performance Indicator 7.2 Describe the effects of\nenvironmental changes on humans and other populations.\n\nCommencement Level:\n\n\u00b7Performance Indicator 7.1 Describe the range of\ninterrelationships of humans with the living and nonliving environment.\n\n\u00b7Performance Indicator 7.2Explain the impact of technological development and growth in the human\npopulation on the living and nonliving environment.\n\n\u00b7Performance Indicator 7.3Explain how individual choices and societal actions can contribute to\nimproving the environment.\nDay One: An Introduction to Environmental Health\n\nDescription: This class session is intended to\ngenerate student interest and excitement in the Killing Killer Rain\nenvironmental health unit as a unique learning experience.\n\nObjective:Students will\ndemonstrate comprehension and evaluation skills by defining the term\n\"environmental health\" and reflecting upon its relationship and importance to\nour lives.\n\nTime allotted:One class\nperiod.\n\nMaterials:\n\n\u00b7Large sheets of paper (one per group)\n\n\u00b7Tape, if paper is not self-adhesive\n\n\u00b7Markers (one per group)\n\n\u00b7List of students assigned to each of the six groups\n\n\u00b7Blackboard, white board, or paper on wall for brainstorming\n\n\u00b7One Homework Canada\nMap (Handout #1) per student\n\nActivities:\n\n1.Model how to develop a working definition with the whole\nclass by working through an example.A\npossible word to use for this exercise is \"home economics.\" After writing the\nterm on the board, ask students to define \"home\" first, and write suggestions\non the board. Do the same for the term \"economics.\" Ask students to suggest a\ndefinition for the entire term based upon their definitions of each word.\n\n2.Group students into six teams of students (3-6 per team\ndepending on class size). Provide each group with a large piece of paper, a\nmarker, and a place in the room to work. Direct each group to take 10 minutes\nto compose its own working definition of \"environmental health.\"\n\n3.Call the whole class back to order. Ask for a volunteer from\neach group to share its definition of \"environmental health\", and write the\ndefinitions on the board. Work with the class again to craft a single working\ndefinition of the term \"environmental health.\"\n\n4.As a whole group, take another 10 minutes to brainstorm a\nlist detailing things that students think might impact our environmental health.\nCompile the list on the board.\n\n5.Using the new list on the board, groups should work together\nto make alterations or additions to their original, working definitions of \"environmental\nhealth\". Discussion can run until the completion of the allotted time.\n\nHomework for next class: Hand out copies of Handout #1 Homework Canada Map to each student. Explain that their homework\nwill be to fill in an extensive map of Canada. Students may use any resources\nthey can find, including textbooks, atlases, wall maps, encyclopedias, and the\nInternet. The information from this assignment will be used for a game on Day\nTwo.\n\nDay\nTwo: Canada off the Top of Your Head - Geography of Canada Game\n\nDescription: This lesson\nestablishes the geography of Canada as it relates to the United States.It is optional if your students already\ncomprehend geographical relationships between Canada and the United\nStates.Using a simple cooperative\nclassroom activity and their homework assignment, students discover their\ncurrent levels of knowledge about the geography of Canada and gather new\ninformation.\n\nObjectives: Students will\nuse identification and research skills in a collaborative activity to help them\nlearn anew or reinforce their knowledge of Canada's geography and introduce\ngeographical terms they will need to understand and discuss Canada and the\nCanada-U.S. acid rain issue.\n\nTime\nallotted:One and a half\n45-minute sessions or a total of about 60 minutes.\n\nMaterials:\n\n\u00b7Wall map of Canada with masking or medical tape covering\nnames of provinces, territories and their capitals, U.S. states bordering\nCanada, and major Canadian water bodies\n\n\u00b7Five copies of Canada\nGeo Game (Handout #2), a fill-in-map of Canada showing the boundaries and\nlocations of provinces, territories, capitals, U.S. states bordering Canada,\nand major Canadian water bodies\n\n\u00b7One answer key to Canada\nGeo Game (for teacher)\n\n\u00b7Access to wall maps of North America, atlases,\nencyclopedias, and the Internet\n\n\u00b7One answer key to Homework\nCanada Map (for teacher)\n\n\u00b7One red pen for each student\n\n\u00b7Board and chalk or markers\n\n\u00b7Prizes (for example, a \"homework pass\" or candy)\n\nActivities\n\n1.Explain to students that you will not be collecting their\nhomework until later in the period. Ask them to keep their homework sheets out\nof sight until then.\n\n2.Divide students into mixed groups and allow them to choose\ntheir own group names and secretaries. On the board, make a column for each\ngroup.\n\n3.Hand out one copy of Canada\nGeo Game to each group.\n\n4.Allow student groups 10 minutes to fill in the blanks on\ntheir maps with the names of as many provinces, their capitals, bordering U.S.\nstates, and water bodies as the group can generate without looking at their homework or any outside resources,\nincluding books, wall maps, the Internet, etc. Group secretaries write in the\nanswers.\n\n5.Call the class to order, allowing students to stay in their\ngroups. Instruct the group secretaries\nto grade their groups' fill-in maps \"on their honor.\" Using your Canada Geo Game answer key and a wall\nmap of Canada with tape over the labels, ask students to help identify each\nprovince, territory, and their capitals, U.S. states bordering Canada, and\nimportant bodies of water in or bordering Canada. After a place is identified\ncorrectly, pull the tape off that label and ask the secretaries whether their\ngroups identified that place correctly.For each place identified correctly, the group gets 5 points. Keeping a\nrunning tally of points, continue until all provinces, territories and their\ncapitals, U.S. bordering states, and important water bodies have been\nidentified. The secretaries should write in answers that their groups did not\nget. Provide answers for those places no groups identify.\n\n6.Members of the group with the most points receive a prize\n(homework pass, candy).\n\n7.Explain to students that the United States and Canada share\nthe longest unprotected border in the world. We also share elements of a common\nhistory and culture, as well as climate, natural resources, physical geography,\nand environmental problems. Inform students that our environmental health unit\nwill deal with one of these common issues.\n\n8.Ask students to take out their Homework Canada Map answer sheets, and make sure each student has a\nred pen. Have students mark their homework sheets as you read the answers.\nCollect the marked homework sheets.Homework counts for 15% of the students'\ngrade for this unit. For each correct answer on this homework exercise,\nstudents receive one Homework Point.The maximum points possible for this exercise: 84.\n\nHomework:Study for Canada Map Quiz to be given on Day Four.\n\nDay Three:Killing the Killer Rain Scenario\n\nDescription: Students are\nintroduced to the acid rain problem using a problem-based learning scenario Killing Killer Rain. This scenario is a fictional account of a 7th\ngrade teacher who listens to the stories her students tell about what happened\nto them during the \"Great Power Blackout\" during the summer of 2003.Class discussion raises many questions\nabout power generation in Canada and the United States.Students read the scenario, discuss the\nscenario, and work in groups to generate specific questions about acid\nrain.\n\nObjectives:To engage students in active learning and problem solving\nthrough a problem based learning scenario.\n\nTime\nallotted:One 45-minute\nsession\n\nMaterials:\n\n\u00b7One copy of Handout #3 Killing\nKiller Rain for each student\n\n\u00b7Board and chalk or markers\n\nActivities:\n\nBriefly review what students learned in the first\nlesson establishing the geography of Canada. Remind them that Canada and\nthe United States share a 5,525 mile border extending from the Atlantic\nOcean to the Pacific Ocean. Ask students what major physical features are\nshared by the United States and Canada, and list them on the board.\nResponses might include the Great Lakes, the Rocky and Appalachian\nMountains, the Great Plains, the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and many rivers.\n\nDivide the class into six mixed ability groups, each\nwith three or four students. Ask each group to generate on a sheet of\nscrap paper a list of problems the United States and Canada might share as\na result of their common border and physical features. Responses might\ninclude terrorism, pollution, immigration, water access, mineral access,\nand endangered species. List these on the board.\n\n3.Distribute the Killing\nthe Killer Rain scenario (Handout #3). Inform students that this scenario\nis based on a real situation.Explain\nthat the situation is one that many of them experienced themselves. Ask\nstudents if they remember their own experiences during the power outage that\nstruck the Northeast U.S. in August, 2003.\n\nHave students read the scenario aloud in class, each\nstudent reading one paragraph.This problem-based learning scenario is entitled Killing Killer Rain. It is a\nfictional account of a 7th grade teacher who listens to the\nstories her students tell about what happened to them during the \"Great\nPower Blackout\" during the summer of 2003. The class's discussion of this\nscenario should raise many questions about power generation in the U.S.\nand Canada, its effects on the two countries' environments and economies,\nand how the media has handled such issues.\n\nExplain that acid rain, the focus of this unit, is an\nissue that affects both the U.S. and Canada.\n\nAsk students what they know about acid rain\nalready.Write their ideas on the\nboard.\n\nAsk students why acid rain would be a particular\nproblem between the United States and Canada. Remind students that in\nsocial studies they will be looking at how acid rain affects the\neconomies, the politics, the environment, and people's health in Canada\nand the United States.\n\nMake sure all students understand the terms and\nconcepts involved in the reading.Ask students to:\n\nDefine such terms and phrases as\n\"electric grid\" and \"lawsuit.\"\n\nExplain the relationship between\nthe \"Great Power Blackout\" during the summer of 2003 and \"dead lakes\",\nsuch as those found in the Adirondack Mountains area of New York State.\n\nShare how they have seen or\nexperienced the effects of acid rain.\n\nConduct a class discussion to establish some basic\nissues and questions raised by this scenario, and write the ideas on the\nboard. The list might include:\n\nHow important is electricity to\nus, and what are we as a society willing to \"pay\" for it?\n\nIs it fair for people in one part\nof the country or world to create pollution that hurts another part of\nthe country or world, even if a lot of people benefit from what is being\nproduced?\n\nDoes acid rain harm the health of\npeople?\n\nHow do we know who or what to\nbelieve when we read about issues like this?\n\nWhat is being done to solve the\nproblems associated with acid rain?\n\nHomework:Study for Canada Map Quiz (scheduled for next class period)\n\nDay Four:The Situation and the Task\n\nDescription:Students are presented with a situation and task that will\ndirect their research on acid rain.They brainstorm a list of questions that will help them make informed recommendations\nabout whether new coal-burning power plants should be built and whether\nanti-pollution laws should be relaxed for older power plants.\n\nObjectives:Students will demonstrate their\nunderstanding of Canadian geography through a quiz.Students will brainstorm questions about the scenario, the\nsituation, and the task.\n\nMaterials:\n\n\u00b7One answer key Canada\nMap Quiz (for teacher)\n\n\u00b7One copy of Handout # 4 Canada\nMap Quiz for each student.\n\n\u00b7One copy of Handout # 5 Killer\nRain Assignment for each student\n\nActivities\n\n1.Students take\na 10-15 minute Canada Map Quiz\n(Handout #4) testing their knowledge of Canada's geography. Collect quiz.The quiz is out of 33 points, and students\nreceive a percentage grade. Quizzes are 20% of the unit grade.\n\n2.Hand out one\ncopy of Handout #5 Killer Rain Assignment\nto each student.Have one student read\nout loud \"The Situation\" and another read out loud \"Your Task\" at the bottom of\nthe handout.\n\n3.Remind\nstudents that they will be working in groups and tell them that they will be\ngiven 5 points toward their daily participation grade for each day they\ncontribute to their group or class discussions. The participation grade is 15%\nof the unit grade.Monitor each group's\nprogress.\n\n4.Ask each of\nthe small groups to use a marker and their large pads of paper to generate a\nlist of questions, required information, and experts who might help the class\nhandle the task they have been presented.Prompt the groups by asking what information they need to know about\ncoal-burning power plants and acid rain in order to make their recommendation\nto the government. Encourage them to address the questions: Who? What? When? Where? How? and Why? The groups should be given about 10\nminutes to complete this exercise.Notes to Teacher:This works best if each group identifies one member to take\nnotes and write down the questions. Inform students that they may choose a\nsingle spokesperson for their groups, or they may divide the report among group\nmembers.\n\n5.Give groups 5\nminutes to plan how they will present their questions.\n\n6.Have each\ngroup tape or post its large paper on the board and present its ideas. As they\nwork, record their questions on another part of the board\u2014these should be\nclassified under the appropriate headings:\n\na.Sources,\nGeography and Geology\n\nb.Potential\nSolutions\n\nc.Environmental\nImpact\n\nd.Economics\n\ne.Politics\n\nf.Health\n\n7.Once all of\nthe groups have presented, discuss the most popular questions. Be sure to probe\nwhy particular questions are important.\n\nHomework:Students are to use the Internet or magazines\nand newspapers at home or in the library to search for a recent news article\ndealing with acid rain. They will write a one- to two-paragraph summary of the\narticle to hand in. \"Recent\" could be anything from the last two calendar\nyears. The summary should include the publication name, the title of the\narticle, the date, and the author. An attached copy of the article is useful,\nbut not required. A copy of the article\nis not a substitute for the one\nparagraph summary.This homework\nactivity is worth 30 homework points for this unit.\n\nDay Five:Identify the Problem and Begin Research\n\nDescription:Students organize their groups to begin researching both the\nquestions that they generated in the previous class and the questions on their Killer Rain Group Questions sheets. They\nare provided with a list of suggested sources and information on the citation\nformats that they should use for their research.\n\nObjectives:Raise students' awareness about\nenvironmental health issues that affect their lives.Encourage and sharpen basic research skills such as locating\nsources, taking notes, and citing sources.Help students analyze information for authenticity and relevancy.Develop skills for collaborative learning,\ninterpersonal communication, and organization through group work.Teach students how information can be used\nto solve a problem.Encourage student\nparticipation in and understanding of current events, public debate, civics,\nand advocacy approaches.\n\nMaterials:\n\n\u00b7One copy of Handout #6 Killer\nRain Group Questions for each student\n\n\u00b7One copy of Handout #7 Sources\nof Information about Acid Rain for each student\n\n\u00b7One copy of Handout #8 Citation\nFormats for each student\n\n\u00b7At least 10 note cards for each student (or have students\nbring these to class)\n\n\u00b7Access to computer room with printer (and paper) and to the\nlibrary\n\nActivities:\n\n1.Students break\ninto their groups.Remind students that\ntheir ultimate task is to advise U.S. and Canadian officials about whether to\nbuild new coal-burning power plants and whether to ease anti-pollution\nrequirements for older plants.\n\n2.Direct\nstudents to look at the third paragraph on the Killer Rain Assignment sheet (Handout #5) and follow along as you\nread the instructions. Read the rest of the assignment sheet to students and\nanswer student questions about the assignment.\n\n3.Note to Teacher:Be particularly clear about three matters:\n\n\u00a7Students in each group are responsible for dividing\nresponsibilities within the group.That\nis, each student within the group should tackle specific questions on the\ngroup's list. However, group members are free to share sources of information\nwith other members in order to help the whole group.\n\n\u00a7Each student must hand in a 1-2 page typewritten summary\n(report) addressing the questions he or she answered for the group. Although\nstudents would be wise to use these reports to help them prepare for their oral\npresentations, they should not read directly from their written reports.\n\n\u00a7Note cards are required to record information; students must\ndocument their sources. (See Handout #5 for proper citation formats.)\n\n5.Tell students\nthat they will have the remainder of Day Five class time and the next two class\nperiods to work individually and with their groups to research their\ntopic.They should use the questions\ngenerated in the previous class and the questions on the Group Questions sheets to organize their research.\n\n6.Students\nshould use Internet sources in the computer lab and print sources in the\nlibrary.Be available to assist\nstudents in their searches for information and the writing of their summaries.Be certain to check that students are\npreparing note cards using the required citation formats.\n\nHomework:Continue researching and writing note cards with citations.\n\nDay Six:Continue Research\n\nActivities:\n\nStudents work individually and in small groups to\nresearch the answers to theirHomework:Continue researching, writing note cards, and preparing to\nreport the results of their research.\n\nDay Seven:Continue Research\nand Organize to Prepare for Group Oral Reports\n\nActivities:\n\nDuring the first half of class, students work\nindividually and in small groups to finish researching the answers to\ntheirDuring the last half of class, students work in small\ngroups to prepare for the group report that they will give on Day 8.\n\nHomework:Continue researching and preparing for Killer Rain reports.\n\nDays Eight, Nine and\nTen (depending on\nclass size): Group Reports\n\nDescription:Groups present the results of their research and their\nrecommendations to their classmates.\n\nObjectives:Raise students' awareness about environmental health issues\nthat affect their lives.Encourage\nstudent participation in and understanding of current events, public debate,\ncivics, and advocacy approaches.Encourage student participation in and understanding of current events,\npublic debate, civics, and advocacy approaches.Promote public speaking skills through class presentations on\ngroup findings and recommendations.\n\n1.Give all\ngroups an additional 10 minutes to organize their information in preparation\nfor their reports to the class.Remind\nthem that their presentation should include: their findings about acid rain and\ntheir recommendation for whether the U.S. or Canada should build new coal-burning\npower plants and\/or ease anti-pollution requirements for older plants.\n\n2.Give\neach group 10 minutes to present its findings about acid rain and its sources\nto the class. Each group should also recommend whether the U.S. or Canada\nshould build new coal-burning power plants and whether to ease anti-pollution\nrequirements for older plants.Depending on the size of the class, the presentations should take 2-3 class\nperiods.\n\n3.At the end of\neach presentation, collect individual student summaries, citations, and note\ncards.\n\nNote to teacher:Use the Handout #9 Killer Rain\nSummary Report Assessment to score each student's individual report as they\npresent, and then use the same sheet to grade the written part of the project.\nIt is strongly recommended that you complete the grade sheets for each student\nas soon as possible, preferably the day of a student's presentation. This will\nenhance your ability to remember and respond to each student's presentation; it\nwill also make your grading management task far easier later.\n\n4.After all\ngroups have presented their reports, discuss the class's efforts and what it\ndiscovered about acid rain and its sources. Prompt students with questions such\nas:\n\na.What was the\nmost interesting information learned from either your research or that of your\nclassmates?\n\nb.Do you believe\nthat acid rain is a problem society has to deal with? How many don't? Why or\nwhy not?\n\nc.Did anything\nmake you mad about the issue of acid rain? If so, why? Ask at what point during\nthis project they thought to themselves, \"That's not right\" or \"That's\nunfair\"?)\n\nd.Can average\ncitizens and middle school students help solve a problem such as this? How?\n\nNote to Teacher: Ideally, for questions \"a\" through\n\"c,\" students will address acid rain's effects on human health and the fact\nthat affected populations usually live far away from the sources of the\nproblem. Some might be angered by the fact that technological solutions to the\nproblem are available, yet they are not implemented because of costs. As for\nquestion \"d,\" some students will offer concrete actions such as ways they\nthemselves can conserve energy to reduce emissions from coal burning power\nplants, automobiles, or other sources.Others may come up with the idea that we can vote for politicians who\nwill act on the issue, or that they can write to public officials expressing\ntheir viewpoints. If students do not generate these latter approaches, prompt\nthem to do so, and discuss the role of elected officials and our\nresponsibilities as citizens. Emphasize that elected officials want to know\nwhat their constituents think, and that all of our voices count. This will set\nthe stage for the final assignment of the unit, Write a Letter. Continue to\nfollow any news related to energy and environmental issues, particularly those\nrelated to coal-burning power plants and acid rain.\n\n5.Distribute the\nHandout #10a or #10b Write a Letter!\nhomework assignment and explain that this will be the final segment of the Killing Killer Rain unit in Social\nStudies. It is an opportunity for each student to use his\/her knowledge to help\nformulate a letter expressing his\/her views to a public official about acid\nrain and the government's energy and environmental policies.If time permits, allow students to begin\nthis assignment during class.\n\nNote to Teacher: There are two versions of the Write a Letter assignment (Handout #10a\nand Handout #10b).In the Handout #10b\nassignment, students read several articles\nthat address Clean Air Act,in addition to writing their letters.Version #10b is lengthier but offers more\npolitical context and content.\n\nHomework: Give students\ntwo days to complete a first draft of the Write\na Letter assignment.\n\nDay Eleven:Complete the Write a Letter assignment\n\nDescription:Students \"peer review\" letters written by their classmates.By doing so, they make suggestions for\npotential revisions and have an opportunity to read about the acid rain problem\nsomeone else's perspective.\n\nObjectives:Raise students' awareness about environmental health issues\nthat affect their lives.Encourage\nstudent participation in and understanding of current events, public debate,\ncivics, and advocacy approaches. Teach students how information can be used to\nsolve a problem.Encourage student\nparticipation in and understanding of current events, public debate, civics,\nand advocacy approaches.Promote\nwriting and public speaking skills through class presentations on group\nfindings and recommendations.\n\nMaterials:\n\n\u00b7Letters that students have written for homework.\n\n\u00b7One red pen or pencil for each student\n\n\u00b7Handout #11 \"Write a\nLetter\" Homework Grading Rubric\n\nActivities:\n\nHave students work in groups to proofread and provide\nsuggestions on the first draft of the group members' letters to public\nofficials.Make sure students use\na proper business letter format, correct spelling (including names) and\ngrammar, and accurate addresses.\n\nGive students one more day to revise their work and\ncomplete a final draft of their letters that are ready to be mailed to\npoliticians.\n\nCollect the letters on their final due date. Grade the\nletters as a homework assignment based on the revisions they made and\neffort. Students can earn up to 30 Homework Points for this assignment.\n(See Handout #11 \"Write a Letter\"\nHomework Grading Rubric.)\n\nAfter the letters have been graded, provide envelopes\nand stamps for students to mail their letters. Have students address the\nenvelopes in class and stamp them. Mail the letters for your students, and\nask them to report back if they receive responses."}

{"text":"Email Newsletter\n\nSite search\n\nSearch for:\n\nSelect a Post Category\n\nAquaponics and Educating Children\n\nAquaponics is a fantastic tool for bringing a wide variety of subjects to life for children. The bacteria in the grow beds, the fish in the tank, and plants growing in rocks are all terrific foundations for biology lessons. The spectrum of the grow lights, the inner workings of a bell siphon and water moving through the system can all be part of several physics lessons. The dynamics of pH and how it changes in aquaponics can make chemistry come alive. And, my favorite, learning how integrated eco-systems work and how, if you change one element (for example, temperature) its effects permeate the entire system.\n\nI've been thinking a lot lately about how aquaponics can be used in education. That is probably due to the convergence last week of three events at The Aquaponic Source around education.\n\nCurriculum \u2013 We shipped our first Complete Aquaponics Curriculum Sets last week! This product has taken over a year to launch and it sure felt good to see those first sets boxed up and ready to go. Why did it take so long? Well, we started early last summer with a series of meetings with the two teachers who were our mentors through the development. Then we wrote a lesson and worked with them to make sure that the format worked well for a teacher. We revised and reviewed again until they were happy with it. Then the writing started. As we completed each lesson, the teachers used them in their classroom, supplied feedback, and we revised yet again. Once we had made it through all 24 lessons, we focused on formatting and getting the product polished and ready to ship. We feel especially proud of how well this aquaponics curriculum has been received by the teachers and students at the MESA Elementary program and look forward to working with many other schools in the future.\n\nAquaponics Systems \u2013 Today we finished packing up an AquaBundance 4-bed Easy Reach system for the Cal Farley's Boys Ranch in Texas. This system is going to be used as part of their science curriculum in their outstanding program for disadvantaged children. In fact, we've been surprised at how many of our systems ship to schools and other organizations that work with children! We have systems in a few colleges now, including Michigan Tech (see video), a private school in Massachusetts, and another Boys and Girls Club. We are about to ship to a school district in New Mexico and a school in Maryland. It seems that as the word spreads about the benefits of aquaponics, more and more schools are seeking grants or private funding to purchase aquaponics systems for their students. We hope this trend continues!\n\nChildren's Museums \u2013 There are many ways that children learn, however many of them are not in a classroom. This week Alan and I were invited to a meeting with the director of the Denver Children's Museum, along with the person who is in charge of their exhibits.\n\nAlan with Mike Yankovich, President and CEO of the Denver Children's Museum\n\nAfter introductions we learned that the Denver Children's Museum is the busiest Children's Museum in the country on a child visitor per square foot basis, and that they are now looking to expand. Part of this expansion will be a permanent exhibit on growing food and, you guessed it, aquaponics! We explored working with them on this exciting project, which is scheduled to open sometime in 2015. When the meeting was over we got a private tour of the museum, the highlight of which was definitely the bubble room!\n\nIf you have children in your life, please be sure to get them involved in your aquaponics system! The symbiotic magic of aquaponics that we adults find so addictive is even more powerful for children. Let's get them started young!\n\nComments\n\nI'm not sure why there is not more support for the life of the fish in the cycle. To gaze into the eyes of an animal before one takes its life is the the true mark of a compassionate being. To take a life merely to eat it's flesh is not ecologically sound in any society. Go back to \"Modest Proposal\" if you dare.\nR. Mayfield M.F.A."}

Our simple, inclusive license allows you to use the program as you see fit.\n\nWho created Exploration Nation?\n\nThe show was created in 2007 by Enzo Monfre at the age of seven as part of a home school project. He thought of the name and what the show would be about. He continues to drive the creative process and does most of the research for each episode. He also owns a significant part of the company.\n\nI thought television was bad for kids\n\nExploration Nation looks like television but it's not. It is designed for education use. Kids love the face paced media they see on shows like Dirty Jobs and Mythbusters. We simply use this highly effective delivery method to engage kids and support their natural enthusiasm about science.\n\nWe want to interview your hosts for our publication, television show, etc. Who do we contact?\n\nOur hosts have a very busy schedule which includes riding their bikes, studying and exploring the world. They do a number of media interviews every year depending on the schedule, type of publication and other factors. If you are looking for an articulate, charismatic kid to feature, we'd love to hear from you. Call us at 512-663-7393.\n\nWhere do you find those kids?\n\nExploration Nation hosts are referred to us by people we know. Sometimes we reach out to find more kids. None are actors. They just need to love science.\n\nHow can I help Exploration Nation?\n\nBuy a Team XN Pro subscription. Tell your friends. Send a link to your favorite educator.

{"text":"Questions and Answers\n\nGeneral\n\nWhat is biodiversity?\n\nBiodiversity, or biological diversity, means the multitude of living beings, ecosystems and their interrelationships, in space and in time. It is divided into three components: genetic diversity, species diversity, and ecosystem diversity.\n\nWhat materials do I need?\n\nIn addition to your BioKit and a pencil, whatever materials you need to perform the suggested activities are indicated at the beginning of the kit. Generally, the necessary materials are easy to find and to carry: magnifying glass, pocket mirror, camera, and binoculars. Are you missing one of these items? No problem! You'll be able to do most of the activities using just your five senses.\n\nDo I have to have a GPS?\n\nIn some BioKits (e.g. \u00cele Sainte-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, Cap Tourmente and Montr\u00e9al Urban BioKits), use of a GPS is suggested, but it's not compulsory. You will be able to follow the circuits of the \u00eele Sainte-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Cap Tourmente BioKits with a map and the instructions provided in the kit. If you don't have your own GPS, you can rent one for a small fee at the Biosphere and at the Cap Tourmente National Wildlife Area. Note that the use of a GPS is highly recommended to find the geocaches (points of interest located with GPS coordinates)!\n\nWhere can I use the BioKits?\n\nAnywhere in Canada! The BioKits are a fun way to discover the places you'll visit all over Canada, whether in the city or in a natural setting. Some BioKits, such as the Ile Sainte-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne or Cap Tourmente BioKits, are designed for a specific site, while others, like the Nature or Urban BioKit, can be used from coast to coast."}

Explain this by comparing a sponge and a rock, or jeans\nand a raincoat. Both the sponge and jeans absorb water, while\nwater runs off the rock and raincoat. Explain that this occurs\nevery time it rains. Some things absorb water and other things do\nnot, and thus the water runs off them.\n\nDiscuss where water goes after it rains. Make a list of\nplaces where water may go. For each place that is listed, decide\nwhether or not the rain will be absorbed or if it runs off.\n\nAsk students to guess where the water that falls on hills\nwill go. Will it: stay on top of the hill, or flow to the\nbottom?\n\nDo the run-off activity with the students observing. Pretend\nthe marbles are raindrops, and allow each one to roll down the\nhill and leave it where it stops. They should accumulate in one\narea.\n\nQuestions:\n\nWhy did all the marbles go to the same spot?\n\nWhen rain falls on a slope, what is the end result?\n\nCompare what would happen to the rain falling on a parking\nlot, and rain falling on a forest.\n\nVisit the schoolyard prior to a rainfall. Examine the area\nfor low depression areas where water would accumulate to form\npuddles. Also, examine different areas in the schoolyard to\ndetermine if water would be absorbed or forced to run off. After\na rainfall, return to these areas to see if your predictions were\nright."}

{"text":"Visionlearning and the National Science Education Standards\n\nby Jessica E. Zimmer\n\nVisionlearning is a science education system that provides high-quality teaching lessons that can be used in college and high school classrooms. Our lessons are written by professional educators to meet and exceed the goals outlined in the National Science Education Standards (NSES). First outlined in the 1996 book \"The National Science Education Standards\" published by the National Research Council (NRC), a non-profit institution under the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering, the standards set goals for K-12 science education and provide guidance for college education. They have shaped how science classes have developed since the late 1990s.\n\nVisionlearning provides teaching material that meets and exceeds the goals of the NSES. We combine high-quality content written by professional educators and scientists, with links to current news stories and online experiments. Our lessons discuss the historical context and societal impacts of scientific principles while giving students opportunities to ask questions of research scientists, learn alongside their peers and better communicate with their teachers.\n\nVisionlearning has designed content so that it fulfills the requirements of the NRC's Science Content Standards. All of the modules in our Library are categorized by NSES-topics: life science, physical science, earth and space science, beyond the NSES and faculty development. The \"Search by Standard\" tool built into Visionlearning's library allows you to quickly locate relevant lessons. You can locate a link to a listing of our modules by their National Science Education Standard equivalent in the second paragraph of our Library page or on right-side yellow menu of that page. These links will allow you to browse our modules according to which standard they meet.\n\nOur modules are built to incorporate a number of concepts that have not been adequately addressed by textbooks: historical content, societal content, inquiry-based learning and technological comprehension (Slattery 1996). The history behind scientists and scientific discoveries is discussed within lessons and links to biographies, classic research papers and accounts of experiments. Histories and biographies help students to understand how scientific principles come to be developed and accepted (Hurd 1998: 411). An understanding of how science relates to society \u2013 societal content \u2013 is achieved through links to current news stories (in News & Events) and websites that talk about a discovery's place in modern life. There is a place for students to do inquiry-based learning (interactive, question-driven use of material) in the animations and self-assessment quizzes in the module. Visionlearning's modules also incorporate technological comprehension into lessons by encouraging students to use hyperlinks, audio, visual and animation programs (such as Real Audio, Quicktime and Flash) and a computer to find class notes and homework (in MyClassroom).\n\nVisionlearning allows teachers to look at other online classrooms in the MyClassroom section to compare and evaluate different approaches, providing faculty development. Visionlearning's method of establishing NSES standards for college classrooms is cost effective. Since the NRC's recommendations ask that teachers incorporate scientific inquiry and teamwork into classes without extra funding or administrative or government guidance, we at Visionlearning worked to create free accessibility for teachers and students to the site. Published guides of Visionlearning's lessons are also available and are inexpensive.\n\nAt Visionlearning, we believe in several core tenets that the NRC expressed in \"The National Science Education Standards.\" Teaching methods should be as excellent as lesson content. Teachers should individualize their lesson plans. Classes should be directed toward a diverse group of students rather than to the \"mean.\" We look forward to helping you bring your science teaching methods and content up to the goals of the Standards, as well as working with you to keep your lessons distinctive and exciting."}

Engineering\ndesign is an iterative process involving modeling and\noptimization used to develop technological solutions to problems\nwithin given constraints.\n\nStudents engage in\nthe following steps in a design process:\n\nidentify needs and\nopportunities for technical solutions from an investigation of\nsituations of general or social interest.\n\nlocate and utilize a\nrange of printed, electronic, and human information resources to obtain\nideas.\n\nconsider constraints\nand generate several ideas for alternative solutions, using group and\nindividual ideation techniques (group discussion, brainstorming, forced\nconnections, role play); defer judgment until a number of ideas have\nbeen generated; evaluate (critique) ideas; and explain why the chosen\nsolution is optimal.\n\ndevelop plans,\nincluding drawings with measurements and details of construction, and\nconstruct a model of the solution, exhibiting a degree of craftsmanship.\n\nin a group setting,\ntest their solution against design specifications, present and evaluate\nresults, describe how the solution might have been modified for\ndifferent or better results, and discuss tradeoffs that might have to\nbe made.\n\nThis is evident,\nfor example, when students: s reflect on the need for\nalternative growing systems in desert environments and design and\nmodel a hydroponic greenhouse for growing vegetables without\nsoil. s brainstorm and evaluate\nalternative ideas for an adaptive device that will make life\neasier for a person with a disability, such as a device to pick\nup objects from the floor. s design a model vehicle\n(with a safety belt restraint system and crush zones to absorb\nimpact) to carry a raw egg as a passenger down a ramp and into a\nbarrier without damage to the egg. s assess the performance of a\nsolution against various design criteria, enter the scores on a\nspreadsheet, and see how varying the solution might have affected\ntotal score.\n\n2. Technologicalchoose and use\nresources for a particular purpose based upon an analysis and\nunderstanding of their properties, costs, availability, and\nenvironmental impact.\n\nuse a variety of hand\ntools and machines to change materials into new forms through forming,\nseparating, and combining processes, and processes which cause internal\nchange to occur.\n\ncombine manufacturing\nprocesses with other technological processes to produce, market, and\ndistribute a product.\n\nprocess energy into\nother forms and information into more meaningful information.\n\nThis is evident,\nfor example, when students: s choose and use resources to\nmake a model of a building and explain their choice of materials\nbased upon physical properties such as tensile and compressive\nstrength, hardness, and brittleness. s choose materials based upon\ntheir acoustic properties to make a set of wind chimes. s use a torch to heat a steel\nrod to a cherry red color and cool it slowly to demonstrate how\nthe process of annealing changes the internal structure of the\nsteel and removes its brittleness. s change materials into new\nforms using separate processes such as drilling and sawing. s process energy into other\nforms such as assembling a solar cooker using a parabolic\nreflector to convert light energy to heat energy. s process information into\nmore meaningful information such as adding a music track or sound\neffects to an audio tape.\n\nuse a computer system\nto connect to and access needed information from various Internet sites.\n\nuse computer hardware\nand software to draw and dimension prototypical designs.\n\nuse a computer as a\nmodeling tool.\n\nuse a computer system\nto monitor and control external events and\/or systems.\n\nThis is evident,\nfor example, when students: s use computer hardware and a\nbasic computer-aided design package to draw and dimension plans\nfor a simple project. s use a computer program,\nsuch as Car Builder, to model a vehicle to desired\nspecifications. s use temperature sensors to\nmonitor and control the temperature of a model greenhouse. s model a computer-controlled\nsystem, such as traffic lights, a merry-go-round, or a vehicle\nusing Lego or other modeling hardware interfaced to a computer.\n\ndescribe how\nsubsystems and system elements (inputs, processes, outputs) interact\nwithin systems.\n\ndescribe how system\ncontrol requires sensing information, processing it, and making changes.\n\nThis is evident,\nfor example, when students: s assemble an electronic kit\nthat includes sensors and signaling devices and functions as an\nalarm system. s use several open loop\nsystems (without feedback control) such as a spray can, bubble\ngum machine, or wind-up toys, and compare them to closed-loop\nsystems (with feedback control) such as an electric oven with a\nthermostat, or a line tracker robot. s use a systems diagram to\nmodel a technological system, such as a model rocket, with the\ncommand inputs, resource inputs, processes, monitoring and\ncontrol mechanisms, and system outputs labeled. s provide examples of modern\nmachines where microprocessors receive information from sensors\nand serve as controllers.\n\n5. Technology has\nbeen the driving force in the evolution of society from an\nagricultural to an industrial to an information base.\n\nStudents:\n\ndescribe how the\nevolution of technology led to the shift in society from an\nagricultural base to an industrial base to an information base.\n\nunderstand the\ncontributions of people of different genders, races, and ethnic groups\nto technological development.\n\ndescribe how new\ntechnologies have evolved as a result of combining existing\ntechnologies (e.g., photography combined optics and chemistry; the\nairplane combined kite and glider technology with a lightweight\ngasoline engine).\n\nThis is evident,\nfor example, when students: s construct models of\ntechnological devices (e.g., the plow, the printing press, the\ndigital computer) that have significantly affected human progress\nand that illustrate how the evolution of technology has shifted\nthe economic base of the country. s develop a display of\npictures or models of technological devices invented by people\nfrom various cultural backgrounds, along with photographs and\nshort biographies of the inventors. s make a poster with drawings\nand photographs showing how an existing technology is the result\nof combining various technologies.\n\n6. Technology can\nhave positive and negative impacts on individuals, society, and\nthe environment and humans have the capability and responsibility\nto constrain or promote technological development.\n\nStudents:\n\ndescribe how outputs\nof a technological system can be desired, undesired, expected, or\nunexpected.\n\ndescribe through\nexamples how modern technology reduces manufacturing and construction\ncosts and produces more uniform products.\n\nThis is evident,\nfor example, when students: s use the automobile, for\nexample, to explain desired (easier travel), undesired\n(pollution), expected (new jobs created), unexpected (crowded\nhighways and the growth of suburbs) impacts. s provide an example of an\nassembly line that produces products with interchangeable parts. s compare the costs involved\nin producing a prototype of a product to the per product cost of\na batch of 100.\n\n7. Project\nmanagement is essential to ensuring that technological endeavors\nare profitable and that products and systems are of high quality\nand built safely, on schedule, and within budget.\n\nStudents:\n\nmanage time and\nfinancial resources in a technological project.\n\nprovide examples of\nproducts that are well (and poorly) designed and made, describe their\npositive and negative attributes, and suggest measures that can be\nimplemented to monitor quality during production.\n\nassume leadership\nresponsibilities within a structured group activity.\n\nThis is evident,\nfor example, when students: s make up and follow a\nproject work plan, time schedule, budget, and a bill of\nmaterials. s analyze a child's toy\nand describe how it might have been better made at a lower cost. s assume leadership on a team\nto play an audio or video communication system, and use it for an\nintended purpose (e.g., to inform, educate, persuade, entertain).\n\n1. Engineering\ndesign is an iterative process involving modeling and\noptimization used to develop technological solutions to problems\nwithin given constraints.\n\nStudents engage in\nthe following steps in a design process:\n\ninitiate and carry\nout a thorough investigation of an unfamiliar situation and identify\nneeds and opportunities for technological invention or innovation.\n\nidentify, locate, and\nuse a wide range of information resources including subject experts,\nlibrary references, magazines, videotapes, films, electronic data bases\nand on-line services, and discuss and document through notes and\nsketches how findings relate to the problem.\n\ndevelop work\nschedules and plans which include optimal use and cost of materials,\nprocesses, time, and expertise; construct a model of the solution,\nincorporating developmental modifications while working to a high\ndegree of quality (craftsmanship).\n\nin a group setting,\ndevise a test of the solution relative to the design criteria and\nperform the test; record, portray, and logically evaluate performance\ntest results through quantitative, graphic, and verbal means; and use a\nvariety of creative verbal and graphic techniques effectively and\npersuasively to present conclusions, predict impacts and new problems,\nand suggest and pursue modifications.\n\nThis is evident,\nfor example, when students: s search the Internet for\nworld wide web sites dealing with renewable energy and\nsustainable living and research the development and design of an\nenergy efficient home. s develop plans, diagrams,\nand working drawings for the construction of a\ncomputer-controlled marble sorting system that simulates how\nparts on an assembly line are sorted by color. s design and model a portable\nemergency shelter for a homeless person that could be carried by\none person and be heated by the body heat of that person to a\nlife-sustaining temperature when the outside temperature is 20 o\nFtest, use, and\ndescribe the attributes of a range of material (including synthetic and\ncomposite materials), information, and energy resources.\n\nselect appropriate\ntools, instruments, and equipment and use them correctly to process\nmaterials, energy, and information.\n\nexplain tradeoffs\nmade in selecting alternative resources in terms of safety, cost,\nproperties, availability, ease of processing, and disposability.\n\ndescribe and model\nmethods (including computer-based methods) to control system processes\nand monitor system outputs.\n\nThis is evident,\nfor example, when students: s use a range of high- tech\ncomposite or synthetic materials to make a model of a product,\n(e.g., ski, an airplane, earthquake-resistant building) and\nexplain their choice of material. s design a procedure to test\nthe properties of synthetic and composite materials. s select appropriate tools,\nmaterials, and processes to manufacture a product (chosen on the\nbasis of market research) that appeals to high school students. s select the appropriate\ninstrument and use it to test voltage and continuity when\nrepairing a household appliance. s construct two forms of\npackaging (one from biodegradable materials, the other from any\nother materials), for a children's toy and explain the\ntradeoffs made when choosing one or the other. s describe and model a method\nto design and evaluate a system that dispenses candy and counts\nthe number dispensed using, for example, Fischertecnik, Capsela,\nor Lego. s describe how the flow,\nprocessing, and monitoring of materials is controlled in a\nmanufacturing plant and how information processing systems\nprovide inventory, tracking, and quality control data.\n\nattach a modem to a\ncomputer system and telephone line, set up and use communications\nsoftware, connect to various on-line networks, including the Internet,\nand access needed information using e-mail, telnet, gopher, ftp, and\nweb searches.\n\ndevelop an\nunderstanding of computer programming and attain some facility in\nwriting computer programs.\n\nThis is evident,\nfor example, when students: s choose a state-of-the art\ncomputer system from computer magazines, price the system, and\njustify the choice of CPU, CD-ROM and floppy drives, amount of\nRAM, video and sound cards, modem, printer, and monitor; explain\nthe cost-benefit tradeoffs they have made. s use a computer-aided\ndrawing and design package to design and draw a model of their\nown room. s write a computer program\nthat works in conjunction with a bar code reader and an optical\nsensor to distinguish between light and dark areas of the bar\ncode.\n\n4. Technological\nsystems are designed to achieve specific results and produce\noutputs, such as products, structures, services, energy, or other\nsystems.\n\nStudents:\n\nexplain why making\ntradeoffs among characteristics, such as safety, function, cost, ease\nof operation, quality of post-purchase support, and environmental\nimpact, is necessary when selecting systems for specific purposes.\n\nmodel, explain, and\nanalyze the performance of a feedback control system.\n\nexplain how complex\ntechnological systems involve the confluence of numerous other systems.\n\nThis is evident,\nfor example, when students: s model, explain, and analyze\nhow the float mechanism of a toilet tank senses water level,\ncompares the actual level to the desired level, and controls the\nflow of water into the tank. s draw a labeled system\ndiagram which explains the performance of a system, and include\nseveral subsystems and multiple feed-back loops. s explain how the space\nshuttle involves communication, transportation, biotechnical, and\nmanufacturing systems.\n\n5. Technology has\nbeen the driving force in the evolution of society from an\nagricultural to an industrial to an information base.\n\nStudents:\n\nexplain how\ntechnological inventions and innovations have caused global growth and\ninterdependence, stimulated economic competitiveness, created new jobs,\nand made other jobs obsolete.\n\nThis is evident,\nfor example, when students: s compare qualitatively and\nquantitatively the performance of a contemporary manufactured\nproduct, such as a household appliance, to the comparable device\nor system 50-100 years ago, and present results graphically,\norally, and in writing. s describe the process that\nan inventor must follow to obtain a patent for an invention. s explain through examples\nhow some inventions are not translated into products and services\nwith market place demand, and therefore do not become commercial\nsuccesses.\n\n6. Technology can\nhave positive and negative impacts on individuals, society, and\nthe environment and humans have the capability and responsibility\nto constrain or promote technological development.\n\nStudents:\n\nexplain that although\ntechnological effects are complex and difficult to predict accurately,\nhumans can control the development and implementation of technology.\n\nexplain how computers\nand automation have changed the nature of work.\n\nexplain how national\nsecurity is dependent upon both military and nonmilitary applications\nof technology.\n\nThis is evident,\nfor example, when students: s develop and implement a\ntechnological device that might be used to assist a disabled\nperson perform a task. s identify a technology which\nimpacts negatively on the environment and design and model a\ntechnological fix. s identify new or emerging\ntechnologies and use a futuring technique (e.g., futures wheel,\ncross impact matrix, Delphi survey) to predict what might be the\nsecond and third order impacts.\n\n7. Project\nmanagement is essential to ensuring that technological endeavors\nare profitable and that products and systems are of high quality\nand built safely, on schedule, and within budget.\n\nStudents:\n\ndevelop and use\ncomputer-based scheduling and project tracking tools, such as flow\ncharts and graphs.\n\nexplain how\nstatistical process control helps to assure high quality output.\n\ndiscuss the role\ntechnology has played in the operation of successful U.S. businesses\nand under what circumstances they are competitive with other countries.\n\nexplain how\ntechnological inventions and innovations stimulate economic\ncompetitiveness and how, in order for an innovation to lead to\ncommercial success, it must be translated into products and services\nwith marketplace demand.\n\ndescribe new\nmanagement techniques (e.g., computer-aided engineering,\ncomputer-integrated manufacturing, total quality management,\njust-in-time manufacturing), incorporate some of these in a\ntechnological endeavor, and explain how they have reduced the length of\ndesign-to- manufacture cycles, resulted in more flexible factories, and\nimproved quality and customer satisfaction.\n\nhelp to manage a\ngroup engaged in planning, designing, implementation, and evaluation of\na project to gain understanding of the management dynamics.\n\nThis is evident,\nfor example, when students: s design and carry out a plan\nto create a computer-based information system that could be used\nto help manage a manufacturing system (e.g., monitoring\ninventory, measurement of production rate, development of a\nsafety signal). s identify several successful\ncompanies and explain the reasons for their commercial success. s organize and implement an\ninnovative project, based on market research, that involves\ndesign, production, testing, marketing, and sales of a product or\na service."}
{"text":"Purpose:\n\nThe purpose of this lesson is to introduce the learners to the concept of Environmental Stewardship, community and how making an area beautiful is an act of philanthropy. Learners will look at the Monarch Butterfly and the four stages of its life cycle. They will also discover that it is dependent on the milkweed plant as a source of energy.\n\nDuration:\n\nOne Forty-Five Minute Class Period\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe learner will:\n\nunderstand the concept of stewardship of the land.\n\nunderstand that making an area more beautiful is an act of philanthropy.\n\nrecognize a milkweed plant as the source of energy for the Monarch caterpillar.\n\ndevelop an understanding of the four stages of the life cycle of the Monarch Butterfly.\n\ndraw and label the four stages of the life cycle of the Monarch Butterfly.\n\nInstructional Procedure(s):\n\nAnticipatory Set:\nAsk learners if they can think of anything they can do that would make their school, home, or community a more beautiful place. Write down the learners' ideas and save them. Then tell the learners you are going to read a story about a woman who made the world a more beautiful place.\n\nRead to the class the story, Miss Rumphius by Barbara Clooney.\n\nDiscuss the story. Ask the students why Miss Rumphius planted the flowers. Ask them if they think she is a philanthropist. (If students have not had lessons on philanthropy you will want to introduce this term. A philanthropist gives of his\/her time, talent, and\/or treasures for the common good.) Discuss how Miss Rumphius was working alone, but as a member of a community. What community job did she hold? How did she help people? When she traveled, did she become part of other communities?\n\nTell them that by working to make an area attractive an act of philanthropy is being demonstrated.\n\nExplain that flowers not only make the world attractive, but the flowers also serve as an energy source for insects.\n\nShow the students a milkweed plant with a caterpillar(s) (larvae) on it. (See Materials list for how to obtain these.) Note: Milkweed comes in several varieties depending on where you live. The type shown in the book is grown in the Mid-West and Eastern United States. Some varieties can be toxic especially the milky sap from the stems. Those learners handling the plant should wash their hands afterward. Naturalists observed in the early 1800 that birds avoided eating monarch butterflies. Milkweed contains a toxin that made the birds sick so the birds learned to avoid eating them. It is best to have enough plants and larvae for the learners to work in small groups for closer examination of the plants. Ask learners what they think they will be studying. Allow time for responses and them share that they will be studying the life cycle of the Monarch butterfly.\n\nGive each child a magnifying glass to use to look more closely at the milkweed plant and the larvae (caterpillar).\n\nRead aloud: Monarch Butterfly by Gail Gibbons. While you are reading, stop to discuss each of the four stages of the life cycle. Point out the color of the larvae, the adult butterfly and the milkweed."}

{"text":"Understanding Relative Sizes in Worlds We Don't See\n\nLesson Plan Overview \/ DetailsActivities in this Lesson\n\nJust to get students looking at and considering elements of a world that went unknown and unidentified until Robert Hooke's examination of a slice of cork, I ask students to watch the following two videos and simply record in their notes, what they believe they are observing in general detail.\n\nI like to begin with the Harvard BioVision video entitled Inner Life- Minute Music Version and then if time permits, show the Inner Life -Super Speed Version towards the end of the lesson to give students a bearing point for what they are observing. (At the end of the lesson, they will have some further context for the video as well...won't seem so \"alien\")\n\nThe second video you might show as a beginning point either with the above selection or on its own is one of the classic Zoom from Atom to Universe type videos. You can find many of these online, but this one actually annotates the items being observed in much the same fashion as our following activities within this lesson. You pick what works best for you and your students!\n\nHarvard BioVisions Collection\n[\nGo to Site\n]\nVery well produced cellular level video animations. Some narrated, some set to music.\n\nAtom to Universe Progression\n[\nWatch Video\n]\n[\nDownload Original Video\n]\nthis is a video that shows relative sizes of objects from microscopic proportions to galactic structures.\n\nZoom from Small to Large\n[\nGo to Site\n]\nsame video as above, but linked to youtube with identifiers for each item.\n\nFollowing the opening video segments, provide each student a set of cards (see attached for printing out in advance). Ask them to put the cards in order by size as best they can. I like to give them about 5 miutes to skim through them and begin to lay them out in order as best they can across their own desks. I instruct students that it is important that they at least attempt to place them in order now, and that we can modify their orders as we proceed through the lesson today. Here is a list of the items that are present on their cards which is a printed resource from the University of Utah's Genetic Science Learning Center Collection.\n\nMany of the items on the cards should be somewhat familiar to the students. However, most students will not remember every term. Use the attached powerpoint presentation to review and answer any questions.\n\nOther interesting things to include in your lecture...\n\nCompare Small Objects to Larger Objects\n\nIf a carbon atom = 7 pixels, then\n\nAntibody = 1 inch\n\nInfluenza virus = 8.5 inch x 11 inch piece of paper\n\nMitochondrion = 8 foot x 30 foot (classroom wall)\n\nSkin Cell = a 25-floor building\n\nExplian How We Can See Small Objects\n\nThe smallest objects that the unaided HUMAN EYESmaller cells are easily visible under a LIGHT MICROSCOPE. It's even possible to make out structures within the cell, such as the nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Light microscopes use a system of lenses to magnify an image. The power of a light microscope is limited by the wavelength of visible light, which is about 500 nm (nanometers). The most powerful light microscopes can resolve bacteria but not viruses.\n\nGoing Nano! To see anything smaller than 500 nm, you will need an ELECTRON MICROSCOPE. Electron microscopes shoot a high-voltage beam of electrons onto or through an object, which deflects and absorbs some of the electrons. Resolution is still limited by the wavelength of the electron beam, but this wavelength is much smaller than that of visible light. The most powerful electron microscopes can resolve molecules and even individual atoms. To better understand Nano Scale, watch the video linked below and answer the questions at the end.\n\nVocabulary Review\n[\nDownload\n]\nSimple presentation of the terms used within this topical study\n\nWhat is Nano? - Video\n[\nGo to Site\n]\nA simple explanation of Nano Scale as a concept via a short animated video with questions to guide students thinking and assess their comprehension at the end.\n\nHave students go to the following website:  (linked below).\n\nThose students who have yet to fully organize their cards in progressive order of size of elements found on a visual to cellular to molecular level, can zoom through the images, from a coffee bean to a carbon atom and everything in between in relation to the items found in their deck.\n\nThis is in turn a great visualization tool to help them appreciate relative sizes. Ask them to use the website to finish putting their cards in order correctly (if they have not done so already!) If students do not have access to their own laptops or computers, you can simply demonstrate the zoom in and out feature for them as projected on a screen. I suggest you consider starting with the image zoomed all the way down to the Carbon Atom and zooming out to the begin point with the Coffee Bean.\n\nInteractive Cell Size and Scale\n[\nGo to Site\n]\nA nice Flash-based presentation of the relativity of various sizes of very small objects: from coffee beans, grains of salt and rice, down to HIV, antibodies, water molecules, carbon atoms and elements of a cell.\n\nProvide tape or glue and ask students to attach their cards in order to their notebooks. Have them write a short paragraph about what they were surprised to learn about relative sizes. When they are finished, they are to come to you so that you may check their notebooks.\n\nAs an extension activity or a pre-learning exploration, direct students to the Amazing Cells site and go through the \"inside a cell\" activity as a precursor to the information they will be encountering in upcoming lessons on Cell organelles and structures and their functions.\n\nAmazing Cells\n[\nGo to Site\n]\nExplore the cell's interior, parts of the cell, and how cells communicate through this interactive view into an animal cell\n\nAssessment\n\nAssessment Types:\n\nJournals,\n\nCheck their notebook for the correct order of the cards and completion of the paragraph about what they learned. Stamp or check off thier notebook and record their credit, dont forget to include any extra credit for those students who were able to correctly identify the size sequence in the first or second activity if you deem it more than a \"lucky guess.\"\n\nAs a nice extension assessment, you could have students take into account the relational comparison between a skin cell and an influenza virus shared at the beginning of this lesson (25 story building to and 11 inch piece of paper respectively) and the other comparisons provided in this lesson plan. Have them formulate the difference in scale amongst these two items and then have them create a simliar scale comparison using common visible objects when the smaller of the two objects is 2 inches or less. For instance, a paperclip or an eraser head or a grain of rice instead of a sheet of paper. It is interesting to see the comparative objects students will generate, and you can also assess their overall understanding of relative sizes as well as proportional reasoning. For advanced students have them create compartive elements for other items from their cards such as the carbon atom and a red blood cell...\n\nConnecting Career Technical Education Programs & Professionals\n\nCTE Online is your single destination for model curriculum, resources, tools and community."}
{"text":"These first graders at Newsome Park Elementary dig worms, and they've designed an entire project around them with the help of their teacher, Cathy Huemer.\n\nOh, there's one.\n\nCathy: You wanna pick it up, Cameron?\n\nWhen they wanted to do animals, they had idea. \"Let's do snakes, let's do you know, horses, let's do dogs, you know.\" And so I keep raising question to them, \"Well, why? What is it that you wanna know?\" Well, they wanna know about, \"Well, where do these animals live?\" So I said to them, \"Are we really gonna be able to go look for snakes, you know? That might not be possible. Can you think of something else that might be similar?\" And someone just said, \"Let's do worms.\" Said, \"Okay, we what do we know about worms? What do we need to find out about worms?\" Phase one, which leads us into phase two, which is the field work, the actual work that they're doing, whether it's field trips, lab work, experiments.\n\nStudent: We did a experiment on dead worms. We smelled 'em and they didn't smell good.

They then plan a research phase which includes field trips to gather information.\n\nStudent: Transportation, four facts.\n\nNarrator: At the conclusion of the project, they share their findings in oral presentations, digital slideshows, and display boards which are viewed and critiqued by their parents and their peers.\n\nPeter: Project based learning was really the delivery model that we felt would allow kids to learn, and really learn about what they wanna learn about. I mean, so many years, we've been pumping kids full of stuff that we think is appropriate, and really, in many instances, maybe that was successful, but it's much more successful and exhilarating when kids have the input that we allow them to have here at Newsome Park.\n\nHow do you spell \"minerals?\"\n\nNarrator: Students here have chosen to study everything from space flight to homelessness. This first grade class decided to explore cystic fibrosis, a disease affecting one of their classmates.\n\nOne of our students has CF and we're trying to learn about CF to see what it is, how it works. Mucus starts getting into the person's lungs and pancreas. And we hope to find out that there's a cure for CF.\n\nNarrator: Students use programs like PowerPoint and a series of thinking maps to turn good project concepts into exemplary work products.\n\nPeter: The students of today are really more in tune with everything that they have coming in at them visually, so using the technology to represent their learning has actually increased the quality of their work.\n\nNarrator: Even with the latest technology tools, project based learning can be challenging for teachers.\n\nPatty: -- for us, and so we came up with some questions for Miss Harbuck and she's coming in today to tell us more, isn't she?\n\nYep.\n\nOh good, okay.\n\nPatty: It's easier to teach out of a textbook, where this day it tells me to do this, and this day it tells me to do that. So in a way, you've gotta be willing to work a little harder too to do it this way. Even though it looks like the kids are doing all the hard work, there's a lotta planning that goes on behind it to make sure that the work is there for them.\n\nDo we have anybody in this classroom with asthma?\n\nAll: Yes.\n\nPatty: Yes, we do. And--\n\nNarrator: Since several of Miss Vreeland's students have asthma, they're studying pets, focusing on pets that don't make asthma worse. As part of every research project, students seek out experts, like a guest speaker from the local hospital..\n\nTeacher: Your lungs are made up of different kinds of tissue.\n\nPatty: They know that they don't have all the answers, and it's okay. They also know that Miss V doesn't have all the answers, and it doesn't bother her a bit. And so we sit back and we go, \"Okay, well who can we call, who can we ask?\"\n\nThank you, thank you.\n\nNarrator: At lunchtime, students get to test their social skills and basic math, selling everything from Walkathon pledges to marigolds.\n\nStudent: We have marigolds, we have two of these left, and mixed flowers. Those just all type of flowers, like this flower, this whole patch, it'll probably be like that when they grow.\n\nNarrator: The plant business grew out of a class investigation into the stock market.\n\nRobert: We talked about what the stock market was. We actually invested in fancy stocks. We were thinking about investing in some penny stocks and seeing how much money we could make on the stock exchange. However, that became repetitive and truthfully, somewhat boring.\n\nWhat you wanna buy?\n\nNarrator: Instead, the class decided to create their own business. They bought seeds, grew the plants and made sales brochures, funding the entire operation through the sale of flower power stock.\n\nRobert: We ended up going around, we sold ten cent shares of our stock in our company and we actually raised over seventy-five dollars.\n\nNarrator: But the success of the fourth grade plant projects sowed the seeds of another lesson in real life learning. It led to the mounting of a hostile takeover attempt by Miss Shields' fifth graders.\n\nStudent: Miss Shields' classes, the fifth grade, is planning to take and buy all the stock and leave them for like five percent of their stock and take over their business. So we'll be in total control of their business.\n\nNarrator: The process of learning project based lessons has had a positive impact on everything from test scores to classroom behavior.\n\nPeter: Our test scores have improved, mainly I think because of the fact that we've connected the learning to real world problems, and the integration of technology has helped the students to actually product quality products. So that's the reward, and to me, it's been probably the most rewarding way of teaching and learning that I've experienced in my thirty years.\n\nIt's a red wiggler.\n\nNarrator: For more information on what works in public education, go to Edutopia.org\n\nComments (6)\n\nI think that implicit in your question is a separation between the core skill students need to succeed and the project based learning approach. The challenging approach is to integrate the two - to figure out how each day you are instructing students in the skill they need, but not doing so in a way in which this is separated from the totality of the project. You must integrate each lesson as a part of a larger whole, so that you don't understand what you are teaching and what you're expecting student to learn as something separate from the project, but as the necessary steps to completing it.\n\nI have experienced the incredible experience of a project-based learning project, but I am still unsure of how the entire school semester is geared around it.How much of the day (or week or whatever) is given to the project and how much is still core curriculum material?Basic core instruction still has to be taught (spelling, basic math facts, etc.)but how much time is given to each component? Please tell me how it works with your classroom.Thank you\n\nCheck to see if you have access to the Intel Essentials Training program. Intel Essentials is a multi day training that results in a complete Unit that focuses on Project Based Learning. It is a great deal of work but the end result is something you can use.\n\nThis is the first time that I have seen project-based learning in full effect. I'm very interested in doing this with my own first graders. I would love to also get more training on this. If any one reads this post and know of any conferences that are offering training on the topic. I would love to know about it.\n\nProject-based learning is a great way to get studetns involved in what they are learning. Often times, if the lesson is not interesting, the students will not be actively involved. In the world we live in today, teachers must compete with the media to keep students interested. By taking trips and doing projects, students learn more and retain more of the information presented to them.\n\nsee moresee less"}

Two obvious features are buildings and walls. These objects modify their adjacent microclimates by absorbing solar energy, radiating heat, and providing shade. Buildings and walls can be used to actively manipulate the microenvironment to benefit agriculture.

Emissions of SO2 occur naturally through plant decomposition and volcanic eruptions. However, since the industrial revolution, humans have contributed greatly to an increase in the rate of these emissions. Emissions from power plants which burn coal to produce electricity, along with oil refining processes and ships which burn bunker fuel, are the main sources of SO2 emissions produced by man. These emissions are regulated through the Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990 (CAAA) by the Environmental Protection Agency. This project is a STELLA\u00ae Model based on the work of Madalinski, Nichols and Martens (Global Effect of Natural and Anthropogenic Sulfur Dioxide Emissions).\n\nby Martha Mersereau, Florence Duarte, Anna Zareba-Kowalska.\nIt is generally agreed that deforestation initiates local changes, but there are varying opinions as to the likely effect of deforestation on the global hydrological cycle and global climatic change. Deforestation on a global scale since 1890 has greatly contributed to the total release of carbon. Carbon dioxide is one of the most important greenhouse gases and is responsible for about 60 percent of the enhanced greenhouse warming. Its atmospheric concentration has increased tremendously since the industrial revolution. However, at present carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere seems to be increasing primarily due to increased use of fossil fuels. The purpose of this project was to examine the effects of human activities such as deforestation and increased fossil fuel burning in the United States on the carbon cycle in the U.S. using STELLA\u00ae modeling.\n\nby Monica Shah, Belinda Poindexter, Edgar Ticzon.\nThe increasing level of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is of concern because of its association with global warming. This excess CO2 is being rapidly released into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas. As fossil fuels remain the predominant source to meet present energy demands the level of carbon dioxide is expected to increase along with its accompanying problems. One attempt to alleviate the situation has been reforestation in various regions of the world, to compensate for the effects of fossil fuel-using industrial and power plants. In this project a simple model was created, using the STELLA\u00ae system, relating rate of carbon dioxide emission from burning fossil fuel to rate of carbon dioxide fixation by trees. The model is expected to provide an estimate of extent of forestation needed to compensate for specific levels of carbon dioxide emission. A student experiment is included which will allow students to study carbon dioxide utilization by bean seedlings.\n\nby Percival Barretto Ko, Carol Guogas, Janet O'Leary.\nThe problem studied in this project is: If human use of Chlorofluorocarbons is reduced to zero, how long will it take for ozone destruction to cease?

The instructional unit described in this account was designed during an NSF\ninstitute for science educators. It is a model unit for chemistry education incorporating\nthe Virtual Molecular Dynamics Laboratory. It includes a brief introduction to the\nobjectives for learning, the relevance of these objectives to the standard curriculum, and\nan outline of instructional activities and assessment techniques.\nIntroduction\nThis unit is designed to accompany a chapter on states of matter and phase\ntransitions. The activities outlined explore the molecular nature of the three principal\nstates of matter (solid, liquid, and gas) and the transitions between them. The energy and\ntemperatures associated with the states of matter and the transitions between them are\nalso explored. Kinetic Molecular Theory is used to describe the behavior of particles.\nHands-on activities combined with computer simulations provide a unique look at both\nthe macroscopic and the molecular basis of phase transitions.\nA primary focus of this unit is the incorporation of the Virtual Molecular\nDynamics Laboratory into the traditional approach to teaching the states of matter. This\nprovides a distinct advantage in that it allows students to visualize molecular motion and\nmolecular interactions. When incorporated appropriately into the curriculum, this\ncomputer simulation can help students understand the macroscopic properties they\nobserve.\nIntended Audience \/ Adjustment\nThe materials that follow were developed for honors level students. They are\neasily adapted for a standard level classroom by focusing on the qualitative content rather\nthan quantitative content. Advanced placement students might be expected to perform\nthe more challenging calculations included in the experiments. The varying activities and\nassessment techniques are designed to encompass a broad range of learning styles.\n1\nBurlington High School; Burlington, MA; longstaff@burlington.mec.edu\n2\nActon-Boxborough High School; Acton, MA; carol_murphree@mail.ab.mec.edu\n3\nActon-Boxborough High School; Acton, MA; stacie_williams@mail.ab.mec.edu\nPlacement in the Curriculum\nThis instructional unit addresses the following categories within the Grade 10 or 11\nChemistry Massachusetts Science and Technology\/Engineering Framework.4 The\nmaterial is revisited in units on gas laws and solutions.\n1.1 Identify and explain some of the physical properties that are used to\nclassify matter. e.g. \u2026 melting point, and boiling point\n1.2 Describe the four states of matter (solid, liquid, gas, plasma) in terms of\nenergy, particle motion, and phase transitions.\n10.3 Analyze the energy changes in physical and chemical processes using\ncalorimetry.\nGoals and Objectives\nThe objectives of this unit are as follows:\n1. State and describe the three states of matter.\n2. Using kinetic molecular theory (KMT), explain the similarities and differences\nbetween each phase.\n3. Using KMT, describe what happens within each phase and the transitions between\nphases.\n4. Define heat and describe how it is measured.\n5. Draw the heating curve of a given substance by plotting temperature as a function\nof time.\n6. From an energy point of view, explain the heating curve.\n7. Explain how heat is involved in phase transitions.\n8. Define heat capacity, specific heat, heat of fusion, and heat of vaporization.\n9. Experimentally determine the values for heat capacity, specific heat, heat of fusion,\nand heat of vaporization of a given substance.\n10. Given the values for heat capacity, specific heat, heat of fusion, and heat of\nvaporization, calculate the amount of heat involved in a specific phase transition.\nTime \/ Resources\nIt is envisioned that this unit will require twelve teaching days. Classroom\nactivities are designed for approximately 40-minute sessions. Time required for\npreparation and clean-up is minimal. Each activity specifies the amount of time required.\nMaterials for the hands-on activities are common to high school chemistry laboratories\nand are listed within each experiment. Ideally, students should perform computer\nsimulations in groups of two to four. However, if this is not possible, the simulations can\nbe run as demonstrations, provided the screen is large enough for students to clearly see\nthe display.\n4\nMassachusetts Department of Education, May 2001\nInstructional Activities5\nDay 1 Introduction to the states of matter and phase transitions.\nTeacher-guided worksheet: \"States of Matter and Phase Transitions.\"\nRelevant reading assignment and selected homework problems.\nDay 2 Simple assessment to determine prior knowledge any prior misconceptions\nIntroduction to \/ Review of Kinetic Molecular Theory (KMT).\nSimulab: \"Explore the Common States of Matter.\"\nProvide rubric for unit project.\nDay 3 SMD Demo: \"Boiling.\"\nLab: \"Boiling Point.\"\nCompare simulation with laboratory results.\nTeacher-assigned teams will collaborate to interpret data.\nHomework: laboratory data manipulation and analysis.\nDay 4 Teacher-directed discussion of heat and temperature.\nDemo\/Minilab: \"Heat and the Calorie.\"\nDemo\/Minilab: \"How Much Energy in a Nut.\"\nDay 5 Lab: Melting Point Determination.\nDay 6 Construction and discussion of the heating curve.\nIntroduction to heat capacity, heat of vaporization, and heat of fusion.\nDay 7 Assessment for heating curve.\nLab: \"The Heat of Fusion of Ice.\"\nDay 8\/9 Introduction to Specific Heat.\nLab: Specific Heat of Liquids.\nLab: Specific Heat of Solids.\nDay 10 Teacher-modeled laboratory calculations.\nSimulab: Heating curve.\nDraw connections between previous experiments and the final heating curve.\nDay 11 Review calculations.\nProvide clarification of unit project.\nMake connections between all activities by generating a graphic organizer\nwith the class.\nDay 12 Unit Exam.\nCollect unit project.\n5\nFor detailed student activities and assessments, refer to the appendices.\nAssessment\nThe following is an outline of the tools for assessment used in this unit:\n\uf0b7 Throughout the unit, reading assignments and problem sets will provide embedded\nassessment of student progress.\n\uf0b7 An early simple assessment will be directed at the student's prior knowledge of the\ntopic and gauge comprehension of the new material.\n\uf0b7 Halfway through the unit, another simple assessment will gauge the student's\nprogress within the unit and mastery of the material.\n\uf0b7 Several hands-on activities will engage the students.

(Consider your graph when answering this question.)\nWRITE A CONCLUSION\nLAB: HEAT AND THE CALORIE\nINTRODUCTION\nWhen heat is absorbed by liquid water, the temperature of water rises. The amount of heat\nnecessary to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Centigrade is reasonably\nconstant between 8oC and 80oC. Consequently, it provides a simple and reproducible basis for a\ndefinition of a standard amount of heat, the calorie. The CALORIE is the amount of heat to raise\nthe temperature of one gram of water one degree centigrade. Conversely, one calorie is released\nas one gram of water is cooled one degree centigrade. (1 cal= 4.184 J)\nThe purpose of this lab is to use this knowledge of the calorie to determine the heat of\ncombustion per gram of candle wax. You will weigh a candle before you burn it. You will allow\nwater to capture the heat from the burning candle. You will then weigh the candle at the end of\nthe experiment. Calculate the amount of heat gained by the water and divide by the amount of\ncandle wax that was burned to obtain the calories per gram of wax.\nMATERIALS\n1 short candle and a small piece of foil or cardboard\n1 small coffee can with holes punched to allow a glass rod through\n1 large can with top and bottom removed\n1 glass rod\n1 thermometer\nPROCEDURE\n1.

The products we sell were primarily developed through National Science Foundation support; to disseminate the products to a larger audience requires selling them so that we can make more. It is for this reason that we chose to start a company. We have many more ideas for products and hope to expand our product list in the future as our company grows. Meanwhile, Dr. Tamarkin continues to teach at a community college and test out her ideas on her own classes.\n\nCell Zone\u00ae, LLC was\nformed with a mission to make Universal Design for Learning (UDL) biology products\navailable to more classrooms so that more students can learn about\nbiology. All of our products have been classroom tested and work with a\nvery wide range of students-- from 5th graders or middle schoolers\nthrough college science majors. Because our products reach students with diverse learning styles regardless of ability\/disability, they are ideal for any classroom. In addition, students get to interact and participate in a student-centered approach when they use Cell Zone products, so they have more fun learning about biology.\n\nIt was our decision to form a company and sell directly to schools in order to keep the pricing of our products as low as possible. For example, one kit of our Dynamic Cell Models enable a class to model at least two unique eukaryotic cells at a time; meanwhile, a standard, quality, static model of a single eukaryotic cell typically costs more than our entire kit. With the Dynamic Cell Models, though, the students can continually change the cells that they are creating for endless variety and applicability. So although $399 may seem like a significant sum of money for many schools, this is relatively inexpensive for models. It is important to keep in mind that because the development of the Dynamic Cell Models was funded by the National Science Foundation, the costs of initial development and production did not have to get added into the cost to the teacher. We also received help from colleagues in creating our CAD designs, so that cost does not have to get passed to the teachers, either.\n\nAt\nCell Zone\u00ae, LLC, our goal is for science to be accessible to all students, not just the \"science-types.\" As well, students should be learning and experiencing science rather than just memorizing information. It is for this reason that we incorporate a UDL approach in all of our products."}

Is this plant population of concern for the entire world?\n\nChoose an area of the world for a road trip and describe the biomes that you would encounter during your trip. For example, you might start a road trip in Washington, D.C., and travel west to California and then up the Pacific coast to Alaska. How could you distinguish one biome from another? What characteristics set each biome apart?\n\nPlace students in groups of three for the duration of the project. Have them create and sign a contract for working successfully and receiving a satisfactory DAILY group participation grade. (Please see Group Work Rubic. ) Teacher can print out and staple multiple copies and have students tear off one rubric per class.\n\nPart Two (2 class periods):\n\nActivity 1\n\nStudents will generate research on a biome that the teacher provides. It is best for teachers to pick from the following (these biomes are easiest to recreate in the classroom without extra materials):\n\nGrassland\n\nWetland\n\nCoastal desert\n\nHot desert\n\nSavanna\n\nTropicalForest\n\nTemperate Forest\n\nEstuary\n\nTaiga\n\nAlpine or Arctic Tundra\n\nNote: These biomes may be easily maintained depending on the natural climate in your region and time of year.\n\nStudents will be gathering all the information they need to recreate their biome. This is including, but not limited to: flora, fauna, topography, elevation, climate, and human influence. Designate one student at least two topics for research. Student research may be done in a variety of formats to suit the school and student resources, as well as time permitting for the teacher (computer carts, library, internet articles printed off and brought in, website suggestions below). After they have researched their environment, they will write up a one paragraph summary on each subject totaling AT LEAST 6 paragraphs (more if there are more group members).\n\nStudents will use the information from their research to create a materials list to build their biome. Pose questions (some found in materials list) to guide their materials list. Also consider what precautions will students set up for species? Sometimes, species will get sick, die, or escape. Have students explain how they would prevent\/handle each of these situations in the most humane way possible. Show students examples of ways to construct biomes with photos. (I have some pictures from my class last year uploaded as well as other classroom biomes.) Have them explain what specific materials are feasible, affordable, and successful for their environment.\n\nActivity 3\n\nPrint out or project the teacher anonymous blog, explaining how to make one particular type of biome to house an ecosystem at  Student groups will discuss how to make it differently depending on their biome. Then, draw up a blueprint of what their biome will look like on graph paper. Detail is important here. Have students write captions that explain how the blueprint will sustain the population. Be sure students do this before materials are purchased! A neighboring group will then critique draft of biome. Have students check to make sure that materials and construction make sense for their biome. Students critiquing work will give positive feedback, as well as one comment for improvement of the blueprint.\n\nNote: Teachers will collect blueprints and materials list, OK the blueprints and create a shopping list for the following class period.\n\nProcedure:\n\nPROJECT (5+ class periods)\n\nNote: It is preferable to start your project near the end of the week to give students biomes time to establish themselves over the weekend.\n\nTeacher will set out materials for students to create their biome that has been approved by the teacher and their peers. Students will take the materials that they asked for and begin constructing the ecosystem shell. (Reference the teacher anonymous blog.) After construction is complete, add soil, water, and aquatic plants and\/or seeds to the ecosystem. WAIT UNTIL ECOSYSTEM IS ESTABLISHED\/GROWING TO ADD LIVE SPECIMENS. This should take at least 5-7 days. Discuss with students about the necessity of this. (If they are added too soon, they will die without oxygen or food.) For examples of what the final product might look like, please see these photos:\n\nReflect and discuss the different designs in the room. How are they suited for each biome? Discuss the location of each biome for the duration of the project. Did the construction of the biomes match the blueprints made by each group? Did you have to make some changes? Why or why not?\n\nJournaling your observations: Students will create a field journal to document the progress of their biome. Provide each student with several sheets of construction paper and colored construction paper. Fold the construction and graph paper in half, hole punch on either side and secure with string. Alternatively, staple the crease where the paper was folded. Each day they have class, each student will be taking detailed notes on their biome by answering questions to the following prompts:\n\nDate:\n\nTime:\n\nLocation (windowsill, chair, bookshelf, fridge, outdoors):\n\nOutdoor weather conditions:\n\nNumber of producers\n\nNumber of consumers:\n\nNumber of decomposers:\n\nNumber Draw and describe any changes your biome\n\n(First entry only) Describe the types of abiotic factors inside biome. What purpose do they serve?\n\n(First entry only) What questions do you have about your biome? What you do predict will happen? Make a hypothesis stating the survival rate of each factor in your biome.\n\n(Subsequent entries) Reflect on your previous entries. Why do you think these changes occurred? If there is no change, why not? What symbiotic relationships do you witness? If not, look at another group that has these relationships. What makes their biome successful? Should you interfere with your ecosystem? What are the implications of this?\n\nAssessments and Rubrics\n\nPOST PROJECT\n\nPart Four (2 class periods)\n\nStudent group members will combine observations from the project (a self-sustaining ecosystem should take about two weeks to stabilize) and present their findings to the rest of the class.\n\nThey will take students through the design process and discuss what they learned, errors, and ways to improve the project. One way to set up the presentation is as follows:\n\nHave students compare notes from AT LEAST five days of observations.\n\nWrite key points from the checklist on notecards, bring up biome and present information.\n\nHave each student present two checklist points for credit.\n\nChecklist:\n\nDid you answer the questions you originally ask about your biome? Explain.\n\nReflect on the amount of wildlife in the biome from one observation to the next. Does the ecosystem function on its own? Why or why not?\n\nWhat did you learn about the role of producers, consumers, and decomposers in your biome?\n\nWhy are both biotic and abotic factors important for an ecosystem to be successful?\n\nDid you disturb your biome in any way? For what reason? How does this simulate human impacts in our own ecosystem?\n\nStandard 6.1a: Energy flows through ecosystems in one direction, typically from the Sun, through photosynthetic organisms including green plants and algae, to herbivores to carnivores and decomposers.\n\nStandard 6.3b: Through ecological succession, all ecosystems progress though a sequence of changes during which one ecological community modifies the environment, making it more suitable for another community. These long-term gradual changes result in the community reaching a point of stability that can last for hundreds or thousands of years.\n\nObjective 2:\n\nStandard 6.1d: The number of organisms any habitat can support (carrying capacity) is limited by the available energy, water, oxygen, and minerals, and by the ability of ecosystems to recycle the residue of dead organisms through the activities of bacteria and fungi.\n\nStandard 6.1e: In any particular environment, the growth and survival of organisms depend on the physical conditions including light intensity, temperature range, mineral availability, soil\/rock type, and relative acidity (pH).\n\nStandard 7.1a: The Earth had finite resources; increasing human consumption of resources paces stress on the natural processes that renew some resources and deplete those resources that cannot be renewed.\n\nObjective 3:\n\nStandard 6.3c: A stable ecosystem can be altered, either rapidly or slowly, through the activities of organisms (including humans), or through climatic changes or natural disasters.The altered ecosystem can usually recover through gradual changes back to a point of long-term stability.\n\nObjective 4:\n\nStandard 7.1c: Human beings are part of the Earth's ecosystem. Human activities can, deliberately or inadvertently, alter the equilibrium in ecosystems. Humans modify ecosystems as a result of population growth, consumption, and technology. Human destruction of habitats through direct harvesting, pollution, atmospheric changes, and other factors are threatening current global stability, and if not addressed, ecosystems may be irreversibly affected.\n\nStandard 7.2b: When humans alter ecosystems wither by adding or removing specific organisms, serious consequences may result. For example, planting large expanses of one crop reduces the biodiversity of the area.\n\nI really like this lesson and\n\nI really like this lesson and you have provided a great deal of detail! It looks like a project you can set up and run for several weeks. It would be interesting to see how long the students could keep them going. Thank you!"}

{"text":"I have never seen a Christian Science curriculum that truly merges\nscience and a Christian worldview like Truth in Science. Based\non the work of Dr. Henry Morris and his sixteen tenets of Biblical\nand Scientific Creation, the creators of this curriculum have done\na beautiful job of teaching how your view of the world will color\nyour interpretations of science\n\nI received the grade four complete package to review which includes:\none Teacher's Edition, eleven Students Steps, Test and Quizzes\npacket, Answer Key, and a Multimedia\/Support DVD, which cost $98.80.\n\nLet's start with the Teacher's Edition which is enormous and the\nwealth of information is amazing! The first few pages explain the\nphilosophy of the curriculum, and present the sixteen tenets.\nThere is a scope and sequence, and a Quick Teaching Schedule that\ncan help you plan your lessons depending on how many lessons per\nweek you want to accomplish. Each chapter in the TE correlates\nto one of the Student Steps. For example chapter one in the TE\nwould be Step 1 in the Student Steps. The first couple of\npages in each chapter include planning guides that lists vocabulary\nfor each lesson, teacher illustrations that will be needed, required\nmaterials and any addition student resources. There are\nten lessons per chapter. The first page has a lesson organizer\nwhich lists all of the lessons and their topics (highlighting the\ntopic being cover in that lesson). Objectives, activities\nand materials needed are also included on the first page. In the\nmargins of the Teacher's Edition is Teacher's Commentary that usually\ngives some background information. On the bottom of each\npage includes some additional information that fall under one of\nthe following categories: Evolution Says, Interesting Facts, Notable\nQuotes and Faith or Fact. The pages from the student steps\nare included in the teacher's guide along with Teach and Apply\nthat includes guided inquiries, and questions to ask.\n\nEach of the Student Steps covers a different topic. The\nfirst is Worldview which lays a great foundation for how this curriculum\nincorporates the sixteen tenets, and worldview with science. The\nnext ten steps cover science topics which are as follows: Classification,\nPlants, Animals & Humans, Ecology, Meteorology, Geology, Earth's\nResources, Astronomy, Matter, and Forces & Energy. The\nStudent Steps can be used independently of the Teacher's Edition.\nIf your student is an independent learner they will be able to\ndo them without much teacher direction. There are eight\nlessons in each step. The first lesson lists the objectives\nfor the topic, vocabulary, a memory verse, and a K-W-L chart. A\nReport-to-You-Project is also assigned that is due in the last\nlesson of each step. There\nare two labs for each Step most of which require household items.\nOccasionally you will need something that will require purchase\nsuch as silkworm eggs. A worldview quiz is given for each\nstep as well as a chapter test. The answers for these and\nanswers for the Student Steps are proved in the Answer Key.\n\nThe Multimedia\/Support DVD gives a great introduction and overview\nof the curriculum. It also includes vocabulary lessons for\neach Step and PDF files that includes the teacher's illustrations.\n\nDue to the realization of standardized test the curriculum does\ninclude sections that align with the standards. Sometime\nthe standards are in direct conflict with what is being taught\nand this is discussed. One major conflict being evolution,\nTruth in Science does a marvelous job at teaching the flaws in\nthe evolution theory, and that it is just that, a theory.\n\nTruth in Science is an amazing curriculum that not only does a\nfantastic job at teaching science but also teaching the Truth and\nhow the two work together to the glorify God."}

{"text":"8: Photosynthesis & Respiration\n\nObjectives\n\nStudents will know the relationship between plants and animals in an aquatic ecosystem and be able to predict the effects of low dissolved oxygen on the organisms.\n\nLesson Overview\n\n1. Students create microcosms with plants, animals, or both 2. Students use observation skills to determine which microcosm was more successful (define this before starting) 3. Review photosynthesis and respiration 4. Students answer review questions 5. Students extend their knowledge using Hudson River data\n\nTime:\n\nTwo 45-minute lessons\n\nSetting:\n\nClassroom\n\nMaterials\n\nfour one-quart jars with lid\n\naged tap water\n\nseveral pieces of Elodea\n\n4 aquarium thermometers\n\nseveral aquarium guppies and\/or water snails\n\ncopies of worksheet\n\nProcedure\n\nEngage: Ask students what happens to them when they hold their breath. This should create a decent amount of discussion. Connect this to the predicament a fish or other aquatic organism would face if they didn't have any dissolved oxygen in the water.\n\nExplore: Set up the four jars for each group. Aged tap water should go in each jar, along with an aquarium thermometer. Allow students to decide what they would put in each of the three jars, based on the materials available; this can be done in pairs or in groups. One jar should be the control, one jar should have only plants, one should have only animals, and one should have both plants and animals. Students should write their predictions in their lab notebooks about what responses they think they will observe. The jars should be closed tightly and left in a well-lit place (but not in the sun, as this will introduce temperature as an additional variable). Observations should be made daily; although the animals that are without plants may need to be taken out of the jar within the first day to avoid casualties.\n\nExplain: Students should be familiar with the cycle of photosynthesis and respiration. Encourage students to create a diagram on the board for the relationship between the two processes. The equations for photosynthesis and respiration should be reviewed. Remind students that respiration takes place all the time, while photosynthesis happens only with light (unless you have taught the dark reactions)\n\nExtend: If time permits, you can set up this experiment and test for dissolved oxygen levels on a daily (or hourly, in the case of the aquatic animals) basis. You can also create an inquiry-based lab by adding other variables such as temperature or light, and allowing the students to create their own experiments.\n\nEvaluate: Students should be able to answer the questions from 'Dissolved Oxygen Changes' worksheet, which includes extension questions using data from the Hudson River."}
{"text":"Centers\n\nI am thinking of creating centers for my 7th grade science class and am wondering if anyone else has tried this? What are some things I need to consider prior to creating the centers? I have 40 min classes and see anywhere from 26 to 8 students in each class.\n\nReplies to This Discussion\n\nHi Vivian,\nI used to use stations with my upper elementary and middle school students - they would rotate through a number of them within a class period or two. It's been a while, but here's what I remember about the organization:\n\n-The simpler the activities were at each station, the better. Complicated procedures or directions = frustrated students and me running around like a crazy woman. It also works really well if you have a number of items that students are observing, measuring, etc - they follow the same procedure at each station.\n\n- Time each station before doing this with a whole class. Ideally, have a student go through the procedure and add in a little extra time for each. Too little time = frustrated students. Too much = behavior problems. And think about what you will do if a student doesn't finish a particular station. Is there a time at the end that they can return to finish something up?\n\n- Plan in transition time between stations\/centers.Again, not too long, not too short.\n\n- Tape down directions and other needed materials so they aren't accidentally removed from the center\/station.\n\n- Think about how to organize desks or tables so there is sufficient work room. Make sure you have enough room in between the stations, and think about traffic flow between them. This can be a problem if students have lots of books or backpacks to deal with.\n\n- Will stations be cooperative tasks or not? How will you organize students into groups?\n\n- All the normal management issues for small groups and labs apply as well.\n\nI hope these are helpful - please let me know if you have other questions! Good luck!\n\nHello Vivian,\nJessica has some great advice. Another idea is to have more stations than groups of students, so that students who finish first do not have to wait. AND\/OR build in a page that is a reading\/react activity they can work on while waiting between stations.\nI always associate centers with elementary school, and cannot say I have much experience with them. But I do like the idea of stations to give students experience with concepts, to directly observe, to develop conceptions of the related science and to enable some reasoning about the observations and form reasonable inferences. So I don't know if centers are terribly different from stations. In station activities, students are given some information, they manipulate things and\/or make observations both quantitative and qualitative and respond to questions and prompts designed to elicit their reasoning and help them connect their experience and observations to previous knowledge. For example, we just completed properties of water stations, Some stations had students manipulating models, another had them observing boiling water and making inferences, and another had them \"float\" a paper clip on water, then explain how that's possible, given paper clips are less dense than water, evidenced by the paperclip in the bottom of the container.\nI searched NSTA resources using \"learning centers\" and got about 5 hits, most of which led to Science and Children, the elementary pub. But I did find this one: The Station Approach: How to Teach With Limited Resources\nBy: Denise Jaques Jones\nScience Scope, Feb 07 .\nat  and it says its free! Check it out. I attempted to hyperlink, but if it's not hot, just copy and paste into your browser. Good luck!\n\nWOW--so much to think about and great ideas!! I don't know how to reply to each of you to say thanks, so I am saying thanks this way. I really want to differentiate my instruction and be able to work with students in small groups, and I think this is the way to go. Thanks again and I will keep you up to date on what I decide. Now, to come up with the stations\/centers and start after Christmas break. THANKS AGAIN!!!!\n\nHello,\nI have discovered that the students have done better when the centers came to them. Sometimes this wasn't possible, but when it was it worked great. I had 2 or 3 sets of the materials for the centers and gave the students a time frame that they had to complete them in. I started them with a schedule that told them what day and center they would do, and then gradually released them to their own management. This worked a lot better than having their bodies move and rotate, since they are such creatures of habit and any little change can result in confusion and madness."}
{"text":"Below: Complete Learning Outcome Progression\n\nAbstract\n\n(to paper)\n\nTo say Earth systems are complex, is not the same as saying they are a complex system. A complex system, in the technical sense, is a group of \"agents\" (individual interacting units, like birds in a flock, sand grains in a ripple, or individual units of friction along a fault zone), existing far from equilibrium, interacting through positive and negative feedbacks, forming interdependent, dynamic, evolutionary networks, that possess universality properties common to all complex systems (bifurcations, sensitive dependence, fractal organization, and avalanche behaviour that follows power-law distributions.)\n\nChaos\/complex systems theory behaviors are explicit, with their own assumptions, approaches, cognitive tools, and models that must be taught as deliberately and systematically as the equilibrium principles normally taught to students. We present a learning progression of concept building from chaos theory, through a variety of complex systems, and ending with how such systems result in increases in complexity, diversity, order, and\/or interconnectedness with time\u2014that is, evolve. Quantitative and qualitative course-end assessment data indicate that students who have gone through the rubrics are receptive to the ideas, and willing to continue to learn about, apply, and be influenced by them. The reliability\/validity is strongly supported by open, written student comments.\n\nIntroduction to this Site:\n\nThe rubrics presented in the paper are a sequential series of models (some computer based, some qualitative) or graphic presentations that are designed to represent a specific concept in support of specific learning outcomes. There are 12 models leading to 19 learning outcomes. We do not use all the models in all the classes, but pick and choose what works best for the time available and the goals of the class.\n\nEach Model begins with a Description of the model, why we use it, why it is important, how it relates to other areas of knowledge. This is followed by a Presentation; how we develop the model in class. Finally are listed the Learning Outcomes for each model.\n\nA pdf table of the rubric sequence is available. Below we list the steps in the learning progression in the order we present them along with the learning outcomes; each of these link to a page where the Description, Representation, and Learning Outcomes are explained, with links to any computer models or figures used during teaching.\n\nTHE COMPLETE LEARNING PROGESSION\n\nModel: Logistic System (Xnext): Time Series - Part One (of 2 parts)\n\nAnticipated Learning Outcome:\n\n1. Computational viewpoint: the idea that in a dynamic system the only way to know the outcome of an algorithm is to actually calculate it; there is no shorter route to knowing its behavior. This is not true at values below about 3.0, but becomes true at higher values. That this is not intuitively obvious is clear to the students because at higher 'r' values they are unable to predict the changing behavior of the system based on past behavior.\n\n2. Positive\/negative feedback: one central feature of all complex systems is that their behavior stems from the interplay of positive and negative feedbacks. This is a concept that students, when thrown into a natural complex system with many feedbacks operating, may have trouble grasping. The logistic system being so simple makes the influence of positive and negative feedback transparent.\n\n3. 'r' values: 'r' can be translated as rate of growth, although we use 'r' from this point on to talk about whether the 'r' value of any system is high (dissipating lots of energy and\/or information), or low (settling toward an equilibrium state).\n\n4. Deterministic does not equal predictable: this is a very deep concept, especially if we explore its philosophical or theological roots (which in some classes we do). But, in classical science deterministic equals predictable, and predictable means it is deterministic. The logistic system is undeniably deterministic, but at higher 'r' values all semblance of predictability breaks down. For understanding complex systems this is the most important concept gained from exploration of the logistic system.\n\n5. Bifurcations are a change in the behavior of the system and the entire range of behaviors can be summarized in one diagram. Eric Newman, at his MyPhysicsLab web site has an applet of a chaotic pendulum. In just a couple of minutes we can demonstrate that bifurcations to complexity occur in a system that, going back to Galileo, is often taken as one of the best examples of a classical system.\n\n6. Instability increases with 'r'. The harder a system is pushed, the higher the 'r' value, the more unstable and unpredictable its behavior becomes,\n\n7. Self-similarity is patterns, within patterns, within patterns, so that you see complex detail at all scales of observation, all generated by an iterative process. We show examples of river drainage systems, plant branching patterns, zoom in on the Dow Jones on the stock market index, look at Earth temperature patterns during the past ice age, sea level curves, cladograms, and examples of fractally generated landscapes.\n\nModel: Fractal Geometry (more depth on self similarity)\n\nAnticipated Learning Outcome:\n\n8. There is no typical or average size of events or objects; they come nested inside each other, patterns within patterns, within patterns. Peripheral to these discussions, but crucial when dealing with statistics, is that normal statistical analysis cannot be used on fractally organized data sets; there is no mean or standard deviation for fractal objects.\n\n9. Unlike the geometry we are usually taught, most natural objects have non-whole number dimensions.\n\n10. All complex systems accelerate their rate of change\u2014bifurcations\u2014at the same rate. This is a universality property; if this rate of change in behavior of a system is detected, the system is a complex system.\n\nModel: Power Law Relationships\n\nAnticipated Learning Outcome:\n\n13. Small\u2014low energy\u2014events are very common, but do very little work. Large\u2014high energy\u2014events are very rare, but do most of the work in a system. In a complex system at high 'r' values a difference as little as one part in a million can result in different histories for the system.\n\nModel: Cellular Automata\n\nAnticipated Learning Outcome:\n\n(Same as last.) 17. All natural open systems dissipating sufficient energy evolve\u2014self-organize\u2014to critical, sensitive dependent states which lead to avalanches of change that follow a power law distribution.\n\nModel: Bak-Sneppen Ecosystem\n\n18. In a complex system everything is connected with everything else. Nothing exists in isolation from the rest, sitting in a protected niche, independent and self-sufficient.\n\n19. In a complex system no one can be completely safe, with complete control over their fate. Everyone has the potential to be an innocent victim since there is no way one can fully protect oneself from external actions."}
{"text":"Plants and Seeds\n\nPrep Time: 10 minutes Lesson Time: 45 minutes to an hour Age:\n\nAreas of study: art, science\n\nSummary\n\nBackground\/objectives:\n\nMarsh plants have a number of qualities that are common to all plants \u2013 terrestrial and aquatic. Plants are different from animals in a number of ways, but perhaps the biggest difference is that they cannot move to catch their food. To overcome this challenge, they absorb sunlight to produce their own energy. One of the things plants need is therefore is light. They also need air and water.\n\nThe anatomy of a plant allows it to utilize the three things plants need to their utmost potential. The root structure soaks up water and minerals and also stores food, or glucose (sugar). The stem carries up the water, minerals, and food. The leaves make food. Chlorophyll, what causes plants to have their green color, aids in the process of making food. The flower part of the plant makes seeds for reproduction. Seeds are the means by which plants reproduce. They are almost like a young plant, or embryo, with a food source and a hard outer coat. The last part of a plant is the fruit. That is the part that holds and protects food .\n\nPreparation: Buy all of the materials necessary for the activity.\n\nMaterials:\n\nseeds, dirt, pots, paint, paintbrushes\n\nProcedure:\n\n1. Paint the pots\n\n2. Let pots dry for at least an hour\n\n3. Put dirt and seeds in the pots. while the class is planting, discuss with them what plants need to grow and ask them if they've ever planted anything before. This is also a good time to use a worksheet or talk about plant anatomy.\n\nAssessment\n\nTips and Tricks:\n\nHow to implement for\u2026\n\nPreK-2: Don't mention \"photosynthesis\"; keep it simple with the sun, water, air etc.\n\n3-4: They're old enough to understand photosynthesis and why plants are good for the air\n\n5-6: You can probably get into plant anatomy and potentially some more complex anatomy, like chloroplasts"}

The summer season offers all kinds of learning experiences, though. Why not send students off on summer vacations knowing a little bit more about why it's so hot while they are sitting by the pool, and why students on the other side of the world are wearing parkas while it's time for sunscreen here?\n\nTo explore seasonal changes, try these Gizmos:\n\nWith the\nHeat Absorption Gizmo, demonstrate that a beam of light is very concentrated when it is at right angles to a surface, and much more diffuse when the angle is oblique. This explains why the noon sun feels so much stronger than the sun in the early morning and evening. It also explains why the summer sun, which is much higher in the sky, is much more powerful than the winter sun.\n\nThis concept can be further explored with the\nSummer and Winter Gizmo and the\nSeasons: Why do we have them? Gizmo. Each of these Gizmos allows students to compare the angle of sun rays at any location on December 21 and June 21. Students can count the number of \"rays\" that strike a plate on each date, and discover that seasons in the southern hemisphere are opposite of the seasons in the northern hemisphere.\n\nTo explore the seasons in greater detail, we offer a 3D Gizmo with three different modules:\nSeasons: Earth, Moon, and Sun,\nSeasons in 3D, and\nSeasons Around the World. With the Gizmo, students can set the axis angle, choose a location, and make observations on any date. Students can observe the path of the sun through the sky, graph solar intensity during a day or a year, and even observe the shadows cast by a vertical stick over the course of a day. Enjoy!\n\nMore Gizmos with Expanded Curriculum\n\nOur curriculum expansion project is rolling along, and we are pleased to announce that even more Gizmos now come with expanded curriculum materials:\n\nThe new materials include a Teacher Guide, a Student Exploration Guide with an Answer Key, and a Vocabulary Sheet.

{"text":"Teaching Tools\n\nLesson Plans: Exploring Geologic Time and The Burgess Shale Fossils\n\nOverview:\n\nStudents gain an understanding of Geologic Time in this hands-on activity, by building a physical model of the Geologic Time Scale. Some important developments in the evolution of life on Earth are illustrated and highlighted on the timeline, including the famous Burgess Shale fossil site, an UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Yoho National Park of Canada. Some mathematical calculations are required.\n\nLearning Expectations:\n\nto make a correct scale model of the Geologic Time Scale, showing its basic divisions of time\n\nto summarize, and place in order some of the major developments in the history of life on Earth\n\nto appreciate the great age of the Burgess Shale fossils, and why they are designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\nDuration of the lesson:\n\nApproximately one hour to actually build and label the timeline, assuming that all materials are previously collected. In and out of class research time (ranging from 1-3 hours), if desired.\n\nRequired Materials\/Preparation:\n\n4 different colours of thick yarn (you will need about 4 metres of one colour, and small amounts of the other colours)\n\nmetric ruler or measuring tape\n\nscissors\n\ncolour markers\n\nmasking tape or flagging tape, copies of Tables 1 & 2 (included here)\n\ncalculator\n\n*computer, with Internet access (optional)\n\n*construction paper and pictures corresponding to the major events, string (optional)\n\nTeacher Background:\n\nStudents should know how to use a mathematical ratio to create a scale model, as well as be able to do basic metric conversions.\n\nThe Background Information section gives more details about each of the events listed in Table 2. Answers to the Discussion Questions are located within the text of the Background Information section.\n\nSmall groups may work together to build their own version of the timeline, then present theirs to the rest of the class. Illustrations representing each of the events (in random order) could be handed out to another group, and they could be asked to arrange the events on the timeline. The teacher can facilitate this exercise by encouraging participants to think about what had to happen first, in order for higher life forms to evolve (e.g. plants had to be present on land as a food source, before animals could move to land).\n\nAnswers to Tables 1 and 2, and to the Discussion Questions are included.\n\nProcedure:\n\nRefer to Table 1: Major Divisions of Geologic Time. Complete the table, using a calculator, to calculate the length of yarn that should be used to represent each major division of the geologic time scale (use the scale 1 cm = 10 million years).\n\nUse a different colour of yarn to represent each of the 4 divisions of time, and cut the lengths of yarn according to your calculations in Table 1. (You may need to add an extra 10 cm or so to each piece, to allow you to tie the pieces of yarn together.) Now you will have a colourful representation of the geologic time scale! (Make sure that when your lengths of yarn are tied together, the time periods remain approximately the correct length according to your calculations.)\n\nPlace a large knot at the beginning of Precambrian time on your timeline to represent the Formation of the Earth, 4.5 billion years ago. This will be your datum or starting place from which to measure to the next event. Label this event using colourful tape (or a suitable picture glued onto construction paper and hung on a string).\n\nStarting from the first knot, tie a 2 nd knot the correct distance away (to represent the appearance of Simple Cellular Life, 3.5 billion years ago, or 1 billion years after the Earth had formed). Label this important event with tape, or a picture.\n\nContinue to tie knots along the string at the correct distances from the previous knot to represent each important event in Earth's history listed in Table 2. Label what you think are the most important events. Your timeline is now finished and ready to present to the rest of the class!\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nWhat can be observed about the history of life on Earth from the timeline?\n\nAbout what percentage of Earth's history is represented by Precambrian time?\n\nWhat chemical process allowed for the build-up of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere over time? What life forms were responsible for this?\n\nWhat important event marks the beginning of the Palaeozoic era? What is the significance of this event?\n\nWhere were the Burgess Shale fossils first discovered? When were they found? By whom? Why are they important enough to be designated an UNESCO World Heritage Site?\n\nWhat other major geologic event (that has shaped our landscape in western Canada) occurred during the Age of the Dinosaurs?\n\nWhat major event marks the close of the Mesozoic era?\n\nHow significant is the time in which humans have lived on Earth relative to the great age of the Earth?\n\nEvaluation:\n\nThe teacher could assess students using any or all of the following criteria:\n\nTables 1 and 2 correctly completed\n\ntimeline is correctly built to scale, major divisions of time are apparent with colour-scheme used\n\ntimeline is neat and is labelled correctly\n\nappropriate illustrations are used to represent the major events, and are correctly positioned\n\nDiscussion Questions are answered correctly\n\nstudent demonstrates understanding by an ability to tell others about the timeline\n\nExtension of the lesson:\n\nIf time allows, students could find illustrations representing each of the major events, and label the timeline with these.\n\nRather than providing the students with the Background Information given here, the teacher may wish to have the students research themselves to find out more about the major events in the history of life on Earth listed in Table 2.\n\nOnly some of the major events in Earth's history are listed in Table 2. The teacher could build on this activity by asking students to create their own version of Table 2.\n\nOnly the largest divisions of the Geologic Time Scale are given in Table 1. The teacher may ask students to show more divisions of the Geologic Time Scale on their timeline than are given in Table 1.\n\nSuggested Related Resources :\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, Museum of Paleontology website:  (an excellent site for information about geologic time and evolution, with lots of pictures).\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nBackground Information:\n\nThe first evidence for life on Earth comes from fossils of simple bacteria and cyanobacteria in rocks that are 3.5 billion years old. However, it wasn't until the dawn of the Palaeozoic era (start of the Cambrian period) when life on Earth suddenly became abundant. Complex life has only existed on Earth for about the last 12% of Earth's long history!\n\nThe main divisions of geologic time are defined by major events in the Earth's history that are recorded in the fossil and\/or rock record.\n\nSome Significant Events in the History of the Earth:\n\nFormation of the Earth\n\nThe estimated age of the Earth is 4.5 billion years old. At this time, Earth was a nasty place with a poisonous atmosphere and no signs of life anywhere. Gradually, an atmosphere of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, methane and water vapour built up from volcanic eruptions and meteors crashing into Earth. From this primitive beginning, the first life developed, and the atmosphere gradually changed to contain more and more oxygen, capable of supporting higher life forms.\n\nSimple Cellular Life\n\nA billion years after the planet formed, the first lifeforms, bacteria and cyanobacteria, were present. They formed mats in shallow tidal environments, and these mats trapped small particles of sand and other sediment to build structures called stromatolites. They had the ability to photosynthesise, i.e. use sunlight and CO 2 to make food, and in the process they gave off oxygen. As a result of their life processes, oxygen gradually built up in the Earth's atmosphere and in the oceans.\n\nCambrian Explosion\n\nIt was the Big Bang of evolution! In a very short time period, an abundance of fossils suddenly appeared in the fossil record showing that a large diversity of complex, multicellular animals were living in Earth's oceans at this time. This important event marks the beginning of the Palaeozoic eon. For the first time, many different animals acquired the ability to produce hard shells for protection. Trilobites, ancient marine arthropods, were present in great numbers in the Cambrian oceans, and were the first animals to develop eyes and the ability to see.\n\nBurgess Shale fossils\n\nThese world-famous fossils are found in Yoho National Park in British Columbia. They were first discovered by Charles Walcott in 1909. They represent a tremendous variety of plants and animals that lived in a warm, tropical, shallow sea. Some of these animals are ancient ancestors of animals alive today, but others are long extinct, and are nothing like creatures alive today! They lived a short time after the Cambrian Explosion, and are important to science because they are so old and so well preserved (even the soft tissues and membranes of the animals are preserved 505 million years after they died)! Today, the fossils rest in what is known as Walcott's quarry, high up on a mountain ridge near the village of Field.\n\nFirst Land Plants\n\nThe earliest known fossil land plants are from the Devonian period, and have been found mainly in Australia. These plants were quite small, and are called Cooksonia. Their stems were usually only a few centimetres high, and they lacked leaves and true roots. They were the first lifeforms to colonise the land!\n\nInsects\n\nHundreds of fossil insect species date back to the Pennsylvanian Period, 320 million years ago. Early insects were wingless, and related to living silverfish. When wings finally evolved, they initially projected out to both sides, but later, could be folded back along the body. Certain advanced groups such as those that interact with flowering plants (like bees, wasps, flies, and ants) do not appear in the fossil record until flowering plants evolved.\n\nAge of the Dinosaurs\n\nThe Jurassic period (208 \u2013 146 million years ago) was the age of the dinosaurs! The two main groups of dinosaurs were the Saurishians and the Ornithischians. The first group evolved from early reptiles, and had a pelvis like that of many other reptiles. The second group evolved from the Saurishians. This group had a birdlike pelvis. Dinosaurs would rule the land for over one hundred million years! At the time that dinosaurs were roaming the coastal plains of Alberta, the Rocky Mountains began to rise to the west.\n\nFlowering Plants\n\nFlowering plants appeared on land during the Mesozoic, about 40 million years ago. Much of their evolution was based on the symbiotic relationship that developed between insects and plants.\n\nCretaceous Extinction\n\nA major environmental crisis occurred within a short period of time, at the close of the Cretaceous period at the end of the Mesozoic era. Dinosaurs, large clams, ammonites, and other animal groups vanished in less than a million years. A large asteroid struck the Earth just offshore of the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico at this time, creating a tremendous explosion and firestorms that sent huge amounts of dust and debris up into the Earth's atmosphere that blocked out the sun. Evidence for such an impact is found in unusually high concentrations of the rare element iridium, found in clay layers in many places around the world dating from this time period. The iridium is believed to come from the asteroid. Convincing evidence of this theory was provided when an oil company discovered the asteroid's crater beneath the bottom of the sea. However, there is evidence that an environmental crisis was already in progress and was causing extinctions before the asteroid impact, but the asteroid was the final blow to the dinosaurs. There were at least 4 other periods of mass extinctions on Earth prior to this one.\n\nEarly Humans\n\nThe first early humans (hominids), from the family Hominidae, appeared on Earth about 4 million years ago. The hominids were characterised by upright posture, and their forelimbs were not used for locomotion and so were usually shorter and not as strong as the hind limbs. In addition, the teeth were small and were about the same size, in contrast to the larger teeth of apes and monkeys.\n\nAnswers :\n\nTable 1: Major Divisions of Geologic Time\n\nTime range (millions of years)\n\nLength of period (millions of years)\n\nLength in cm (1 cm = 10 million years) *round to the nearest cm\n\nPrecambrian Eon\n\n4,500 \u2013 543\n\n3,957\n\n396\n\nPalaeozoic Era (\"ancient life\")\n\n543 - 248\n\n295\n\n30\n\nMesozoic Era (\"middle life\")\n\n248 - 65\n\n183\n\n18\n\nCenozoic Era (\"recent life\")\n\n65 \u2013 0 (present day)\n\n65\n\n7\n\nTable 2: Some major events in Earth's history\n\nKnot\n\nEvent\n\nMillions of years ago\n\nDistance from previous knot (cm)\n\n1\n\nFormation of the Earth (Datum)\n\n4,500\n\n0\n\n2\n\nSimple Cellular Life appears\n\n3,500\n\n100\n\n3\n\nCambrian Explosion (abundant fossils)\n\n543\n\n296\n\n4\n\nBurgess Shale fossils\n\n505\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFirst Plants on Land (Cooksonia)\n\n410\n\n9.5\n\n6\n\nInsects appear\n\n320\n\n9\n\n7\n\nAge of the Dinosaurs\n\n175\n\n14.5\n\n8\n\nFlowering plants appear\n\n140\n\n3.5\n\n9\n\nCretaceous Extinction\n\n65\n\n7.5\n\n10\n\nEarly humans appear\n\n4\n\n6\n\nAnswers to Discussion Questions:\n\nFor most of Earth's history (the Precambrian), only the simplest lifeforms existed. Life became complex and much more diverse after the Cambrian Explosion.\n\nAbout 88% of Earth's history is represented by Precambrian time ((4500-543)\/4500 x 100%). Complex life has existed on Earth for only about 12% of the total time.\n\nOxygen gradually built-up from the process of photosynthesis by cyanobacteria.\n\nThe Cambrian Explosion. The Cambrian Explosion represents the sudden appearance of a great diversity of complex life in the fossil record.\n\nAmerican Charles Walcott first discovered the Burgess Shale fossils in Yoho National Park in 1909. This site, known today as Walcott's Quarry, remains the richest site, although there are other Burgess Shale sites found elsewhere in the world. The Burgess Shale animals lived shortly after the Cambrian Explosion, so are some of the oldest ancestors of modern animals. They are extremely well preserved, with even soft tissues and internal organs visible.\n\nThe Rocky Mountains began to form, about 175 million years ago.\n\nCretaceous mass extinction, when the last of the dinosaurs perished.\n\nNot very significant at all, less than 0.1% in terms of geologic time!"}

I usually will do it with\nsomething exciting, like giant spiders attacking a town; something\nthat will grab their attention or make them laugh. I show\nthem how to do it, step-by-step, on MovieMaker on my computer using\nthe LCD projector. Then I show them the finished product at\nthe end. I tell them where to find the MovieMaker Tutorial\n(attached below), which walks them through all use of the\nprogram."}

The text introduces functions and features of the human heart, and 4 comprehension questions have students recall what they learned, writing it in their own words. Consider requiring full sentences to promote fuller understanding.\n\nStudents examine the heart to investigate why heart transplants are sometimes needed. In this circulatory system lesson students view video on the human heart and learn how gene mutation can affect the structure and function of red blood cells.\n\nStudents identify the 4-chambers and major blood vessels of the heart and\nconstruct a model of a 4-chamber heart. They sketch their model, identify the chambers\/vessels, state the condition of the blood in each chamber\/vessel, and sketch the flow of blood through the model.\n\nPupils explore the function of the human heart. For this heart anatomy lesson, students participate in activities offered at an Internet website to discover the characteristics and jobs of the parts of the human heart.\n\nStudents take a journey through the heart studying its valves and chambers. In this circulatory lesson students view a demonstration then take another persons blood pressure and discuss how blood passes through the heartAssess anatomists' understanding of the structure of the mammalian heart by giving a pretest. Have them visit some websites to further learn about heart anatomy. Then take them into the laboratory to perform a dissection so that they get hands-on experience. There are handouts, background information, detailed procedures, modifications, and extensions all rolled into this resource. Use it to pump up your biology class when studying anatomy or the circulatory system.\n\nStudents analyze the different functions of the heart. In this heart healthy instructional activity, students participate in an activity where they compare their heart rates at rest as well as after physical activity. Students research more about the heart's functions, and write a report depicting their research. Students continue to monitor their heart rate over a three-day period, and they construct a double bar graph to represent their findings.\n\nStudents explore human anatomy by defining vocabulary terms. In this human heart lesson, students research the components of the respiratory system and complete handouts based on the role of the heart. Students define a list of heart vocabulary terms and graph class heart data.\n\nStudents explore the major causes of heat attacks as the topics of the human circulatory system, blood pressure, heart disease, arteries and veins are examined. Opinions on the topics are developed as researched material is presented to the group."}

We are currently using the FOSS curriculum, and I am going to start off with the Earth History unit... BUT... I'm not a big fan of\u2026Continue\n\nComment Wall\n\nYou need to be a member of Middle School Science Teachers to add comments!\n\nHey Everybody. I wanted to introduce myself and let you know that I have volunteered to be the moderator for our middle school science group. I teach 7th and 8th Grade Science at Yorktown Middle School in Yorktown, IN. I have been flipping since the beginning of this school year in my Accelerated 7th Grade Science Classes. Next year I plan to continue with my advanced students and add my general 7th Graders as well. Our school is going to 1:1 which makes the move to a Flipped Classroom an easy transition.\n\nEnough about me, I'm curious about you. How are you flipping in your middle school science classes? I've heard a great deal about teachers flipping in high school, but a lot less in middle school. I'm really looking forwarr to learning from you.\n\nI'm going into my 3rd year of teaching and would really like to dabble in \"flipping\" this year! I will be teaching physical science to students in grades 6-8. I want to try to use the 5E model, with the flipping video taking the place of lecture or textbook reading in the \"explain\" portion of the model. I want to assign the video for homework, and have class-time centered around labs, practice, and project-based learning. So, I'm currently thinking I may even just do 1 video a week. I'm thinking I might scaffold the year and have the 8th graders find videos to learn from themselves by the end of the year so they can see that they are able to independently use the resources on the internet to learn.\n\nI'm hoping for help with a few things:\n\n- Good sources for sharing\/finding middle school level videos to use? I know I will make some, but I don't want to \"reinvent the wheel\" if there is already something useful out there.\n\n- when\/how do others use the textbook with this model? I don't have a textbook focused classroom but I think it is important to teach my students how to navigate their way through learning with a textbook - including note-taking and text-reading strategies.\n\nHello all, I'm new to flipping, having only just tried it once, but am enciouraged by my students responses to this experiment. Do any of you with more experience have any suggestions on things to try, or, conversly, things to avoid? I'd love to hear from you on either point. Thanks in advance. ~~~~ Phread (said as Fred)."}
