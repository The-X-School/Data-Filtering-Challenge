The misplaced black hole is probably the result of a merger between two smaller black holes, but could also have been pushed by a jet of matter extending from the galaxy's core.\n\nNearly every galaxy has a supermassive black hole -- millions to billions of times more massive than our sun -- nestled in its centre.

Some data centres just pump it out into the outside world. Others use the excess energy to heat local homes. But TelecityGroup's newest datacentre, Condorcet - which opened in Paris earlier in the year, uses its heat to conduct research into climate change.\n\nThe building's exterior is comprised of a massive arboretum - a greenhouse, which is maintained at the climatic conditions expected to be prevailing in France in 2050. The French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) operates a research centre there, growing plants from around the world to investigate which will be viable to grow when climate change's effects are starting to be felt in the country.

The reason they do not mix is that the water molecule is polar\u2013 it has a lopsided electrical charge\u2013 and the oil molecule is not. Polar molecules have a positively charged end and a negatively charged end, and they can form various bonds that exploit positive\/ negative attraction. Water is a strongly polar molecule, which leads to its myriad exceptional physical properties. Water molecules self-organize according to polarity, creating surface tension, six-sided snowflakes, and a frozen form that is less dense than the liquid form. The strong polar forces in water are also able to tear apart molecules such as salt, which is why water can dissolve so many substances. Continue reading \u2192\n\nThe granite of Mt.

{"text":"Small apartments, lack of outdoor space, high rise living: Hong Kong is a tougher town than most when it comes to owning pets. But new technologies are at hand, changing the way we observe living creatures and enabling us to raise them in a rather unique way.\n\nFor a family pet with a difference, urban dwellers are turning to sealed closed ecosystems: complete, self-contained and self-sustaining miniature glass worlds. Containing real micro-ecosystems \u2013 home to plant life, fish, ants, shrimps - these glass enclosures have been termed the world's lowest maintenance pets.\n\nThey may be great learning tools and home to all manner of creatures, but sealed ecosystems are actually a result of space age technology initiated by NASA in the early 1980s. Back then, NASA was studying the Earth's biosphere and researching life support systems in outer space and such tiny biosphere models provided them with valuable data. These days, ecospheres have moved into our homes, schools and offices, offering fascinating glimpses into life on our planet.\n\nInside these containers plants and animals exist in perfect balance, yet nothing enters except sunlight. Energy from the sun promotes plant and animal growth, causing plants to undergo a process called photosynthesis which uses the energy from light to turn carbon dioxide into oxygen. In return, the animals generate carbon dioxide and nutrients needed by the plants. And so it goes on.\n\nSealed ecosystems come in a variety of designs, all of which echo the workings of planet Earth. With Beachworld, for example, you can bring the beach inside your home. Simply place it somewhere warm and light and watch red shrimps called Opae'ula, normally found only on certain Hawaiian islands, inhabit algae-filled lava rock pools. The light causes the algae to produce oxygen and food for the shrimps which in turn produce carbon dioxide and nutrients for the algae to grow. Unlike their natural habitat there are no predators in Beachworld so the life span of the shrimps can be extremely long.\n\nA different kind of environment can be found with a Forest Ants Antquarium, a self-sufficient world where ants and tropical plants live in a perfectly balanced environment. Antquarium contains a special clear gel full of nutrients which acts as the ants' food and water. Within days the ants burrow out an amazing pattern of channels and tunnels, each clearly visible through the clear antquarium walls.\n\nEducational and ever changing, it's no wonder that biospheres are becoming increasingly popular. A fascinating glimpse into the continual cycle of life of which each and every one of us plays a part.\n\nGrow your own Wonderfish\n\n1. Pour water into a prepared container.\n2. Add fish eggs from peat moss into the container and gently stir until peat moss is saturated.\n3. Fish babies will hatch between 2-98 hours.\n4. On the second day, feed with brine shrimps.\n5. When the baby fish become strong, move them to a bigger container.\n6. Male fish are colourful when mature at 2 months old. Female fish have no colour.\n\nSuper Facts\n\nAnts are one of the oldest living creatures on earth. They are also the longest living of all insects and can carry 10-20 times their own bodyweight, climb 30-metre-high trees and move at speeds equal to a person running 104 kph. At the last count, experts estimated there were 4,600 kinds of ants on earth."}

Malaria, one of the world's most damaging diseases with more than 300 million cases per year and more than a million deaths, is transmitted by mosquitoes in the genus Anopheles. Since the mosquito larvae live in small ponds, it would be expected that the more rain the more water-filled ponds and crevices, the more mosquitoes and malaria. However, findings reported by the scientists from the Unversity of Wageningen in the Netherlands and Kenya Medical Research Institute suggest that increased rainfall will have a negative effect on mosquito larval populations and thus potentially on Malaria.\n\nIn the past decades, researchers have been working hard on solving the problem of how individual cells in a multicellular organism organise themselves in structures such as hearts, brains, lungs etc during ontogeny.

Sony have admitted that personal information, including dates of birth, mother's maiden names, addresses and credit card numbers are included in the data stolen by hackers. This is a major incident in the world of the web, one of the largest security breaches ever.\n\nIs the web safe? How can I protect myself from fraud and identity theft? Is there any way I can protect myself?\n\nThe web is by definition a public area. Celebrities especially seem to forget this when posting on Twitter or Facebook. The greatest strength of the web \u2013 that you can access all of it, from anywhere in the world, all the time \u2013 is the reason why security breaches like the one affecting the PSN are inevitable. The web is not inherently safe, but you can protect yourself to a certain extent if you follow the following guidelines:\n\nUse credit (not debit) cards\n\nUse different and strong passwords (a password manager helps)\n\nProtect your data\n\nUse up-to-date software\n\nIf you keep these things in mind when using the web, you will protect yourself from the majority of attacks, and minimise the impact an attack has if you do fall victim to one. The web is a wonderful resource, I love it and can't imagine living without it now, but common sense should prevail with these things, always remembering: the web is public, not private.\n\nI am currently watching an excellent series on the BBC called The Story of Science. The third episode, which I have just watched, is called 'How we got here'.\n\nIt of course raises all the red herrings and difficult questions surrounding geology and biology, but one observation from the presenter hit me squarely between the eyes.\n\nThe episode ended on a geological note, Dr Mosley talked about how violent Earth is, with the volcanic eruptions and earthquakes caused by continental drift, and the tsunamis that occur when those events happen underwater.\n\nHis point was that the development of life is not in spite of Earth being so violent, but is actually helped by it. Some catastrophic events do wipe out entire species, but most of the time the violence actually encourages life to flourish by giving it new opportunities. His best example was the Rift Valley in East Africa, which is home to hundreds of thousands of animals and birds.\n\nI found this a fascinating argument, that natural 'disasters' help and encourage life to flourish far more often than harming it. And it made me think \u2013 well that's exactly how God operates, bringing life out of death, even totally dead and arid places like the deserts of East Africa, transformed into lush savannah by the violent separating of two continents.\n\nIt should not surprise us that he created the world in such a way \u2013 that no matter how dreadful the catastrophe, life always survives, somehow, somewhere. Even at its most harsh and devastating, creation does exactly what it says on the tin.\n\nI have long disliked the central place that 'chance' has in modern scientific theories, particularly the 'random' mutations that drive evolution forward. As a Christian I don't like the idea of utter randomness, of chance being the determining factor in the development of life.\n\nI am also aware that as a concept it is lauded by many of the new atheists as the final nail in God's coffin: there is no need for God, there is no proof for God's existence in nature; everything is down to chance, and therefore there is no creator, and no ultimate purpose to life.\n\nA good friend pointed me recently to this article, by Paul Ewart. It is one of those articles that forced me to look at something from a slightly different angle, which is no bad thing.\n\nPaul Ewart argues that \u2013 maybe \u2013 chance is a necessary aspect of theology, because it helps us to understand the relationship between a sovereign creator and human agency (often called 'free will' \u2013 I'm not sure humans actually have free will, but that's another argument).\n\nPerhaps life is like a game of chess, with God as 'an infinitely wise grand master.' No matter what we do, which moves we make, God always wins, the outcome is always good, in the end: 'God adapts his actions in sustaining the world in existence to take account of whatever happens.'\n\nOf course, we would want to argue that God also knows which moves we are going to make, before we make them. We don't 'catch him out' with our wickedness. We mustn't take the chess game analogy too far; instead it is perhaps a helpful way for us to understand how the world appears sometimes (that there is no benevolent almighty God in ultimate control) with what the Bible insists is the case (the Lamb is on the throne).\n\nAccording to the report 57 per cent of those interviewed described the service an 'intrusion' while 24 per cent said that they believed it was 'a service for burglars'. A staggering seventy-three per cent labeled the service an 'intrusion' and said that they were most angered by the fact they have not given permission for the publishing of images.\n\nJust over a third said they thought the expansion of the service, announced on Thursday, was a positive thing."}

{"text":"YOUR FRIENDS' ACTIVITY\n\nHighway Paleontologist Digs Up a New Species of Whale\n\nDiscovered: How a California law lead to a whale fossil discovery; over half of moviegoers want to puke while watching 3D films; dogs sniff out other dogs in crowds; tracking climate change through Rock Hyrax urine.\n\nGovernment-mandated paleontologist makes a whale of a discovery. If the state of California hadn't approved a highway-widening project in Laguna Canyon, we may never have found evidence of four previously unknown types of baleen whale which once swam the Earth's oceans. By law, new road projects in the state have to involve on-site supervision from a paleontologist and an archaeologist. That's why paleontologist Meredith Rivin of the John D. Cooper Archaeological and Paleontological Center was there to find 30 cetacean skulls that lead to the discovery of the newly identified toothed baleen whale species that lived 17 to 19 million years ago. Modern baleen whales of course don't have teeth, but these Miocene-era fossils suggest that today's filter-feeding whales descended from toothed ancestors. Nick Pyenson of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History says he'll \"be excited to see what [the researchers] come up with\" in terms of what this finding means for our understanding of whale evolution. Though we're sure many a paleontologist has stood idly on fruitless California road-cutting projects, these findings are a big win for government-mandated researchers at transportation project sites.

But one of the more scatological methods involves studying where the Rock Hyrax (a furry, guinea pig-sized mammal that lives in rock crevices in Africa and Asia) urinates. They tend to stay put for generations, with each wave of parents teaching their young where to relieve themselves. As all that urine dries up, it collects pollen, leaves, grass, and air bubbles that capture the atmospheric history of Earth's changing climate. Brian Chase of Montpelier University and his colleagues have studies this urine deposits, finding that places where the Rock Hyrax lives were greatly effected by glacier retreats in the last Ice Age. \"This had a huge local impact in northern Europe but we did not know how the rest of the planet was affected,\" says Chase. \"Thanks to rock hyrax urine from the period, we have an answer. There was significant cooling in South Africa, and presumably the rest of the planet, at the time.\" [Ars Technica"}
{"text":"UW Gamers Crack AIDS Mystery\n\nEmail\n\n|\n\nMORE!\n\nThe University of Washington is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year. Founded in 1861 on ten acres of land donated by the Denny, Terry and Lander families. The UW began with one building, one faculty member who doubled as school President, and a handful of students. Since then, the school has expanded to three campuses, a top-ranked medical center and thousands of students doing groundbreaking work.\n\nOne of the latest developments to come from the University could transform research about AIDS and other scientific challenges. A group of online gamers took on the challenge of locking the protein structure of an AIDS-like virus that scientists have been unable to figure out for a decade. They did it in three weeks.\n\nThree members of that team: Dr. Seth Cooper, creator and lead developer for Foldit, the system tused in this breakthrough; Dr. Zoran Popovic, the Director at the University of Washington's Center for Game Science; and Dr. Firas Khatib, a post-doctoral researcher in the UW's Department of Biochemistry joined Margaret to talk about their amazing accomplishment. They shared how they achieved their results and talked about their work to help revolutionize K-12 education by getting students involved in tackling math and science using gaming methods.\n\nTo learn more about Foldit and the team's groundbreaking achievement, please click here.\n\nHere are just a few of the innovative developments to come from University of Washington alumni and researchers:\n\nUW Medicine professor Belding Scribner came up with the idea of implanting a Teflon shunt in patients with kidney failure. This allowed repeated, long-term use of dialysis machines that clean the blood, extending the lives of kidney patients significantly. Wayne Quinton, '58, the \"father of bioengineering,\" created more than 30 innovative medical devices, including the shunt used by Dr. Scribner. Engineering professor Albert Babb then helped invent a home kidney dialysis machine that has saved millions of lives.\n\nConsidered one of biotechnology's greatest triumphs, the vaccine for Hepatitis B was the result of basic research conducted by Genetics professor Ben Hall and his team.\n\nBionic contact lenses developed by UW electrical engineer Babak Parviz were selected as among of the 50 best inventions of 2008 by Time magazine. The lenses create a display over the wearer's visual field, so that images, maps, data, etc., appear to float in midair.\n\nMaynard Pennell, Jack Steiner, Joe Sutter and John Roundhill - all UW alumni - were among the chief designers of Boeing jet planes that revolutionized air travel.\n\nThe process that brought us color television - three beams of electrons (one for each primary color) fired on a screen of small, inverted pyramids, was invented by Willard Geer,a 1927 Physics graduate of the UW.\n\nVictor Mills, a 1926 UW grad, was a chemical engineer working for Proctor & Gamble. He was given a challenge when the consumer products giant purchases a pulp mill and told him to see what he could make of it. He invented the disposable diaper, a revolutionary development that today is a multi-billion dollar industry.\n\nTo learn more about the University of Washington's 150th Anniversary celebration, please click here."}

It attracts over 3000 science educators from all phases of science education who can choose from over 400 talks, workshops, seminars and booked courses over four inspiring days.\n\nA similar series of talks will be held at next January's conference, with a theme of 'competition and success'.\n\nNews - Can Scientists Improve Photosynthesis?\n\nPhotosynthesis has evolved over millions of years - so is it possible for scientists to improve on it? Teams of scientists from a range of different disciplines from both the US and the UK are working to make photosynthesis more efficient.\n\nProfessor Janet Allen, Director of Research at BBSRC, said \"Photosynthesis has evolved in plants, algae and some other bacteria and in each case the mechanism does the best possible job for the organism in question. However, there are trade-offs in nature which mean that photosynthesis is not as efficient as it could be - for many important crops such as wheat, barley, potatoes and sugar beet, the theoretical maximum is only 5%, depending on how it is measured. There is scope to improve it for processes useful to us, for example increasing the amount of food crop or energy biomass a plant can produce from the same amount of sunlight. This is hugely ambitious research but if the scientists we are supporting can achieve their aims it will be a profound achievement.\"\n\nSome of the scientists will be focusing improving the efficiency of the 'bottleneck' enzyme RuBisCO. By attempting to transfer parts from algae and bacteria into plants, the researchers hope to make the environment in the plants' cells around RuBisCO richer in carbon dioxide which will allow photosynthesis to produce sugars more efficiently.\n\nThe CAPP team explains\n\n\"In most plants, growth rate is limited by the rate at which carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is taken up and converted to sugars in the process of photosynthesis. The enzyme responsible for the first step in this process, Rubisco, does not work at its potential maximum efficiency at the current levels of carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere. If levels were much higher, photosynthesis would be faster and plants would grow faster. This speeding-up of photosynthesis will happen naturally over the next fifty years or so as atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rise due to human activities. However, there is an immediate requirement for increased crop productivity to provide food for the rising population of the planet. Our project addresses this problem. We are studying a mechanism present in tiny green algae that results in high concentrations of carbon dioxide inside their photosynthesising cells (called a Carbon Concentrating Mechanism, or CCM), enabling Rubisco to work at maximum efficiency. We have recently discovered important new information about this mechanism, and we have invented new and rapid methods to discover algal genes that contribute to it. We have two complementary and parallel aims. First, we will apply our new methods to identify all of the genes required by the algae to achieve high concentrations of carbon dioxide inside the cells, and we will discover exactly how these genes work. Second, we will transfer the most important genes into a plant, and study whether the same CCM can be recreated inside a leaf. If it can, we expect that our experimental plant will have higher rates of photosynthesis and hence a higher rate of growth than normal plants. This work will provide new insights into how plants and algae acquire and use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, of great importance in predicting and coping with the current rapid changes in the atmosphere and hence in climate. The work will also contribute to strategies to increase global food security, because it will indicate new ways in which crop productivity can be increased.\"\n\nSee their website at: \n\nSneaky, cheating plants - just like humans, then?\n\nThey feign sick, they're shy, they call in others to fight on their behalf when attacked, and what's more, they trick others into mating with them. In fact, we have to conclude that plants are more like humans than we might think.\n\nSexual plant reproduction: Male and female talk in the same way as do cells in your brain\n\n17 March 2011\n\nHow far is cell-cell communication conserved between animals and plants? The answer may be that it's much further than we sometimes think.\n\nNew research from a team of scientists in Portugal reveals that pollen, the organ that contains the plant male gametes, communicate with the pistil, their female counterpart, using a mechanism commonly observed in the nervous system of animals. The growth of pollen tubes is controlled by, among other things, a rare aminoacid, D-serine (D-Ser). Both D-Ser and GLRs are key molecular players in cell-cell communication in the animal central nervous systems, at various levels: they play a central role in memory and learning processes in the brain, and have been implicated in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer, Huntington's disease and others. The research of the Portuguese scientists suggests that D-serine, produced in the female sexual organs of the plant may have a role in guiding pollen tubes to their final target.\n\nA new way to avoid injections\n\nAsk the average person about how plants contribute to health, and you'll probably get two responses - firstly, a mention of the nutritional value of fruit and veg, and secondly, a vague memory of the role of plant compounds as medicines.\n\nBut could plants also help deliver vaccines? Would staying healthy be easier if, rather than getting a vaccine through a jab in the arm, you simply ate a banana, a potato, or a tomato?\n\nGetting vaccines out across the world and administering them safely can be a difficult business. Researchers searching for an easier and affordable means of immunization had the idea of using fruit and vegetable plants as factories for synthesizing vaccines, known as ''edible vaccines''.\n\nAn article by researchers Monika Sharma and Bhumika Soods describes edible vaccines as follows: \"Invented by Charles J. Arntzen (Biodesign institute, Arizona State University) these subunit vaccines are made up of antigens that can be grown in genetically modified plants and delivered through the edible parts of the plant (Arntzen 1997). They do not contain the genes responsible for pathogenesis, making them safe as they can generate an immune response in the body without causing disease. Edible vaccines are likely to overcome the hurdles posed by traditional vaccines, as they can be delivered without needles, do not require refrigeration and can be made, less expensively, right in the area in which they will be delivered.\"\n\nBut, as the researchers state, getting ideas from the lab to the real world is not a straight-forward journey: \"Though the road ahead seems promising, there are several constraints which restrict the success and public acceptability of these vaccines.

The movement is achieved through osmosis: touch triggers water to leave certain cells, and to enter others, with the result that the leaves fold inwards. Researchers are studying how plants change shape, and working to replicate the mechanisms in artificial cells. Today, their artificial cells are palm-size and larger, but the teams are working to shrink them down, using microstructures and nanofibers. They're also exploring how to replicate the mechanisms by which plants heal themselves.\n\nNews - Killer Alien Weed May Threaten Biggest Animal Migration\n\nFrom The National Geographic\n\n\"An alien weed creeping through southern Kenya may threaten the largest wildlife migration on the planet, scientists say.

It is a highly sophisticated chemical language undetectable by the human nose and largely undeciphered by science. But if and when it can be understood, it might open the way to modifying plants' signals to give them stronger protection, or to developing environmentally friendly mimics of natural signals as alternatives to herbicides.\n\nIn his efforts to understand this language, Baldwin has embarked on a project unique in its ambition and scale, carried out along what he calls \"the longest lab corridor in the world\". Working in Jena, Germany, where he is a director of the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, he and his team develop powerful genetic tools to systematically knock out, or knock down, genes involved in making the chemical signals.

{"text":"YOUR FRIENDS' ACTIVITY\n\nDeep underground, worms and \"zombie microbes\" rule\n\nOSLO (Reuters) - A dark realm far beneath the Earth's surface is a surprisingly rich home for tiny worms and \"zombie microbes\" that may hold clues to the origins of life, scientists said on Monday.\n\n\"It's an amazing new world,\" said Robert Hazen, head of the Deep Carbon Observatory, a decade-long $500 million project to study the planet's carbon, an element vital to life and found in everything from oil to diamonds.\n\n\"It's very possible that there's a deep microbial biosphere that goes down more than 10 km (6 miles), maybe 20,\" Hazen told Reuters of the first book by the Observatory, published on Monday and written by more than 50 experts in nine countries.\n\nMicrobes had been reported, for instance, in rocks recovered by drilling more than 6 km below the surface in China's Songliao basin, he said. And tiny worms have been found in fractures in rocks 1.3 km deep in a South African mine.\n\nThe single-celled microbes found deep underground include bacteria, which need water and nutrients to grow but not necessarily oxygen, and archaea, which can live off compounds such as ammonia or sulphur.\n\nA lack of food in what the 700-page report called the \"Stygian realm\" - after the River Styx of the underworld in Greek mythology - meant some microbes might be \"zombies\", or so slow-living as to seem dead.\n\nThe book, \"Carbon in Earth\", said some microbes may live deep below ground and grow and reproduce extremely slowly or perhaps even \"live without dividing for millions to tens of millions of years\".\n\nHazen, who works at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, DC, said the scientists working on the project, which began in 2009, were also studying the possibility that life on Earth might have originated underground.\n\n\"You have everything you need to make life,\" he said, including energy, water and carbon-rich molecules that could have made the underground zone, rather than the surface of the planet, the cradle of the very first life on Earth.\n\nASTEROIDS\n\n\"We think of the deep subsurface as extreme but it's really quite protected - from asteroids or from volcanic eruptions,\" he said. \"Deep sub-surface rocks are a nice, safe haven.\"\n\nAnd the ability of microbes to survive almost indefinitely in rocks on Earth also raises the possibility that rocks from Mars, which had liquid water before Earth, could have seeded our planet with life.\n\nRocks from Mars sometimes land on Earth after asteroid strikes on Mars blow debris into space. \"It's possible that every single cell on Earth is descended from a Martian. That's not crazy science fiction,\" Hazen said.\n\nThe scientists also found viruses deep underground. Unlike those at the surface, those in the energy-poor subsurface typically insert their genes into microbes without seeking to reproduce aggressively, apparently waiting for better conditions.\n\n\"This role of virus as parasite, as mutualist, and as a sharer of information through gene transfer may be a fundamental underpinning of life in the deep subsurface,\" the book suggests.\n\nIt says underground microbial life should be studied more to ensure that plans for deep burial of nuclear waste, or carbon dioxide from power plants as part of a strategy to combat climate change, would not be destabilized by microbes.\n\nAmong other research, the scientists are trying to find out whether there are major sources of oil and gas and methane produced by chemical reactions deep in the Earth, rather than from the well-understood process of ancient surface vegetation being buried and crushed under high pressure.\n\nThey will also study diamonds, which form at high pressures deep in the Earth, beyond the depths of current drilling. And they will try to map where the Earth's carbon is stored, from the crust to the core.\n\n\"A problem is that a huge part of the system is inaccessible,\" Rajdeep Dasgupta, an expert at Rice University in Texas, told Reuters. Part of the study will aim to re-create temperatures and conditions of the deep in the laboratory.\n\n(This story has been corrected to fix name in final paragraph to \"Dasgupta\" from \"Gasdupta\")"}

{"text":"Prehistoric Monster Shrimp; Why We Yawn\n\nDiscovered: sharp-eyed shrimp, when yawning is less contagious, checking in on the climate conference, and a way to figure out if you've got math skills.\n\nMeet a very strange prehistoric predator. Sure, this ancient shrimp looks scary--but only in a Star Wars prequel creature kinda way. It's called the Anomalocaris, which aptly translates from scientific lingo to the appropriate name: \"strange shrimp.\" While scientists have previously found that this prehistoric shrimp's teeth-things may not have been that sharp, it does, apparently, have excellent vision. Specifically, it's \"a gigantic primordial shrimp with pin-sharp vision,\" New Scientist informs, which complement its \"formidable grasping claws, which allowed it to grab its prey and pull it into its mouth.\" Pretty scary indeed for, as one science press release writer wrote, a glorified \"shrimp from hell.\" [New Scientist, University of Adelaide]\n\nSo, how's the latest climate change conference going over in Durban, South Africa? We're ever optimistic about climate conferences, even though they have the seeming tendency to dissolve without much being accomplished. And, today, The New York Times gives a check-up on the huddle between scientists, diplomats and probably the same old policy-makers hashing out the long-term sustainability of humanity on Earth. No biggie. Here's the first thing we learn from The Times: the \"all-encompassing\" treaty that everyone's hoped for for forever, \"appears as elusive as ever.\" And China and the U.S. are still arguing about the same things--like China balking that proposed rules will hinder its industrial prowess. \"[A]t the end of the two-week session the parties usually pull back from the brink and announce an incremental, face-saving deal. This year's talks appear headed for the same sort of conclusion.\" [The New York Times]\n\nYawning gets more exclusive. Another person yawns, then you do too. It's what inexplicably links humanity together. But, today, we're informed by new research finding that people can be more exclusive with their yawning habits. It's not just for every random stranger that we'll contagiously catch the urge to yawn--\"You're more likely to reciprocate yawns that originate from people you are close to than from a stranger,\" The Atlantic informs. Which makes sense. This new study was concocted by a University of Pisa team that watched a whole bunch of participants yawn for a year. Which begs the question: after a certain point did the researchers themselves get immune to yawns contagiousness? Does it work like that? More research is necessary. [The Atlantic, PLoS ONE]\n\nAren't sure if you're any good at math? Well, by now, you should probably have some indication, really.

Although, we'd assume all bets are off on the link between your time estimating prowess and whether should take that advanced class. [Eurekalert"}

In an article called \"the Battle,\" Clynes serves up an amazing skewering of skeptics that the most extreme environmental group might have blushed at publishing. After reading this article, it seems that \"popular science\" consists mainly of initiating a sufficient number of ad hominem attacks against those with whom one disagrees such that one is no longer required to even answer their scientific criticisms.\n\nThe article is a sort of hall-of-fame of every ad hominem attack made on skeptics \u2013 tobacco lawyers, Holocaust Deniers, the Flat Earth Society, oil company funding, and the Koch Brothers all make an appearance.\n\nOf course, not once in the article is the mainstream skeptic scientific position even given. If Clynes is unable to parse it out or understand it, it certainly would have been possible to quote someone who could. But that would seem to defeat the purpose. According to Clynes sources, there is no skeptic position, just a series of \"information missiles\" and Internet memes backed with threats against scientists.\n\nThose who are not actually involved in the details of the debate could be forgiven for believing that skeptics have not real scientific position, since folks like Clynes go out of the way never, ever to write about it. It is the first rule of climate journalism \u2014 never quote a skeptic's scientific position. If you have to discuss a skeptic, quote only the most extreme rhetoric of the political ones like Rush Limbaugh or Marc Morano. Never, ever quote something scientific from a Richard Lindzen or Roy Spencer or even a science-based amateur like Steve McIntyre.\n\nt strikes me that it might be useful at this point to outline a couple of the skeptics' key points, if only to demonstrate how even in a 7 page article on skeptics with closely set type, they never make mainstream publication. Skeptic critiques focus on both climate science process and core beliefs:\n\nThe climate community has become incredibly insular and resistant to criticism and replication of their work. Peer review tends to be by a small group of friends and close associates, and attempts by third parties to replicate their work are impossible, since climate scientists seldom release their key data to outsiders, even when, which is often the case, their work is publicly funded. In particular, climates scientists often get very \"creative\" with statistical methods, and often create results which don't stand up to review by qualified statisticians outside the field.\n\nWhile the world has indeed warmed over the last century, and some of that warming has almost certainly been due to man-made CO2, climate scientists are grossly exaggerating future warming in large part because they are exaggerating positive feedback effects in the climate system. Most of the warming in climate models is not from CO2 directly but from feedback effects, and the evidence for strong positive climate feedback on temperature is very weak as compared to the evidence of greenhouse gas warming (more complete exposition here)\n\nJust this much background on the skeptic position would have gone a really long way towards bringing balance to the article, and explaining certain skeptic positions mentioned in the article that just seem irrational the way Clynes presents them with no context (or relentlessly negative context).\n\nTake, for example, the issue of \"harassment\" via Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and lawsuits. Over and over we must take Michael Mann and other climate scientists at their word that these lawsuits are purely to harass them. But, in fact, the origins of these lawsuits were to try to obtain data from Mann and others that was needed by third parties to replicate their published works, data that was collected in most cases with taxpayer-funded grants for research that was published in journals that nominally required authors to provide all data needed for replication.\n\nThe 2012 Research as Art competition organized by Swansea University in Wales has just concluded its competition and the winners have been announced.

But six weeks later, triclosan suddenly became news after Environmental Defence produced an alarming report, The Trouble With Triclosan: How a Pervasive Anti-bacterial Chemical is Polluting our World and Our Bodies.\n\nThe result: Junk news by rubber ducky, a twisted but masterful case of media manipulation by Rick Smith, Canada's greatest purveyor of exaggerated and distorted science.

New research published June 8 in BioMed Central's open access journal BMC Genomics reveals that the Malaysian parasitic plant Rafflesia cantleyi, with its 50cm diameter flowers, has 'stolen' genes from its host Tetrastigma rafflesiae. Analysis of these genes shows that their functions range from respiration to metabolism, and that some of them have even replaced the parasites own gene activity.\n\nVertical gene transfer is that between parents and their offspring, while horizontal gene transfer is the movement of genes between two different organisms. Bacteria use horizontal gene transfer to exchange resistance to antibiotics. Recent studies have shown that plants can also use horizontal gene transfer, especially parasitic plants and their hosts due to their intimate physical connections.\n\nAustin dims its lights, everyone + science wins. By Philip Bump. This is a map of light pollution in the area around Austin, Texas. Those purple markers (which are clickable at the map's website) indicate how much or how little night sky is visible.\n\nThe contentiousness is over one of the main AGW battlefields: sea level rise (SLR). NC happens to have a large amount of coast line, and has become the US epicenter for this issue.\n\nThe brief version is that this began several years ago when a state agency (Coastal Resource Commission: CRC) neither happened and the project soon jumped the rails, landing into the political agenda ditch.\n\nIn their 2010 report the panel concluded that NC should expect a 39 inch NC coastal communities, putting them on notice that they would need to make BIG changes (elevating roads and bridges, rezoning property, changing flood maps for insurance purposes, etc.).\n\nI compiled and edited their responses to the CRC panel's report into what I called a Critique.\n\nThis 33 page document discussed how real science works, and then went through the 16 page CRC document, essentially line-by-line. In doing so numerous specious claims, unsupported assumptions, and questionable models were pointed out. It wasn't pretty.\n\nIt was during this time that I was solicited to work with a small coastal organization called NC-20 (there are 20 NC coastal counties). Since they were interested in promoting science-based solutions (my agenda) for NC coastal issues, I agreed to be their Science Advisor and a board member (both non-paying, volunteer positions).\n\nInitially we had hopes that the CRC panel's report could be fixed, so we met with the head of the CRC, explained our concerns and handed the Critique to him. He appeared to be receptive and we were optimistic that this important matter could be straightened out. That proved to be an illusion, as none of the CRC panel members ever contacted us about fixing any of their mistakes, or about doing a more balanced assessment. Shame on them.\n\nWe subsequently asked that the Critique be posted on CRC's SLR webpage, but they refused to do so. So much for presenting the facts to NC citizens.\n\nOn the positive side of things, due to our objections, the state did (temporarily anyway) back off from the rules and regulations that they had threatened coastal communities with. [BTW NC-20 is NOT disputing that there will be SLR. The amount of NC SLR is unknown, so a genuine scientific assessment of the NC SLR situation should be undertaken. What such an assessment entails is explained in the Critique's Part 1.]\n\nBy all appearances it seems the CRC assumed that the prestige of their science panel would win the day against the NC-20 upstarts. To help assure that outcome they engaged in an intensive PR campaign to pervert this as a science vs real estate developers issue (with them representing the science side, of course!). Here's a sample of several articles that appeared, and another.\n\nIt was during this time that a CRC Panel member wrote me saying that they agreed with the Critique, and apologized for signing off on the Panel's report! The member stated that the Panel was driven by a few activists, and that everyone else simply went along. This was no surprise, but that an individual had the good conscience to apologize was refreshing.\n\nAnyway, the CRC panel's disinformation campaign didn't work, as we didn't go away. Further, almost everyone who actually read the Critique ended up being on our side. One legislator who liked it asked us to make a presentation to interested state legislators in November 2011. We took that opportunity and it was well received. (See my part.)\n\nNot long after that the CRC panel changed their tactics. Their new plan was to issue an Addendum to their 2010 report, and then claim that all of our concerns were answered. If only that were the case! Their nine page document was prepared with zero contact with us \u2014 which tells you all you need to know about the sincerity that they had in any scientific resolution.\n\nMy response was to follow the successful earlier pattern, so I passed it on to my network of international SLR experts for their commentary. Again they were forthcoming, so I was able to compile and edit a detailed 18 page response that I called a Commentary. We again sent this directly to CRC, asked them to put it on their SLR website \u2014 but posted it ourselves on our own site. [We received no response from CRC, and they have yet to post our document.]\n\nWhat happened next was a BIG surprise.\n\nWe were notified that state legislators were as exasperated as we were with the politicalization of these technical issues \u2014 and that they were going to introduce legislation to stop the agenda promoters! Wow.\n\nIn this case, SLR legislation was drafted by a staffer who has a PhD in oceanography. The main point of the document was that future SLR projections must be made based on extrapolating prior empirical data. In other words, state agencies would not be allowed to create policies that were based on speculations about some possible acceleration!\n\nAs a scientist, I'm always concerned about legislating technical matters. In this case, though, the evidence is quite clear that certain NC agencies have no genuine interest in real science. So what to do? Defunding them is a possibility, but that might be throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Replacing the agency's problem people is another option, but the logistics for that weren't practical. So putting some constraints on these dogmatists has some merit.\n\nNot surprisingly, the backlash was immediate. These evangelists are used to getting their way, and for legislators to actually stand up against their religion was an unexpected development.\n\nIn their anguish they lashed out to anyone they could blame for this roadblock in their crusade \u2014 including yours truly. There were numerous rants (some national) lamenting how \"good science\" was being thwarted by ignorant legislators. Even the Colbert Report had fun with it.\n\nOf course, the reality that the legislators were actually trying to protect NC citizens from promoters masquerading their agendas as science, was rarely reported. Such are the times we are living in, where talk is cheap, and few understand what science really is.\n\nWhat's worse is that thousands of scientists are off the reservation, and have no interest in adhering to scientific principles or procedures. The solution (in my opinion) is that such renegades should have their degrees revoked, just as a priest is defrocked for violating his vows.\n\nIn any case, here is a piece about the NC SLR bill (H819), which includes a link to download a PDF version. Last Friday, there was a brief committee hearing (see interesting video) where this measure was discussed and voted on. It passed unanimously.\n\nAs I understand it, the NC Senate may be voting on this measure this week. I am hoping that they will not be dissuaded from their worthy objective. I wrote this (word limited and edited) NC op-ed to respond to some of the misinformation.\n\nIMO there are parts of this bill that can be improved, and I submitted written suggestions. If you'd like to add your comments, please direct them to the bill's sponsors: Senator David Rouzer and Representative Pat McElraft. (Please copy me.)\n\nSome are predicting that this measure will pass the legislature, and then be vetoed by our lame-duck Governor. As an optimist, I'm hoping that since the Governor no longer needs to cater to the green constituency, that instead she can send a message that real science should be the basis of the state's technical policies. That would give her legacy a major positive boost.\n\nJohn Droz, Jr. is a Physicist & Environmental Advocate; Morehead City, North Carolina\n\nOrdinary baking flour isn't the most electrifying substance, but spilling a box of the stuff yields a jolt of voltage that has scientists excited about their prospects for sensing catastrophic events like earthquakes and industrial accidents.\n\nScientists have known for years that materials including rock, crystals and adhesives like ordinary office tape can produce an electrical signal as they fracture or crack under a load. It's also known that before a granular material can flow, the space it takes up has to enlarge \u2014 think of a traffic jam in which another lane opens up and cars begin to move again. The voltage measured in the flour may be a signal of this 'dilation,' which indicates flow is about to happen.\n\n\"We've known about dilation and that there's an electrical signal when things fail, but nobody has put these two together before,\" says chemical engineer Joseph McCarthy of the University of Pittsburgh, who wasn't involved in the work. \"This is a really, really interesting observation.\"\n\nResearchers at Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J., took a cylindrical tumbler \u2014 the sort used to thoroughly mix powders \u2014 and filled it first with a blend of ground-up acetaminophen and cellulose, and then unbleached white flour. After running a static eliminator over the whole set-up to clear out any static electricity, the researchers fixed a voltage probe to different locations on the tumbler and slowly spun it. Seconds before the powder dumped from one side of the tumbler to another \u2014 essentially right before the avalanche \u2014 the researchers detected an impressive zap of electricity. They report the findings online June 11 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\"Our expectation was that we weren't going to see anything, but we found hundreds of volts from just tumbling flour,\" says Troy Shinbrot, a granular materials specialist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J. \"It seemed very strange, like something was wrong with the flour.\"\n\nPuzzled, he made the setup even simpler: The team built an acrylic box, filled it with flour and slowly tipped it. Again, there was a detectable voltage spike, and in 14 of 23 trials this spike occurred before the flour began to slip, the team reports.\n\nWhile the spike in voltage was often very close in time to start of the grain cascade, the researchers think the voltage is released from the crack that precedes the event. Such a signal might be harnessed for predicting the impending failure of granular materials, McCarthy says, perhaps in huge industry vats, silos or even earthquakes.

Water is one of the Earth's natural resources, continuously being depleted due to pollution and global warming. Urgent steps are consciously taken to stop, or at least slow down, this tragedy; saving rainwater is one of them.\n\nCollecting rainwater is a typical inexpensive way to utilize a free source to help cut down consumption of tap water. The rainwater collected is usually stored in a special system or container built specifically for the purpose of collecting water. This will not only save you money; it will also give you the satisfaction of doing your part in helping conserve natural resources.\n\nWhen collected and utilized through proper ways and procedures, rainwater can even be a possible alternative to drinking water. In a way, it is even a more revitalizing and stimulating type of water, providing natural and contamination-free components that refresh the body and satisfy its needs for hydration. Just as importantly, you get to have a refreshing source of your long showers, or as an accessible means to wash your car.\n\nRainwater collection is a great option to help you cut back on water bills. One of the most expensive water-consuming home chores is lawn irrigation, which ranges from watering the plants to carefully maintaining your garden and landscaped backyard. If you collect rainwater, you can use that instead of tap water to water your collection of myriad flowers and plants. On the chance that you are keeping pets and livestock, this would be a great alternative for them as well.\n\nOne way of rainwater collection is via a groundwater catchment system. Usually this is used by individual households and residences, or by small communities. This procedure directs the water to a special storage container which is then distributed to different channels. That way, all areas of a home or a small community has easy access to rainwater.\n\nAnother type is the roof catchment system wherein rainwater that hits the roof is collected to be treated and filtered at a later time. Rainwater collection is an ideal option to conserve water and make use of free resources. It's a blessing; it would be a great waste not to use it diligently.\n\nWith proper procedures and implementation, commercial rainwater harvesting can be used in businesses, helping companies save considerably on their utility bills.

When magma erupted to form those rocks, scientists say, it also released huge amounts of bromine into the air \u2014 enough to destroy large parts of the ozone layer for several years.\n\n\"We have to be aware of this,\" says Kirstin Kr\u00fcger, a meteorologist at the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of Kiel (GEOMAR) in Germany. \"Large-scale tropical eruptions have the potential to deplete ozone on a big scale.\"\n\nKr\u00fcger presented the work, led by GEOMAR volcanologist Steffen Kutterolf, on June 12 at an American Geophysical Union conference on volcanism and the atmosphere.\n\nThe scientists studied rocks formed during 13 big Central American eruptions over the past 70,000 years. Volcanoes at tropical latitudes are good at injecting the stuff they erupt into the stratosphere, some 16 kilometers up. When elements such as chlorine and bromine reach that high, they help trigger a series of reactions in which ozone's three oxygen atoms break apart and recombine with other atoms.\n\nResearchers have previously measured chlorine coming from volcanoes, such as 1991's Mount Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines, and watched it destroy ozone overhead. But the new work is the first to pin down bromine in such detail. The element is 60 times as efficient as chlorine at destroying ozone, Kr\u00fcger says.\n\nKutterolf and his colleagues collected thousands of rock samples both on and offshore, then analyzed bromine concentrations in tiny glass bubbles that formed within the rocks when the magma erupted out of the volcano. The scientists found enough bromine in the bubbles to suggest that 4,000 to 600,000 tons of bromine came out per eruption.\n\nEnough bromine would have made it to the stratosphere to create at least double the ozone-destroying potential seen at the highest modern-day levels, Kr\u00fcger says. It would have taken three to six years for the chemicals to clear out so that ozone could begin to recover.\n\nIt's still not clear what makes a particular eruption rich in bromine, or whether the bromine would have destroyed ozone locally or globally once aloft.\n\nAbout three-quarters of atmospheric bromine comes from human-made sources like chlorofluorocarbon chemicals, used in refrigeration and other devices. One-quarter is natural, produced by the sea or by volcanoes. \"Wherever it comes from, it will destroy the ozone,\" Kr\u00fcger says. Most human-made ozone-depleting chemicals were phased out by the 1987 Montreal Protocol.\n\nThe new study is an important step in better quantifying bromine from present-day eruptions, says Tamsin Mather, a volcanologist at the University of Oxford in England. \"If we can apply this to other volcanoes,\" she says, \"we can really get a handle on how much bromine is coming out.\"\n\nThere is another scientifically flawed claim of skillful multi-decadal regional climate predictions. This report by the US Department of Agriculture is another failure to assess what the scientific literature actually says with respect to these forecasts, as I summarized in the post\n\nClimate scenarios offer one way to identify and examine the land management challengesposed by climate change. Selecting projections, however, requires careful consideration of the natural resources under study, and where and how they are sensitive to climate. Selection also depends on the robustness of different projections for the resources and geographic area of interest, and possibly on what climate projections are available for a region. Rather than a misguided attempt to identify the \"most accurate\" climate scenario, managers are strongly encouraged to explore variability through the use of multiple climate scenarios. Considering a range of possible future climates facilitates the identification of management strategies to help ensure resilience of natural resource systems across a broad set of potential conditions.Downscaling climate projections increases the spatial resolution of climate information and can make projections more relevant to natural resource managers by allowing decision-makers to better visualize what these different futures imply locally and regionally. The following series of questions describes key concepts that end-users of climate projection products should understand to appropriately interpret downscaled climate projections, including various sources of uncertainty. The selection used for each component of a downscaled climate projection has implications for interpreting the resulting climate scenario. Understanding the merits and limitations of the downscaling method employed is also important since downscaling approaches vary in their dependence on observed data availability, computational requirements, and in resultant uncertainty owed to biases of the method or the spatial scale of the downscaling.\n\nHere is how the report addresses the reliability of the model predictions\n\n7. How reliable are GCM-based climate projections?\n\nThe IPCC concluded that GCMs provide a credible range of quantitative estimatesof future climate change, particularly at global and continental scales andover long time periods (Randall and others 2007). Extensive, rigorous multi-model intercomparisons underpin this conclusion. Over the many generations of climate models and across a range of emissions scenarios, models unanimously and unambiguously project warming over the next 2 decades in response to increasing atmospheric GHG concentrations.\n\ndespite the claim made in the statement in the US Forest Service report\n\nGCMs provide a credible range of quantitative estimates of future climate change, particularly at global and continental scales and over long time periods (Randall and others 2007).\n\nthis does not mean that regional predictions are skillful even if the global and continental scales are accurate [which they have shown not to be as summarized in this weblog post]. That the models and observations show warming over the last 100 years is correct, but this hardly translates into assuming the models have regional skill, as is required for the needs of the US Forest Service.\n\nThe report continues\n\nThe scientific credibility of climate models and resulting projections hinges on several lines of evidence. First, climate models are consistent with well-understood physical processes and physical laws (e.g., conservation of energy and Newton's laws of motion). Second, current-generation climate models demonstrate a significant and increasing ability to simulate recent and past climate dynamics (e.g., Reichler and Kim 2008). Third, extensive comparisons of multiple models reveal that over the past 2 decades different models have converged toward similar results (Reichler and Kim 2008). GCM projections include uncertainties and they represent some climate elements better tha others. For example, confidence in the projections of temperatures is greater than for precipitation projections. As with all models, interpreting and applying results appropriately entails understanding models' strengths and limitations.\n\nActually the climate models only have a part that is basic physics (advection, pressure gradient force and gravity). The rest of the physics (e.g. subgrid scale mixing, cumulus parameterization stable clouds and precipitation, long and short wave radiation, vegetation dynamics, ice sheet dynamics, etc) is parametrized using engineering code which is tuned for individual modules that are developed from just a subset of idealized real world conditions. Those parameterization also often contain a framework of physics (such as conservation of energy) but always have tunable coefficients. I discuss the atmospheric part of climate models in my book\n\nIt is therefore inappropriate to present [mutli-decadal regional climate prediction] results to the impacts community as reflecting [at best] more than a subset of possible future climate risks.\n\nThe authors of the Forest Service Report are ignoring[and not refuting] evidence that documents a lack of ability to simulate recent and past climate dynamics.\n\n3. The report than writes\n\nThird, extensive comparisons of multiple models reveal that over the past 2 decades different models have converged toward similar results (Reichler and Kim 2008).\n\nModel agreement is not a test of the accuracy of the models at replicating reality. Real world comparisons must be the basis for hypothesis testing (which is what models are). In this context, the multi-decadal climate models are not even accurately predicting in hindcast climate statistics over the last few decades, much less CHANGES in these statistics.\n\nThe authors of the report are making the mistake of assuming that intermodel agreement increases confidence in the model skill to accurately predict real world regional climate.\n\nThe Bottom Line Message\n\nUsers of these model results by the US Forest Service community are being misled into the actual value of the climate projections. The Forest Service climate projection FAQ is scientifically flawed.\n\nAquaponics, a portmanteau of the two words namely aquaculture and hydroponics, works on greenhouse quasi combination in which large premium quality vegetables and herbs are cultivated on a yearly basis, concurrently producing hefty amount of fish. Undertaking well-designed planning, apparatus and management, aquaponics might be utilized to supplement your food requirements. It can also be morphed into a money-spinning business.\n\nThis technology has two major parts, as has been mentioned already, the aquaculture which involves the rearing of aquatic animals and the hydroponics which involves the growing of plants. Understanding better how it can be useful to fulfill and supplement your food needs, its basic function must be identified with properly.\n\nThe remains of aquatic effluents in the fish tanks as a result of uneaten feed left by fish accumulates in the water. Such effluent-enriched water turns out to be lethal for the aquatic animals in high proportions but, on the other hand, these effluents are dynamic nutrients necessary for plant's growth.\n\nAlthough this whole system consists of two major parts, some additional sub-systems are also attached to it in order to perform some required tasks, for instance, the effectual elimination of solid wastes, addition of base for the neutralization of acids, or upholding oxygenation of water. Rearing tank, biofilter, sump, solids removal etc. are some of the subsystems.\n\nDepending upon the design and the cost of a whole system, the sub-units like sump, solids removal etc may be coalesced into one unit which helps to stop the water from flowing straight from the aquaculture to the hydroponics. This food supplement system is highly advantageous in more than one term. Apart from its basic advantage of providing fresh vegetables and fish, it is both eco-friendly and affordable. As far as its eco-friendliness is concerned, it helps to conserve water through the constant re-use and recycling.\n\nAnother advantage involves the complete removal of solid wastes disposal from concentrated aquaculture.\n\nIn terms of availability and affordability, it requires a small space, and \"food miles\" are minimized by constructing small efficacious commercial as well as domestic installations near marketplace. Today, a large amount of money is being earned through this business. Many responsible families have praised its enriched advantages for fulfilling their primary food needs. The principal benefit it provides is the simultaneous organic fertilization of different plants with natural and genuine fish emulsion.

{"text":"NASA climate researchers have discovered animal life deep below the Pine Island Glacier Ice Shelf in Antarctica. The researchers drilled a hole six-hundred feet deep and eight inches wide into the glacial ice sheet about twelve miles from the open ocean. When they lowered a camera below the ice sheet, the scientists were surprised to see a Lyssianasid amphipod crustacean swim up and park on the cable. The researchers were only expecting to find microbial life under the ice sheet this far in from the open ocean. It is unknown what the primary energy source for animals living here could be. The presence of a three-inch amphipod, however, suggests a much more elaborate and dynamic ecosystem than hypothesized in this poorly understood habitat. (DSN has a video of the amphipod)\n\nLimnoriid isopods, commonly called gribble worms for some reason (they neither are, nor resemble worms), have a ravenous appetite for wood. This is not unusual among arthropods; many diverse groups including termites, millipedes, and squat lobsters are capable of digesting woody plant matter. However, all these creatures process the wood with the aid of gut-dwelling symbiotic bacteria. A new study finds that the Limnoriid isopod, Limnoria quadripunctata is special in that it doesn't rely on bacteria-produced catalysts to break down wood, but rather has the necessary glycosyl hydrolase enzymes incorporated into its genome. These enzymes are evolutionarily related to similar proteins found in arthropods, but their derived function for wood digestion in Limnoriid isopods is completely novel. The researchers, or their over-excitable university PR department, think the study of these enzymes could aid in bio fuel synthesis.\n\nThe gemone of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, has been sequenced. This is the first Hemipteran (true bug) genome and will provide clues about the evolutionary history of certain hexapod groups. This new genome could also help agriculturalists develop new techniques to control aphid pests and the spread of aphid-borne plant viruses. Researchers are also interested in the pea aphid's, apparently, scaled down immune response system and their ability to easily switch specialization from one plant species to another.\n\nThe BBC is presenting an article and series of films from a recent University of Aberdeen research expedition. The films are shot between 5.5 kilometers and 10 kilometers in depth and feature snailfish, decapod shrimp, isopods, and amphipods as they scavenge on a bait bag. The videos are narrated by Dr. Alan Jamieson, and he shares some neat insights about deep sea life.\n\nI am personally surprised at the ridiculous swarms of amphipods in the 9 km and 10 km videos. I did not think deep sea life was that dense except around vents and seeps. They don't say how long the bait bag was there before the film starts, and it could have been down there for hours attracting every amphipod in a 100 m radius. However, a quick check of the literature reveals that these near-bottom deep-sea amphipod swarms have been observed near vents as well as in open abyssal plains. Pelagic swarming is not typically a characteristic attributed to deep sea crustaceans and its ecological significance is unknown.\n\nA swarm of undescribed paradaliscid amphipods, photographed from the submersible Alvin near a deep sea vent in the East Pacific Rise (Dover et al., 1992).\n\nThere is an interesting anecdote which claims that the amphipod crustacean genus, Phronima, served as the inspiration for the alien queen first seen in James Cameron's, \"Aliens.\"\n\nPhoto: P\u00e5l Abrahamsen\n\nThe story seems to originate from David Attenborough's narration in the \"Blue Planet\" documentary (Skip to 3:25 in this video for the scene in question). Some people around the web rebut this, stating that the original alien design was based on a painting by artist H. R. Giger. This seems to be the case as far as the original \"soldier\" alien morph seen in \"Alien\" (1979) is concerned. It is much more likely that Phronima actually influenced the design of the queen alien morph, seen in \"Aliens\" (1986).\n\nI've tried to contact someone at the special effects company, Stan Winston Studios, but they seem to be hard to get a hold of if you are not the producer of a multi-hundred-million dollar blockbuster. Instead, lets talk a little about Phronima, which is an awesome animal regardless of whether or not it was the inspiration for the alien queen."}

{"text":"Science and technology reached new heights and depths in 2012, thanks to human daredevils willing to risk life and limb to explore both the Earth's stratosphere and its deepest undersea trench. The success of both feats hinged not only on the cutting-edge gear that protected the men from either thin air or crushing pressure, but also on clever thinking to reach their destinations.\n\nOn October 14 Austrian Felix Baumgartner broke the 50-year-old mark for highest-ever skydive after leaping from a balloon nearly 39 kilometers above Earth's surface, traveling at supersonic speeds before landing in southeastern New Mexico. During his 20-minute descent Baumgartner's top speed reached 1,342.8 kilometers per hour, making him the first skydiver to break the sound barrier, which is 1,236 kilometers per hour at sea level. Baumgartner's mission also set the record for highest-ever manned balloon flight.\n\nBaumgartner's full-pressure suit included a control mechanism designed to adjust pressure at different altitudes, protecting him from symptoms of decompression sickness during his rapid descent. The balloon that took Baumgartner to the apex of his journey was made of a polyethylene film, only 0.02 millimeter thick, that could enclose a voume of nearly 850,000 cubic meters. Baumgartner's equipment included main and emergency parachutes, along with a drogue stabilization chute to help him recover from an uncontrollable spin. The main and reserve chutes were designed to open at speeds of up to 280 kilometers per hour.\n\nAt the other extreme, filmmaker James Cameron in March became the first solo aquanaut to reach the deepest recess of the Mariana Trench, touching down at the Challenger Deep site about 11 kilometers below the surface of the Pacific Ocean. Cameron, who directed the first two Terminator movies as well as Titanic and Avatar, piloted his DEEPSEA CHALLENGER submersible on the seven-hour round-trip, spending about three hours at the deepest spot on the planet's crust to collect samples for marine biological, microbiological, astrobiological, marine geologic and geophysical research.\n\nThe DEEPSEA CHALLENGER included several features designed to aid Cameron on his expedition, including a sphere-shaped pressurized cockpit that collected moisture from Cameron's exhaled breath and sweat into a plastic bag. Cameron could have consumed this concoction if he had run low on drinking water. About 70 percent of the CHALLENGER's volume was taken up by syntactic foam made from millions of hollow glass microspheres suspended in an epoxy resin, making the vessel's skin low in density but extremely strong. \u2014Larry Greenemeier\n\nFYI: The comment about ovarian stem cells (\" If confirmed, the finding would overturn the long-held notion that women are not born with all the eggs they will ever have.\") should be corrected.

Unless, of course, the guy predicted that he would cause the big storm by jumping out of the plane. There was plenty of real science this year; why demean it by implying that newsworthiness is somehow comparable.\n\nLooks like we've got some grumpy-pants saying these stories aren't science. If you think Baumgardner just jumped out of a balloon from that altitude without doing some physics beforehand, you are dead wrong (and he would be dead-dead) and I think any meteorologist would say there is plenty of science behind the weather. Just because the stories didn't go into great detail doesn't mean there isn't science there. Take a chill pill.\n\nSorry but to put a huricane over the discovery of the Higgs Boson is laughable at best. It doesn't even mention CERN for 'gods' sake.\n\nBesides it was the European weather center that first predicted superstorm Sandy would hit New York. While the main US forecasting model GFS had it going for the Atlantic untill days later. Such an early prediction by ECMWF is what is really impressive science here. Only in things like Star Trek did we imagine humans one day being able to so accurately being able to predict a storm. Certain US forecasters have called for a noble prize for the European Weather Center for this breakthough of early predictions.\n\nAnd what about the discovery of a planet at Alpha Centaury by ESO the European Southern Observatory for big science of the year. A planet at the closest star system to earth. Even NASA labeled this the greatest astronomical discovory in a decade. Not to mention all the other planets confirmed with HARPS this year even in the habitable zone of some stars.\n\nThe biggest science story of 2012 has yet to happen.That is of course that the World is coming to an end on 12-21-12 is a hoax.Hopefully all the writers and scientist predicting this will be out of a job.Publishing the 10 top stories of 2012 before the end of the year is jumping the gun a bit isn't it.As for the Sandy hurricane,the statement that it the first to do so coming from the south and then turning west and hitting the eastern shoreline is a untrue.Although it was a big storm,it was still only a Category 1 hurricane when it came ashore.The reason there was so much damage was because there were so many buildings built directly on or nearby the shore that weren't designed to survive a hurricane.There have been many other storms with a much greater loss of life.In fact the tornadoes that hit earlier in year the took many more lives.Don't get me wrong the loss of life anywhere is terrible.I feel for the families that lost kin,friends,and property.\n\nWhat about the fiscal cliff?

Then there is the unnatural and theoretically awkward conventional Planck mass, which bears no resemblance to anything in nature.\n\nIs it reasonable to just say: \"Well, we have to go to yet higher energies\", and make that dodge sound credible by saying that 'we expected this' when in fact the pre-LHC hype about what would be found was laid on thick and the present non-results were called \"The Nightmare Scenario\"?\n\nThe relevant question is: Do we keep adding epicycles to the faltering old paradigm of particle physics\/cosmology, or do we begin the search for a revolutionary new paradigm that can make definitive predictions, that can be (and has been) experimentally verified, and that can provide simple and natural answers to fundamental problems?\n\nHalf of these aren't even \"science\", much less \"top ten science\"... What has obamacare, sandy, daredevil stunts have to do with science? Some of the other ones are also technology\/engineering (sorry wolowitz), not science. Media has dumbed down science so much that even a publication calling itself \"scientific american\" doesn't know or care about what science is.\n\nInteresting how many people misread this as to be Top 10 Science Discoveries list although it was clearly explained in the first sentence that it is a list of Top 10 Stories in the news that show how science and society are intertwined.\n\nThe public spent 10 billion dollars on the LHC and so far all they got in return was a back-of-the-cereal-box \"Higgs Mechanism\" that purports to explain how particles get their masses (the substandard model of particle physics otherwise treats subatomic particles as massless!!!).\n\nOn the bright side, the unfolding \"Nightmare Scenario\" tells anyone with an open and questioning mind that a whole new unified paradigm for understanding the cosmos is very badly needed.\n\nTherefore, in the end the LHC may be worth the money and the effort, although not in the way true believers in the substandard paradigm had hoped"}

{"text":"Recent Interesting Science Articles (July 2012)\n\nJuly 2012 has been a less awesome, insofar as science articles go. I guess things do slow down in the summer.\n\nThis isn't the first article about empathy for humans as displayed in dogs that has appeared in this blog, and it won't be the last! This article from The Economist covers experiments performed to see if dogs can really perform actions out of empathy for the perceived suffering in humans, as opposed to acting out of curiosity. This was done by observing the behavior of dogs when alternately encountering a human crying and exhibiting other signs of distress or merely humming. They also alternated between using a trusted human for the dogs and a complete stranger. The results were that the dogs could indeed recognize distress in humans and react by whining, nuzzling, licking, and fetching toys for the human perceived to be suffering. They did this to the suffering human even if he or she was a stranger and their master was in the same room, indicating that it was the comfort of the suffering human that they sought rather than their own comfort.\n\nJust last month I had an article talking about how more modern pop music is getting sadder and sadder while becoming more emotionally ambiguous. This month I have a new article from Reuters making a different claim: that pop music is getting louder and louder, while at the same time becoming less diverse with a more limited variety of sounds. They're not directly contradictory but they are odds enough that the two teams should probably have a good long discussion with each other about just what is going on.\n\nThis next one is cheating a bit as it's more of a demonstration video than a science article. Its about the color shifting abilities of a species of cuttlefish in Australia, Sepia plangon. Nothing new, you say? Except that this one is not only capable of shifting its colors, it can apparently shift each side of its body to a different color scheme, in this case, mimicking a female with half of its body and a male with the other half. This demonstrates not only as astounding level of control over its own colors but also an awareness of just who is looking at it from each direction.\n\nEver wondered while walking in the rain if it would be more effective to run through the rain or walk steadily through it to minimize wetness. I did and judging by the contents of this Washington Postarticle, I'm not the only one. Intuitively, running is better to minimize your time spent in the rain but at the same as you travel fast, you run into more raindrops in your path. Walking steadily increases your exposure time, but you present a small target and you don't walk into raindrops. The paper summarized in this article concludes that for most cases, running is best but the true answer really depends on your body shape, the direction of the rainfall (vertically or at a lateral angle), the angle of the path you are traveling across and so forth. It is truly a profound topic.\n\nFinally, no rundown would be complete without the biggest scientific news of the month: the confirmation of existence of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider. There are many articles about it on the web but I'm partial to this one from the BBC. There are no practical applications for this but it is pretty solid confirmation of the Standard Model of physics."}

{"text":"Oh the simple mushroom. Apparently it really is magical. A research team from Yale recently discovered a mushroom that eats plastic! That's right, one of the biggest burdens on us and the environment can be eliminated by a simple mushroom. This can truly be huge. It is hard to convey the detriment to the world caused by plastics. This is just another example of why we next to invest more into education and conservation of the environment. As smart as we like to think we are, Mother Nature has been doing this for a lot longer and we cannot match her skills. Happy Friday everyone!\n\nThe function that fungi serves in the ecosystem is powerful and even spiritual - fungi transition dead matter back into useful nutrients that will support and give rise to new life. They are the great recyclers of the Earth and return life from death."}
{"text":"Here's the mystery: Why, you probably have been wondering, are\nyoung people today so dumb\u2014especially compared to people of earlier\ngenerations? After all, when those of us in The Middle Years (or\neven older) were in our teens and twenties, we knew utterly\neverything, whereas the Youth of Today know almost nothing. This\nholds true despite the fact that they can look up anything almost\ninstantly, whereas those of us who came along before wireless\nInternet access had to acquire knowledge by any number of arduous\nmeans, including walking to the library or even, if all else\nfailed, asking an Old Person for help.\n\nYou could chalk up this perceived state of affairs to the habit\npeople have of thinking everything was better back when they were\nyoung, except for one depressing fact. During the past four decades\neducation spending per pupil has shot up, class sizes have shrunk,\nand yet test scores have stayed flatter than a 10-cent pancake.\n\nWhat gives?\n\nFinally we know the answer. Earlier this month scientists\nannounced three new elements had been\nnamed: Darmstadtium, Roentgenium,\nand Copernicium. The elements are man-made and can exist\nonly under laboratory conditions. This is is like\nNewton's apple: It explains so much.\n\nBack in your humble servant's school days, the Periodic Table\nhad only 11 elements: hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, metal\n(magnetic), metal (non-magnetic), plastic, and I forget the other\nthree. Chemistry class consisted of Mr. Storck dropping\nthings into a cup of liquid nitrogen and smashing them with his\nshoe. Biology, taught by Mr. Haas, consisted of watching film\nstrips from the 1950s about people with elephantiasis and guinea\nworm. Nobody took physics because it hadn't been invented yet.\n\n(Film strips, by the way, were a cutting-edge multimedia\npedagogical tool that were going to revolutionize classroom\ninstruction and turn every child into a rocket scientist. Just like\nlaptops and tablet PCs are doing today!)\n\nPoint is, back then nobody learned much science because\nthere was not much to learn. Nobody had heard of quarks or pulsars\nor gene sequencing or dark matter\u2014let alone later discoveries like\nCylons, Ferengi, or Decepticons. (It was a simpler time,\nbut people were happy then.) So passing your science test was a\nbreeze. Science fairs? Same deal. Build\na papier-mache volcano, toss in some baking powder and\nvinegar, and collect your gold star. Easy-peasy.\n\nNowadays, they won't even let you into the science fair unless\nyour research into Calvin-Benson cycle catalysts for artificial\nphotosynthesis is drawing venture-capital offers from\nprivate-equity firms.\n\nSame for history: They just keep making more of it. For the WWII\ngeneration, the Great Depression wasn't history, it was current\nevents. They didn't have to learn about the civil-rights movement\nor Vietnam or Watergate or Reaganomics because none of that had\nhappened yet. Today's pupils not only have to learn all that more\nrecent history, they will soon be learning the history of 9\/11, the\nIraq War, and the Obama administration. And the cohort after\nthat? Good luck to them, because they're going to need it.\n\nDitto English. Great writers from Clive Cussler to\nDanielle Steele keep cranking out new masterpieces. Every year the\nmajor dictionary publishers add new words (retweet,\ntinfoil hat, cryonaut) and eliminate obsolete ones (aerodrome,\ncassette tape, literacy). Even the rules of grammar keep changing,\nas The Onion reported a while back: \"The U.S. Grammar\nGuild Monday announced that no more will traditional grammar rules\nEnglish follow. Instead there will a new form of organizing\nsentences be.\"\n\n had this conversation in college with my\nthermodynamics professor. He pointed out that the things we were\ngetting taught as undergraduates were what they were teaching him\nin grad school. The body of human knowledge expands, and what you\nhave to know to be even marginally competent in a field expands\nwith it. It's why few engineers graduate in 4 years anymore.\n\nThere used to be something called a \"Renaissance Man\" this was a\nperson who was an expert (in the true sense of the word) in several\nfields - this was very possible - during the Renaissance. Today it\nwould be virtually impossible to know everything there is to know\nin Physics and Zoology and Mathematics and Chemistry and History\nand .....\n\nThe library at Alexandria was burned several times, the last\ntime by the Muslim caliph Umar, who famously remarked, when told\nthat his troops were about to burn the books in the library, \"If\nthe books contain wisdom, the Qur'an contains all the wisdom we\nrequire, and their wisdom is not needed; if the books do not\ncontain wisdom, they are not needed. Hence, let it burn.\"\n\nSkewing the historical record and misrepresenting facts in a\n\"plausible\" way is exaclty what different groups do from the left\nand the right to promote a political agenda or cultural\/social\nideology. It is despicable.\n\nThe problem with education, and I am saying this as a former\neducator, is that our current system tells students what to think,\nnot how to think.\n\nReasoning and logic skills are all that are needed to be able to\ntackle various topics and become a \"Renaissance Man.\" The problem\nis not that we now have too much knowledge, the problem is that\nstudents aren't being taught critical thinking.\n\nThat is why reading skills are in the toilet, the amount of\ncritical thinking skills needed to comprehend what one reads and be\nable to read difficult material is very high. But, once you can\nread well, the world is at your fingertips.\n\nThat said, my husband is an engineer and I do think that as an\nundergrad he did recieve a great education. His problem solving\nskills are innate, but he was also challenged to further develop\nhis critical thinking skills in his classes.\n\nIn the past, engineers learned drafting and moving into the\ncomputer age -- CAD\/CAM.\n\nBut by the time I was in school in the late 80s, those courses\nhad all been crammed into one \"Engineering Graphics\" course. Those\nkind of skills were handled by techs -- if you needed to learn\nthem, you learned them on the job.\n\nHowever, the organization of the material often improves as time\ngoes on so that it's easier to learn quickly.\n\nFor instance, I always like to remind students that the stuff we\ndo in chapter 2 on limits actually was invented a couple of\ncenturies after the stuff in chapter 3 on derivatives. Yet the way\nwe present it makes it appear that you learn limits first and then\nderivatives, which is a much better way to learn it than whatever\nthey did in the 1700s before Cauchy cleaned up Newton's mess.\n\nIt amuses me that you teach students. How do you deal with\ntrying to not bore them to death, which must be a real problem for\nyou? The last thing you need, I imagine, is an involuntary\nmanslaughter charge.\n\nThis is my case for expanding med school to 5 years, or possibly\nintegrating it into undergrad. The current edition of Robbins\nPathological Basis of Disease is almost twice as thick as the\nedition in 2000-2001.\n\nDo that and you will be an idiot PA or NP following cook book\nmedicine and without the ability to think through pathology and\npathophysiology. Learn all you can your first two years. Plus,\nacing Step 1 is worth something like a few million dollars in\ndifferential pay and it is all about the first two years.\n\nWe could do away with undergrad requirements like the Europeans\nand Indians.\n\nThere's some truth to that, but it doesn't explain everything. I\nmean, Maxwell was doing his work in the mid-1800s, but I still\ncouldn't really grasp most of what he was doing despite having\nabout 150 years on him. The idea that that's supposed to be\nstrictly undergrad stuff is not comforting.\n\nStill, there's this: arXiv vs. snarXiv\nEven if you are very up on your science, it's still really damn\ndifficult to even know what a real physics paper might be titled\nthese days...\n\nThe point is that no one in the time of Maxwell could\nunderstand what Maxwell was doing. Today, undergrads can get a\nfairly good understanding of EM from Maxwell's equations. Hell, a\ngood undergraduate physics curriculum will almost certainly expose\nstudents to a covariant field tensor formulation derived from\nspecial relativity, something Maxwell himself could not have\nunderstood.\n\nI liked the website. Having a PhD in physics only helps a bit\nhere, as all of the topics are way outside my little world of\ncondensed matter. You can get some insight, though. Clearly a paper\ntitled \"a calculable formulation of quantum gravity\" would be a\npretty big deal and I'd likely have heard of it looking through\nscience news articles. Thus, not an article.\n\nEngineering should take three to four years, with some of that\ntime being trained within the career. The publicly funded higher\neducation system has incentives to NOT make educations in things\nlike engineering be very efficient. They load it up with excessive\n\"liberal\" interdisciplinary requirements and far, far, far too much\nmathematical theory that doesn't apply to a career of the\napplication of engineering.\n\nI'm going to disagree with you there. In my school, you spent\nyour freshman year in \"Freshman Engineering\" where they taught you\nhow to program and some problem solving skills. You didn't start on\nyour field specific engineering courses until your sophomore\nyear.\n\nOn top of that, I did a co-op program for 5 semesters, adding a\nyear onto my graduation date. So it took me 5 years to get my\nundergrad and one year of that was spent in courses not associated\nwith my field.\nNot to mention, I entered undergrad with 22 hours of liberal arts\ncredits, so I should have been a semester and half ahead.\n\nI still think I should have had another two semesters of\nundergrad to really know what I was doing.\n\nMathematical theory is extremely important. They don't teach you\nenough theory, IMO. If you don't understand the physical\nimplications of the operations you're performing, then you don't\nknow what you're doing - you're doing it because that's what\nsomeone\/the textbook told you to do. No real understanding\nthere.\n\nExcept for Material and Chemical Engineers, they need that B.S.\nin Chemistry. :^)\n\nActually, my wife struggles a bit in Engineering with her MS in\nPhysics. In the first year or two of Engineering, one learns\nsimplifying assumptions that they do not teach in Physics (e.g.\nconstrain the boundary conditions so you can make the mathematical\nmodel linear like the PI model of the transistor for instance)\n\nI got my engineering degree 10 years ago, and now the same\nprogram takes 10 fewer hours to obtain a degree. A lot of the \"old\"\nengineering curriculum is obsolete. There used to be a few classes\nof manual drafting required, now there are none.\n\nI thought the article was funny, but it still doesn't address\nthe fact that our public school system is churning out a bunch of\nignorant, lazy kids.\n\nSonny, its 10 cent flapjack. Which in today's money is\n23.52$.\nIn a pinch, you can use griddle cake. back in Fresno, we called 'em\nsqurelly jacks. That now was good eating. back than, you could live\noff the land, or more precisely, the road. plenty of\nfiddles....\n\nIs there a problem here? \"the real problem (parenthetical\nstatement separated by commas) isn't that public education has\nfailed (second clause connected by a comma and but) that there's\ntoo much too learn (typos are not grammatical mistakes).\n\n\".\"\n\ntells me that the writer has absolutely no clue about modern\nmathematical research.\n\nYes, there is! How else would professors pad their paychecks?\nFor biz calc, my university uses a \"specialized\" edition. Its a\nstandard calc book with about fifteen pages inserted. It costs\nabout $40 more than the regular book and can only be purchased at\nthe school bookstore.\n\nIt's probably not the professors who get the extra cash. It goes\ninto the university's slush fund operating\nrevenue.\n\nI've never written a textbook, but from what I hear the author\nis lucky to get $5 royalty from a $100 text. Outside of the hugely\npopular calculus and physics books, that's not going to add up to\nmuch.\n\nIn one of my undergrad history classes, the professor's book was\nrequired reading. On the last day of class, he passed around a\nstack of $1 bills and told everyone to take one. After we all had\none he said, \"I don't want to profit all of my students for a\nrequired text book, so I gave you all back my royalty for the book.\nIt was a $25 book, IIRC.\n\nActually the reason kids are getting dumber is because they are\nnow using the Welfare system or socialized system of education.\nWhats that? The teacher requires everyone to get into groups of\nfour and each group will share the grade. The teacher organizes the\ngroups by making sure there is at least one smart kid per group\nthat way the lesser kids will get the same grade as the smart kid\nand the teacher can claim across the board improvement when in\nreality the only kid learning is the smart one because the others\nrely on the smart kids work just like in a welfare society. This is\nhappening to my sisters kid and my friends kids that are in\ndifferent schools and the smart kids know what is going on and it's\nmaking them conservative because they now understand the futility\nof shared work, money etc...\n\nIs it possible, though, that some things become easier to\nunderstand over time, because of cultural saturation?\n\nThey say that the theory of relativity was extraordinarily\ndifficult for even professional physicists to conceptualize when it\nwas new, but in 2011 it doesn't seem all that\nunstraightforward.\n\nI bet if you went back in time and tried to explain the laws of\nthermodynamics to Aristotle, he'd be all like, \"Huh whaaaaaaaaa?\"\nBut in 2011 you can explain them pretty easily to any bright 5th\ngrader.\n\nI'm pretty sure the relativity thing was pretty apocryphal.\nLorentz and Poincare were damned close to finishing special\nrelativity before Einstein got there. And it's a remarkably\nstraightforward and easy to understand theory which explained a lot\nof recent experimental results. I don't think any physicists found\nit exceptionally difficult; their problems with it were more\nideological than anything.\n\nNow, general relativity is any entirely different matter. No one\nelse was even thinking about this at the time of Einstein. And it\nrequired mathematics with which most physicists were not familiar.\nSo it would be extremely difficult. Though I'd still argue that\nmost physicists find GR to be a fairly difficult subject. But maybe\nthat's only us poor schleps who don't do all the sexy particle and\ncosmology work.\n\nA specific result of general relativity (time dilation due to\nproximity to a massive object) comes into play when designing GPS\nsystems, etc. All an engineer has to do is apply a well-known\nformula to correct for these effects. That doesn't necessitate an\nunderstanding of the basic principles of GR.\n\nHinkle seems to think he was making a point here, but he\ncompletely misses the point that there is a difference between the\naccumulation of knowledge and that of being able to think in an\nanalytical manner. So yes children today are \"dumber\" or in other\nwords have not had that foundation of analytical thinking paired\nwith the ability to communicate that is necessary to learn at a\nhigher level.\n\nwhat evidence do you have that critical thinking is now worse?\nand worse than when? 50 years ago? 20? 1000? (my guess is, it is\nworse than the \"good ol days\")\ni hear that bs spouted all the time, and when it comes time to\njustify it, the only answers i get are variations of \"just look\naround, it is obvious!\"\n\nexcluding slaves, what about excluding women? chinamen? who is\nthe population then, and who is the population now? how have the\ntests changed? as someone who has a background in psychological\ntesting, and is currently an SAT instructor (which is a moderately\ndirect descendant of the military's version of Stanford-Binet), i\nam familiar with the myriad variables that must be accounted for\nbefore conclusions can be drawn.\n\nYour literacy stats are comparing apples to oranges. Look at the\nbreakdown of who was taking the military literacy tests then and\nnow.\nthen look up the concept of selection bias.\n\nconsidering all the hoaxes, hysterias, panics and other assorted\nb.s. even our most respected and right thinking forefathers bought\ninto, i would dare say the changes in critical thinking are\nlateral, not up or down.\n\nHmmm, could that have anything to do with a larger number of\nnon-native speakers?\n\nMr Hinkle, may I recommend googling Simpson's Paradox. Aggregate\nresults without demographic breakdown are meaningless. Every time\nthere is an aggregate result of scores going down, it turns out\nthat all the individual ethnic groups have scores going up.\n\nI've pointed out numerous problems with their education articles\nand linked to facty, academic stuff. It's pointless. They have\ntheir agenda, truth be damned. By they, I mean everyone but Bailey\nand Cavanaugh.\n\nStrange, too. I always get the feeling that the idea that people\nare getting dumber comes from a basic desire to say: \"See! Ed\nDepartment fucked things up. See!\" It should be clear that kids\ntoday know at least as much, if not more, than their predecessors.\nThe information economy necessitates that. Instead of making up\nfacts to fit a story, perhaps we could just say that this is\nanother success story of the individual (read - kid who goes\nthrough the public school system) triumphing over the state. Need\nnot be contrary to over favorite political beliefs.\n\nIs it so unreasonable to expect that they will know that proper\nnouns and pronouns must be capitalized? Or that words at the start\nof a sentence must be capitalized too? You don't really need 11\nPhDs in physics to know that.\n\nHang on a minute \"I saw him\": the pronoun referring to yourself\nis not capitalized? And I didn't say all pronouns are\ncapitalized (go back and read the sentence please). D- for your\ninattention.\n\nI've just come from a long argument with some idiot who didn't\nseem to know how to use his shift key and... kept adding dramatic\nellipses in the middle of every... sentence for no good reason. The\nfuck is that all about? And he was much more overkill than\nthat.\n\nAnd I've never taken a physics course in my life. I'm not quite\nsure what your saying there. I just wish people could learn basic\npunctuation and capitalization rules. Especially if they're going\nto call me a \"fool\" and an \"idiot\". Yeah, the bastard did that too.\nBastard.Marc Urbach said in an ajc.com post, Get Schooled, that children\nneed better standards\u2026.I think he is correct... But allow me to\nexpose, in no uncertain terms, a close kept secret among academics,\ni.e. any average child, African American included, if subjected to\nthe proper discipline and standards, will become nothing less than\na straight A student.\n\nMr. Urbach, a teacher at Georgia State University, is admitting\nthat when students receive straight A's in public schools or higher\neducation, it is a matter of the mechanical rather than cerebral.\nThe vast majority of people mistakenly believe it's the opposite;\nthat's an oppressive error. But via the mechanical grind in public\nschools, the brain is able to adapt to greater mechanical\nexpectations in higher education.\n\nI think if academic and others were confident enough to expose\nthis secret etc in no uncertain terms to undisciplined children and\nparents, they may be inclined to go through the mechanical grind to\nreceive straight A's in public schools which will undoubtedly\nprepare them to take on the rigorous mechanical grind of higher\neducation.\n\nThis article might explain why it is hard to become a top-tier\nscientist; it does not explain why high-school graduates cannot\ncalculate change, or why 2 out of 3 college seniors in America fail\nto reach enough \"math proficiency\" to calculate and compare the\nprice per ounce of two products.\n\nA simpler theory, known to most Reason Readers, does explain the\ndecay of education: the socialist calculation problem. Markets and\nmarket prices are essential to discover what customers want and how\nto provide it efficiently. Lacking those basic economic features,\nschools cannot effectively compute what they should be doing, nor\nhow to do it.\n\nThank you, my point exactly: you don't need to know all the new\nadvances in science to know when to use a capital letter. I know\nrelatively little about new scientific developments but I know how\nto string a freakin' coherent sentence together."}
{"text":"February 20, 2012\n\nTime manifests as a fractal structure. The smallest unit of time is also the smallest unit of matter. Every atom has a frequency, a cyclic tone that represents one unit of time. Each cycle or unit of time takes input compares it to memory and outputs the result. This memory is not a static pattern, but is dynamic, vibrating in sync with the environmental variables. If the pattern of the input matches the pattern stored in memory, the field doesn't react, it continues to vibrate normally, but if the input doesn't match what is anticipated by memory, a perturbence is created in the field. Like a stone pitched in a pond, the waves spread out through the system, carrying information about the mismatch to all points. Not only is the location of the mismatch clearly stated by the arc of the wave, but the \"shape\" of the mismatch is carried by the shape of the wave. In this way, the whole keeps track of its units in real time.\n\nWhat makes time a fractal is that this cycle of input, comparison and output is repeated throughout biological systems, regardless of scale or implementation. All cells, organs, creatures, social organizations and ecosystems, use this fundamental process to interact with their environment. The fundamental vibrations are in harmony from atoms all the way up to galaxies and beyond.\n\nFor those who want a more scientific explanation, The Fractal Topology of Time,\n\nA dissertation defense by Kerri Welch at the California Institute of Integral Studies, Feb. 12, 2010.\n\nFebruary 14, 2012\n\nEvery handful of living topsoil contains more microorganisms than there are human beings on Earth. All those billions of creatures aren't living isolated existences, but are organized into colonies. That is they are organized into cooperating and communicating networks that share nutrients and information.\n\nThese are the ancient ones, the oldest and most stable products of evolution. They were here first, before animals, plants or any multicellular creatures.\n\nThese microorganisms represent the primordial intelligence that learns and builds on what it knows about itself, in an organized, purposeful, goal oriented progression. And it starts right here with the tiny creatures that understand information processing, communication networks and symbiosis.\n\nFebruary 8, 2012\n\nMy sweetheart and i like to do jigsaw puzzles. Putting one together is satisfying on several levels. We have fun.\n\nI get an extra kick out of seeing the pieces as packets of information, also on different levels. The shape of the pieces is information that determines how they fit with their immediate neighbors. On each piece you have bits of information as brush strokes, lines, shapes and color, that also needs to match its neighbors. This is a separate level of information from the shapes of the pieces themselves. Both of these levels pertain to the assembly of the puzzle. When the puzzle is solved, the assembled bits produce a new level of information: the picture. The picture, in turn can produce another level of information by telling a story.\n\nIn the jigsaw puzzle we have levels of information woven together to support a system of encrypted data storage.\n\nAtoms are packets of information limited to their connections by their shape. They also carry another level of information in their charges, spins and wave function, variables separate from the molecular shape. These internal variables are connected to externals through the laws of quantum mechanics. It looks to me like data storage with relational links, like a database.\n\nThere are infinite levels of information woven into biological systems, each one representing a web of quantum connectivity with its own level of functionality, the levels immediately above and below, and to all levels ever interacted with. It is a living breathing hyper-relational database that acts like it is a super quantum computer solving for the most efficient growth, reproduction and dispersal through adaptation.\n\nJanuary 30, 2012\n\nThis presentation is based a couple of concepts at odds with some of the basic assumptions of science and religion. The first is that the biosphere as an intelligent entity. What makes it intelligent is that it communicates. The system intakes, processes and distributes information to and from all agents within its system. That relates to the second concept, that evolution is not a random process, but one controlled by intelligent, goal oriented communication.\n\nOnce you accept that you and i are agents within an intelligent system, new explanations for the life's anomalous occurrences present themselves. Once you start to explore those anomalies, armed with this new perspective, a very different picture of human history emerges. It is also a liberating experience to find out that we can communicate with other entities within the system.\n\nWhat do psychedelic aliens have to do with forests anyway, you may ask? Seems like too many unrelated subjects are being included. Well, you have heard it before, everything is connected to everything else. Herein i will show that it is not merely a romantic metaphor as some would like you to believe, but an overriding property of reality. Exploring the connections between religion, psychedelics, symbiosis in complex adaptive systems and alien encounters, can lead to some interesting revelations.\n\nBesides, we now know for sure that space travel is possible, by both man made vehicles and spores carried by the solar winds, therefore we all may be aliens.\n\nJust as science needs a unified theory to bring together its many disciplines, the rest of us need a unified theory of reality. This one works for me.\n\nThroughout there will be tips on how to expand your natural communication skills. I will give you exercises that you can use to verify my conclusions.\n\nJanuary 29, 2012\n\nWhen we combine the findings in the field of biology with general systems theory we find an unexpected mathematical synchronicity. The formulas that govern the formation of networks in complex systems are the same for the growth of biological systems and our beloved internet. The blood flowing through your veins is following the same fractal power laws as your email. It has taken the smartest people on the planet decades of study, trial and error to figure out how to run a truly complex communications network, but these laws governing the efficient transfer of information have been in use in biological systems all along.\n\nIn short, biological systems are constructed as if they are meant to be communication networks. Everything from tree trunks, roots, branches, leaves to coastlines and watersheds is built as if for the transfer information. Some coincidence. If we honor this evidence and look at biological systems as if they function primarily as information processors, a whole new model of reality begins to take shape.\n\nWhen we look at matter as information stored in physical form, like memory in a computer, the network like construction of biological systems makes perfect sense. Biological systems process and transfer matter\/information with great efficiency.\n\nMatter as information is more than bits, it is more dynamic than that, more like strings of bits that have coherence. The information of reality is organized in the form of stories. The physical world is current state of all of the stories being told. Stories aren't random, but unfold in very predictable ways. Stories follow rules, laws of communication that run through all living systems.\n\nWithin this new model many of the claims of the ancients take on new significance, many of the anomalies uncovered by science disappear and a pathway to a truly sustainable future reveals itself. This is the real significance of the Information Age. It is not only that we have learned to use these formulas to build our networks, but that we have found the best model for reality we have yet discovered, and it is virtual.\n\nThis path isn't for everyone. There those who really fear the forest. They have been brought up to think of Nature as the enemy, to be conquered and managed. To go into the forest is an act of bravery that takes planning, special equipment and most of all, courage. The idea of a benevolent goddess of the forest is foreign or even repulsive to the western warrior mentality. If she exists, she must be fought and beaten, says the warrior. To the mainstream of this industrial\/consumer society, She doesn't exist unless She can be sold for profit. To most environmentalists she is nothing more than a convenient metaphor.\n\nOn the other hand, even for the most hard core of the survival of the fittest practitioners, the forest is the only road back. It is the forest goddess, through her plant spirit messengers, that can reconnect lost souls with their source.\n\nDecember 16, 2011\n\nThat's why i have brought you deep into the forest, to give you human history from a different point of view. We've had the history of civilization written for us by the ones who have profited from the exploitation of the Biosphere. The version i am presenting comes from my communication within this system.\n\nI didn't get this model of intelligent microbes from books or discussions nor did i think this up on my own. I got this view of straight from the horses mouth. I got it directly from a member of the microbial mat. It came in an intelligent exchange, sort of an interview, where i asked questions and received answers. My encounter with this plant spirit overloaded my psyche with information that spawned more questions. I have spent the last thirty plus years sorting through that information and comparing it with other sources. I have interviewed other plant spirits along the way. I've learned valuable lessons from living alone in forests, deserts and mountains. I have found a landscape exactly as described by magicians, mystics and indigenous cultures in general. It is from my experience probing this separate reality that i obtained this version of human history.\n\nSo, this model of \"how it all works\" that the plant spirits have collectively laid on me, fits very well with the latest studies in biology, genetics, adaptive complex systems, symbiosis, quantum mechanics and information processing in general. The plant spirits got it right! So, for me the forest goddess is much more than a metaphor. The physical world we live in is intelligent. The whole Universe is a communication; the story of Life being told. We are part of that story. We are built from the same story elements as all of creation. Our bodies are made from intelligent parts that all communicate with our environment. Our bodies understand the language of Life, even if our intellect doesn't."}
{"text":"This is one of those stories that I see somewhere and think \"wow, this would be great on the Tumblr!\" and then I read it and I want to run home and hide and never eat anything but food I have grown myself ever again. Aspergillus flavus is a mold that thrives in hot, dry weather, just like last year's epic drought in the U.S. It has rendered huge portions of corn crops unsaleable; just the equivalent of 100 kernels per truckload of corn turns the whole lot into garbage. This is a very real and very scary threat. Read at your own risk. ~AR\n\nHaha. Scary indeed. I wonder what kind of solutions will arise from this. Surely, you can't control the weather. Is this going to lead to breeding for lines that are resistant? Or special greenhouses or closed conditions for raising corn where you can adjust the temperature? And I worry about the repercussions of such developments for poorer corn farmers who can't afford such adjustments.\n\nAnd only partially true. Depends on cell potency. Unless imagination and risk taking is a quality dependent on cell potency for said stem cell in said comic. Okay. Shutting up. Not going to ruin the joke any further.\n\nMoney may still not grow on trees, but scientists from Michigan State University have discovered the next closest thing: bacteria that can transform toxic chemicals into pure, 24-karat gold, according to MSU News.\n\nThe bacterium with the Midas touch, Cupriavidus metallidurans, was coaxed into producing real gold nuggets simply by exposing it to copious amounts of gold chloride, a toxic liquid substance with no actual value but which is found naturally in the environment. The bacterium gobbles up the gold chloride, ingesting all of the liquid's toxins and waste, and leaves behind only solid gold. It just goes to show that one bacterium's waste is another organism's treasure.\n\n\"Microbial alchemy is what we're doing \u2014 transforming gold from something that has no value into a solid, precious metal that's valuable,\" said Kazem Kashefi, assistant professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at Michigan State University.\n\nKashefi, along with associate professor of electronic art and intermedia Adam Brown, conceived of the method. Rather than get rich, the two professors are instead using their gold-producing bacteria as part of an art exhibit titled, \"The Great Work of the Metal Lover.\" The exhibit makes use of the researchers' odd visionary combination of biotechnology, art and alchemy to produce gold in front of an audience. The work received an honorable mention at the Prix Ars Electronica cyber art convention. (There was no evidence of the researchers paying off the judges with gold nuggets.)\n\n\"This is neo-alchemy. Every part, every detail of the project is a cross between modern microbiology and alchemy,\" explained Brown. \"Science tries to explain the phenomenological world. As an artist, I'm trying to create a phenomenon. Art has the ability to push scientific inquiry.\"\n\nThe analogy to alchemy, the ancient practice of transforming base metals into noble metals like gold or silver, is an apt one. Although the practices of ancient alchemists have been widely debunked as pseudoscience and charlatanism, Kashefi and Brown's method could rewrite the history books.\n\nThe gold produced using this method is also as pure as it gets: 99.9 percent pure. But is lab-produced gold as valuable as natural gold? Kashefi and Brown have yet to test the market on that, but they suspect the method they use in the lab is similar to how many gold nuggets get produced in nature. After all, both gold chloride and Cupriavidus metallidurans occur naturally. All it takes is for the two of them to naturally run into each other.\n\nGiven that the price of gold is currently through the roof, you might already have gotten the idea to begin duplicating this process in your garage. But before you get that twinkle in your eye, keep in mind that Kashefi and Brown have already crunched the numbers, and they attest that the experiment is not cost-effective enough to turn a worthy profit.\n\nAnd besides, if gold really was so easy to produce, its value would undoubtedly sink.\n\nMan oh man. The wonders of biotech. Imagine what it would be like to be an undergrad, or I guess even a grad student, who'd collaborate with the profs on this projectIt has previously been found that psychopaths have different brains than the rest of the human population. But could those differences affect their senses? Some researchers are saying yes. One study published in the journal Chemosensory Perception found that people with psychopathic tendencies had a weaker sense of smell than other people.\n\nThe study was conducted by Mehmed Mahmut and Richard Stevenson from Macquarie University in Australia. They examined 79 people with no criminal background living in the area. They measured the level of psychopathy in the participants, measuring them for manipulation, callousness, unpredictable lifestyle and criminal tendencies. They also noted how much or little empathy participants felt for others.\n\nThen researchers measured participants' olfactory ability, which refers to the sense of smell, as well as the sensitivity of their olfactory system. They found that people who scored more highly for psychopath traits were more likely to have a difficult time identifying scents and even noticing the differences between odors, even though they knew that they smelled something.\n\nClick title to read more.\n\nHaha. Strange. Though there are plenty of normal people who can't smell at all.\n\nSpider Version of Bigfoot Emerges from Caves in the Pacific Northwest\n\nScienceDaily (Aug. 14, 2012) \u2014 The forests of the coastal regions from California to British Columbia are renowned for their unique and ancient animals and plants, such as coast redwoods, tailed frogs, mountain beavers and the legendary Bigfoot (also known as Sasquatch). Whereas Bigfoot is probably just fiction, a huge, newly discovered spider is very real an historic moment But\u2026\n\nThis really makes me excited. Heck, I never knew amyloid build up can be seen in the eyes. Oh the handiness that is fluorescent markers. Seriously, they can be so useful if you just use some creativity and ingenuity.\n\nFor just one day a year, millions of ants across the UK take to the air in what is known as the nuptial flight - those in the London area may have noticed that for this region, that day was yesterday. This annual event is the time for winged 'princesses' - virgin queens - and male drones, collectively known as alates, to get a taste of the outside world where their sterile female workers roam during the rest of the year. The ants choose their day carefully based on temperature (warmth makes it easier for them to fly), humidity (damp soils are softer to dig new nests) and day length (the ritual always takes place in summer). Amazingly, flights are somehow coordinated between nests in the same region in order to maximise the chances of meeting with ants from other colonies to mate. How this is done is not yet fully known, but it is likely to be through a chemical signal. After emerging, the princesses release pheromones to attract male suitors, and ensure they get the strongest mate by outflying the males so that they must work to keep up. During her nuptial flight a princess will usually mate with several drones, storing the sperm in a 'sperm pocket' that will last her a lifetime: after mating, she loses her wings and buries underground, where she will start a new colony and use sperm reserves to fertilise tens of millions of eggs over the course of up to 15 years. The males, on the other hand, have completed their role in mating and die shortly afterwards.\n\nThe Society of Biology is studying patterns of flying ant emergence across the UK to determine country-wide levels of synchronisation and is calling on the public for your help - if you have noticed any flying ants in your area submit your sightings here!\n\nRef: BBC News, 2012.

However, these payoffs don't come easy. The work that a scientist must do is extremely taxing and laborious. I can attest to the intense work that one must go through in order to gather enough data and propose new scientific theories.\n\nToday our team worked in the field surveying vegetation plots at two different sites for seedlings and saplings for another 5+ hours. After receiving snow yesterday and experiencing a heavy frost this morning, laying on the ground searching for seedlings and saplings was not an easy task. It was cold and difficult to stay focused. This Earthwatch expedition and research opportunity has made me respect the work of field scientists that much more. These scientists don't only work long hours in the field, but they also put in a tremendous amount of hours in the lab. The hours of field research is followed up more time in the lab sorting through collected specimens before the analysis process can even begin.\n\nSo tonight's post is dedicated to all of those scientists who sacrifice for the rest of us. Scientists who despite the long hours, persist to conduct research to make our world a better place.\n\n1 Comments:\n\n1. (Jack) Are the black tips on the rabbits ears for any special purpose or is it just coloration? 2. (Jackie) Are you helping with the analysis process or just the collecting and sorting process? 3.

{"text":"Wednesday, January 18, 2012\n\nMusings: Lessons From the \"Lowly\"\n\nLast night, as the trees creaked and big rain beat on the windows, I sent a video link to a friend of a crow clearly using a jar lid to sled down a snowy roof. It was accompanied by a short article in which a scientist described it as \"play-like behavior.\"\n\n\"I don't understand how people don't think animals play,\" she replied in an email I received after walking beneath a crescent moon as shell pink clouds blew past the waterfall-streaked face of Makaleha this morning.\n\nReally. So if it's hard for some humans to believe animals play, much less think or feel, I realize it's a big stretch to accept the fact that bacteria have something important to teach us.\n\nBut they do. After all, they've been around for some 4 billion years, compared to our measly little 100,000, only the last 6,000 of which have approached anything close to what we now congratulate ourselves on as civilization.\n\nMeanwhile, the bacteria can watch the frenzied empire-building, colonizing, exploiting, over-populating, over-consuming human dramas that have brought our species to the brink of simultaneous crises and yawn, \"Been there, done that.\"\n\nBecause they have, more than once, and each time they figured out a way to adapt themselves to weather it, which resulted in an evolutionary leap. Heck, they even developed electric motors as complex as our own, and way before we did, says Dr. Elisabet Sahtouris, an evolution biologist who was the subject of a fascinating and inspiring interview on New Dimensions that you can listen to free through today.\n\nI suggest you do, because hearing her give the abridged history of the evolution of life on the planet really helped to put things in perspective. It also gave me hope. As Sahtouris says, \"Life gets creative in a time of crisis.\"\n\nSo as we ponder our possible fates, it behooves us to take a few lessons from the \"lowly\" bacteria that not only were here first, but offer us a model for how we humans can evolve into a mature species \u2014 provided we don't kill each other off, first.\n\nHere's the biggest tip: move beyond hostile competition to cooperation and co-creation. \"We have to form a global family if we're going to make this thing work,\" Sahtouris says. \"We're not looking for monoculture; that's a human invention. We have to maintain the diversity and do things cooperatively within it.\"\n\nAnd another one: have a little more appreciation for all forms of life, especially the bacteria that play such critical roles in our own existence. Consider this: the bacteria in our guts alone regulate 80 percent of our immune system function.\n\n\"We're not supposed to call them germs and attack them all the time,\" Sahtouris says. \"They're so flexible. We're not as smart as they are. Our consciousness is new in evolution compared to theirs. Once we understand this, we will be demanding natural products and good food.\"\n\nNeedless to say, she is an opponent of genetic engineering and factory farming practices that call for giving livestock massive doses of antibiotics. While the technically-oriented scientists who come up with this stuff do have their place, she says, \"we need scientists who understand life to stand up to them when they're going off course.\"\n\nWhat I really liked was her description of life as \"a sort of improvisational dance, constantly rebalancing itself and learning flexibility and resiliency.\"\n\nInterestingly enough, just before listening to the interview I'd written an article about acupuncture, and how its sole purpose is to help restore the balanced movement of energy through our bodies so that we can naturally repair ourselves. Ah yes, yet another ancient concept that's finally trickling into Western awareness...\n\nAnyway, as Sahtouris sees it, we currently have \"an old culture and a new culture co-existing\" in human systems. The old is vigorously resisting relinquishing its power \u2014 think Mitt Romney preaching how he'll America arm to the teeth to reassert our role as a dominant force in the world \u2014 and the new fears that it won't prevail against that resisting force. But she sees the shift we're making \"less like a phoenix rising from the ashes than the metamorphosis of a butterfly emerging from the caterpillar.\"\n\nIn other words: \"Look for ways that we can adapt,\" Sahtouris says. \"Be in joy, not fear or negativity.\""}

What sounds like the premise of a horror movie premise is actually a scientific fact: We share our homes with a host of bacteria, fungi and other microscopic organisms.\n\n\"We have scary things living around us but also lots and lots of beneficial ones,\" says Dunn, author of The Wild Lives of Our Bodies. \"What we want to learn is where those different kinds of species are and how the way that you live is influencing those species.\"\n\nDunn needs citizen scientists willing to shine a light on the creatures living in their houses. He's recruiting volunteers who will collect samples in the kitchen, under the bed and from other selected spots as part of the Wild Life Of Your Home project.\n\n\"You then seal the kit back up, send it back to us, and we'll use genetic techniques to see which species of fungus, bacteria, and even insects are living around you,\" he says.\n\nBy collecting samples from across the country, Dunn hopes to get a picture of what's out there, and how the way we live influences the creatures we live with."}

{"text":"Flawless evolution at work (unfortunately, it doesn't have a species bias).\n\nIn the 1980's, cockroaches in a Florida 'test kitchen' mysteriously defeated a poison bait that had, up until then, worked. Researchers eventually discovered that many of the roaches had lost their sweet tooth, and in just five years, the trait became so widespread that the bait was rendered useless.\n\nA study published Thursday explains the genetic mutation that allowed this to happen. In \"normal\" cockroaches, glucose excites neurons that tell the brain the food is \"sweet\". However, in mutated cockroaches, glucose not only activates the \"sweet\" neuron, but another that tells it \"yuck\". The \"yuck\" neuron overpowers the signal from the \"sweet\" neurons, so the brain gets the message that the food tastes awful.\n\n\"A team of researchers in the Canadian Arctic is reporting on an interesting find: bacteria that thrive at \u201315 degrees Celsius. That is the coldest environment bacteria have ever been found to grow in.\"\n\nPlanococcus halocryophilus, whichmakes its home in the tiny veins of salt water in the arctic permafrost, can grow and survive in temperatures as low as -25 degrees celsius.\n\nWhy are scientists so interested? Well, aside from how amazing this discovery is on its own, it also has major implications for the search for bacteria on Mars and Saturn's moon Enceladus. Both mars, and its moon, may have similar habitats to the one this bacteria has made its arctic home.\n\nLately, these shows have also filmed killing of wolverines, lynx, grizzly bears, rattle snakes, and crocodiles for no reason other than ratings. The wolf, above, was no threat to Tanana. The show exploits viewer's naivete about guns by shooting this animal with an AR-15 semi-automatic gun. That's not how Alaskans hunt, they use hunting rifles, not assault weapons that look good on camera. In fact, Alaskan outdoorsmen and women are appalled at this blatant exploitation of both the animal and the audience. There is no need for this.\n\nMy point is that we are at a critical time in human history. Species are going extinct at a rapid pace, science education is under attack from aging politicians, and young people are generally experiencing nature less and less.\n\nI am genuinely worried about the future of this country's environmental leadership. Federal conservation programs, which have taken decades to create, are weakening. The ethic of conservationism (a conservative ethos) is dwindling. Young people are being pulled in the direction of technology, and away from grandeur, away from fresh air and nature.\n\nIt seems to me that one important aspect of this messy new milieu are education based TV companies who heretofore have been untouched by healthy criticism.\n\nI think it's time to analyze the impact of these shows. I believe that the Discovery Channel et al are not contributing to a healthy planet nor are they assisting educating viewers. It seems to me they are mastering fear for short term gain and profits. If I am correct, and I believe I am, these companies need to stop and focus on their mission, which is non-fiction, education-based media - not sensationalism or harm."}

A quick look at the animal explains the confusion. Shaped like a dog, striped like a tiger or zebra, pouched like an opossum, and reputed to behave like a wolf, it became many different creatures in the popular imagination.\n\nBut the thylacine is, or was, a unique species. Now considered extinct, the thylacine was a carnivorous marsupial that lived in Tasmania and fed primarily on kangaroos, wallabies, small mammals, and birds. Nocturnal and shy, it was seldom seen by humans. Nonetheless, beginning in the 19th century, settlers believed the animals threatened their livestock and, spurred on by a bounty offered by the government, hunted them relentlessly.

{"text":"New Findings in Suspended Animation Could Have Significant Clinical Benefits\n\nIt may sound like science fiction\u2014a person apparently freezes to death but then comes back to life. This phenomenon has actually occurred in reality, and researchers may have found the key to explain how it is possible.\n\nThere have been well-documented examples of humans who appear frozen to death, without a heartbeat\u2014but somehow are resuscitated with no long-term adverse health consequences.\n\nWidely publicized cases include Canadian toddler Erica Nordby, who in the winter of 2001 wandered outside wearing only a diaper. Her heart had stopped beating for two hours and her body temperature had dropped to 61 degrees Fahrenheit before she was discovered and resuscitated.\n\nAnother incident that made the headlines involved a Japanese man, who in 2006 fell asleep on a snowy mountain and was found by rescuers 23 days later with a body temperature of 71 degrees Fahrenheit. Mitsutaka Uchikoshi was also resuscitated and made a full recovery.\n\nBiologists have discovered a possible reason for this phenomenon, which could potentially bring significant health benefits.\n\nIn a laboratory, yeast and garden worms survived hypothermia, if they were first put into a state of suspended animation by anoxia, or extreme oxygen deprivation.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, both organisms cannot survive severe cold. But according to cell biologist Mark B. Roth, Ph.D., of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 66 percent of the yeast and 97 percent of the garden worms survived when they were deprived of oxygen right before freezing. \"We have found that extension of survival limits in the cold is possible if oxygen consumption is first diminished,\" he said.\n\nThe relationship between low oxygen and low temperatures may one day lead to the development of improved techniques for extending the shelf life of human organs for transplantation. \"Our experiments in yeast and nematodes suggest that organs may last longer outside the body if their oxygen consumption is first reduced before they are made cold,\" said Roth.\n\nAnother key potential benefit from this discovery could also help patients in trauma situations, including victims of a heart attack or blood-loss injury, by reducing their need for oxygen until proper medical attention can be provided. Roth explains that these patients could easily be put in suspended animation by exposing them to agents such as hydrogen sulfide, which could lower metabolism as a means to \"buy time.\"\n\nRoth's research is far from over, but his findings have already generated great interest within the scientific community, and may yield significant advances in medicine someday."}

E-mail The Body Odd or check us out on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThere are 14 different kinds of noses, study claims\n\nMay we present the \"bumpy nose\" -- found in 9 percent of noses surveyed.\n\nBy Cari Nierenberg\n\nHow many different shapes of human noses are there? Ten? Fifty? Hundreds?\n\nThe correct answer is 14, according to Abraham Tamir, an Israeli scientist. And while the study has its limitations, it is the first-of-its-kind survey detailing the shapes of schnozes.\n\nTamir set out to count, sort and categorize the shapes of human noses mainly because no one had ever done this experiment before. A professor of chemical engineering at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beer-Sheva, Israel, Tamir also teaches a course on the interaction between art and science.\n\nAnalyzing the shape of noses fulfilled both his scientific curiosity and his artistic appreciation for the contours and appearance of this vital part of human anatomy. Tamir also likes looking into topics that others have not yet investigated -- and the nose seemed, well, ripe for the picking.\n\nTo group and quantify noses, Tamir looked at nearly 1,800 photos. Four hundred images came from artwork, while he took almost 1,400 snapshots of real people in Israel as well as in three European countries -- Holland, Belgium, and France. Around 1,200 of the pictures were of men and about 700 were women.\n\nThe results, reported in the May 2011 issue of the Journal of Craniofacial Surgery, found 14 different nose shapes. But here it's worth noting the study's drawbacks, as Dr. Tony Youn, Michigan-based board-certified plastic surgeon, sees them.\n\n\"This study is limited to the types of Caucasian noses,\" says Youn, author of the recently-published memoir \"In Stitches.\" \"It doesn't appear to take into account African noses, Asian noses, Latino noses and the various other non-European and non-Israeli types of noses. A complete study would include noses from the wide spectrum of ethnicities.\"\n\nStill, according to Tamir's research, the fleshy nose, which is large and prominent, was the most popular proboscis for both men and women found in roughly one-quarter of the photos reviewed. It was the most widely seen beak in Israel observed on nearly 38 percent of the faces photographed in that country.\n\nThe turned up, or \"celestial nose,\" was the most common shape in Europe, seen on 22 percent of the profile shots from this region. The research also considered it the \"most attractive\" snout shape, and its edge is sharper than a snub nose, which is smaller, slightly rounder and slopes upward at the tip.\n\nAnd because of his interest in art, he also found it interesting that all the shapes of real noses were also demonstrated by paintings in one way or another.\n\nA few other shapes identified in the paper included the hawk (thin, sharp, and downward hooking), Roman (long with a downward-sloping tip), Greek (straight), and bumpy.\n\nThe experiment even found a nose in Israel it considered extremely unique -- and the only one of its type in nearly 1,800 pictures viewed.\n\nHow about your honker? What does it look like? Are you happy with its look and shape?\n\nNow I know why the economy is going downhill. To spend money on all of these studies is ridculous. How about, why some people in the US do not have enough food or water while wasteful money is spent to go to mars to find water.\n\nOh for dumb. Did you read the article at all? This study was done IN ISRAEL. By an Israeli. No US government dollars involved at all. It seems like a a dumb article, granted, and very Eurocentric, but it's nothing to do with the US at all.\n\nOk, this is (for lack of a better word) stupid. I don't see my nose or any nose even similar to my nose. Why would he exclude African, Asian, Latino and the various other non-European and non-Israeli types of noses in his (I'm using this word loosely? If I were a teacher I'd give him a 20% as a grade on his assignment. It's clearly incomplete!\n\nI couldn't tell if they covered the \"split nose.\" The thing at the bottom of the nose that divides the nostrils, mine kind of \"curles\" or something. It's not actually a split nose, more of a divide, like the start of two noses, but not. It's not something I would have surgery on or anything like that, unless I was a Hollywood actress, then I could probably afford it, but I'm not a girl either, so I could hardly be an actress, unless I was Dustin Hoffman, Kurt Russell, Robin Williams, Wesley Snipes, or somebody like that who at least made pretend they were a girl, but I'm not an actor or famous or anything, it's just me, so no surgery, not like that I really needed it anyways. But like, yea, I got a split nose or something. Not sure if they covered that one...but it's got a button on it, though, kind of slants a little to the left.....I think.\n\nI had to look it up, but yes, like Jodie Foster's nose; only, to use hairdoharriet's term, I got more cleavage than Jodie Foster does, in my nose that is. So, thanks a lot hairdoharriet, I got cleavage, but I'm still not an actress, not like Patrick Swayze anyways...though he might have cleavage too.\n\nSarcasticus1 - sounds like it's part of your philtrum (the indentation between your nose and mouth). Perhaps it's extended further into the nose for your type of nose.\n\nEveryone else - given that his position and normal research has nothing to do with art and the physiognomy of the face, I suspect this is research he did for fun rather than a funded project. As someone who studies face perception, there are lots of portraits available online from a number of different centuries. You can also find them in books at the university library. There are also a substantial number of free face databases (face-rec.org), so long as you are an academic or affiliated with some sort of research institution. Otherwise, it doesn't take much to have assistants snap some photos of people as they exit classes etc. (so long as you don't publish the photos without permission). The main work comes from examining it all and making measurements in Photoshop. Outside of the cost of Photoshop, this particular set of research costs nothing. So stop fretting about it being a waste of money etc etc. It's just a curiosity piece... hence \"body odd\". ;)\n\n\"The experiment even found a nose in Israel it considered extremely unique -- and the only one of its type in nearly 1,800 pictures viewed.\"\n\nThis is not an experiment. If you look at the original article, it is a survey and classification with little applicability to science or art. It is sad to think these types of papers clutter the peer-reviewed literature.\n\nDepends on how the article is written. Many people who study the perception of art in the vision sciences would be quite interested in knowing how well art represents our visual perception. To know that that element of the face is accurately reproduced by artists could well be of interest to them... at the very least it may suggest that we have a veridical mental representation of facial features.\n\ni'm not asian but my nose is so teeny, tiny, narrow at the top, hardly anything there, that i have a hard time keeping glasses in place on my face and sometimes wish the top of my nose was shaped differently so i didn't constantly have my glasses sliding down onto my cheeks. my son is half asian and his nose is very flat and low at the top so his glasses fall down too.\n\nThe purpose of science is to serve mankind. You seem to regard science as some kind of dodge... or hustle. Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy, and your conclusions are highly questionable! You are a poor scientist,\n\nOK...14 types of noses from bits and pieces of Europe. now how about amongst the rest of...oh, sorry, the MAJORITY...of the world? The title needs a qualifier indicating the research's limited context.\n\ni like how the headline says that a study says there are 14 different types of noses, but all the noses studied where in europe and israel and all on caucasian people. the headline should be more like \"study says there are 14 different caucasian nose types in europe and israel.\" but even than, he only studied 1,400 noses of actual people. that doesn't seem like a high enough number to make the conclusion that there are 14 types. how did he think that such a small number of people, confined to only two different countries, and one race of people, was enough to make a conclusion?\n\ni'm mixed race, living in america and didn't see my nose in any of those noses. i didn't see my son's either, or the nose that most of my relatives on my mom's side have, or the nose that almost everybody on my dad's side seems to have. i didn't see the type of nose that the majority of my friends have either.\n\nIt's easy to tell who has had a nose job in town, as everyone goes for the snout, piggy-like, upturned nose. Not me, I will keep my Roman nose. It says a lot about my strong personality and believe it or not, a lot of great rulers and fierce warriors had Roman noses, so I like to think of my nose as special :)\n\npersonally, i think it's somewhat boring when people have plastic surgery to make their nose look like whatever the new \"fad\" nose is. maybe they didn't have a \"perfect\" nose before, but at least they didn't have one that looked like a clone of everybody else's\n\nFourteen kind of white\/European noses. This article would be interesting if they pointed out the intense bias but as it is, it's completely erasing everyone who doesn't fit into those 14 white\/European categories. Just a note, some context, ANYTHING would help ease the reporting bias, though no help can be given for the study itself.\n\nI think it's shocking to declare \"There are 14 kinds of noses\" and only include Caucasian noses!! How can anyone take this person seriously?? Plus you'd think an Israeli scientist would have some sensitivity about the Nazi-esque taint to this \"study\" -- which could be re-named \"14 Aryan Noses.\" All in all, just creepy and horrifying!\n\nfirst study of its kind? NOT !!!!! Nazi anthropologists did an exhausting study of the variations found, worldwide, in the human body - and this included nose shapes and a lot of other stuff that the average person would never consider as testable variables... perhaps the headline should read \"Israeli scientist does first study of its kind in 70 years\" or \"Israeli Jews steal Nazi thunder (again)\""}
{"text":"Four members of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) faculty\u2014William Clemons Jr., assistant professor of biochemistry; Thanos Siapas, professor of computation and neural systems; Long Cai, assistant professor of chemistry; and Lea Goentoro, assistant professor of biology\u2014have been named among the researchers being given National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director's Awards.\n\nIn the last couple of years, researchers have observed that water spontaneously flows into extremely small tubes of graphite or graphene, called carbon nanotubes. However, no one has managed to explain why. Now, using a novel method to calculate the dynamics of water molecules, Caltech researchers believe they have solved the mystery. It turns out that entropy, a measurement of disorder, has been the missing key.\n\nStretching for thousands of miles beneath oceans, optical fibers now connect every continent except for Antarctica. But although optical fibers are increasingly replacing copper wires, carrying information via photons instead of electrons, today's computer technology still relies on electronic chips. Now, researchers led by engineers at the Caltech are paving the way for the next generation of computer-chip technology: photonic chips.Artificial intelligence has been the inspiration for countless books and movies, as well as the aspiration of countless scientists and engineers. Researchers at Caltech have now taken a major step toward creating artificial intelligence\u2014not in a robot or a silicon chip, but in a test tube. The researchers are the first to have made an artificial neural network out of DNA, creating a circuit of interacting molecules that can recall memories based on incomplete patterns, just as a brain can.\n\nThe power output of wind farms can be increased by an order of magnitude\u2014at least tenfold\u2014simply by optimizing the placement of turbines on a given plot of land, say researchers at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) who have been conducting a unique field study at an experimental two-acre wind farm in northern Los Angeles County.\n\nEver since a crash landing on Earth grounded NASA's Genesis mission in 2004, scientists have been gathering, cleaning, and analyzing solar wind particles collected by the spacecraft. Now, two new studies published in Science reveal that Earth's chemistry is less like the sun's than previously thought.\n\nWere dinosaurs slow and lumbering, or quick and agile? It depends largely on whether they were cold or warm blooded. Now, a team of researchers led by Caltech has developed a new approach to take body temperatures of dinosaurs for the first time, providing new insights into whether dinosaurs were cold or warm blooded.\n\nAs part of a program to foster innovative biomedical research projects, an anonymous donor has pledged $3 million each to Caltech and City of Hope to strengthen scientific collaborations between the two leading research institutions.\n\nWhen geologists survey an area of land for the potential that gas or petroleum deposits could exist there, they must take into account the composition of rocks that lie below the surface. Previous research had suggested that compaction bands might act as barriers to the flow of oil or gas. Now, researchers led by Jos\u00e9 Andrade have analyzed X-ray images of Aztec sandstone and revealed that compaction bands are actually more permeable than earlier models indicated."}

Each one is half as wide as a grain of salt. Taste cells, which appear here as red and green, bunch together to form the taste buds. The red cells taste sour things. It's not clear yet what the green cells taste. Courtesy of Thomas Finger\n\nIt was an exciting day when Thomas Finger looked inside the nose of a small black mouse. Finger had borrowed the animal from another scientist. It was not your average mouse.\n\nThe mouse's genes had been changed so that the taste buds on its tongue turned green when you shined light on them \u2014 like a secret message written in secret ink.\n\nBut no one had ever looked inside its nose. When Finger finally did look there with a microscope, he saw thousands of green cells dotting the soft pink lining. \"It was like looking at little green stars at night,\" says Finger, who is a neurobiologist at the Rocky Mountain Taste and Smell Center at the University of Colorado in Denver. (A neurobiologist studies how the nervous system develops and functions.)\n\nSeeing that green starry sky was Finger's first glimpse of a new world. If he and other scientists are right, we don't taste things just on our tongues. Other parts of our body can also taste things \u2014 our nose, our stomach, even our lungs!\n\nYou might think of taste as something that you experience when you put chocolate in your mouth \u2014 or chicken soup, or salt. But for you to taste chocolate or chicken soup, special cells on your tongue have to tell the brain that they detected chemicals that are in the food. We have at least five kinds of these chemical-detecting cells (commonly called taste cells) on our tongues: cells that detect salt, sweet compounds, sour things, bitter things and savory things like meat or broth.\n\nYou might call these five things the primary colors of your mouth. The unique taste of every food is made up of some combination of salt, sweet, sour, bitter or savory, just as you can make any color of paint by mixing together bits of red, yellow and blue.\n\nIt's these chemical-sensing cells that scientists are now finding all over the body.\n\n\"I'll bet you that in terms of total number of cells,\" says Finger, \"there are more [taste cells] outside the mouth than inside the mouth.\"\n\nThis gives us clues about other functions the sense of taste has in our bodies. It could also help scientists find new treatments for certain diseases.\n\nFish skin: more than a feeling\n\nIt's an exciting time for scientists who study taste. Finger spent 30 years working toward this big moment. Some of the first clues came from fish. Back in the 1960s, scientists looking at fish skin under microscopes discovered that the outside of a fish's slippery body is dotted with thousands of funny cells shaped like bowling pins. Those funny cells look just like the chemical-detecting cells on your tongue. At the time, no one was sure what those bowling-pin cells on fish skin did. But years later, scientists found that they actually can taste. When food chemicals were sprinkled onto the fish skin, those cells sent a message to the fish brain \u2014 just like the cells on your tongue tell your brain when you taste food.\n\nNosey tasters: Taste cells on the inside of the nose of a genetically engineered mouse appear green under the microscope. Those taste cells talk to the treelike branches of nerve cells, which are red in this picture. Credit: Thomas Finger\n\nFor fish, being able to taste things all over their body comes in handy. Some fish called searobins use this to find their next meal. When searobins poke their pointy fins into the mud on the seafloor, they can \"taste\" the worms they're looking to eat. Other fish called rocklings use these cells to sense the presence of larger fish that might want to eat them.\n\nIn these cases, the buried worms and big fish leak small amounts of chemicals into the water and mud. Taste cells on the skin of searobins and rocklings detect the chemicals (sort of the way you might be able to taste what's in the bathwater after your filthy little brother sat in the tub for a while).\n\nAs Finger studied searobins, goldfish and other wet critters, he began to wonder whether land animals like cats, mice and people could also sense taste outside of their tongues. \"Why wouldn't it be a good idea?\" he asks. \"The more information you get from your environment, the better off you are.\"\n\nPeeling mud\n\nBut finding taste cells on land animals wasn't easy. Unlike fishes', their skin is covered in a dry crust of dead cells, like the layer of cracked mud that forms as a water puddle dries. A taste cell hidden under that crust wouldn't function. It needs to come into contact with chemicals in the outside world in order to detect them. So Finger decided to look at the wetter, fishier parts of our body. He started his search deep inside the nose.\n\nThat's when he borrowed the mouse with the green taste buds \u2014 and found those green, bowling pin-shaped cells inside its nose. The cells were scattered instead of being clumped together, as they are in the tongue. But one thing was for sure: Those cells could taste.\n\nWhen Finger tested them, the cells contained the same special proteins, called receptors, that your tongue uses to detect chemicals in food. Different kinds of receptors detect different kinds of chemicals \u2014 like sugars, sour things and so on. Those in the mouse's nose specialized in detecting bitter chemicals.\n\nSince Finger's discovery of this in 2003, other scientists have found bitter-sensing taste cells inside the hundreds of branching tunnels that move air through the lungs of animals.\n\nSome scientists have also found taste cells along the path that food travels through a person's body \u2014 a journey of at least 12 hours. From the stomach, where food is first digested, those taste cells can be found all of the way to the large intestine at the lower end. Some in your gut taste bitter things, others scout for sweet sugars.\n\n(Not) tasting your poop\n\n\"There is an enormous number of these cells in the lower gut,\" notes Enrique Rozengurt, a biologist at UCLA (the University of California campus in Los Angeles) whose team first found taste cells in the gut in 2002. \"Why do you have all of these receptors?\" asks Rozengurt. \"There are some very profound possibilities.\"\n\nIt might seem like a really bad idea to have taste cells beyond the tongue. In your nose, wouldn't you taste salty buggers? And wouldn't you also taste the brown gooey stuff in your large intestine \u2014 which is pretty much just poop waiting to be excreted? If we have taste cells inside our body, shouldn't we be tasting nasty stuff all day long?\n\nNo, says Finger. What you experience when your body \"tastes\" something depends on what part of your brain the taste cells are talking to.\n\nWhen you put a bitter pill in your mouth, the cells on your tongue talk to a part of your brain called the insular cortex. This part of your brain is part of your moment-to-moment thoughts. It gets the message from your tongue \u2014 bitter! And yuck! Immediately, your face scrunches up. You want to spit the pill out.\n\nYour inner worm\n\nBut when cells in the gut detect something bitter, they send a little telegram to a deeper, older part of the brain. Scientists call it the nucleus of the solitary tract, but you might well think of it as your inner worm.\n\nThis part of the brain takes care of simple things that a mindless worm would do: pushing food through the gut, digesting it and pooping it out. You don't have to think about those things. They just happen.\n\nFin tasters: This mud-dwelling fish, called a searobin, has taste cells on its pointy front fins. It sticks those fins into the mud in order to feel around \u2014 or you might say, taste around \u2014 for worms that it wants to eat. Credit: Thomas Finger\n\nWhen your brain's inner worm senses the arrival of something bitter in the intestines, it tells your brain: Stop. You've eaten something bad. Get rid of it \u2014 quickly! You may suddenly feel sick, throw up, or have diarrhea. And these things happen without any conscious decisionmaking on your part.\n\nThe world is full of bad things like poisonous plants and spoiled foods. These are things that bitter-taste cells in your digestive system scout for. Says Rozengurt, they \"are there to defend us against all of these harmful substances.\"\n\nBitter sneeze\n\nBitter-detection cells in your nose and lungs protect you in kind of the same way. Bad bacteria sometimes enter your nose or lungs.They cause infections that can make it hard to breathe. Bitter-taste cells sound an internal alarm when they detect chemicals that the bad bacteria squirt out.\n\nThat alarm signals your body to sneeze or cough the bad stuff out. Bitter-taste cells can also trigger a process that tells white blood cells to attack the unwelcome germs.\n\nIt makes sense that you'd want to get rid of nasty, bitter-tasting stuff. But your stomach and intestines also have cells that detect sweet sugars. And they send out very different messages.\n\nIt's one thing to taste sugary pancakes and syrup in your mouth, but what about along the rest of the 30 feet that your breakfast travels through the stomach and intestines?\n\nThose other parts of your body also need to know when something sweet has arrived, says Robert Margolskee of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. Cells scattered up and down your gut act as a tracking system to let your body know when the sugary food arrives at each location. \"It starts things going further down in the digestive tract to digest those things,\" says Margolskee.\n\nScientists have some evidence that the gut also contains taste cells that detect meaty, savory chemicals. Like the sweet-taste cells, these probably also alert different parts of the gut to what's coming.\n\nTaste medicines\n\nMargolskee lent Finger those green-tongued mice in 2001. In 2009, Margolskee discovered that sugar-detecting cells of the intestine squirt out a messenger substance, called a hormone, that prepares the intestine to soak up sugars. Those hormones also let another part of the body, called the pancreas, know that sugar is on its way. The pancreas oozes out its own hormone \u2014 called insulin \u2014 that tells other parts of the body, from the muscles to the brain, to prepare for that sugar.\n\nMaking drugs that affect the gut's taste cells could help treat a common disease called diabetes. In diabetes, the rest of the body appears almost deaf to the insulin message that the pancreas sends out. So the muscles and brain don't take in much of the sugar, a major source of energy, from the blood. A drug that \"turns up the sound in these gut taste cells,\" says Margolskee, might help the gut and the pancreas more effectively shout out to the rest of the body that sugar is coming \u2014 and to get ready.\n\nSome people have another problem called irritable bowel syndrome. Here, food oozes through their intestines too quickly or too slowly, causing painful traffic jams. Drugs that tickle the bitter-detecting cells might help the intestine push food through more quickly and smoothly, reducing belly aches.\n\nJust this past November, scientists made a more surprising discovery: Bitter-tasting cells in the lungs might one day help doctors treat a disease called asthma.\n\nPeople with asthma have trouble breathing because the airways in their lungs close up. Now scientists have found that some bitter substances actually open those airways. And these substances do it better than one medicine that doctors frequently use to treat asthma.\n\nIt's was only the latest surprise. People who study taste outside the mouth expect more will keep on coming.\n\nUntil recently, says Rozengurt, a universe of taste sensors existed \"that we were vaguely aware of, but we didn't have any clues of how to study. Now we do.\"\n\nPOWER WORDS\n\nasthma A disease characterized by a difficulty in breathing, and by wheezing, coughing and constricted airways.\n\ngut The intestine.\n\nhormone A molecule the body produces to serve as a messenger to help the body in its basic functions.\n\ninsulin A protein hormone that helps the body get energy from fats and carbohydrates.\n\npancreas A gland behind the stomach that serves several functions, including releasing molecules that help with digestion and releasing insulin.\n\nThe village of Kuujjuaq, in northern Canada, is home to about 2,100 people.\n\nOrbitale\/Wikimedia Commons\n\nNo roads lead to Kuujjuaq. You can only get to this village, high in the Canadian Arctic, by boat or plane. The trees here are stunted and small, but the bears grow big. The 500 kids who live in Kuujjuaq (pronounced KOO-joo-ak) have unusual chores: they help their parents catch fish and hunt caribou to eat. This place might seem far away from the big problems of big cities, like water pollution and air pollution. But even here, people can't escape those problems. Pretty little Kuujjuaq, with its blue skies and crystal clear waters, also has an invisible pollution problem that rivals any city.\n\nToxic chemicals have a surprising way of finding their way up here to the Arctic. They are gushed out of factories and cities thousands of miles away, and they travel to the Arctic like birds flying north for the summer. The birds go back home, but the chemicals stay.\n\nEveryone in Kuujjuaq has the chemicals in their bodies. No one knows their full effects, but they may hurt children in a slow and silent way. They could cause babies to get sick a little more often. And they might even cause kids to do worse in school.\n\nNo one would have dreamed that people in such a clean and beautiful place could be hurt by pollution from thousands of miles away. Then, in 1989, some scientists made a discovery.\n\nPOPs around the world\n\nEric Dewailly, a doctor at Laval University in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, was studying chemicals called persistent organic pollutants, or POPs. These are chemicals that can hang around for a long time in people's bodies or in the environment.\n\nDewailly and his team tested people in the cities of southern Qu\u00e9bec (near the border with the United States) to see how much of these chemicals were in their bodies. Dewailly's team wanted to compare this group with people in the Arctic. They reasoned that people in the Arctic lived far from pollution, and so would probably have lower levels of POPs in their bodies.\n\nSo the scientists went up to Nunavik, the remote, northern part of Qu\u00e9bec which includes Kuujjuaq and 13 other native Inuit villages. When they tested people in Nunavik they were surprised. People there had five to ten times as much of these chemicals in their bodies as people living in polluted cities. Some of the chemicals came from as far away as Russia!\n\nScientists now understand why this happens. The POPs include hundreds of different chemicals. Some are used in electronic gadgets like TVs, or in the lights and electrical wiring of buildings. Some are used in paints or for making windows waterproof. Others are sprayed onto crops as pesticides. But POPs have one thing in common: They like to evaporate. Just as a puddle of water dries on a hot summer sidewalk, POPs turn slowly into vapor and drift into the air. Winds can carry them thousands of miles.\n\nPOPs travel in the air until they reach a cold place. Have you noticed that on a hot day, a glass of lemonade with ice cubes in it collects little drops of water on the outside? This is because water vapor, which is a gas in the air, \"condenses\" onto the cold glass and forms those droplets\u2014the opposite of evaporating or drying. The same thing happens with POPs, says Knut Breivik, an environmental chemist at the Norwegian Institute of Air Research in the city of Kjeller.\n\n\"Things tend to evaporate in warmer regions and condense when it gets colder,\" says Breivik. So when winds carry POPs into the Arctic or Antarctic parts of the world, cold temperatures cause them to condense onto plants or rocks or snow or oceans. And then they stay where they landed and build up over time.\n\n10 million tons\n\nOver the years, more than 10 million tons of POPs have probably floated through the skies to the Arctic. If those chemicals were piled on an area the size of a football field, the pile would rise 700 meters in the air\u2014higher than the tallest building on Earth.\n\nSince the chemicals are spread over the entire Arctic instead of a football field, there's actually only a small amount in any one place. A swimming pool filled with Arctic Ocean water might contain only a single tiny raindrop of POPs. But these chemicals have a nasty habit of collecting inside animals and people, so even a little bit in the environment can end up causing problems.\n\nPOPs tend to stick to the oils and fats in living things, so tiny ocean animals like plankton soak them up, just like a shirt soaks up a drop of spaghetti sauce. Those plankton are eaten by larger animals, which in turn are eaten by even larger animals.\n\nEvery time one animal eats another, more POPs enter the larger animal's body. Animals can't digest POPs. They take them in the front, but never poop or pee them out the back end. So the POPs collect and collect. The biggest animals, like sea birds, seals, and whales, have the most POPs in their bodies. And these animals are eaten by native Inuit people, who have lived and hunted in Nunavik and other parts of the Arctic for thousands of years.\n\nTwo teaspoons\n\nBy the time a boy growing up in Kuujjuaq turns five years old, he may have collected one or two little rain drops' worth of POP chemicals in his body. That doesn't sound like much\u2014but it's thousands of times more concentrated than these chemicals are in sea water. In fact, that little boy has as much of these chemicals in his 20-kilogram body as there would be in two and a half million kilograms of sea water\u2014in other words, enough sea water to fill an Olympic swimming pool! Scientists are trying to understand how the chemicals affect kids.\n\nKids in Kuujjuaq play and joke around.\n\nAndr\u00e9 Perron\/Wikimedia Commons\n\nDewailly's team has made many trips back to Nunavik to study the problem of POPs. In 1992 and 2004, they sailed in a ship to all 14 villages along the coast of Nunavik, including Kuujjuaq. The ship stopped at each village, and doctors took blood samples and examined people. They measured POPs in hundreds of newborn babies. Blood samples were taken again when the babies turned one year old. And these babies were studied for years as they grew, to find out how the POPs in their bodies affected them over time.\n\nThese studies have shown that POP chemicals affect the health of children in small but worrying ways. For one thing, these chemicals can weaken children's immune systems, says Pierre Ayotte, a toxicologist who works with Dewailly at Laval University. \"Then you're less able to fight disease,\" he says. Babies with the most POPs in their bodies had more ear infections and more infections in their lungs\u2014not minor infections like colds or flu, but serious ones that affect breathing and can sometimes send you to the hospital.\n\nLong division\n\nThese chemicals might even affect how well kids do in school. When the babies were 1 year old, the Laval University scientists gave them some tests. They tested how well the babies used their hands. They also tested how well the babies paid attention and learned when they were shown new toys. All of these tests were videotaped, and scientists carefully studied the videos afterward. What they saw surprised them.\n\nBabies with high POPs levels weren't quite as coordinated with their hands as other babies. They also didn't pay attention quite as well when they were being shown new toys\u2014they often stared away at other things. And during several hours of tests, these babies became upset and cried more often.\n\nThese were small differences. You wouldn't notice them unless you watched the babies closely. But when the same babies were tested again at the age of 5, the ones with high POPs still did a little worse.\n\n\"At later ages you're still at a disadvantage,\" says Gina Muckle, a psychologist on the Laval University team that traveled to Nunavik to test the children. Muckle thinks that even small changes can affect how children do in school as they get older. They could affect how a child responds when taught something hard, like long division\u2014whether they meet the challenge with a positive attitude, or get upset and discouraged. Or they could affect how a child responds to the stress of going to a new school\u2014how well they make new friends, and whether they still do well in class during those awkward times. Little differences, over the years, could add up. \"Those effects,\" says Muckle, \"are likely to be a real disadvantage overall during the life of the person.\"\n\nStill trickling\n\nNo one was happy to learn that POP chemicals were hurting people in the Arctic. But finding out about the problem gave the Inuit a chance to do something about it. In the 1990s, the United Nations held a meeting, called the Stockholm Convention, to discuss banning many POP chemicals. The Inuit sent people to the United Nations to tell how POPs had affected them. Since 1998, 140 countries have agreed to stop making many POP chemicals. As a result, levels of POPs in the Arctic are falling.\n\nBut it will take a long time for the problem to go away. For one thing, buildings around the world still contain many tons of POPs in their paint and wiring. Every day, a little bit of those chemicals turns into vapor and drifts outside. Eventually, it reaches the Arctic.\n\nResearcher S\u00e9bastien Roy tests the quality of a lake's water during the 2004 Nunavik Health Survey.\n\nIsabelle Dubois\/NRBHSS\n\nSoil also contains huge amounts of POP chemicals\u2014and the hot blast of a forest fire can send them into the air, just as a hot blow drier causes water to evaporate from your hair. Breivik found that major fires in 2004 and 2006 caused large amounts of POPs to go into the air and reach the Arctic. Many of these chemicals last for 100 years or longer.\n\nLikely suspects\n\nThe other problem is that while hundreds of POP chemicals are known, there are probably others that scientists still don't know about. \"There are new compounds that are ending up in remote areas,\" says Frank Wania, an environmental chemist at the University of Toronto in Scarborough.\n\nMany POPs contain the element chlorine. But in the last few years, scientists like Wania have been surprised to find that two families of manmade chemicals, which contain the elements fluorine or bromine, have found their way into the Arctic. \"We failed to recognize [them] until they were already accumulating in the Arctic,\" says Wania\u2014meaning that large amounts of them were turning up in seals, birds and people. By the time the chemicals were discovered and banned, the damage was done.\n\nScientists want to get ahead of the problem. Wania has surveyed 100,000 industrial chemicals. He was looking for chemicals\u2014you could call them \"hoppers,\" \"fliers\" and \"swimmers\"\u2014which might reach the Arctic. Out of those chemicals, he found 120 likely suspects that he plans to look at more closely.\n\nAll of this might seem like a lot of effort. But many scientists think it's the right thing to do. It comes down to one question, says Muckle\u2014whether we want children to be able to grow and learn to their full potential. \"The environmental contaminants are certainly an issue,\" she says. \"As a society we need to take that into account.\" LiangFocusXiaogan Liang works with the \"focused ion beam\" instrument in the clean room.

The dark color comes from oil left behind by bacteria and animals that lived over 500 million years ago. The white color comes from salt left behind by the sea.\n\nPetroleum Development Oman\n\nGordon Love walked past the warm waters of the Arabian Sea as they lapped on a white sandy beach in the country of Oman. He entered a metal warehouse and walked past row after row of hallways lined with sliding metal doors. Some of these doors concealed an important piece of history.\n\nLove, a geochemist now at the University of California, Riverside, had come to the Middle East to work for an oil company for a couple of weeks. But this trip would also give him a rare chance to look at rocks from deep inside the Earth. It would lead him and his partners to a major new discovery about early life on our planet.\n\nBehind each one of the warehouse's metal doors lay a cylinder of stone about the width and length of a baseball bat. You might call this warehouse a library of both rocks and history. These cylinders of stone \u2014 called cores \u2014 were drilled from the flat and dusty deserts of Oman by people looking for oil. The stone cores were lifted out of drill holes that reach three miles underground. Those drill holes pierced through layer after layer of petrified mud, which contained once-living material that turned into rock over time. This mud collected over millions of years on an ancient sea bed. You can see the layers as stripes of gray, white and brown stone in the cores. If you stacked these cores end to end they would run for miles \u2014 and they would tell the history of this ancient sea now buried beneath the desert.\n\nLove entered a room where dozens of sections of core were laid out on tables. He could tell from the brown color of the stone that it still contained tiny bits of oil. That brown stone was just what he was looking for.\n\nScientist Gordon Love looked at molecular fossils in rocks as deep as 3 miles underground, similar to the dark ones shown here in the desert of Oman.\n\nDavid Fike, Washington University\n\nMolecular fossils\n\nOil doesn't just fuel cars, trucks and airplanes. It also contains a record of the past. Oil contains chemical traces of things that lived hundreds of millions of years ago. Scientists call these chemicals \"molecular fossils.\" They can exist even when more obvious fossils, like the imprints of leaves or seashells pressed into rocks, do not survive the extreme heat and pressure of being buried deep in the Earth.\n\nBy studying the molecular fossils in the cores lifted from drill holes, Love and his colleague, Roger Summons of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), have found evidence of animals that lived as long as 751 million years ago.\n\n\"At present it's the oldest fossil evidence for animals,\" says Love. In fact, it's up to 176 million years older than any other animal fossils that scientists have found.\n\nThis 550 million-year-old fossil from Australia may be the oldest fossil imprint of a sponge.\n\nJames Gehling, South Australia Museum in Adelaide\n\nThe animals that Love found may have been some of the first on Earth. Human eyes have never seen these animals and have never even seen the faint shapes that they left pressed between rocks. The tortures of the deep Earth have long since erased those shapes. But by studying the invisible molecular fossils left behind by these animals, Love and Summons can not only tell that these creatures lived \u2014 they can actually make some guesses about what they looked like.\n\nGreasy black tar\n\nOil forms over millions of years as dead plants, animals and bacteria are buried beneath sand or mud and decompose deep underground. Most of the grease seeps out of rocks and drains into spaces underground where it collects in large pools \u2014 the places where oil companies like to aim their drills. This oil in Oman is the oldest oil that companies have ever tried to drill out of the ground and turn into gasoline. This oil came from bacteria, algae and other critters that lived in an ocean over 500 million years ago.\n\nThe kind of molecular fossil left behind depends on the kind of organism decomposing. Bacterial molecular fossils look different from those fossils left behind by animals, for example. By studying such fossils, Summons and Love hoped to find out what kinds of things were living in the ocean when the rocks formed.\n\nThis adult sponge, about the size of a fist, was found in ankle-deep water in the Great Barrier Reef off Australia's coast.\n\nSally Leys, University of Alberta, Edmonton)\n\nIn the warehouse that day, Love sawed some marble-sized chunks of rock out of the cores. The rock was as hard as cement. He took his little pieces of rock back to Summons' lab in Cambridge, and crushed them into dust. He cooked the dust in acid until he was left with a glob of greasy black tar \u2014 the remains of ancient dead things.\n\nLove spent another two weeks purifying, or removing unwanted material from, this tar until he held in his hand a test tube of colorless liquid. That liquid contained the molecular fossils that he and Summons wanted to analyze. The molecular fossils were invisible to the eye. A person might not even taste the small amounts of them in the tube. But Love could detect the fossils using a refrigerator-sized machine called a GC-MS, or gas chromatograph mass spectrometer.\n\nLove loaded a few drops of the liquid into the GC-MS and watched the computer screen as the machine analyzed the dozens of chemicals.\n\nShown is the larva, or young, of the same species of sponge pictured as an adult. About the size of a grain of salt, this tiny creature was seen through an electron microscope.\n\nSally Leys, University of Alberta, Edmonton)\n\nBlobby sponges\n\nIf you've ever been in a hospital or seen a hospital show on TV, then maybe you've seen the bright line that moves across a heart monitor, tracing out jagged peaks and dips every time a person's heart beats. Love saw something like this as he watched the GC-MS analyze the molecular fossils. A line running across the computer screen traced out a sharp spike every time the machine detected another chemical.\n\nAs Love sat and watched, one of those spikes grabbed his attention: It stood for a chemical called 24-isopropylcholestane, or 24-ipc. Love had seen 24-ipc in rocks before \u2014 it's a well-known chemical \u2014 but seeing it in these old rocks from Oman was a big deal.\n\nScientists consider 24-ipc to be a molecular fossil that comes from animals called sea sponges. Scientists have looked at various animals, fungi and bacteria that live on Earth today to see which chemicals they produce. Researchers have found that sponges produce large amounts of a chemical closely related to 24-ipc. During heating, such as that deep inside the Earth, this chemical slowly changes into 24-ipc. \"Sponges are the only organisms that produce it in any significant quantities,\" says Love.\n\nSea sponges are cigar- or balloon-shaped animals that sit on the seafloor. They eat by filtering bacteria and other tiny organisms out of the water. You wouldn't exactly call sea sponges smart. They have no brains, no eyes, no legs and no fins. They're some of the simplest animals on Earth. Some biologists think sponges were the first animals to evolve, or develop from simpler, single-celled organisms through a process of gradual change over millions of years. So when Love saw 24-ipc in the oil from these old rocks, he knew it was important.\n\nThe oldest known sea sponge fossils that you can see with the naked eye are cup-shaped imprints found in 550-million-year-old rocks. Scientists have also seen blobby imprints, like round, quilted pillows, in rocks as old as 575 million years. (Though some scientists believe that many of these older animal fossils aren't related to modern animals.) Researchers think these imprints were probably made by some kind of animal \u2014 although the blobs are so strange, they don't know what kind of animal. But the molecular sponge fossils that Love had just found were much older than any of those shapes in the rocks. Judging from the age of the rocks from Oman he tested, these sea sponges are at least 635 million years old, and maybe as much as 751 million years old.\n\nA big disagreement\n\nThese findings by Love, Summons, David Fike of Washington University in St. Louis, and nine other scientists will be published on February 5 in a major scientific journal called Nature. Their discovery has a lot of people excited. These new molecular fossils may help to solve a big disagreement about the earliest animals on Earth.\n\nIn other studies, biologists have compared the DNA, a molecule that holds an organism's genetic information, of different animals alive today, such as sponges, clams, insects, worms, mice and humans. Scientists have done this in order to estimate how long ago the first animals lived. These \"molecular clock\" calculations say that the first animals evolved somewhere between 650 and 950 million years ago. And yet the oldest fossil imprints of animals are only 575 million years old.\n\nThat disagreement between the dates from the fossil imprints and the dates from the molecular clocks caused some scientists to wonder whether the molecular clock calculations were wrong. But by showing molecular fossils of animals maybe as old as 751 million years, Summons and Love's new findings have something to say about that disagreement. \"I think this new work is both important and believable,\" says Andrew Knoll, a paleontologist who studies early fossils at Harvard University. \"This goes a long way toward reconciling the geologic record with molecular clock estimates.\"\n\nSwimming in the early oceans\n\nIt makes sense that the first animals might have been sponges or something like them. All animals, whether they live in water or on land, need to breathe oxygen; without it, they suffocate. But 600 or 700 million years ago the Earth hadn't yet filled up with oxygen the way it has today. The oceans probably contained oxygen in their shallowest parts, but the deeper waters likely contained hardly any oxygen.\n\nThis is one reason why it makes sense that sponges are the first animals, says Kevin Peterson of Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. \"Sponges have exceedingly low metabolism,\" he says, meaning that some kinds of sponges consume oxygen slowly compared to other animals, and so such sponges can tolerate lower levels of oxygen.\n\nEven if these ancient animals were closely related to modern-day sponges, Knoll isn't willing to say whether these early animals actually looked like the same big cigar-shaped sponges that we see in our oceans today.\n\nIt's true that adult sponges are big balloons which sit on the sea floor and suck food out of the water. But young sponges, called larvae, look very different. They are tiny \u2014 about the size of a grain of sand. And rather than sitting on the ocean bottom, they swim through the water by whipping around tiny oars on their body that look like hairs.\n\nThe animals that Love detected could have looked more like tiny larvae than big adult sponges. \"If you had been swimming in the same ocean, you might not have noticed them,\" says Knoll."}

Scientists at M.I.T. in Massachusetts claim to have manipulated the dreams of rats in the laboratory, and changed the dreams so that the rats remember different things when they woke up.\n\nThe process involved monitoring the rats' brain activity during the day and again at night and manipulating those brain waves to different patterns. Of course we really can't say what sort of dreams the rats really did have, or even if they dream in the same sort of way that people do, but this is the first stage in a controversial process called \"dream engineering\".

{"text":"Reports On \"Weird Life\" Almost Better Than Fiction\n\nDeinococcus radiodurans can withstand 10,000 times the amount of radiation that would kill a human, earning it monikers like \"Super Bug\" and \"Conan the Bacterium.\"\n\n\"It's just phenomenal how much radiation life can take and remain viable,\" said Daly, a scientist at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, a military medical school in Bethesda, MD.\n\nDaly was one of about 20 scientists who talked about their studies of \"weird life,\" or life in extreme environments, at a recent conference near Big Sky, MT.\n\nSponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the conference will help the space agency finetune programs aimed at understanding how life began in the violent early years of the planet. Those answers may help determine whether life could exist elsewhere in the universe. The gathering was organized by the Thermal Biology Institute at Montana State University-Bozeman.\n\n\"We may be the generation to understand the origins of life,\" said Anne Kinney, director of NASA's Astronomical Search for Origins and Planetary Systems Program.\n\nRecalling how Galileo's discovery of Jupiter's moons altered people's world view in the 16th century, Kinney said astrobiology--or the search for life in outer space--could have a similar impact in our day.\n\n\"It comes down to, 'Are we the center of the universe or not',\" Kinney said.\n\nOn this planet, life is not limited to the cushy places. Microbes--mostly bacteria and organisms from a domain of life called archaea--live in some of the coldest, hottest, deepest, driest, saltiest, most acidic, nutrient-poor and oxygen-deprived environments scientists have thought to look.\n\n\"It's a burgeoning field,\" said John Spear of the University of Colorado. \"People are literally beginning to look under the rocks.\"\n\nD. radiodurans was living in swollen tins of irradiated meat when discovered in Oregon in the 1950s. Studies revealed a unique, almost bizarre, ability to repair numerous DNA double strand breaks--the most lethal kind of genetic damage--within hours.\n\n\"Its DNA is highly damaged at 1.7 million rads ,\" Daly said. (One thousand rads is deadly to humans.) \"Its DNA is all chopped up. There are between 1,000 and 2,000 DNA fragments per cell, but they're all fixed in about 24 hours.\"\n\nEngineering D. radiodurans so it also has an appetite for toxic compounds associated with nuclear waste would create an alternative (and cheaper) cleanup method for the nation's 3,000 nuclear waste sites, Daly said. So far such work, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, looks promising.\n\nThe potential usefulness of \"extremophiles\" cropped up repeatedly during the two-day meeting. After all, an enzyme isolated from a bacterium living in a Yellowstone National Park hot spring has made possible DNA fingerprinting and a host of related genetic studies and processes.\n\nMany at the conference want to know how well the organisms they find in the planet's meanest places are actually doing. Do they play active parts in their ecosystems or are they just hanging out? Bacteria frozen in Antarctic lake ice \"barely can handle it,\" said MSU ecologist John Priscu, whereas microbes in hotsprings in Yellowstone National Park appear to be fairly well adapted.\n\n\"Living a poor man's existence\"is how Florida State microbiologist Imre Friedmann described microbes clinging to the underside of stones in hot dry deserts like the Atacama in Chile. A doyen of the group, Friedmann has studied extremophiles in both hot and cold environments, including the Siberian permafrost, since the 1950s.\n\n\"But only lately have I begun to understand what makes them live and die,\" he told the group.\n\nHot, dry environments are harsher than cold ones because the limiting factor is water.\n\n\"In a super-cold environment, the limiting factor is not the cold itself but the lack of warm hours,\" Friedmann said. \"They need some heat to keep alive.\"\n\nBut what makes the clock stop altogether is dehydration, said James Clegg from the University of California at Davis. That is, unless you're a microscopic invertebrate.\n\nThe embryos of brine shrimp called artemia can almost totally dry out without dying, and then rehydrate themselves when there's water. Nematodes and an organism called tardigrade can survive nearly 98 percent dehydration.\n\nDry Copper Kills Bacteria On Contact(Feb. 22, 2011) \u2014 Metallic copper surfaces kill microbes on contact, decimating their populations, according to new research.

Hundreds of people and a variety of technologies were quickly deployed to help restore the area. But arguably, the most effective cleaning agent came in the form of naturally occurring, oil-devouring bacteria.\n\nTerry Hazen, UT\/ORNL Governor's Chair for Environmental Biotechnology, is an environmental biologist who specializes in bioremediation. In other words, he examines how bacteria breaks down and detoxifies hazardous materials.\n\nIn the wake of the Gulf disaster, Hazen seized the opportunity to advance his research. The result was a paper he co-authored that appeared on the cover of Environmental Microbiology titled \"Deep-Sea Bacteria Enriched by Oil and Dispersant from the Deepwater Horizon Spill.\" It documented microbial communities and their natural ability to remove spilled oil from the environment.\n\nTerry Hazen\n\n\"We are trying to look at and understand environmental systems from the molecular level right up through the ecosystem level and everything in between,\" Hazen said.\n\n\"There's a lot of hidden information. Ultimately, we want to understand how organisms create a community, as well as the resilience of the community.\"\n\nBy studying the relationship between these communities, scientists hope to be able to calculate how they will react when pollutants such as hydrocarbons are introduced and, in turn, how that affects the overall ecosystem.\n\nCertain microbes\u2013primarily bacteria and fungi\u2013are known to break down oil into carbon dioxide and water through a process similar to human digestion by harnessing the released energy to sustain themselves. Over millions of years, some bacteria developed the ability to produce enzymes specific to different aspects of the oil-degradation process. Basically, the bacteria have evolved to be picky eaters.\n\nHazen and his team investigated a group of organisms in the Gulf of Mexico that preferred to feast on alkanes\u2013a saturated hydrocarbon consisting only of hydrogen and carbon atoms that is typically the dominant component in fuels. The team found that after the alkane-eating bacteria finished eating, the community structure changed and other bacteria stepped up to the buffet line.\n\n\"Once particular hydrocarbons were degraded, the community switched and organisms that could effectively compete for what was left began to compete for food,\" Hazen said. \"We saw a natural progression of keystone species in the community as the oil degraded.\"\n\nThe discovery got Hazen thinking about the pattern of succession and how species composition changes when different hydrocarbons are introduced into the environment. He decided to recreate the Deepwater Horizon conditions in a lab to study transformations within the microbial community and determine which specific members could degrade oil, regardless of whether or not dispersants were used.\n\n\"Ultimately, we learned that microbial communities in the Gulf of Mexico have a high potential for degradation of oil and have adapted rapidly to the introduction of hydrocarbons,\" Hazen said.\n\nThis knowledge could prove highly beneficial for similar cleanup and restoration efforts in the future. By knowing how microbial communities will behave in specific hydrocarbon-heavy areas, researchers will be better prepared to assist with immediate restoration. It also could potentially save money by curtailing the use of expensive chemical dispersants.\n\nInterestingly, Hazen found that the bacteria do not just incorporate the oil into their bodies; they completely convert it into proteins, carbohydrates, and their DNA structure. The next step is to investigate how the molecular level transformation affects biological processes on the systems level.\n\n\"We want to understand how currents and weather affect the overall community,\" Hazen said. \"That's why I say we are taking a biological systems approach.\"\n\nUnderstanding how these other factors influence microbial communities will help scientists evaluate how global climate change could alter their hydrocarbon degrading abilities.\n\nAs the demand for crude oil increases, the chances of future spills occuring also increase. Because of his work on the Deepwater Horizon spill, Hazen was named lead investigator for a multi-disciplinary, multi-university research team funded by BP to study potential deep sea drilling sites around the world and assess the environmental risks.\n\n\"This research will potentially give us some really exciting results,\" Hazen said. \"All of these sites are quite deep and might have different types of crude oil, which may help us understand the hydrocarbon transformations occurring in the microbial community and how different or similar they are at each site.\"\n\nOnce scientists understand how the many variables affect microbial communities, they should be able to predict how the microbes will react to the introduction of hydrocarbons in their environment. Will they be as hungry as the ones in the Gulf? Or will the community structure change completely?\n\nHazen's previous work on bioremediation technologies has lead to five patents. He recently submitted a proposal for a collaborative strategic environmental research development program that would involve scientists from a variety of disciplines to study the resilience of our natural world.\n\n\"Mother Nature has an incredible resiliency to clean herself up after we make a mess,\" Hazen said. \"I'm worried about the fact that in the Gulf of Mexico, she's had too many catastrophic events, and how resilient she actually is, but my hope is that this research will help us understand how resilient Mother Nature can be in the future.\"\n\n]]>0primmc>[caption>0admin.]]>Andrew Fist and Dimitrios Kakavelakis III, graduate students at the UT Space Institute, have won first- and second]]>000admin.]]>"}

{"text":"Contact\/News Media\n\nFriday, December 18, 2009\n\nAnyone remember the Y2K scare? Fears that a fluke of technology would cause our entire digital world to crash with the 2000 calendar rollover were a mere distraction.As we enter 2010, we're hoping technology can save us from climate change.\n\nThe first decade of the 21st century flew by, with changes coming at breakneck speed. It's a good time to peer into the crystal ball of research. eScienceCommons asked Emory scientists for their views on key advances during the past 10 years, and what may be in store by 2020.\n\n\"The most important thing that's happened is the recalibration of our perception of the world, and a clarification of the real challenges,\" says David Lynn, chair of chemistry. \"That relates to everything from how we understand the origins of life, to the emerging focus on predictive health, and our increased understanding of the need for renewable energy.\"\n\nLynn cited the sequencing of the human genome and the identification of new planets as two events that shook the foundations of our social structure.\n\nNASA photo\n\n\"The existence of other planets was predicted decades ago, but now we've accumulated hard evidence that we're clearly not alone \u2013 our solar system is not the only one,\" he says. \"And what are we going to look for on these other planets that could allow life to emerge and evolution to start? I think that is where the fun begins.\"\n\nThe fast pace of discovery contributed to a polarization of views on research, particularly in areas such as stem cells and evolution.\n\n\"The theme of our recent Evolution Revolution conference was that the world is changing very quickly, and we need to understand what that means so we can make better informed decisions,\" Lynn says.\"The important problems, and the fact that many are interconnected, have become more clearly defined. This clarification attracts people's attention, and means the chance of finding viable solutions goes way up.\"\n\n\"We are taking principles that are central to evolution and probing them to use in different ways,\" Lynn says. \"It's a great time to be a scientist \u2013 the sky is no longer the limit.\"\n\nFor neuroscientist Elaine Walker, one of the biggest breakthroughs was the growing awareness of genetic plasticity, or the idea that DNA is not necessarily destiny. \"In the past, it was generally assumed that with only a few exceptions the individual genotype was fixed at conception, and that its effects on human health and disease were relatively fixed across the life span,\" Walker says.\n\nIn recent years, however, we've learned that genetic mutations in the form of copy number variations and microdeletions occur much more frequently than was previously assumed. \"It now appears that these mutations can occur in embryogenesis, and that they can confer risks for autism, schizophrenia and a range of other disorders,\" Walker says.\n\nAdding to this paradigm shift is our understanding of epigenetics: changes in the expression of genes due to a person's physical and psycho-social environment. \"I think during the next decade, we're going to see more focus on applications of epigenetics for the treatment of everything from cancer to heart disease,\" says Victor Corces, chair of biology and one of the pioneers of the field.\n\nWe have also learned that the brain changes significantly across the life span, a finding that overlaps with genetic plasticity. \"These developments have made our research much more complex,\" Walker says, \"but they also provide us with much more optimism about our opportunities to prevent illness.\"\n\nWalker is studying whether it might be possible to identify the changes in gene expression occurring in some young people that are causing a change in brain funciton that can put them at risk for psychotic disorders.\n\nThe theory of grounded cognition has revolutionized studies of the mind during the past decade, says psychologist Larry Barsalou, a leading researcher in this field. \"Previously, it was argued that you could study the cognitive system in isolation. Now, we realize that you cannot understand cognition without grounding it into the body and the sensory motor system and the world,\" he explains.\n\nWhen you think about walking, for instance, your brain fires the same parts that operate when you are actually walking.\n\nResearch is increasingly showing the impact of social processes, culture, development and emotion on cognition, he adds. \"I think that during the next 10 to 30 years, theories and research of cognition processes and social processes will be increasingly integrated.\"\n\nEverything needs to be studied from an interdisciplinary perspective, Barsalou says. \"A big question is how to build programs that foster this kind of work. Psychology departments are becoming very strange beasts.\"\n\nDeboleena Roy's research spans women's studies, philosophy, neuroscience and bioethics. During the past decade, the long struggle of women and minorities to be included in clinical trials began paying off, she says. Studies of biological differences can raise thorny issues about race and gender, she adds, stressing that we need to move forward with knowledge of the mistakes of history.\n\n\"People who are the subject of research need to be involved in generating the research questions,\" Roy says. \"The day of the scientist in a white coat working alone in a lab is over. Scientists have to learn to connect to the broader community.\"\n\n\"We're entering completely new territory,\" says Taylor, a computer scientist specialized in bioinformatics. \"DNA sequencing technology is becoming faster and cheaper, but this transition is just happening.\"\n\nWithin five years, he adds, the complex data sets they are mining through a grant will likely become much cheaper and more easily obtainable.\n\nPsychologist Joe Manns, whose work focuses on the biology of memory, views the use of genetically engineered mice and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as transformational. While both these technologies were developed prior to the past decade, they matured and hit their stride during the past 10 years, he says.\n\nHe believes that the emerging technology of optogenetics \u2013 using high-speed optics to control genetically targeted neurons \u2013 will likely help fuel memory discoveries in the coming decade.\"Now we can put a wire into a brain and induce neurons within a region of the brain to fire, but we can't control which neurons,\" Mann says. \"Optogenetics gives you anatomical precision, allowing you to target a specific neuron, along with temporal precision, because the pulses of light operate in milliseconds.\"\n\nThe past decade saw wireless devices like iPods and iPhones become almost physical extensions of the human body. Google became a household word \u2013 both as a noun and a verb \u2013 as search engine technology connected our collective digital mind.\n\nMonday, December 14, 2009\n\nMost people know they are not going to get rich playing the lottery. But if you just want to buy some tickets for fun, can you improve your odds? Is a bigger jackpot a better bet? How big is big enough?\n\nWhen lottery prizes climb into hundreds of millions of dollars, these are the kinds of questions Emory mathematicians Aaron Abrams (above, right) and Skip Garibaldi (above, left) get from their students. The pair decided to conduct an analysis, applying math and economic theory to analyze the rates of return and risks associated with lottery tickets. \"We wanted solid numbers to help explain why playing the lottery is not a good plan,\" Garibaldi explains.\n\nTheir mathematical models for the interstate lottery Mega Millions and its competitor, Powerball, demonstrated that as the jackpots grow and more tickets are sold, the extra tickets nullify the benefit of the bigger jackpot.\n\nSmaller, single-state lotteries like Georgia's Fantasy 5 offered better rates of return, due to the larger ratio of jackpot size to total number of tickets sold, according to their analysis. \"To our great surprise, in some cases single-state lotteries have had positive rates of return as high as 30 percent,\" Abrams says. \"That is, for these drawings a $1 ticket would give you back $1.30 on average. We didn't expect this.\"\n\nSo why not buy lottery tickets instead of stocks? Because the odds are you won't win the lottery.\n\n\"The technical word for this is risk,\" Garibaldi says. \"The high rate of return is only an average for all lottery tickets for a particular drawing, and most people in that drawing will not win the jackpot.\"\n\nThe two mathematicians applied modern portfolio theory, pioneered by economist Harry Markowitz, to compare the potential return and risk of a savings account, various stocks and bonds and lottery tickets. \"When we ran the analysis, the result was: don't buy lottery tickets,\" Garibaldi says. \"It's too risky. Even the enormous returns we found were not enough to counteract the enormous likelihood of not winning the lottery.\"\n\nSo most people already know this intuitively, right? What's the point of spelling it out in precise mathematical and economics terms?\n\n\"Most people don't fully understand risk,\" Abrams says. He points out that when people make decisions about how to allocate their money in an IRA, the prospectus gives the rate of return, but doesn't attempt to quantify the risks. \"I strongly feel that mutual fund prospectuses should include the risk data,\" Abrams says. \"It's important for people to understand how they are spending their money.\"\n\nThe recent collapse of the financial system illustrates the importance of driving home the fundamentals of risk, say the two mathematicians, who both teach probability theory to freshmen.\n\n\"The field of probability has developed rapidly during the past 50 years, and we have a tremendous understanding of how randomness works,\" Abrams says. \"But as our understanding of probability gets better, financial instruments keep growing increasingly complex.\"\n\nTo sum up the lesson in their lottery analysis for students: Math studies are a sure bet and a great investment.\n\nThursday, December 10, 2009\n\nEmory researchers have generated the first transgenic prairie voles, a key step toward unlocking the genetic secrets of pair bonding. The advancement by Emory's Yerkes National Primate Research Center will enable scientists to perform genetic manipulations to help identify the brain mechanisms of complex social behaviors. The work, in the current issue of the Biology of Reproduction, may also have important implications for understanding and treating psychiatric disorders associated with impairments in social behavior.\n\nThe prairie vole is a naturally occurring monogamous rodent that is being used to discover the brain mechanisms underlying monogamous pair bonds.\n\n\"Domesticated lab rats and mice dominate biomedical research, but wild rodent species with more complex social behaviors are better suited for investigating the biology of the social brain. Until now, genetic engineering among rodents has been limited to lab mice and rats,\" says Zoe Donaldson, the lead researcher.\n\nSingle-cell prairie vole embryos were injected with a lentivirus containing a gene found in glowing jellyfish. The gene encodes a green fluorescent protein, which glows under the appropriate conditions. The prairie vole that developed from this embryo expressed the green fluorescent protein throughout its body, and the foreign gene was passed on to the offspring for multiple generations.\n\nLarry Young, a senior investigator on the study and an expert in social behavior, will use this technology to determine whether monogamy and its associated social behaviors can be affected by manipulating a single gene. Researchers are also investigating ways to refine this technology in order to alter gene expression in certain brain regions as well as at certain developmental milestones.\n\n\"This device has broad potential, not only for getting more accurate counts of mosquito populations, but for better understanding mosquito ecology,\" says Gonzalo Vazquez-Prokopec, the invention's namesake. Vazquez-Prokopec is a post-doctoral fellow working with Uriel Kitron, chair and professor of environmental studies.\n\n\"There is a great need for effective and affordable mosquito sampling methods. Use of the Prokopack can increase the coverage area, and the quality of the data received, especially for blood-fed mosquitoes. Ultimately, it can help us develop better health intervention strategies.\"\n\nIn both field and lab tests, the Prokopack outperformed the current gold standard for resting mosquito surveillance \u2013 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Backpack Aspirator (CDC-BP). In addition to having a longer reach, enabling it to collect more mosquitoes than the CDC-BP, the Prokopack is significantly smaller, lighter, cheaper and easier to build.\n\nAnyone with access to a hardware store, and about $45 to $70, can make the Prokopack, which uses a battery-powered motor to suck up live mosquitoes for analysis. Mosquito-borne diseases rank among the world's top killers, and Vazquez-Prokopec hopes that more affordable and efficient surveillance methods will help save lives.\n\n\"I come from a developing country,\" says the Argentine native. \"I understand what it feels like to know that there is a health technology available, and to not have the money to access it.\"\n\nFor decades, public health officials have struggled to conduct mosquito surveillance. One early method, with obvious drawbacks, was to expose a bit of skin and count the bites. Another low-tech method is to spray inside a home with insecticide, and gather the bugs that fall onto on a drop cloth.\n\nMosquito traps baited with a chemical that mimics human sweat are sometimes used to catch live adult insects. But these traps capture only females who are looking for a meal.\n\nThe CDC-BP can quickly vacuum up samples of live specimens, which can be analyzed in a lab to determine the source of blood they recently consumed. The drawbacks to the CDC-BP, however, include its heavy weight (25 pounds), its bulk and its price \u2013 about $450 to $750 in the United States.\n\nWith a bit of ingenuity and a few trips to the hardware store, the research team put together a solution: a plastic container, a wire screen, a plumbing pipe coupler, a battery-powered blower motor and painter extension poles. After some experimentation with these components, the Prokopack was born.\n\n\"It's not like we woke up one day and said, 'Let's invent a mosquito aspirator,'\" Vazquez-Prokopec explains. \"It grew out of our needs during field research.\"\n\nComparative tests with the Prokopack and the CDC-BP were conducted outdoors and in sewer tunnels during the Emory lab's Atlanta research projects. Additional field tests were done during a dengue fever study in Iquitos, Peru, where public health technicians are trying to control mosquitoes in homes. The Prokopack, which weighs less than two pounds, collected more mosquitoes than the CDC-BP, and reached higher into ceilings and into foliage.\n\nCollecting more mosquitoes in higher locations can give researchers more insights into their behaviors. Upper foliage, for instance, can yield more mosquitoes resting after feeding on birds. And upper walls and ceilings of homes may harbor more mosquitoes resting after a meal on humans.\n\nThursday, December 3, 2009\n\nCapuchin monkeyscan recognize familiar individuals in photographs, a study by the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory has found. The discovery is in the current online edition of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\"The study not only reveals that capuchin monkeys are able to individually recognize familiar faces, but it also convincingly demonstrates they understand the two-dimensional representational nature of photographs,\" says lead researcher Jennifer Pokorny. \"The fact these monkeys correctly determined which faces belonged to in-group versus out-group members, corresponding to their personal experiences, validates the conclusion that capuchin monkeys view images of faces as humans do -- as individuals they do or do not know.\n\nFor the study, the capuchins viewed photographs of four different faces. One of the four pictures was of a capuchin from their own group, which they needed to tell apart from three strangers. They also needed to do the reverse, differentiating one stranger from three familiar individuals.\n\n\"This required monkeys to look at similar-looking faces and use their personal knowledge of group mates to solve the task,\" says Pokorny. \"They readily performed the task and continued to do well when shown new pictures in color and in gray-scale, as well as when presented with individuals they had never before seen in pictures, though with whom they were personally familiar.\"\n\nResearchers often use two-dimensional images in experiments, yet there is little conclusive evidence to suggest nonhuman primates, particularly monkeys, truly understand the image represents individuals or items in real life.\n\nPokorny trained under Emory primatologist Frans de Waal, who says the study is the first to show face recognition in monkeys is fundamentally similar to that in humans, indicating that face recognition is an evolutionarily ancient ability. De Waal is director of the Yerkes Living Links Center."}

Not only are there approximately a bajillion different kinds, but we also haven't completely nailed down how they actually produce an antidepressant effect. However, a new study from a group of researchers at Columbia University suggests there may be a link between antidepressants and a similarly confusing group of brain areas called the default mode network (DMN).\n\nThe study, published in February in JAMA Psychiatry, first used functional-connectivity MRI to show that patients with dysthymia show a higher baseline level of activity in their DMN. Then, after 10 weeks with either duloxetine or placebo, the patients' brain activity was measured again. Patients who had received the antidepressant showed brain activity in the DMN more like control subjects than those patients who just got the placebo. The authors conclude that antidepressant treatments \"normalize\" activity in the DMN.\n\nBut there are a couple problems here. First, what exactly is the default mode network? Well, it's a group of brain areas that \"lights up\" in brain imaging between tasks. It's sometimes used to describe the brain's resting state. But it also can be selectively activated when subjects are given self-directed tasks (like asking a participant \"what did you buy at the store?\" rather than \"what did your roommate buy at the store?\"). And while previous studies have shown that DMN activity is higher in depressed patients than in control subjects, what that means in terms of therapy (pharmacological or otherwise) has yet to be understood.\n\nSecond, brain imaging is always, by necessity, nothing more than correlated with behavior. Which makes it pretty difficult to draw any giant conclusions here. And third, possibly most importantly, the authors did not see any correlation between improvement of dysthymia symptoms and DMN activity. That's right. Even though they'd like us to believe DMN activation plays a crucial role in depression and antidepressants, they really only found half that story. And it's a really muddled story to begin with.\n\nSo, what exactly are we supposed to do with this? Right now, I'd say nothing.\n\nWhat is oral allergy syndrome?\n\nActually it's a lot like \"The Fugitive\"\n\nIt's a case of mistaken identity. Persecuted for crimes they didn't commit, raw fruits and veggies can incite a series of puzzling allergic reactions if oral allergy syndrome is around to mess things up.\n\nImagine a humble apple as our Dr. Richard Kimble (obviously, still played by David Janssen). That apple is a great, upstanding piece of deliciousness. It's packed with vitamin C, gives you a sweet dose of natural sugar, and pays its taxes on time. That apple only wanted to help. And it definitely did not murder its wife.\n\nBut, like Kimble, that apple had one important force working against it \u2013 its proteins are unfortunately similar to the allergens found in birch tree pollen. And in people who already have seasonal allergies to pollen, oral allergy syndrome (OAS) causes the body to confuse those otherwise harmless apple proteins for the birch pollen ones. So, unlike other allergies to things like pollen, dust, and animal dander, OAS isn't just your immune system being oversensitive. And unlike classic food allergies, it's not really the food you're allergic to."}

{"text":"One of the two winners is a canadian PhD student in chemistry and, from the look of his videos, an all-around goof. I certainly got a few laughs out of his video, and I thought his explanation was the clearest I've ever heard.\n\nWhile in Europe on a work trip and grabbing a bite for lunch at a caf\u00e9, I grabbed a bottle of water on my way to pay without checking the label. Checking the label is important, because in Europe, \"still\" water and \"sparkling\" (carbonated) water are sold side by side\u2014and I can't stand the taste of sparkling water. Halfway through eating lunch, I opened the water bottle to have a drink and it sprayed water all over my tray and my clothes.\n\nI'd grabbed the wrong sort of water. Not only that, I'd obviously shaken it at some point.\n\nBecause I'd opened it, I couldn't return it for a bottle of still water, so I decided to de-sparkle the sparkling water, in the hopes that it would improve the taste. Fortunately, this requires no special equipment and can be done in a caf\u00e9, although it might draw some funny looks.\n\nWhile we usually calculate reaction rates based on the concentrations found in the bulk solution, in a case of a surface reaction, that's out where no reaction is happening! The equations for reaction rates empirically account for this in the constants, where the reaction rate is rolled together with the rate the reagents diffuse toward the surface to react and the rate the reaction products diffuse away from the surface and out of the way.\n\nBut in terms of designing a reaction, controlling it to get, say, the product we want instead of a byproduct if there are two possible reactions, or speeding it up or slowing it down, what happens at the surface can be key. And whether we watch or measure, knowing what happens at the surface is the first step toward changing what happens at the surface.\n\nEpidemiology, the statistical study of population health instead of a single person's health, has taken population-wide sampling to a new level\u2014underground.\n\nInstead of collecting data on individuals representing a subset of the population and then averaging it, the researchers let an existing piece of infrastructure do the averaging for them. This also made sure they were actually getting properly anonymized data from every single resident of the study area\u2014because the area of study was \"everybody connected to the sewer\", and everybody who has one, uses the toilet.\n\nI was on a work trip and sitting in the lunchroom at a client site, chatting with the operators there. It was a friendly group, and we got to know each other reasonably well in our lunchtime conversations. I and one of the locals were talking about running and race training, being both runners. Another of the operators mentioned that he occasionally ran a mile at the track, and was asking about training for a 5k race, three times farther than he had run before.\n\nBecause he and I both find running more than a mile or so on the track unutterably boring (I think he hadn't run more than a mile on the track partly because he was bored, not because he was too tired to continue) I suggested that he run on the street, through the neighbourhood where he lived, so at least the scenery was a bit different. I frequently use google maps' walking directions tool to plot out a route of the distance I want to run when I'm not in the mood for an out-and-back straight line run, especially in an unfamiliar city.\n\nHe laughed and said he couldn't do that. Because he predicted a response to him being out running along the sidewalk: \"Honey, call the cops! There's a black man running!\" And the rest of the group laughed, because they knew it was true.\n\nIt had never in my life occurred to me to even think that somebody might call the police on me while I was out minding my own business on a training run.\n\nOne morning, my co-worker picked up a hard hat off a chair in the site office trailer. This would normally have been a perfectly normal thing but on this day, there was a tarantula hiding in the cozy, dark, and air-conditioned cool place it had found overnight.\n\nAfter a bit of surprised dancing, the tarantula was left alone. They're pretty mellow and not dangerous, and besides, we had to get to work outside in the hot.\n\nA while later when we went back into the office, the tarantula was on the ceiling. With a hard hat minus its harness, we got the tarantula into the hard hat to put it outside. After, of course, my co-worker asked for a photo of himself with the tarantula.\n\nThe tarantulas, as scary as they look, weren't the scary ones in that area. It was the sort of place where you banged your boots around a few times before putting them on in the morning to make sure nothing had taken refuge inside.\n\nI never had anything inside my boots, but one morning I did wake up to a scorpion on my pants.\n\nYou know the sugar maple, which produces the raw material for maple syrup by dripping sap into a bucket in the spring. Well, it turns out that it's not only a case of the sugar maple's sap being particularly sweet and thus well suited for this use. The sugar maple, along with a couple of other trees, are the only ones which drip their sap out in a way that can be usefully collected, and it is also particularly sweet.\n\nThe question, or rather questions, are:\n\nWhy only a few types of tree?\n\nWhy does this only happen during spring thaw, in certain temperature conditions?\n\nI've been busy lately so I haven't had time to put together any good posts. In the interim, here's some interesting reading. The first sentence describes me perfectly, but then I'm one of the group named in it as well: \"It's the number one pet peeve of just about every chemical professional I talk to: why is 'chemical' such a dirty word in the minds of so many people?\"\n\nEven people who have some interest in chemistry can fall prey to this. I was talking to a friend (who does have an interest in chemistry) recently and this came up, and he pulled out a few of the classics about synthesized things not being tested \"enough\" (even though it's been my experience that for many chemophobes there is never a level that will be \"enough\") using \"unnatural\" or \"chemical\" as a loose synonym for dangerous\u2014acknowledging immediately when I pointed out that there are plenty of natural poisons, because he does know more than a little about chemistry, BUT...\n\nIt's easier to argue with strangers about this, than with friends; at least I find it so. It sucks when friends hit your pet peeves, and it's easier to walk away from strangers who do the same.\n\nOk, this isn't chemistry, or engineering, but I think it's pretty cool.\n\nArchaeologists found king Richard III, for real. The location and battle wounds and twisted spine were excellent clues, but the DNA test comparing the skeleton to two people descended from his sister confirmed it.\n\nDNA testing is chemistry-related, right? Ok, this post is chemistry related after all :-)\n\nI was out snowshoeing with a friend not long ago, and ate some snow because I was thirsty. My friend made a comment about the \"distilled water\" taste of snow, and I suddenly realized something that, really, I've known all along\u2014snow effectively is distilled water.\n\nWater distillation involves vaporizing impure water, then condensing the water vapour back to a liquid. In the case of snow, water vapour in the air freezes directly into snowflake form, making them pure\u2014distilled\u2014water.\n\nRaindrops, on the other hand, while they also condense out of the water vapour in the air, absorb other vapours into the drop. There are some things that absorb more easily than others, SO2 being one of the well known pollutant related compounds that absorbs easily into water, and which makes acid rain. It's a little harder (but not impossible) to dissolve other stuff into solids."}

The Mars Orbiter Mission, expected to be launched in mid-October this year, will carry five experimental payloads with a total weight of 14.49 kg. The Methane Sensor for Mars, which will be capable of scanning the entire Martian disc within six minutes, will weigh 3.59 kg. Earlier missions to Mars had detected Methane in the thin Martian atmosphere, but the discovery is yet to be corroborated.\n\nNEW DELHI: The Mines Ministry wants geo-scientists to take up the cause of groundwater in India. Dinsha J Patel , the minister of state in the ministry of mines warned that demand for agricultural and drinking water is ever increasing. \"I, visualize an acute problem of water shortage in the coming years especially in the drought prone areas.

Through a new game, aptly titled A Slower Speed of Light, game designers there have created a first-person prototype game in which the speed of light slowly decelerates as the user progresses through the game, bringing the effects of special relativity down to walking speed.\n\nA Slower Speed of Light is built on top of Game Lab's own custom-built, open-source relativistic game engine imbued with all of the strange effects of relativity. But rather than taking the user up to the speed of light, where these effects would be far easier observed, the game brings the speed of light down to the user.\n\nSarah, an 11-year-old cheetah at the Cincinnati Zoo, set a new world speed record this summer during a shoot for National Geographic magazine. She first earned the title of world's fastest land mammal in 2009 when she covered 100 meters in 6.13 seconds, breaking the previous mark of 6.19 seconds set by a male South African cheetah named Nyana in 2001. On June 20, 2012 Sarah's top speed was clocked at 61 mph.\n\nHer run was photographed for a November 2012 National Geographic magazine article that will include never-before-seen high speed photographs and video of cheetah movement.\n\nCameras captured the record-breaking run on Sarah's first attempt on a specially designed course certified by the Road Running Technical Council of USA Track & Field.\n\nSarah and the Cincinnati Zoo's other four cheetahs in the Cat Ambassador Program regularly run at the Zoo's Regional Cheetah Breeding Facility.

The Cincinnati Zoo has been dubbed \"The Cheetah Capital of the World\" because of its conservation efforts through education, public interpretation, and the captive cheetah breeding program. The Zoo's Regional Cheetah Breeding Center is one of only four similar facilities in the United States managed by the Species Survival Plan.

{"text":"Category: Living World\n\nErika Check Hayden is a journalist at Nature and educator in San Francisco. Her work has taken her to wild and beautiful places, but focuses most of the time on the inner terrain of the human body. You can find her online at erikacheck.com and twitter.com\/Erika_Check.\n\nA few years ago, Eric Klavins found himself starting at the ceiling of his room in the Athenaeum, a private lodging on the grounds of the California Institute of Technology, in the middle of the night. Unable to sleep, Klavins was instead pondering a question that had been posed to him earlier that day at a meeting.\n\nKlavins, a robotics researcher, was funded by grants from the U.S. Air Force and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) on robot self-organization: making many simple robots work together to assemble themselves into a shape or structure. While working on the grants, Klavins would routinely be called into meetings to discuss his work with various defense officials, and it was at one of these meetings that a Defense Department researcher had posed his question. \"He said, 'Do you think you could figure out how something that has been broken up into lots of little pieces could be reassembled so we could figure out what it was?'\" he recalls.\n\nKlavins spent hours thinking about how one could actually do it. Then, he realized, he had no idea why one would even want to\u2014and hadn't asked that question at all during all the years he worked with Defense Department funding. He suddenly felt uncomfortable about that. \"It bothered me that someone would spend their time studying how things get blown up and working to make things get blown up better,\" Klavins says. Not long after, he decided to steer away from defense funding and towards applications in biology and medical research that are part of the realm of synthetic biology, the field of science that tries to turn biology into more of an engineering discipline.\n\nBut if Klavins thought that the change would help him escape the moral dilemmas that used to keep him up in the middle of the night, he was wrong. The U.S. Department of Defense has emerged as one of the major funders of synthetic biology; last fall, for instance, DARPA accepted proposals for a highly coveted set of grants in a new program, Living Foundries, that aims to \"enable the rapid development of previously unattainable technologies and products, leveraging biology to solve challenges associated with production of new materials, novel capabilities, fuel and medicines.\"\n\nSo what did LeVaux get so wrong, and, once all of the wheat was sorted from the chaff, was there anything to what he was trying to say?\n\nAt the heart of the fracas is LeVaux's claim that a class of molecules called miRNA is a reason to fear GMOs specifically, more than any other food plant or animal. miRNA, which is short for microRNA, is a class of molecules that perform various tasks in plants and animals. They were first discovered about twenty years ago, in nematode worms, and they regulate gene expression by binding the messenger RNA involved in translating a gene into a protein. The messenger RNA carries the \"message\" of the DNA's sequence to a group of enzymes that translate it into the amino acid sequence of a protein. But if a miRNA binds to a messenger RNA, the message is destroyed, and the protein is never made. Thus, miRNA can be a powerful tool for preventing the expression of genes. In fact, that is what's made it such an important lab tool in recent years: it allows researchers to knock down the expression of genes without physically removing them from an organism's genome.\n\nIn the paper that LeVaux pegged his article on, Nanjing University researchers found that miRNAs usually seen in rice were circulating in the blood of humans, and that mice fed rice had the miRNA in their blood as well. That particular miRNA, in its native context, regulates plant development. When the researchers added it to human cells, it appeared to bind to the messenger RNA of a gene involved in removing cholesterol from the blood. Previous papers had found that plants have plenty of miRNA floating around in them [pdf] (as does just about everything we eat, since plants and animals make them by the thousands), but having them show up whole and unmolested in blood, apparently after digestion, was a new and very intriguing discovery.\n\nMalcolm MacIver is a bioengineer at Northwestern University who studies the neural and biomechanical basis of animal intelligence. He also consults for sci-fi films (e.g., Tron Legacy), and was the science advisor for the TV show Caprica.\n\nA few years ago, the world was aflame with fears about the virulent H5N1 avian flu, which infected several hundred people around the world and killed about 300 of them. The virus never acquired the ability to move between people, so it never became the pandemic we feared it might be. But recently virologists have discovered a way to mutate the bird flu virus that makes it more easily transmitted. The results were about to be published in Science and Nature when the U.S. government requested that the scientists and the journal withhold details of the method to make the virus. The journals have agreed to this request. Because the information being withheld is useful to many other scientists, access to the redacted paragraphs will be provided to researchers who pass a vetting process currently being established.\n\nAs a scientist, the idea of having any scientific work withheld is one that does not sit well. But then, I work mostly on \"basic science,\" which is science-speak for \"unlikely to matter to anyone in the foreseeable future.\" But in one area of work, my lab is developing new propulsion techniques for high-agility underwater robots and sensors that use weak electric fields to \"see\" in complete darkness or muddy water. This work, like a lot of engineering research, has the potential to be used in machines that harm people. I reassure myself of the morality of my efforts by the length of the chain of causation from my lab to such a device, which doesn't seem much shorter than the chain for colleagues making better steels or more powerful engines. But having ruminated about my possible involvement with an Empire of Dark Knowledge, here's my two cents about how to balance the right of free speech and academic freedom with dangerous consequences.\n\nConsider the following thought experiment: suppose there really is a Big Red Button to launch the nukes, one in the U.S., and one in Russia, each currently restricted to their respective heads of government. Launching the nukes will surely result in the devastation of humanity. I'm running for president, and as part of my techno-libertarian ideology, I believe that \"technology wants to be free\" and I decide to put my money where my slogan is by providing every household in the U.S. with their very own Big Red Button (any resemblance to a real presidential candidate is purely accidental).\n\nIf you think this is a good idea, the rest of this post is unlikely to be of interest. But, if you agree that this is an extraordinarily bad idea, then let's continue.\n\nSex, a biological function of reproduction, should be simple. We need to perpetuate the species, we have sex, babies are born, we raise them , they have sex, repeat. Simple, however, is one thing sex most certainly is not. And it's only getting more complex by the day.\n\nFor those who are fans of human exceptionalism, it might be worth considering that the trait which differentiates us from all other animals is that we over-complicate everything. Sex, and its various accoutrements of sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, libido, and even how many partners one may have, contains a multitude.\n\nRecently some psychologists have said that pedophilia is a sexual orientation, the erotic predilection that drives people like former Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky to do what he allegedly did. This idea came to twitter and incited a minor firestorm over whether \"sexual orientation\" should really be applied to pedophilia. Nature editor Noah Gray used the term in a neutral sense, as in, \"an attraction to a specific category of individuals\"; io9\u2032s Charlie Jane Anders and Boing Boing blogger Xeni Jardin pointed out the queer community's long campaign to define sexual orientation only as an ethically acceptable preference for any category of consenting adults. Given that willful troglodytes like Rick Santorum regularly conflate homosexuality with pedophilia and zoophilia, you can see where the frustration around loose use of the term might arise.\n\nSantorum aside, how should we classify pedophilia if not a \"sexual orientation?\" Why should that term include should one unchosen, inborn form of sexual attraction, but exclude another unchosen, inborn form of sexual attraction?\n\nWhile we may have ready answers for these questions now, technological and social changes on the horizon will once again challenge our definitions and beliefs about sex. We can imagine a time when we have artificial intelligence (to at least some degree), or super-intelligent animals, or maybe we'll even become a spacefaring species and encounter other alien intelligences. Without a doubt, people will start discovering that they are primarily attracted to something that isn't the good ol' Homo sapiens. Sex and sexuality will increase in complexity by powers of ten. If some person is attracted to a sexy cyborg, or a genetically enhanced dolphin, how will we know if it is ethical to act upon those desires?One of the strangest aspects of our understanding of evolutionary biology is the tendency to conflate a sprawling protean dynamic into a sliver of a phenomenon. Most prominently, evolution is often reduced to a process driven by natural selection, with an emphasis on the natural. When people think of populations evolving they imagine them being buffeted by inclement weather, meteors, or smooth geological shifts. These are all natural, physical phenomena, and they all apply potential selection pressures. But this is not the same as evolution; it's just one part. A more subtle aspect of evolution is that much of the selection is due to competition between living organisms, not their relationship to exterior environmental conditions.\n\nThe question of what drives evolution is a longstanding one. Stephen Jay Gould famously emphasized of the role of randomness, while Richard Dawkins and others prioritize the shaping power of natural selection. More finely still, there is the distinction between those which emphasize competition across the species versus within species. And then there are the physical, non-biological forces.\n\nEvolution as selection. Evolution as drift. Evolution as selection due to competition between individuals of the same species. Evolution as selection due to competition between individuals of different species. And so forth. There are numerous models, theories, and conjectures about what's the prime engine of evolution. The evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin famously observed that in the 20th century population geneticists constructed massively powerful analytic machines, but had very little data which they could throw into those machines. And so it is with theories of evolution. Until now.\n\nOver the past 10 years in the domain of human genetics and evolution there has been a swell of information due to genomics. In many ways humans are now the \"trial run\" for our understanding of evolutionary process. Using theoretical models and vague inferences from difficult-to-interpret signals, our confidence in the assertions about the importance of any given dynamic have always been shaky at best. But now with genomics, researchers are testing the data against the models.\n\nA recent paper is a case in point of the methodology. Using 500,000 markers, ~50 populations, and ~1,500 people, the authors tested a range of factors against their genomic data. The method is conceptually simple, though the technical details are rather abstruse. The ~1,500 individuals are from all around the globe, so the authors could construct a model where the markers varied as a function of space. As expected, most of the genetic variation across populations was predicted by the variation across space, which correlates with population demographic history; those populations adjacent to each other are likely to have common recent ancestors. But the authors also had some other variables in their system which varied as a function of space in a less gradual fashion: climate, diet, and pathogen loads. The key is to look for those genetic markers and populations where the expectation of differences being driven as a function of geography do not hold. Neighbors should be genetically like, but what if they're not? Once you find a particular variant you can then see how it varies with the factors listed above.\n\nEvery few years it seems that the British biologist Steve Jones declares the death of evolution by natural selection in the human species. The logic here is simple even to a schoolboy: evolution requires variation in fitness, and with declining risk by death during our reproductive years humans have abolished the power of selection. But this confuses the symptom for the disease. Death is simply one way that natural selection can occur. Michelle Duggar has 19 children. The average American woman has around two by the end of her reproductive years. It doesn't take a math whiz to figure out that Michelle Duggar is more \"fit\" in the evolutionary sense than the average bear. Even without high rates of death, some people have more children than other people, and if those people who have more children than those who do not are different from each other in inherited traits, evolution must occur. Q.E.D.\n\nBut you probably shouldn't be convinced by logic alone. Science requires theory, experiment, and observation. (If you're talking humans, you can remove the second from the list of possibilities: there are certain unavoidable ethical obstacles to experimenting on human evolution\u2014plus we take far too long to reproduce.) But humans sometimes have something which bacteria can not boast: pedigrees! Not all humans, of course. Like most of the world's population I don't have much of a pedigree beyond my great-grandparents' generation. But luckily for biologists, the Catholic Church has long taken a great interest in life events such as baptism, marriage, and death, and recorded this info parish by parish. With these basic variables, demographers can infer the the rough life histories of many local populations over the centuries. In many European nations, these databases can go more than 10 generations back. And some aspects of human evolution are revealed by these records.\n\nWhat aspects am I talking about? Reproduction itself. Not only is variation in fitness one of the primary ways by which evolution occurs, but it is also a trait upon which evolution operates! How else are there rabbits which breed like\u2026rabbits, and pandas\u2026which don't. There is often variation within species for the odds of multiple births, age at first reproduction, and lifespan, depending upon the differences in selection pressures over a population. And that seems to be exactly what occurs in human beings. There is interesting evidence for evolution of reproductive patterns from populations as diverse African pygmies and Finns, but more recently some researchers have been plumbing the depths of the records of the Roman Catholic Church in Quebec, and they've come back with gold.\n\nConsider two pandemics: the white-nose syndrome now devastating North American bats and the Black Death that killed a third or more of Europeans in the 14th century. Lethality aside, they may not seem to have much in common. But recent studies suggest they both offer important lessons about understanding that the deadliness of disease organisms is very much a product of the circumstances in which they appear.\n\nTwo weeks ago in Nature, a multi-institutional team of U.S. Geological Survey scientists presented conclusive evidence the parasitic fungus that lends white-nose syndrome its name is indeed the cause of the mysterious bat epidemic. The illness came to light in New York in 2006, when cave explorers started finding thousands of little brown bats (and later, other species) dead together in the caves where they spent the winter months, their bodies covered with a white fungus, Geomyces destructans. It has since spread throughout the northeastern U.S., where bat populations have declined on average by 73 percent\u2014which may make it one of the most rapid declines in wildlife populations ever observed. Worse, white-nose syndrome is still on the move, with documented cases in four Canadian provinces and states as far south and west as Tennessee, Missouri, and Oklahoma.\n\nIn the 1970s, doctors noticed that sometimes people with hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) would get suddenly much worse and go into liver failure, and they didn't know why. But through hard work with what are now antiquated methods, they found out that there was another virus, very different genetically from HBV, but dependent on HBV to spread from person to person. It is called hepatitis D virus or delta agent, and it steals proteins made by HBV to get from cell to cell and victim to victim. The combination of HBV plus hepatitis D is always much more serious than HBV alone, and hepatitis D virus never occurs on its own.\n\nThis phenomenon, called viral interference, has been seen in the lab for a while, but it was generally thought to be an artifact with little or no importance in human disease. That's because we didn't have the technology to easily find and identify viruses in living people until recently.\n\nThe advent of PCR rewrote our understanding of viral interactions, as it did for many areas of biology. We learned that almost everyone has many silent viral infections cooking in them all the time, some that last for life and some that come and go. When the human genome was sequenced, it showed that 8% of the human genome is made up of dormant and disabled retroviruses (the kind of virus that causes AIDS). It's as if scientists were looking for cockroaches in a big dark room and all we had was a little flashlight. For decades we followed one bug at a time, and it worked and we made progress, so we thought each one was alone. And then with PCR we found the light switch and yikes, they were everywhere! We didn't notice most of them for so long because they cause no symptoms in most people. Read More\n\nTwo people are dancing a waltz, and it is not going well. One is tall and the other short; one is graceful, the other flat-footed; and both are stepping to completely different rhythms. The result is chaos, and the dance falls apart. Their situation mirrors a problem faced by all complex life on Earth. Whether we're animal or plant, fungus or alga, we all need two very different partners to dance in step with one another. A mismatch can be disastrous.\n\nVirtually all organisms with complex cells\u2014better known as eukaryotes\u2014have at least two separate genomes. The main one sits in the central nucleus. There's also a smaller one in tiny bean-shaped structures called mitochondria, little batteries that provide the cell with energy. Both sets of genes must work together. Neither functions properly without the other.\n\nMitochondria came from a free-living bacterium that was engulfed by a larger cell a few billion years ago. The two eventually became one. Their fateful partnership revolutionised life on this planet, giving it a surge of power that allowed it to become complex and big (see here for the full story). But the alliance between mitochondria and their host cells is a delicate one.\n\nBoth genomes evolve in very different ways. Mitochondrial genes are only passed down from mother to child, whereas the nuclear genome is a fusion of both mum's and dad's genes. This means that mitochondria genes evolve much faster than nuclear ones\u2014around 10 to 30 times faster in animals and up to a hundred thousand times faster in some fungi. These dance partners are naturally drawn to different rhythms.\n\nThis is a big and underappreciated problem because the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes cannot afford to clash. In a new paper, Nick Lane, a biochemist at University College London, argues that some of the most fundamental aspects of eukaryotic life are driven by the need to keep these two genomes dancing in time. The pressure to maintain this \"mitonuclear match\" influences why species stay separate, why we typically have two sexes, how many offspring we produce, and how we age."}

Measurements from several instruments show that gas in this galaxy is condensing to form stars close to the maximum rate thought possible.\n\nThe distant galaxy, 6 billion light years away, initially popped out of an image captured by a satellite-based NASA instrument called WISE, for Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. The image revealed infrared light, an indication of star formation, pouring out of the galaxy.\n\nThat rate of star formation combined with the estimate of available fuel indicates an efficiency close to the theoretical maximum, called the Eddington limit, so ferocious that most of the galaxy's gas will be gone in just a few tens of millions of years, a brief episode in the course of its evolution.

{"text":"BIOLOGY\n\nHotTopics Native American Research Lab hunts answers at the edge of life\n\nWith his right hand gripping the climbing rope, Michael Ceballos crouches on the tilting rock and leans out over the volcanic cauldron of bubbling mud. His black braid is tucked under a blue bandana knotted pirate style. Holding the test tube in a protective glove, he lowers it into the primeval ooze to retrieve a precious sample. The mud pool is boiling and highly acidic. It's not a friendly environment.\n\nCeballos (right) helps UM senior Chelsea Morales inoculate a culture in the Native American Research Lab. Morales, a Gros Ventre tribal member, grew up in Harlem, Mont. A \"Wall of Fame\" of previous students who excelled at NARL can be seen in the background.\n\nFor Ceballos, a research assistant professor in UM's Division of Biological Sciences, collecting the sample marks the start of a long day. He climbs back up the red baked rim of the hot springs deep in the Costa Rican jungle, unhooks from a tree and gets to work.\n\n\"If you imagine spending hours in a very hot steamy sauna that smells like rotten eggs, that's what it's like,\" he says of his fieldwork in Costa Rica and El Salvador.\n\nMost samples contain archaea, single-celled organisms lacking nuclei that live in extreme environments. These ancient life forms may hold secrets to the origins of life on Earth, including how viruses develop. Hyperthermophilic archaea and their viruses have become the primary subject of study at UM's Native American Research Lab, which Ceballos directs.\n\nDuring grueling 12- to 16-hour days, Ceballos has collected and prepared samples with meticulous care so they will survive the journey on foot, by rental car over treacherous roads and by plane back to Montana.\n\nTo keep the tough, yet fragile archaea alive, Ceballos puts them \"in a coma\" by raising the pH level just slightly with a calcium carbonate buffer. Raising the pH allows them to lower metabolic processes until he and his team can replicate natural conditions in the laboratory.\n\nBack at his UM lab, flasks containing archaea from El Salvador, Costa Rica, Italy, Japan, Russia and nearby Yellowstone slosh rhythmically in an incubator-shaker set at 176 degrees Fahrenheit. Some of the flasks hold uninfected archaeal strains. Others contain cultures of archaea infected with thermotolerant viruses isolated from different sulfuric hot springs worldwide. By studying virus-host interactions at such a primitive level, Ceballos and fellow researchers hope to gain a better understanding of the evolution of virulence and apply this knowledge to the study of emergent infectious viral diseases.\n\nArchaea play another vital research role at the lab as well. In August 2009, Ceballos received a two-year, $300,000, rapid technology development grant from the National Science Foundation to investigate how archaea may hold the key to enhancing efficiency in cellulosic ethanol production. As a promising source for cheap fuel that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on foreign oil, cellulosic ethanol substrates can be wood waste, grass or a host of other available natural products.\n\nThe trick to making cost-effective ethanol that can replace gasoline is to efficiently produce the fermentable simple sugars from cellulose bound in the substrates. But there's a hitch. Scientists have to separate the cellulose (a complex sugar) from lignin, a complex polymer found in wood, and efficiently convert the cellulose to simple fermentable sugars, such as glucose.\n\nCurrently, cellulosic substrates are processed with pretreatments such as high-temperature steam explosion and acidic washes to loosen up the ligno-cellulosic matrix. Then, enzymes (proteins that catalyze chemical reactions) such as cellulases and hemi-cellulases are used to deconstruct the cellulose. However, enzymes don't work well in the heat and acid of the pretreatment processes. Enter heat and acid-loving archaea, featuring enzymes that work best under exactly those kinds of conditions.\n\nCutting-edge and ancient. Both terms describe what's happening at UM's Native American Research Lab, the only one of its kind in the nation, and part of a larger emphasis on Native American education at the University. With the lab's dual focus on viral ecology and sustainable fuels, the science is relevant to solving today's most urgent problems. The choice of studying ancient life forms also seems fitting for a lab dedicated to increasing the number of indigenous scientists coming from cultures whose legacy of scientific inquiry dates back thousands of years.\n\n\"There's such a rich heritage of science in pre-Columbian Native America, and yet today Native Americans are the most underrepresented minority group in the sciences,\" Ceballos says. \"Several Native American cultures prior to the European conquest had strong science education centers. Significant accomplishments in mathematics, astronomy, pharmacology, physics and more are part of the historical record, and yet the history of pre-conquest Native American science is not given proper credit or treatment in our modern educational systems.\"\n\nCeballos, whose paternal family is Tepehuan (O'dami) and maternal family is mixed-blood Choctaw\/Scottish and Cherokee\/French, is passionate in his support for a lab that already has provided hands-on science experience and mentoring to more than 60 students, two-thirds of whom are Native American and represent more than 25 tribal nations. The doors opened at UM in 2007.\n\nCeballos had the idea of developing a Native-serving lab first as a faculty member at Salish Kootenai College and then at UM, where he secured more than $1 million in grants from NSF and NASA to start the NARL research facility. From his own experience working as a designer and drafter on the NASA space station project while completing his undergraduate degree in physics and math, Ceballos knows the value of hands-on student research experiences in complementing the scientific theory presented in classrooms.\n\n\"Unfortunately, most tribal colleges lack access to state-of-the-art instrumentation and faculty with research expertise \u2013 particularly Native American science faculty who can serve as research mentors and role models,\" he says. \"Helping students successfully transfer from tribal colleges to the University was my first goal.\"\n\nToday, students work under the mentorship of Ceballos and visiting assistant professor Don Benn (Navajo). Benn is co-directing the lab in 2009-10 to allow Ceballos time to complete his doctoral dissertation on archaea virus-host interactions as part of the degree requirements in the Integrative Microbiology and Biochemistry Program.\n\n\"We must have faculty role models who share a similar background with students. It emphasizes to students that science is part of Native American culture, history and heritage,\" he says. \"And, yet, at the same time, I believe it is very important to also engage non-Native and international students to facilitate cross-cultural exchange and collaboration.\"\n\nFor Native American and non-Native students alike with an interest in microbiology or biochemistry, what could be better than looking for answers at the edge of where life can exist? While much more time is spent among flasks and petri dishes than leaning over steaming, acidic hot springs, Ceballos strives to make the research tangible and meaningful to students.\n\nOn a large wall of the Native American Research Lab, kept toasty warm by the water baths filled with its single-celled study subjects, are two rows of photos. They feature students who have presented research posters at national conferences, who are listed as co-authors on scientific papers or who have completed undergraduate or graduate degrees. Some students have continued on as graduate research fellows, such as Joshua Marceau (Salish), who studies host-virus interactions, and Meredith Berthelson (Blackfeet), now developing mathematical models of thermophile host-virus systems.\n\n\"I have a whole other row to add to the Wall of Fame,\" says a proud Ceballos. Every photo demonstrates the success of the lab as more Native American students join the ranks of scientists equipped with the tools, experience and high-level learning to succeed and become mentors to the next generation.\n\n(Above) UM researcher Michael Ceballos collects a sample from a hot pool of bubbling mud in Costa Rica. His quarry are microscopic archaea such as this one (below) found in El Salvador. The creatures may offer insights into disease virulence or enhancing ethanol fuel production."}

Burgess\n\nAfter years of isolation and poverty, Alabama's MOWA Choctaw tribe is reclaiming its roots\u2014with the help of UAB alumna Jacqueline Matte and UAB anthropologist Loretta Cormier.\n\nThirty years ago, UAB alumna Jacqueline Matte went out to the Choctaw reservation in southwest Alabama in search of a story. What she found has haunted her ever since, fueling decades of interviews, investigations, and heartache. Nine years ago, UAB anthropologist Loretta Cormier, Ph.D., joined the struggle. Separately and together, Matte and Cormier have fought through swamps both literal and legal, seeking clues to one of the great vanishing acts in Alabama history. It is no easy task; after all, they are looking for a people who haven't wanted to be found for more than 150 years.\n\nThe Alabama Choctaw lived in poverty and isolation until the 1940s, when they began sending some of their children to Indian schools in other states because their own were not accredited. When those educated children came home, they led the tribe out of isolation and into the public eye, launching a campaign for state recognition. In 1979, they officially became the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians, the first recognized tribe in Alabama. (The name MOWA comes from the tribe's location on the Mobile County-Washington County line.) The following year, the tribe began to seek federal recognition, a lengthy and involved process requiring extensive genealogical research. That is where Jacqueline Matte comes inUAB Uses Nutrition Science to Fight AIDS in Africa\n\nBy Tara Hulen\n\nAs medical mysteries go, this one is particularly heartbreaking. Several years ago, UAB clinicians began a large-scale program to bring lifesaving antiretroviral therapy to Zambia. But to their surprise, the same wonder drugs that revolutionized AIDS treatment in the United States produced untoward side effects in Africa.\n\nScientists at UAB's Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ), which administers the program, were perplexed. \"In the first 90 days, an unexpectedly large number of patients die after the drugs are started,\" says Douglas Heimburger, M.D., a researcher and professor in nutrition sciences and medicine at UAB. \"But if they can get through the first 90 days, the patients' mortality rates are very similar to patients on similar therapies in the United States.\"\n\nUAB Neuroscientists Stretch the Boundaries of the Mind\n\nBy Bob Shepard\n\nImage courtesy of J. Palop\n\nThe brain, as we saw in last week's story, is \"plastic\" in the sense that it can reshape itself after injury. But the power of plasticity doesn't stop there, says David Sweatt, Ph.D., chair of the UAB Department of Neurobiology, director of the Evelyn F. McKnight Brain Institute, and Evelyn F. McKnight Endowed Chair for Learning and Memory in Aging. According to Sweatt, the brain is also able to strengthen the connections between neurons\u2014and even make new neurons.\n\nNeurons, Sweatt explains, are the fundamental information-processing units of the brain. But they do not work in isolation; instead, each neuron communicates with thousands of its neighbors through specialized connections called synapses. \"It turns out that perhaps half of the synapses in the adult nervous system have a robust capacity to change the strength of the connections between neurons,\" Sweatt says. \"That is an important part of how the brain works, how we store information, and how we adapt to environmental stimuli.\"\n\nIt is also an important part of memory, says Sweatt\u2014in fact, he argues, synapses are the keys to memory. And once scientists understand how the adult brain strengthens certain synapses, they can begin to manipulate the process\u2014finding ways to slow down or delay the inevitable memory loss associated with aging.\n\nUAB Neuroscientists Stretch the Boundaries of the Mind\n\nBy Bob Shepard\n\nThe big news in neuroscience these days is that you can change your mind. Not just in superficial ways, either, such as opting for milk over creamer or paper instead of plastic, although plasticity has a lot to do with it. The field is abuzz with mind-bending research indicating that the adult brain can be shaped\u2014repaired, expanded, optimized\u2014in ways that were unimaginable only a few decades ago.\n\nYou can't teach an old dog new tricks, the saying goes. And for decades, scientists thought the same thing about the human brain. An adult brain, the textbooks said, is not plastic\u2014that is, it has no ability to change, to grow, to repair itself if injured. At birth, in infancy, and through childhood, the central nervous system is malleable; it can grow and change depending on different stimuli. But researchers were certain that this ability fades upon maturity, leaving the adult brain with the capacity to diminish\u2014through injury, disease, or simply old age\u2014but not to grow new cells or structures, or to repair the damage it accumulates over a lifetime. Distinguished Spanish neuroscientist Ram\u00f3n y Cajal summarized the viewpoint succinctly in 1913: \"Everything may die; nothing may be regenerated.\""}

No Burped Compliments to the Chef on the ISS\n\nAstronauts in space cannot belch \u2013 without gravity, gas cannot separate from liquids in their stomachs.\n\n35. They're Just Creatively Falling Down\n\nActually, there IS gravity in space. It's just that astronauts in orbit are in a continual state of falling \u2013 gravity being equivalent to acceleration. There are no regions of space entirely without gravitational forces, just as there is no true vacuum in space \u2013 there are lots of loose atoms and particles out there.\n\n36. And You Thought It Was Watson and Crick\n\nDNA \u2013 the molecule of inheritance \u2013 was first discovered in 1869 by Swiss biologist Friedrich Mieschler, just a decade after Charles Darwin published his theory of evolution. Mieschler called the phosphate-rich chemical \"nuclein.\"\n\n37. Mom Knows Whereof She Speaks\n\nWhile Mom's chicken soup won't really \"cure\" your cold, it will make you feel much better. There are anti-inflammatory properties in the broth that have been shown to reduce congestion and ease fevers.\n\n38. My, That's a Funny-Looking Chicken\n\nIf the brain stem is left intact after beheading a chicken, it can continue to live (with some care in feeding). There is one documented case of a headless chicken living on for 18 months after he was supposed to have become Sunday dinner!\n\n39. Beware the Random Bagel Test!\n\nYou will test positive for opiates on a drug test if you eat just two poppy seed bagels (or muffins) for breakfast.\n\n40. Facts Sometimes Come Later Than Fiction\n\nIn Jonathan Swift's immortal Gulliver's Travels [1726], the author described the size and speeds of rotation for two moons of Mars \u2013 Phobos and Deimos \u2013 more than 100 years before either were discovered!\n\nHe got closer to the speeds of the moons of mars than you'd expect, I'll grant you. But not exact. The characters said something like 3 and 5 for distances, when it's really something like 1.5 and 3.5, time of rotation have a difference of 10 and 21.5 vs really something like 8 and thirty.\nSo maybe he fairly accurately predicted a possible rotation size and speed, but they didn't match up right.\nBetter than one would normally do on an essay question without a clue.\n\nWell, astronauts may not be belching in space, but from reading several books written by astronauts, there is some interesting flatulence going on when astronauts first enter orbit. When a body, used to 14.7 pounds per square inch at sea level, enters space in a craft with less than 4 or 5 pounds per square inch, the gas inside the body (intestinal tract) has to expand somewhere."}

{"text":"Monthly Archives: February 2010\n\nPost navigation\n\nNew Scientist: Using crime data from southern California, Jeffrey Brantingham of the University of California, Los Angeles, and his colleagues set out to calculate how the movements of criminals and victims create opportunities for crime, and how police can reduce it. They came up with a pair of equations that could explain how local crime hotspots form\u2014which turned out to be similar to those that describe molecular reactions and diffusion.\n\nScience: What is the formula for the momentum of light zipping through a transparent material? That may sound like a question on a high-school physics quiz, but physicists have been debating the matter ever since two different formulas were proposed more than 100 years ago. Now Stephen Barnett, a theorist at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, U.K., says he has resolved the famed \"Abraham-Minkowski dilemma.\" Both formulas are correct, he says, but they denote different things and apply in different contexts.\n\nBBC News: It weighs almost a ton, has cost more than $2 billon and, in 2013, it will be lowered on to the surface of Mars with a landing system that has never been tried before. The Mars Science Laboratory will \"revolutionize investigations in science on other planets,\" says Doug McCuistion, director of Nasa's Mars exploration program.\nIt will, he says, lay the foundations for future missions that will eventually bring Martian rocks to Earth.\n\"The ability to put a metric ton on the surface\u2026 gives us the capability to undertake sample collection,\" says McCuistion. \"To collect and launch samples back into orbit will require that size of a vehicle.\"\nBut it has been a rather bumpy road to revolution, including 1000 parts made from a \"bad batch\" of titanium\nThe project has been struggling with technical challenges for several years, but Jim Green, the director of Nasa's planetary science division, recently announced to the planetary science subcommittee that the project had finally turned the corner.\n\n\"Switching on one of the world's first neutrino superbeams is a great achievement,\" said CERN Director General Rolf Heuer. \"Even in a time of financial difficulty around the globe, it's important not to lose sight of the fact that basic science is and always will be a crucial element of progress. It is therefore heartening to see such an important new basic science initiative getting underway now.\"\n\n\"It is a big step forward,\" said T2K spokesperson Takashi Kobayashi. \"We've been working hard for more than 10 years to make this happen.\"\n\nJ-PARC now produces the world's most powerful neutrino beams to study neutrino oscillations.\n\n\"Neutrinos are the elusive ghosts of particle physics,\" Kobayashi explains. \"They come in three types, called electron neutrinos, muon neutrinos, and tau neutrinos, which used to be thought to be immutable.\"\n\nInteracting only weakly with matter, neutrinos can traverse the entire earth with vastly less attenuation than light passing through a window. The very weakness of their interactions allows physicists to make what should be very accurate predictions of their behavior, and thus it came as a shock when measurements of the flux of neutrinos coming from the thermonuclear reactions which power our sun were far lower than predicted.\n\nA second anomaly was then clearly demonstrated in 1998 by Super-Kamiokande, when it showed that the flux of different types of neutrino generated within our atmosphere by cosmic ray interactions was different depending on whether the neutrinos were coming from above or below (which should not have been possible given our understanding of particle physics). Other experiments, such as Kamioka Liquid scintillator Anti-Neutrino Detector (KamLAND), have conclusively demonstrated that these anomalies are caused by neutrino oscillations, whereby one type of neutrino turns into another.\n\nThe first T2K event seen in Super-Kamiokande is seen in the image above. Each dot is a photomulipler tube which has detected photons. The two circles of hits indicate that a neutrino has probably produced a particle called a \u03c0 0, perfectly in time with the arrival of a pulse of neutrinos from J-PARC. Another faint circle surrounds the viewpoint of this image, showing a third particle was created by the neutrino.\n\nThe T2K experiment has been built to make measurements of unprecedented precision of known neutrino oscillations, and to look for a so-far unobserved type of oscillation which would cause a small fraction of the muon neutrinos produced at J-PARC to become electron neutrinos by the time they reach Super-Kamiokande.\n\nObserving the new type of oscillation would open the prospect of comparing the oscillations of neutrinos and anti-neutrinos, which many theorists believe may be related to one of the great mysteries in fundamental physics\u2014why is there more matter than anti-matter in the universe? \"The observation of this first neutrino means that the hunt has just begun,\" said Koichiro Nishikawa, director of the Institute for Particle and Nuclear Studies at KEK and founder of T2K. \"The first physics results are expected later this year.\" Today's news he says, \"is the beginning.\"\n\nAAAS Meeting: Margaret Murnane and Henry Kapteyn group at JILA, a joint institute of the University of Colorado at Boulder and NIST, has made some breakthroughs on how to build a tabletop x-ray laser. The laser could be used for super high-resolution imaging, while also giving scientists a new way to at the nanoscale at objects such as a single cell.\nMurnane and Kapteyn presented highlights of their research at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in San Diego.\n\"Our goal is to create a laser beam that contains a broad range of x-ray wavelengths all at once that can be focused both in time and space,\" Murnane said. \"If we have this source of coherent light that spans a huge region of the electromagnetic spectrum, we would be able to make the highest resolution light-based tabletop microscope in existence that could capture images in 3-D and tell us exactly what we are looking at. We're very close.\"\nMost of today's x-ray lasers require so much power that they rely on fusion laser facilities the size of football stadiums or larger, making their use impractical. Murnane and Kapteyn generate coherent laser-like x-ray beams by using an intense femtosecond laser and combining hundreds or thousands of visible photons together with a desktop-size system.\nThey can already generate laser-like x-ray beams in the soft x-ray region and believe they have discovered how to extend the process all the way into the hard x-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\"If we can do this, it could lead to all kinds of possibilities,\" Kapteyn said. \"It might make it possible to improve x-ray imaging resolution at your doctor's office by a thousand times. The x-rays we get in the hospital now are limited. For example, they can't detect really small cancers because the x-ray source in your doctor's office is more like a light bulb, not a laser. If you had a bright, focused laser-like x-ray beam, you could image with far higher resolution.\"\nTheir method can be thought of as a coherent version of the x-ray tube, according to Murnane. In an x-ray tube, an electron is boiled off a filament, then it is accelerated in an electric field before hitting a solid target, where the kinetic energy of the electron is converted into incoherent x-rays. These incoherent x-rays are like the incoherent light from a light bulb or flashlight\u2014they aren't very focused.\nIn the tabletop setup, instead of boiling an electron from a filament, they pluck part of the quantum wave function of an electron from an atom using a very intense laser pulse. The electron is then accelerated and slammed back into the ion, releasing its energy as an x-ray photon. Since the laser field controls the motion of the electron, the x-rays emitted can retain the coherence properties of a laser, Murnane said.\nBeing able to build a tabletop x-ray laser is just the beginning, said Kapteyn.\n\"An analogy that is pretty close to what is going on in this field is the MRI, which started as just a fundamental investigation,\" said Kapteyn. \"People then started using it for microscopy, and then it progressed into a medical diagnostic technique.\"\n\nThe Economist: In 2008 part of the Wilkins ice shelf on the edge of the Antarctic peninsula suddenly disintegrated.\nThe Wilkins shelf may or may not have been the victim, ultimately, of climate change.

The Insect Hiding in Flickr\n\nWe all know Flickr houses a treasure trove of beautiful images. But this year, we discovered it's also nature's attic-box of undiscovered lifeforms.\nWildlife photographer Hock Ping Guek posted a picture of a fly with patches of color on its wings. Turns out, that fly was actually a never-before-seen species of lacewing. A couple months later, entomologist Shaun Winterton spotted the picture online, identifying it as an entirely new species, which was named Semachrysa jade.\nThe findings were published in the journal ZooKeys. Both Guek and Winterton received credit for the discovery.\nImage via OrionMystery.Blogspot.com\n\nEarth is a big place. Even with our billion-dollar satellites and high-tech monitoring equipment, we are still discovering new species on land and at sea.\n\nOn average, scientists identify 36 new mammals every year. And the ocean is an even more mysterious place. Two-thirds of marine speciesremain unknown \u2014 a huge number, considering between 700,000 and one million species live in oceans.\n\nIn 2012, we met some new species currently sharing the Earth with us \u2014 a gorgeous blue tarantula and a sneezing monkey, to name a couple. And we discovered some of our new friends in innovative ways, through Flickr photos, for example (we're looking at you, Semachrysa jade).\n\nThis year we also met species from our past, filling in some of the mysterious historical gaps from more than 200 million years ago (hello, mini dino). But even though these ancient creatures roamed an Earth without humans, we gave them names that pay homage to modern-day characters -- one after a certain Middle-earth villain; another from a pants-wearing spongeman living under the sea.\n\nWhile these 10 new species weren't the only ones discovered in 2012, they come with the best background stories of the year.

The elk, fearful of becoming Wolf Fare, avoid munching low brush in certain areas of the park. As a result, many young aspens have grown too tall\u2013reaching seven feet\u2013for elk to eat.

{"text":"Research Report: Deep-sea worms are 'green bombers'\n\nSeven previously unknown species of swimming worms (some nearly 4 inches long) have been discovered by scientists using remotely operated vehicles at ocean depths between 6,000 and 12,000 feet. Some of the worms have the ability to release body parts that produce a brilliant green bioluminescent display. Why the worms do this is unknown.\n\nTransparent except for the gut area, the worms feature a variety of elaborate head appendages and propel themselves with fans of long bristles that form swimming paddles. Five species are equipped with luminescent structures: \"bombs\" of fluid-filled spheres that suddenly burst into light when released by the animal, glowing intensely for several seconds before fading.

A well-known example is a meteorite that was discovered in Antarctica named ALH 84001 that made headlines in 1996 when scientists claimed the meteorite contained bacteria from Mars. A more recent example is a meteorite that was discovered in Sri Lanka on which scientists claim is fossilized extraterrestrial algae.

The details are vague, but in this particular case, the Korean-language report (which is more detailed than the supposed English translation) says, that South Korean officials inspected packages mailed from China to Chinese expats in South Korea. The problem is, that the article claims that South Korean officials can inspect the pills using their senses, not chemical analysis, because whatever the substance is, it's mixed with traditional herbs. The article in Korean and English mention, if \"Baby\" means placenta or actual deceased persons.\n\nI've heard urban legends like this above-quoted article mentions. I've also heard of black markets for body parts in decades past. My South Korean wife claims Chinese medical expats resort to this questionable remedies once they have exhausted conventional treatment for cancer and have learned the prognosis is terminal.\n\nI also will stipulate that diplomatic relations between China and Korea are strained, because of incursions by Chinese fishermen into Korean waters in the Yellow Sea resulting in the deaths and injury of South Korean maritime officials and North Korea. Koreans and Chinese (and Japanese) trade nationalist slurs readily. But, what I find most disturbing is, that the only inspection done on these capsules is human. It's not uncommon for South Koreans to make scientific claims using informed language with \"experts\" in white coats and other bureaucratic officials, and then follow with heart-rending tales from laypeople.\n\nOn the 48 frames per second stuff, it's kind of sad that a defect (a slow frame rate) has now been taken by some to be a virtue. But you see that over and over in the entertainment -- and home entertainment -- industry. Those, for example, who insist that vinyl is 'better' than digital, which the former's defects are manifestly measurable and hugely outweigh the latter's.\n\nWhat is overlooked with HFR is that the introduction of 48fps will not, and need not, eliminate 24fps. 48fps display systems are completely compatible with 24fps. Any movie maker who wants to retain that unique 'film' look (largely established by barely subliminal frame judder) can easily do so with a 48fps production system. Just choose 24fps! It isn't going to disappear.\n\nBut by having 48fps available then new and improved creative options are available, including readier access to decent slow motion."}

Mother Earth Forgets To Patent\n\nLately I've noticed a decent amount of technological innovation resulting from biomimicry. Aeronautics traditionally seems to reap the most benefit from this process, but that field is by no means the only one benefiting. We often come up with designs inspired by nature, but how often is our end result superior than our inspiration? Seriously studying the chemicals in a butterfly's wing pigmentation, the physics and fluid dynamics behind insects that walk on water, and the aerodynamic specifics of a peregrine falcon's dive-bomb, our eyes widen in reverence and wonder. Nature's pretty smart, after all. The awesome power of millions of years of evolution will most often yield an engineering design more efficient than the product of one of our humble engineers, no matter how many pots of Starbucks coffee are available.\n\nI was first caught up in the wonder of biomimicry (or biomimetics) when I read this story: \"Fly Eyes Used For Solar Cells\" (July 28th 2010 Article on Discovery News) Solar power is a prime example of us trying to harness nature, but we stopped short, overlooking some important geometry. The shape and amount of surface area is the key. Solar panels in the shape of fly's eyes allow much more light to be captured than the simplistic model of light hitting a flat surface. The original Penn University article is here if you'd like to read more about their project. See below for the paper involving the process. Pulsifer, D., Lakhtakia, A., Mart\u00edn-Palma, R., & Pantano, C. (2010). Mass fabrication technique for polymeric replicas of arrays of insect corneas Bioinspiration & Biomimetics, 5 (3) DOI: 10.1088\/1748-3182\/5\/3\/036001\n\nScientists tend to have a reverence for nature, and rightly so. Science, at its heart, is the study of nature after all. Bioevolutionary science in particular can give us some huge benefits and insight. Millions of years of evolution are the best damned Alpha and Beta phases any project team could ask for. Dr. Richard Dawkins said, in his recent lecture at Duke University: \"Survival itself is all it takes to determine the non-random survival of genes that made the desireable characteristic.\" So we take the desirable characteristic and we make stuff like this:"}
{"text":"A team of coral researchers has taken a major stride towards revealing the workings of the mysterious 'engine' that drives Australia's Great Barrier Reef, and corals the world over. The science has critical importance in understanding why coral reefs bleach and die, how they respond to climate change - and how that might affect humanity, they say\u2026\n\nAccording to a study in Evolution, resistance to certain infectious diseases may be passed genetically from parent to child. The genetic resistance may be beneficial to families as those with the gene are both unlikely to suffer from disease and unlikely to carry the disease home. Paul Schliekelman, author of the study, says the research was inspired by personal experience after catching stomach flus from his daughter three times over a six-month period\u2026\n\nScientists for the first time have observed elusive oscillations in the solar corona, known as Alfven waves, that transport energy outward from the surface of the Sun. The discovery is expected to give researchers more insight into the fundamental behaviour of solar magnetic fields, eventually leading to a fuller understanding of how the Sun affects Earth and the solar system. The research, led by Steve Tomczyk of the National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), is being published this week in Science\u2026\n\nThe NASA's Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity continue to persevere in hard conditions. It is clearly visible in images of the sun they are sending. The images show how opaque the Martian atmosphere has been in the face of a very active, two-month dust storm. To understand the gravity of the storm, engineers and astronomers monitored the situation by examining the images and measuring the amount of dust or the opacity of the atmosphere\u2026\n\nAstronomers at the University of Rochester have discovered five Earth-oceans' worth of water that has recently fallen into the planet-forming region around an extremely young, developing star. Dan Watson, professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Rochester, believes he and his colleagues are the first to see a short-lived stage of protoplanetary disk formation, and the manner in which a planetary system's supply of water arrives from the natal envelope within which its parent star originally formed\u2026\n\nMars rover scientists have launched a new long-term study on the Martian atmosphere with the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer, an instrument that was originally developed at the University of Chicago. Thanasis Economou, Senior Scientist at Chicago's Enrico Fermi Institute, suggested the new study after observing that the APXS instruments aboard NASA's twin Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, had recorded fluctuations in the argon composition of the Martian atmosphere. 'The amount of argon in the atmosphere is changing constantly,' Economou said\u2026\n\nGene sequencing uncovers many more bacteria in super-clean facilities than previous monitoring methods, including newly discovered species. NASA clean rooms, where scientists and engineers assemble spacecraft, have joined hot springs, ice caves, and deep mines as unlikely places where scientists have discovered ultra-hardy organisms collectively known as 'extremophiles.' Some species of bacteria uncovered in a recent NASA study have never been detected anywhere else\u2026\n\nEdwin Hubble once called IC 10 'one of the most curious objects in the sky.' It is an irregular galaxy in the constellation Cassiopeia. New observations of the extremely faint, lightweight dwarf galaxy are giving scientists new clues about how populations of stars are born. Though the properties of stars is one of the most well-studied topics in astronomy, scientists still don't fully understand all the mechanisms involved in star formation and evolution, particularly in galaxies with low levels of oxygen, nitrogen and other heavy elements. But scientists studying the IC 10 galaxy may soon understand how stars might have looked like in the distant past, when the universe was in a younger, more pristine form\u2026\n\nEthiopia is the cradle of mankind, the birthplace of coffee, the purported resting place of the Ark of the Covenant - and home to legions of Bob Marley fans.

In order to do this, environmental scientists must study the climate changes of the past and the current effects of humans and industry on our planet. That is a vast array of potential areas of study: from the Mariana Trench to the Great Barrier Reef to manning one of the science outposts in the Antarctic.\n\nWe have a large amount of research here on Universe Today that is related to the areas of interest for environmental science.

{"text":"Dr. C. Erec Stebbins, head of Rockefeller University's Laboratory of Structural Microbiology, spends much of his time using a nearly 100-year-old investigative tool, X-ray crystallography, to identify the bacterial proteins that cause disease. Finding these proteins is a first step in developing drugs to counter the organisms' harmful effects. Dr. Stebbins is only 34, but he has already identified 10 such proteins. In X-ray crystallography, the crystals of protein structures are subjected to high-intensity X-rays. This creates an image of the protein, making it possible to see what its structure looks like. Dr. Rosalind Franklin famously used the technique to create an image of what would be identified, in 1953, as the double helix of DNA.\n\nThe Early Days of Hearing A fancy audio system with a frequency response up to 20,000 hertz may be just the thing to reproduce music, but you hardly need high fidelity to understand the spoken word.

Does water boiled in a microwave have the same germ-killing abilities as old-fashioned boiled water? Does chicken cooked all the way through in the microwave get hot enough to kill salmonella? A. Because of the chances of uneven heating in a microwave and other factors, the answers are tricky, said Dr. Kathryn J. Boor, associate professor of food science at Cornell. The germicidal strength of anything, be it hot water or disinfectant, depends on temperature, concentration (for chemicals) and time, she said. Water boiled in the microwave is less likely to be hot enough long enough to kill germs outside it, though pathogens in the water would be killed as it came to a boil.\n\nAn Oklahoma man who caught a salmonella infection from his pet snake passed the illness to two people through transfusions of his blood platelets, a doctor reported in a journal article published today. Both recipients became ill, and one died. The case resulted from the convergence of two public health problems, researchers said: first, that reptile pets, like snakes, lizards and turtles, often carry salmonella and can spread it to their owners, and second, that platelets can transmit infection.People, particularly young children, the elderly and those with weak immune systems, should avoid eating raw sprouts because they may bear salmonella bacteria or other microbes that can cause fatal infections, federal health experts say in a new advisory. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued the advisory last week after investigating an outbreak of a rare form of salmonella last year among more than two dozen people in California, Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico.Americans enjoy the safest and most varied and abundant food supply in the world. But this variety and availability, along with changes in food production, eating habits, people's age and overall health, and the food-borne organisms themselves, have resulted in a number of serious and sometimes fatal episodes of food poisoning in recent years. It is not possible to say that food poisoning cases over all are on the rise. In years past, as now, most cases never came to official attention. But while salmonella was once the primary culprit, a number of troublesome new organisms have been identified in the last two decades and, experts say, the potential for widespread disaster has definitely expanded. Outbreaks have already occurred 3,000 miles from a single contaminated source of fresh produce in California.\n\nSalmonella, the bacteria that can cause food poisoning and even death, may have the potential to help certain cancer patients. Researchers at the Yale School of Medicine say the bacteria appears to help combat melanoma, especially when it is used in conjunction with standard radiation therapy.\n\nSalmonella is most commonly associated with eating contaminated food, but federal health officials are now noting other sources: baby chicks and ducklings. A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that merely handling the young birds -- as children sometimes do, especially around\n\nAn outbreak of severe, drug-resistant salmonella infections in 27 people in Denmark, traced to meat from infected pigs, is being described by American scientists as a warning on what can happen in the United States unless steps are taken to limit the use of antibiotics in farm animals. The episode in Denmark, in which 11 people were hospitalized and 2 of them died, is especially worrisome because the bacteria had made them partly resistant to a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones that doctors had considered one of their most powerful weapons against severe cases of salmonella and other bacteria that infect the intestinal tract. If those bacteria invade the bloodstream, which occurs in 3 percent to 10 percent of salmonella cases, the illness can be fatal.\n\nThe Clinton Administration has proposed that warning labels be put on eggs to alert consumers to the possible serious illnesses, including salmonella poisoning, that eggs can cause. ''Eggs are a good source of protein and can be a healthy and economical contribution to a well-balanced diet,'' Dr. Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, said. ''However, they need proper handling or they could potentially be the source of food-borne illness.''\n\nThe Agriculture Department has extended a recall involving about two million pounds of meat and poultry used by prisons, hospitals and schools because new testing turned up continued salmonella contamination at a Georgia processing plant. The recall of cooked patties of beef, pork and chicken took effect Sept. 28 for products shipped by Zartic Inc. of Cedartown, Ga.\n\nThe nation's health authorities are increasingly concerned about a poultry contaminant that can be as debilitating, if not as deadly, as salmonella. Researchers say that the contaminant, the campylobacter bacterium, infects a larger percentage of chickens than they had realized and that antibiotics used to treat people sickened by infected poultry appear to be losing their effectiveness. Campylobacter, which is the leading bacterial cause of food-borne illness in the country, has also been linked to a rare but serious paralytic disease.\n\nSalmonella bacteria have been genetically altered to produce an oral birth control vaccine that primes the immune system to reject sperm before conception, a researcher reported today. The vaccine causes a harmless, temporary infection in the intestine that triggers antibodies against genetic components of sperm that have been spliced into the bacteria, said the researcher, Dr. Roy Curtiss of Washington University in St. Louis"}

Seriously, if your ovaries are exploding, go the fucking hospital, get off tumblr and go to the hospital that shit should not be happening.\n\nThe moisture from sexual arousal comes from the Bartholin's glands just inside the opening of the vagina. Ejaculation comes from the Skene's gland and the urethra. The ovaries are where the eggs hang out, if anything is going to explode from rapid arousal at least use a gland, sing the praises of your prostate (the skene's is like a female prostate kind of in conjunction with the G-spot).\n\nBut seriously, ovaries should not explode. If men started posted about their balls exploding I'd be equally worried (but I have heard that limp ejaculations can happen but that's different, it's not a fucking explosion).\n\nIf ovaries are going to respond to the sexual act it's when the body recognizes there is semen in the vaginal canal and\/or the cervix and it's close enough to menstruation that it's pretty much like 'let's hop on this pregnancy' but that's after things are done.\n\nCome the fuck on, it's really not cute and the phrase is kind of annoying to see, I generally don't edit reblogs but when I'm checking my tracked tags and i see anything about ovaries responding to much other than that fucking hormonal shift that makes life hell then I'm like 'really, what the flipping fuck is wrong with you!?'. I kind of want to punch whoever started that shit.\n\nTetrachromatic vision. Most mammals have poor color vision because they have only two kinds of cones, the retinal cells that discriminate different colors of light. Humans, like other primates, have three kinds, the legacy of a past where good color vision for finding ripe, brightly colored fruit was a survival advantage.\n\nThe gene for one kind of cone, which responds most strongly to blue, is found on chromosome 7. The two other kinds, which are sensitive to red and green, are both on the X chromosome. Since men have only one X, a mutation which disables either the red or the green gene will produce red-green colorblindness, while women have a backup copy. This explains why this is almost exclusively a male condition.\n\nBut here's a question: What happens if a mutation to the red or the green gene, rather than disabling it, shifts the range of colors to which it responds? (The red and green genes arose in just this way, from duplication and divergence of a single ancestral cone gene.)\n\nTo a man, this would make no real difference. He'd still have three color receptors, just a different set than the rest of us. But if this happened to one of a woman's cone genes, she'd have the blue, the red and the green on one X chromosome, and a mutated fourth one on the other\u2026 which means she'd have four different color receptors. She would be, like birds and turtles, a natural \"tetrachromat\", theoretically capable of discriminating shades of color the rest of us can't tell apart. (Does this mean she'd see brand-new colors the rest of us could never experience? That's an open question.)\n\nAnd we have evidence that just this has happened on rare occasions. In onestudy of color discrimination, at least one woman showed exactly the results we would expect from a true tetrachromat.\n\nA botanist has discovered a new species of plant in eastern Brazil whose branches bend down upon bearing fruit and deposit seeds on the ground, often burying them in a covering of soft soil or moss. This trick is an example ofgeocarpy, a rare adaptation to survival in harsh or short-lived environments with small favorable patches. The adaptation ensures seedlings germinate near their parents, helping them stay within the choice spots or microclimates in which they thrive. One well-known practitioner of geocarpy is the peanut, which also buries its fruit in the soil.

{"text":"So many exoplanets may hold water, atmospheres, just-right temperatures and a rocky surface for life to flourish \u2014 we just need to know where to look. Once astronomers have pinpointed a good candidate, we also need to know how to look \u2014 which instruments and methods might sniff out the right chemical signatures of life. A new trick that essentially amplifies those signatures could be one way to do it. Astronomers at the European Southern Observatory just discovered life on Earth with this method, treating our home as if it were an exoplanet.\n\nMicrobiologist Rosie Redfield, at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, spent several months trying to reproduce the results of an experiment conducted by a team led by Felisa Wolfe-Simon (see the feature \"Scientist in a Strange Land\" I wrote for PopSci in October.) In the original paper, published in the online edition of the journal Science in December 2010, Wolfe-Simon and her team suggested that a bacterium called GFAJ-1 could substitute arsenic, poisonous for most life form\n\nErik Andrulis, an assistant professor of molecular biology at Case Western Reserve University, has published an article in a new peer-reviewed journal called Life. His \"theoretical framework,\" he says, \"unifies the macrocosmic and microcosmic realms, validates predicted laws of nature, and solves the puzzle of the origin and evolution of cellular life in the universe.\"\n\nThe paper lays out a completely new way of answering the most basic questions of our universe. \"In this work,\" it reads, \"I have pursued and arrived at a scientific answer to the Schr\u00f6dingerian question, 'What is Life?'\" That answer has something to do with \"gyres.\"\n\nLife put together a gallery of the photographs of Fritz Goro, a German-born photographer for Life as well as Scientific American. Goro died in 1986, but was once called \"the most influential photographer that science journalism (and science in general) has ever known.\" The photos are pretty amazing, for their subject matter and for their pure aesthetics. Check out the gallery over at LifeScientists at Glasgow University are on a mission to create a form of lifeShould we find alien life elsewhere in the universe, what would it look like? Biologists on Earth don't even agree on how life arose here--or what the definition of life really is--but one thing biologists do seem to agree on is that it would be really useful to have a second example of life to compare with our own version. But that second example most likely won't come from some faraway planet, says the NYT's Dennis Overbye. Scientists will more likely create it right here on Earth.\n\nResearchers looking for signs of life elsewhere in the universe often start by looking for one key ingredient necessary to complex life as we know it: water. And just 750 light-years away, they've found quite a bit of it spewing from the poles of a young, sunlike star that is blasting jets of H2O into interstellar space at 124,000"}

{"text":"NASA In Deep Water\n\nTo the uninitiated, it's not immediately obvious why NASA would be sponsoring an expedition into the deepest known sinkhole on Earth. On the other hand, the involvement of Environmental Science and Engineering Professor John Spear is a little more apparent\u2014he's a microbiologist and in this more than 1,000-feet deep, warm, water-filled and mineral-rich cave known as El Zacat\u00f3n, in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, the microbial life is fairly unusual.\n\nBelow 30 meters there is no light or oxygen, yet life abounds. \"The walls are lined with spongy red and purple microbe mats,\" says Spear. Jim Bowden, a deep water diver, dove to 82 meters and brought back samples in which 27 divisions of bacteria were identified, including six new divisions. \"The diversity is astounding. I think that if we get down further, there will be even more,\" Spear says. There may even be whole ecosystems in the depths of El Zacat\u00f3n that are entirely independent of photosynthetic energy, instead metabolizing sulphides from volcanic plumes.\n\nHowever, Bowden won't be diving any deeper to find out\u201482 meters is way past the limit of most recreational divers. Instead, starting in mid-May, the expedition will be using a highly sophisticated autonomous robot called the Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer (DEPTHX). Loaded with a total of 30 computers and able to use sonar, temperature, pressure and light to self-navigate as it searches for environments likely to support life, DEPTHX might be the most sophisticated robot ever designed\nfor autonomous exploration. Of course this is where NASA's interest lies\u2014DEPTHX was designed\nas a prototype for a vehicle that might someday go looking for life in the ice-covered oceans of Jupiter's moon, Europa.\n\nImaging the Earth's Core\nMantle Boundary\n\nLuis Tenorio, associate professor in the Department of Mathematical and Computer Sciences, is participating in an NSF-funded project to image the earth's core mantle boundary (CMB). The collaboration includes geophysicists, mathematicians and statisticians from MIT, Purdue and the University of Illinois. Their results, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research and in Science, clearly show structures at two depths close to the CMB, and the existence of new phase transitions in the mantle.\nThe team's methodology involves a rich mix of physics, mathematics and statistics to extract information from seismic wave data through \"inverse scattering.\" Whereas in the past, existing knowledge of geophysical structures was used to interpret scattering patterns, this method allows researchers to take scattered wave data and reconstruct an image of the subsurface without relying on existing knowledge. Combined with considerably better data coverage, this advance in imaging is leading to a rapid expansion in our knowledge of the subsurface and the inner workings of the planet.\n\nSmokin' Ceramics\n\nMaterials and Metallurgical Engineering professor, Ivar Reimanis recently discovered a unique material behavior in which particles are ejected from the surface of an indented ceramic over periods lasting up to a few minutes. Because many of the ejected particles are submicron in size, it looks to the unaided eye like the ceramic is smoking.\n\nThe key ingredient in the ceramic is a lithium aluminum silicate called \u03b2-eucryptite, a strange material that has a negative coefficient of thermal expansion. It is thought that a high compressive stress, such as that experienced under an indenter, stimulates a transformation to a denser ceramic phase. Upon release, a reverse transformation leads to a popcorn-like effect where particles ranging from submicron to 50 microns are ejected violently from the material. There is no known report of this phenomenon in any other material. With assistance from undergraduate students Chris Seick and Kyle Fitzpatrick, Reimanis is exploring whether this discovery can inform development of a toughened ceramic composite\u2014the phase transformation may be able to shut cracks before they can propagate through a composite.\n\nIn fact, this latter idea has already been submitted for a United States patent. To better understand the phenomenon, the Mines researchers have involved collaborators at the National Institute for Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Indian Institute of Science. The work is being supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences.\n\nEnhanced Imaging of the Subsurface\n\nPaul Sava, who joined the Department of Geophysics faculty in the fall of 2006, is working on increasing the accuracy of seismic imaging. When computers generate a visual representation of the subsurface from a seismic dataset, finer details are often obscured by background \"noise.\" While imaging may provide a coherent overall picture, it emerges from a fuzzy background, much as a badly oriented TV antenna produces a poor image. The noise is created by random sound waves that are inevitably recorded during seismic surveying. This random data makes finer details of the subsurface indistinguishable\u00ad\u2014only \"louder\" signals emerge from buzz. Sava's work aims to cancel out background noise and bring more subtle features into focus. Instead of imaging data received at individual locations, he takes information recorded at multiple nearby sites and mathematically compares them. Data that bears no relation across sites is filtered out, leaving only spatially coherent information. Essentially, he is mathematically cross-checking the data received at multiple nearby sites and building an image from only the information that is corroborated. The result is greatly enhanced imaging, as the accompanying illustrations demonstrate.\n\nReservoir Characterization\nProject Enters Phase XII\n\nGeophysics Professor Tom Davis presented results of Phase XI of the Reservoir Characterization Project (RCP) to a packed house of sponsors April 12-13.\n\nThe Phase XI project focused on nine-component, full wavefield seismic data collected at Rulison Field, in Western Colorado's Piceance Basin. Three multi-component seismic surveys were acquired in 2003, 2004 and 2006 across the same area, enabling interpretation of the efficacy of time-lapse data. Additionally, a downhole test that measured in-situ pore pressure was carried out on a field well within the study area, and multi-component microseismic data were recorded during a four-stage hydraulic fracture treatment on a nearby well.\n\nTo date, RCP's Phase XI graduate students have concluded that shear waves are the most valuable wave mode for characterizing and monitoring Rulison's Williams Fork and Iles tight-gas sands. The RCP project also validated the use of nine-component seismic data for detecting faults and fractures, detecting and predicting lithology and pressures, monitoring reservoir connectivity and depletion, and locating prime well locations.\n\nPressure-test results were able to show a correlation with depletion zones that were predicted from time-lapse shear-wave data. Furthermore, the data showed coincidence with depleted areas in the Cameo Coal interval.\n\nHigh-resolution dynamic reservoir characterization appears to be a key technology for tight gas, said Davis, as it gives operators the potential to improve recovery efficiencies.\n\nGoing forward, RCP is circulating research proposals for its Phase XII project. Under consideration is dynamic reservoir characterization on Postle Field, in Texas\nCounty, OK. Postle's Morrow reservoir is undergoing enhanced oil recovery using CO2, a very germane subject in today's oilfield."}

And an interesting line of research has opened up asking why.\n\n\"Researchers at the University of Michigan discovered the answer recently, and it has a twist I didn't expect. I thought that the best places simply did a better job at controlling and minimizing risks\u2014that they did a better job of preventing things from going wrong.

Amazing!\n\nThank you for posting the Transit of Venus video. I had intended to watch it but forgot. (I do that often now.) I even put it on my calendar, but that doesn't do much good if you don't look at the calendar so I appreciate the chance to see it.\n\nI have seen the Carlin clip before as well as the one on Emilia Earhart.

Thanks for a great start to the w\/end. Dee\n\nI think every voter should be required to watch this segment of George Carlin's wit and rancor just prior to voting! He was always right and those of us who were hippies always recognized the truth in what he said.\n\nI once raised ring-neck doves, and was always amazed at how the mama would SHOVE the baby doves out of their nest, while daddy bird would rally round them and continue to feed them. It was as if the mama had done her part, breeding, but daddy bird felt obligated to keep taking care of the little ones. SO very different to human mama\/daddy behavior.\n\nGeorge Carlin is desperately missed. When I read the comments on many political blogs and FB political posts it's clear that critical thinking is a subject phased out of school about 30-35 years ago. But what astounds me even more is the disconnect between espousing a set of \"religious\" values and employing them. \"Thou shall not bear false witness\" doesn't apply if bearing false witness advances your political agenda. I'm not speaking on a national level, I'm speaking on a personal level, to conversations with a brother who was devoutly and consistently Christian all his life, but felt no compunction about lying to promote his ultra-right political viewpoints. Very very strange."}

The paper-folding task was labelled as either a 'Building Project' or an 'Art Project,' while the weaving task was labelled as either a 'Knot-Tying Task' or a 'Hair-Braiding Task.' Even though the actual task was the same, the more feminine name for the task caused women to be seen as more competent in the task and caused them to be more likely to speak up and exhibit leadership.\"\n\nBoy walks to school\n\n\"A 10-year-old boy has been walking to and from school on his hands every day for the last four years,\" reports Orange News UK. \"Yan Yuhong, of Jiaba village, Yibin, in China's Hubei province, was left partly paralyzed by a childhood illness. He initially crawled to get around but learned to walk on his hands when he was just four years old. Yan has to get up much earlier than his classmates \u2013 as his journey takes him an hour and a half each way. He can also get about with crutches but says he can walk much faster on his hands. His father is also disabled, leaving his mother as the sole bread-winner, but Yan is determined to finish his schooling. 'I don't want to quit,' he said. 'I want to study hard, and support myself in the future.'\"\n\nStorms that go on and on\n\n\"They are, simply, freaks of nature,\" says The South Florida Sun-Sentinel. \"Since 1851, when tropical record-keeping started, only 11 storms \u2013 out of 1,490 \u2013 have lasted more than 21 days. The top among them, the San Ciriaco hurricane, existed an astonishing 33 days in 1899. On average, systems last about seven days. \u2026 September is prime time for such storms, with eight of the 11 longest emerging then. The reason: Ocean waters are warmest, tropical waves still are rolling off the coast of Africa and steering currents are weak.\"\n\nThe shape of land to come\n\n\"Amasia \u2013 named for the crash and subsequent connection of the Americas and Asia \u2013 will fuse in 100 million years,\" says National Geographic magazine. \"It won't be a first.

The most recent convergence, Pangaea, formed 300 million years ago; Rodinia, 1.1 billion; Nuna, 1.8 billion. Most theories of Amasia's creation show the Atlantic seafloor stretching or being swallowed, but geologist Ross Mitchell's model, using paleomagnetic data from ancient rocks, predicts the Arctic Ocean will close up instead, the supercontinent sliding north into its place. Where the rebroken land goes from there is unknown.\"\n\nMalaria in Alaskan birds\n\n\"A new study reports that a form of malaria, generally considered a tropical disease, is being contracted by birds as far north as Fairbanks,\" says The Anchorage Daily News. \"The report was published in the science journal PLoS ONE [last week]. 'It is predicted that malaria parasites will spread to both higher altitudes and latitudes with global warming,' it says. That may not be as alarming as it sounds. Avian malaria cannot be transmitted to people. \u2026 Nonetheless, a press release from San Francisco State University [says] that the data may 'provide clues as to how malaria might spread in humans as a result of global warming.'\"\n\nThought du jour\n\nThe message I would give to young people is: Don't be the best in your class. If you're the best in your class you're in the wrong class."}

This means they are immune to antibiotics like penicillin which target cell walls. M. pneumoniae is a species that causes disease in humans.\n\nMycoplasmas are interesting because they're the smallest self-replicating organisms that exist.

Operation Delirium and High Anxiety: LSD in the Cold War detail the US army's experiments in mind control and chemical warfare during the cold war, centered around Edgewood Arsenal, in Maryland.\n\nThe efforts were led by Colonel James S. Ketchum, who wanted to develop a more humane approach to war: the enemy was not to be killed, only incapacitated using various chemical agents. Never mind that those agents might well be nerve gas, and the mechanism of incapacitation extreme mental or physiological stress. His best bet for such an incapacitating agent was BZ, an anticholinergic drug like scopolamine or atropine which causes delirium. (These drugs work by blocking the transmission of the important neurotransmitter acetylcholine.) At one point Ketchum's team resorted to building \"an entire Hollywood-style set in the form of a makeshift communications outpost.\" Soldiers were placed on the outpost and dosed with either placebo or varying doses of BZ. Then Ketchum set about trying to fuck with their heads in any way he could think of:\n\nTwo hundred phony tactical messages, warnings of chemical attacks, and intelligence were fed to the men in the room. At one point, Ketchum and the others ran out of script. \"In an urgent brainstorming session, we put our heads together and came up with an agonizingly improvised scenario,\" he recalled in his memoir. \"We told the military communicators to start sending new intelligence to the group inside the room\u2014in a simple code. The messages informed the men that enemy forces were planning to move a train loaded with chemical weapons along a certain route.\" Eventually, Ketchum and the technicians resorted to gibberish, using poker terms, referring to \"the dealer\" and a \"full house,\" as the BZ-addled soldiers struggled to interpret their code.\n\nKetchum was flanked by Dr. Van Murray Sim, who founded the Edgewood program on psychochemicals in 1956. Sim's grand idea was the use of LSD-25 to loosen the tongue of what might today be euphemistically called \"enemy combatants,\" or if that didn't work, make them so mad that they'd tell any secrets they had just to escape the torture. Maybe it was cruel, but surely, the logic went, the Communists were doing the same, and the US could not afford compassion. Besides, Sim figured, if he was willing to test the chemicals on himself first and he was fine, surely he could test them on others.\n\nOne chilling story is that of Private James Thornwell. Throwing informed consent to the wind, Sim theorized that expectations about a drug's effect would influence the intoxication, and so it was vital that the subjects did not know what they were given, or even that they were given anything. When word got around about the kind of experiments going on at Edgewood, Sim was forced to relocate his experiments to Europe and, eventually, to Asia. James Thornwell was the only African-American working at an American military-communications station in France. After a falling out with his superior, Thornwell was accused of stealing classified documents. After three months of torturous interrogations, Thornwell insisting on his innocence, he was released\u2014not to freedom, but into the hands of Sim's special investigators, who repeatedly dosed an already half-mad man with LSD without his knowledge. Thornwell never recovered. The experiment was deemed a success.\n\nIt wasn't only the military who were carelessly experimenting on humans. Under the innocuous-sounding title Effect of some Indolealkylines in Man, a 1959 medical paper details some rather cruel experiments. Ostensibly, the scientists set out to study the effects of a psychedelic snuff used across Central and South America. Failing to achieve any effect from the snuff, they isolated two pure chemical compounds for further study. They were n,n-DMT, a powerful psychedelic also found in the traditional brew ayahuasca, and bufotenine, a chemical cousin of the neurotransmitter serotonin. These chemicals were injected intravenously into schizophrenic patients.\n\nHere is a description of one of the experiments:\n\nIn several subjects who had more than 10 mg of bufotenine injected quickly, there was intense salivation. The present subject could easily have drowned in her own saliva, and she had to be turned on her side. (\u2026) Responsiveness returned at about 23 minutes, at which time the patient was entirely lucid and, in response to a query related to a preinjection question, spoke of a long-repressed memory from the age of three years, when she came into the bathroom and saw her mother die of a uterine hemorrhage.\n\nBut this revelation \"had no therapeutic consequence.\"\n\nIn further experiments, we read, three patients\u2014as if they were patients undergoing treatment, not guinea pigs for mad scientists\u2014were injected bufotenine after receiving reserpine or chlorpromazine (both antipsychotic drugs). \"Each of these injections almost proved fatal in small amounts.\" After one subject almost died, they repeated the experiment two more times just to make sure. It's the same absurd logic which prompted Sim's LSD researchers to respond to adverse reactions by doubling the dose in the next trial.\n\nThe LSD trials were suspended in 1963, but the Edgewood experiments continued into the 1970s.\n\nThe media are abuzz with news of an experiment that manages to create negative absolute temperature. Phys.org:\n\nIn order to bring water to the boil, energy needs to be added to the water. During heating up, the water molecules increase their kinetic energy over time and move faster on average. Yet, the individual molecules possess different kinetic energies \u2013 from very slow to very fast. In thermal equilibrium, low-energy states are more likely than high-energy states, i.e. only a few particles move really fast. In physics, this distribution is called Boltzmann distribution. Physicists around Ulrich Schneider and Immanuel Bloch have now realized a gas in which this distribution is exactly inverted: Many particles possess large energies and only a few have small energies. This inversion of the energy distribution means that the particles have assumed a negative absolute temperature.\n\nThe Boltzmann distribution can be illustrated with balls that are distributed on a hilly landscape, which provides both a lower and upper bound for the potential energy of the balls. At positive temperatures (left figure), as they are common in everyday life, most balls lie in the valley around minimum potential energy. They barely move and therefore also possess minimum kinetic energy. States with small total energy are therefore more likely than those with large total energy \u2013 the usual Boltzmann distribution. At infinite temperature (central figure) the balls spread evenly over low and high energies in an identical landscape. Here, all energy states are equally probable. At negative temperatures (right figure), however, most balls wander on top of the hill, at the upper limit of potential energy. Also their kinetic energy is maximal. Energy states with large total energy are occupied more than those with small total energy \u2013 the Boltzmann distribution is inverted.\n\nThis large study published earlier this year and involving tracking more than 400,000 participants over twelve years looked at the correlation between coffee drinking and mortality. It found that, all else being equal, there is an inverse correlation between coffee drinking and mortality, or, in other words, people who drink a lot of coffee died less often:\n\nIn this large, prospective U.S. cohort study, we observed a dose-dependent inverse association between coffee drinking and total mortality, after adjusting for potential confounders (smoking status in particular). As compared with men who did not drink coffee, men who drank 6 or more cups of coffee per day had a 10% lower risk of death, whereas women in this category of consumption had a 15% lower risk. Similar associations were observed whether participants drank predominantly caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee.\n\nHowever, all else is rarely equal. The study also found that coffee drinkers were more likely to have other habits, particularly smoking, that correlate with higher mortality. When not correcting for these factors, coffee drinkers were a bit more likely to die. In other words, coffee appears to be good for your health, but if you drink a lot of coffee, statistically you're more likely to have other, unhealthy habits that increase mortality.\n\nSome of the more interesting things that passed through these pages in 2012.\n\nThe Brocken Spectre is an optical phenomenon in which the observer's shadow appears to be magnified on clouds or fog below.\n\nPsychedelics are back in science. After decades of little research due to drug hysteria, scientists have started exploring the therapeutic potential of psychedelics and similar drugs again. Here is the New York Times reporting on a promising study of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD.\n\nOn February 9, 1913, a unique procession of meteors was observed from North America. This meteor shower may have been the breakup of a short-lived, small second moon.\n\nRare earth metals are important for a number of modern technologies. China has a near-monopoly on the world's supply, and they're prepared to use it for political gain.\n\nSome people might point out that \"conformations\" and \"configurations\" are also concepts in organic chemistry that mean much the same thing, and that this post is a thinly disguised effort to teach concepts in organic chemistry through a discussion of cats. Horseshit. This is 100% cat content here people! This is a cat blog.\n\nSometimes, the ways science goes wrong are as interesting as the ways it goes right. Nowadays, it seems uncommon for major discoveries which have been accepted by the scientific establishment for centuries to be proven completely wrong; they are more likely to be incrementally improved upon. Newtonian physics wasn't wrong, it just wasn't as right as Einstein's relativity (which is to say, in most everyday situations, the two are indistinguishable, but Newton goes wrong in border cases he had no way to test, or even conceive of). But in the early days of modern science, some theories were put forth and widely accepted which turned out to be not only less than complete, but spectacularly wrong. One of my favorites is the phlogiston theory of combustion, which turned out to be the exact opposite of correct.\n\nAnother is the theory of preformationism. It holds that living beings are not assembled from parts, but that their form has actually existed since creation. Human beings come from homunculi, from the Latin for \"little man\": in other words, humans grow from tiny versions of themselves which are identical in form to an adult. Even after Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, pioneer in microscopy, in 1677 discovered sperm cells, some scientists continued to hold that there must be tiny humans inside each cell (illustrated above). There was even scientific debate about whether the homunculi resided inside the ovum or the sperm cell. Today, this sounds like a \"how many angels can dance on the head of a pin?\" type of question.\n\nOf course, one consequence of such a theory would be that humanity has a predetermined lifespan. After all, if humans nest inside each other like Russian dolls, at some point, the chain must end. A single sperm cell cannot contain an infinite amount of tinier humans with even tinier sperm cells with tinier humans.\n\nI'm going to do something I don't usually do on this blog and recommend some science-minded fiction. Notice that I don't say \"science fiction\". A lot of sci-fi is indistinguishable from fantasy, introducing impossible premises and then ignoring them when convenient, applying them when the plot requires. Science-minded fiction, on the other hand, would be fiction that takes false or impossible premises and then works out, in logical fashion, what the consequences would be.\n\nOne of my favorite authors of such fiction is Ted Chiang. He is not a very prolific author, but almost everything he publishes is gold. Every year he publishes a story, he earns at least a nomination for a Hugo or Nebula award. You should check out his collection of short stories, Stories of Your Life and Others. In that book, there is a story called Seventy-Two Letters, which imagines a world where Jewish mysticism and the preformation theory are true. Division by Zero is a story about a mathematician who discovers that mathematics is inconsistent. The title story is perhaps the best one in the collection, dealing with the now discredited Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and some other stuff I'm not going to spoil. If this sort of thing interests you, do check it out. Most of the stories in the collection have been available online at one time or another, so you might be able to find them if you're cheap or impatient.\n\nIf you ever need to write an academic smackdown, let this document be your guide. Lyle Campbell, an expert in historical linguistics, basically destroys any sort of argument that we can know anything about the earliest human language.\n\nLanguage, presumably, evolved once. Logically, then, there should be a most recent common ancestor of all natural languages in the world. Linguists have a procedure called the comparative method by which they can figure out which languages are related, how they are related, and by which they can make reasonable reconstructions of the theoretical, unattested proto-languages that form the root of a language family. As you might expect, it hinges on side-by-side comparisons of languages. (Fun fact: one of the founders of historical linguistics and the comparative method is Jacob Grimm, most famous as one half of the folklore-collecting Brothers Grimm. Grimm's Law, a set of systematic sound changes in the history of Germanic languages, is named after him.)\n\nMost famously, linguists have reconstructed Proto-Indo-European, the unattested ancestor of languages as varied as Sanskrit, English, Latin and Russian. This language is believed to have been spoken some five or six thousand years ago. But humans are believed to have reached Australia by 50,000 years ago, so the common ancestor of all human languages would be at least ten times as old as Proto-Indo-European.\n\nSome people have attempted to use a comparative approach to reconstruct this language, but Campbell shows again and again how this approach yields results that are no better than chance. Basically, what defenders of \"Proto-World\" do is try to find words that mean roughly the same thing in different language families and which look roughly the same, but both the semantic and the phonetic constraints they use are extremely liberal. One of their defining examples is *tik, a root which supposedly meant \"finger\". Although Campbell doesn't say so in that many words, it's essentially wishful thinking. You find what you want to find, because, as Campbell demonstrates, it's extremely easy to find false correlations. Not to mention that if there is a common ancestor of all human languages, from what we know about how languages change over time, we would expect that every single word in every single language would have changed so much as to be unrecognizable over the past fifty thousand years.\n\nIn the end, says Campbell, we will never know much of anything about the earliest human languages unless we invent a time machine. There simply isn't any written material going back far enough, and there isn't enough information in present-day languages to reconstruct their oldest ancestors. The only thing we can know for sure about the earliest human language is that it would have obeyed certain universals\u2014the particulars of which are a subject of acedemic debate\u2014which all present-day human languages obey, but that is only by definition, because anything that came before that would not be what we today define as human language.\n\nIt's rare that we run into a scientific question that is fundamentally impossible to answer, but this is one of them. The information required to answer it simply doesn't exist. It's just one of those things, which is sad, because I, for one, find the emergence of language\u2014one of the defining features which distinguish humans from other animals\u2014to be extremely fascinating."}

In a recent study, we calculated what the effects would be expected to see in the climate due to the replacement of power plants based on coal by any of eight options cleaner.\n\nIn each case, the team of Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution for Science in the U.S., and Nathan Myhrvold of Intellectual Ventures Company, in the same nation, found that to achieve a substantial benefit in this century, humanity needs to begin a rapid transition to less polluting energy technologies like solar or wind power. Researchers have concluded that curbing global warming requires more time than previously thought.\n\nThe major disadvantage of many sources of clean, renewable energy, already in use or have been proposed, is its intermittency: the wind does not always blow, the sun does not always look in the sky, and produce electricity that these energies can not be available on some occasions when it is needed. One of the major goals of the research on the use of these energies has been finding ways to regulate these supplies fickle.\n\nNew results of a research program currently being conducted at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), U.S., show the feasibility of a technology that can help achieve one of the objectives sought: a way to store for supply electricity when the sun is not shining or the wind blows, and with a lower cost and longer than allowed by previous methods. The new system uses high temperature batteries whose liquid components are positioned on their own, naturally, in different layers due to their different densities.\n\nThe leaves of the plants are sealed with a strong layer of wax to prevent water loss. Plants breathe through microscopic pores called stomata, found on the surface of the leaves. Approximately 40 percent of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere passes through the stomate each year and a water volume equal to twice that exist in the entire atmosphere.\n\nBeing the key conduit for the absorption of CO2 and water evaporation, the stomata are essential for both the climate and plant productivity. Thus it is not surprising that the total number and distribution of the stomata is very tightly regulated by plants to optimize photosynthesis and also to minimize water loss.\n\nAn innovative wireless technology that allows people with certain disabilities, including some spinal cord injuries high level skillfully maneuver a power wheelchair, or control a mouse cursor, using all simple movements of the tongue, has been perfected so that now it is less cumbersome and more efficient.\n\nThe innovative control system using a language is gaining increasing prominence among the latest devices to assist people with severe disabilities, such as from spinal cord injuries or degenerative diseases.

The fuel was mixed in with the sandy bottom, forming a contamination layer 'sandwich' type of tar and sand.\n\nThe isolates were cultured in the laboratory using a growth medium like they have in their natural environment and fed only with naphthalene. \"We started with some cultures containing many bacterial species, until, little by little, they were selecting only those able to degrade this substance,\" says Silvia Marques Martin, a researcher at the CSIC.\n\nThe H1N1 flu may cause delirious behavior in children infected with late onset and may last up to two days, concluded a study released by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).

{"text":"Fifth development, Martian water, the DNA time machine, cosmology and epigenetics. The original articles are now behind a paywall; they won't be reproduced here, but their gist is present. I'll try to put them in context and specifically within the Impact Areas of SciTechStory.\n\nWhen I was a kid (a few decades ago), my parents took me to Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming, USA). I remember marveling at many things, not the least of which were the brilliant colors in and near the pools of very hot water \u2013 oranges, yellows, greens \u2013 in all hues. I wondered aloud what made the colors and I was told the common wisdom of the day that most of the colors were from minerals dissolved in the water, except maybe some green, which was from algae. There were probably a few biologists of the time who suspected the presence of bacteria in these pools, but it was generally agreed that bacteria couldn't live in the heat of these waters.\n\nThe concept of the thermophile, heat loving microorganisms, was probably first used in 1879 and promptly put on the mental back-shelf by almost all biologists. While it was accepted that some forms of plant life (algae) could tolerate higher temperatures (between 60 and 80 degrees Celsius, 140-180 degrees Fahrenheit), it just didn't seem likely that any form of animal life could survive. This 'intuition' was generally frozen into many scientists' thinking in the form of a bias.\n\nThat bias persisted until research in the 1980's and 90's showed that not only could bacteria live \u2013 and thrive \u2013 in hot environments, but there were, in fact, such a thing as hyperthermophiles that could live in water up to and above the boiling point. Many of these microorganisms were highly specialized bacteria, and many more were from what is now recognized as a completely distinct domain of life \u2013 the Archaea. It is such creatures that produce the colorful bands around thermal pools in Yellowstone. These days, the study of such extremophiles, life in extreme conditions, is of enormous biological and even commercial importance.\n\nIn a similar vein, scientists have known since the 19th century that the human body contained bacteria. Mostly though, these bacteria were known as the cause of disease. It was assumed that they didn't belong in the body. This intuition became frozen into common knowledge, a bias. Even when it was later shown that some bacteria lived inside the body, particularly in the gut and were probably part of the digestive system, the focus was still very much on dealing with the destructive bacterial invaders. In short, the bias continued to guide the accepted wisdom and most of the research effort.\n\nUnbelievable as it might seem now, it wasn't until the year 2000, when Nobelist Joshua Lederberg published in Science a broadside aimed at his fellow bacteriologists:\n\nNew strategies and tactics for countering pathogens will be uncovered by finding and exploiting innovations that evolved within other species in defense against infection. But our most sophisticated leap would be to drop the Manichaean view of microbes \u2013 \"We good; they evil.\" Microbes indeed have a knack for making us ill, killing us, and even recycling our remains to the geosphere. But in the long run microbes have a shared interest in their hosts' survival: A dead host is a dead end for most invaders too. Domesticating the host is the better long-term strategy for pathogens.\n[Source: From Science Magazine: Infectious History]\n\nEven Lederberg couldn't purge his language of the 'pathogen' view of microorganisms, but those who heeded his call for a more equanimous view of microbes in the human body soon began to discover that the reality called for a wholly different view. For example, as is now often cited, the human body contains far more cells of microbes than our own cells \u2013 by almost 10 to 1. There are at least 1,000 species living inside us, and most of them are symbiotic or at least commensal (one sided benefit). This vast community of mostly non-pathogenic microorganisms is now called the microbiome, an ecology inside us.\n\nAs you can imagine, with only ten years of research microbiologists have just begun to scratch the surface of this newly appreciated relationship between human and microbe. For example, while scientists knew that bacteria were involved with digestion, a 2004 study by a team working with Jeffrey Gordon at the Washington University School of Medicine (St. Louis, Missouri, USA) discovered that bacteria were essential partners in helping to break down the food we eat and to make metabolic use of it.\n\nThe microbiome is now linked to various aspects of human health, including the proper functioning of our immune system. It is also suspected that bacterial DNA may play an active role in our own DNA development. With each new study the links to bacteria within the body proliferate. This new view is even extending to diminish an even greater bias \u2013 the bias against viruses. A new term, the virome was coined to encompass the role that viruses have within the normal functioning of the body, as strange as that may seem.\n\nSome of the practical impact of research into the microbiome and virome will be a better understanding of their benefits to the body \u2013 and how to keep it that way. Scientists are also learning that the microbiome is highly individualized; we can be identified as individuals by the denizens of our gut. These same fellow-travelers also identify our culture and genetic background. This has led research into areas of diet and body chemistry. In fact, the knowledge of the microbiome is leading research into fundamental metabolic pathways that were not even suspected ten years ago. This work will in time have an impact on cell biology, immune systems, and genetics.\n\n3 Trackbacks\n\n[...] that you're an ecosystem?

Sarah Harrop reports.\n\nThe great war: infections and ingenuity\n\nWhen the First World War broke out in 1914, the MRC was barely a year old, but it reacted quickly to focus research on the national war effort. Gangrene, caused by bacteria which thrive in oxygen-free conditions such as soil, was a particular problem for men fighting in the muddy trenches of France and Belgium during WW1. This horrifying condition causes living tissue to decay and die and was responsible for many limb amputations and deaths in soldiers whose wounds had become infected. But by the eve of Armistice Day in 1918, MRC researchers had managed to develop the first serum for the prevention and cure of wound gangrene, which contained anti-toxins against all three bacteria involved.\n\nDesperate times also fuelled ingenuity. Ships bringing home the wounded had poor sanitary conditions, but antiseptics were in short supply. With MRC funding, British chemist Dr Henry Drysdale Dakin managed to work out a cheap way to produce large quantities of an antiseptic from sea water. 'Dakin's Solution' reduced secondary infections in repatriated soldiers to almost zero. Read more"}

By The Associated Press and Bloomberg News\n\nIS GRAVITY left-handed? An answer could provide a clue to a long-sought theory of quantum gravity - and might be within our grasp by 2013. General relativity describes gravity's actions at large scales. For tiny scales however, a theory of quantum gravity , incorporating quantum mechanics, is needed.\n\nWelcome to the Elementary Particle Explorer, designed by Garrett Lisi and Troy Gardner . Every known elementary particle is identified by its charges with respect to the electromagnetic, weak, strong, and gravitational forces. Electrons have electric charge -1, up quarks 2\/3, down quarks -1\/3, and neutrinos 0, with antiparticles having opposite electric charges.\n\nFail an alcohol test and you could lose your job. But confidence is draining from the blood and urine tests that are supposed to show conclusively whether someone has been drinking \u2013 and the US government has decided it's time to take another look at them. Typically, the body destroys alcohol within 6 hours, so the tests are designed to pick up tiny amounts of substances such as ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulphate (EtS) that are formed exclusively from the breakdown of alcohol.\n\nA BALL spinning in a vacuum should never slow down, since no outside forces are acting on it. At least that's what Newton would have said. But what if the vacuum itself creates a type of friction that puts the brakes on spinning objects? The effect, which might soon be detectable, could act on interstellar dust grains. In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle says we can never be sure that an apparent vacuum is truly empty. Instead, space is fizzing with photons that are constantly popping into and out of existence before they can be measured directly.\n\nABSOLUTE zero sounds like an unbreachable limit beyond which it is impossible to explore. In fact there is a weird realm of negative temperatures that not only exists in theory, but has also proved accessible in practice. An improved way of getting there, outlined last week, could reveal new states of matter. Temperature is defined by how the addition or removal of energy affects the amount of disorder, or entropy, in a system.\n\nLight has been used to generate aerodynamic-like lift for the first time. The technique, which takes advantage of the fact that light bends, or refracts, when moving from one medium to another, could be used to create solar-sail spacecraft that could steer using light itself. Photons create pressure when they bounce off objects. Solar sail prototypes are made highly reflective to maximise this push, but the effect does not allow the sails to be easily steered. \"It's well known you can use a light source to push on something, but the steering mechanisms are still up for grabs,\" says Grover Swartzlander of the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York.\n\nPhysicists are considering delaying a planned shutdown of the Large Hadron Collider by a year to keep hot on the trail of the elusive Higgs particle. Located near Geneva, Switzerland, the LHC is the most powerful particle smasher ever built, designed to produce collisions at energies up to 14 trillion electron volts (TeV). It was built to look for the Higgs particle, which is thought to endow other subatomic particles, such as electrons, with mass. But the LHC's ramp-up to full energy has been slower than expected.\n\nIF YOU want to look at individual atoms, it helps to have a powerful microscope. But for delicate situations such as a lone atom on the edge of a sheet of carbon atoms, a high-energy beam can disturb the bonds that hold such atoms in place, making them difficult to study. Now, for the first time, a low-energy beam has been used to count these bonds. In the past, beams of high-energy electrons have been used to probe individual atoms. For example, such an electron beam was used to identify single atoms of so-called \"rare earth\" elements that were trapped inside buckyballs , round cages made of carbon atoms. By looking at the energy spectra of the electrons that bounced back, researchers could deduce the size of the atom inside, and so identify it.\n\nThe Large Hadron Collider has not yet seen any of the microscopic black holes that inspired numerous scare stories in recent years. Many theorists actually hope the collider, based near Geneva, Switzerland, will create short-lived, miniature black holes . These would not pose a threat to Earth , but they would provide evidence for hypothetical extra dimensions that might lie beyond the 3D world we normally experience. If these dimensions exist, gravitons, the particles thought to transmit the force of gravity, could leak into them, providing a much-needed explanation for why gravity is much weaker than the other forces. At the high energies created inside the LHC, though, colliding protons could be affected even by gravitons in the extra dimensions, making gravity strong enough to create fleeting black holes. So far, however, they have not emerged.\n\nHurray for the European Court of Human Rights. It has rejected an emergency injunction to block the Large Hadron Collider from turning on on 10 September. It's the latest legal case brought against the LHC by scientists who fear that the world's largest particle accelerator will produce fearsome entities that could destroy the Earth. I'm thrilled that the ECHR has understood the science and has given the LHC the green light. Because let's get something straight: the world is not going to end on 10 September. Here's why.\n\nMeet PG5, the largest stable synthetic molecule ever made. With a diameter of 10 nanometres and a mass equal to 200 million hydrogen atoms, this huge molecule festooned with tree-like appendages, paves the way to sophisticated structures capable of storing drugs within their folds, or bonding to a wide variety of different substances. Complex macromolecules abound in nature and PG5 is about the same size as tobacco mosaic virus . But making such large molecules in the lab is tough, as they tend to fall apart while they are being made. \"Synthetic chemistry so far was simply not capable of approaching the size range of such functional units,\" says Dieter Schl\u00fcter at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Z\u00fcrich. Previously, polystyrene was the largest stable synthetic molecule, at 40 million hydrogen masses.\n\nThunderstorms have been caught producing one of the most mysterious substances in the universe: antimatter .

NASA's Fermi spacecraft seems to have been hit by the antimatter counterpart to electrons \u2013 positrons \u2013 emanating from thunderstorms on Earth. Thunderstorms emit gamma rays, known as terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs), although what causes them is still a mystery."}

{"text":"Science News\n\nHow People Work ... and the Fingerprint Mystery\n\nJan. 7, 2010 \u2014 Why do we chew our food? Research has shown that it is not, as has long been presumed, to make chunks of food small enough to swallow without choking. Biomechanics, who have modelled the cohesive strength of food after a certain amount of chewing, have shown that we actually chew our food to ensure it is in a firm blob and, therefore, safe to swallow.\n\nShare This:\n\nWriting in January's Physics World, Dr Roland Ennos, a biomechanic in the Faculty of Life Sciences at University of Manchester, explains how we need to look beyond obvious answers if we are to understand how our own bodies work.\n\nExplaining why we swing our arms, why we have notched teeth, why our fingernails always break in the same direction, and, still puzzling, why we have fingerprints, Dr Ennos shows how rich the boundary between biology and physics is in, some counter-intuitive but, potentially significant discoveries.\n\nOn the fingerprint puzzle, we know that fingerprints are useful to identify people for security and crime detection, but no scientist has ever suggested that fingerprints evolved specifically for this purpose. It has been thought that fingerprints help us to grip more tightly to objects, but tests show that a rough surface does not actually increase the friction of soft materials such as skin.\n\nFingerprint friction is therefore a mystery that has left Dr Ennos's team testing a number of options -- it could be that fingerprints act like the treads on tyres, removing water and so increasing friction under wet conditions. Another possibility is that prints also make the skin more flexible and stop it blistering.\n\nAs Dr Ennos writes, \"The answers to these questions may appear obvious or even trivial, but further thought and experiment is revealing that our world is far more fascinating than we could have dreamed.\"\n\nWhat's more, this sort of research, unlike many areas of physics, is not expensive or mathematically hard. \"All you need is an enquiring mind, a bit of ingenuity and the courage to ask awkward questions,\" concludes Dr Ennos."}

We covered the topic generally, but also focused on the flu and H1N1. Seriously, he was as straightforward as you can get, and I truly appreciated the answers he was able to give to my many questions.\n\nVaccines have become a touchy subject of late, and having accurate information on which you can base your decisions is vital. I hope this episode is spread far and wide just like the diseases vaccines are meant to protect us from.\n\nRecently, on Dr. Kiki's Science Hour, I spoke with Karen James of the Natural History Museum in London, UK. She's a biologist working on several interesting and interrelated projects.\n\nFirst, at the Natural History Museum, she works as a botanist and has been involved in an international effort to develop a genetic bar-coding process for plants. She is also responsible for their Darwin research memorabilia\u2026 i.e. specimens that Darwin collected while traveling to the Galapagos and back, like the Floreana mockingbirds, which were massively important in the development of Darwin's great idea.\n\nAdditionally, she is the science director for the Beagle Project, whose aim is to build a replica of the HMS Beagle and sail it as a research vessel to the Galapagos.\n\nAda Lovelace was an intellectual woman in an age when women weren't pushed to be intellectual. Her mother made sure she was trained in mathematics rather than literature so that she wouldn't follow in her father's (the poet Lord Byron's) footsteps.\n\nThis training as well as her place in society put her in a position to meet and work with an academic named Charles Babbage who hired her to help on his \"Analytical Engine.\" Ada took the project and ran with it, elaborating on the idea in notes that contain the first computer algorithm. She is now considered the world's first computer programmer.\n\nThere are many things that made the story of Ada Lovelace possible: her noble birth and marriage, her mother's reactionary nature, her training, the people she met in life, etc. But, central to the story is the passion that Ada had for her academic endeavors.\n\nHad she simply been a translator, that's all she would have done for Charles Babbage\u2026 translated an article from Italian that he could then use in developing his ideas. Instead, she dug into the ideas and came up with ideas of her own. She wasn't afraid to write those ideas down and share them.\n\nAnd, now we celebrate her and what she helped make possible.\n\nWomen today have it fairly easy compared to the women of the past (I'm referring to women in first world nations here\u2026 I know there are many women around the world who still struggle). We can do what ever we set our minds to. We can take on the historically female held roles of mother, teacher, nurse, secretary, or we can be doctors, lawyers, astronauts\u2026 it's up to us.\n\nThe doors are open like they never have been. All we have to do is walk through them.\n\nBy finding and following our passions, we create new opportunities for the women who will follow. We make it easier for them to do what they dream of doing.\n\nI am lucky in that as a young scientist, I was able to find wonderful female mentors to learn from. I saw that it is possible to be a successful woman in science. I saw that it is possible to have a family at the same time. I saw that I could do it too if I wanted.\n\nUnfortunately, there aren't enough female role models in the sciences. The number of women in academics is growing, but it is still not equal to the number of men. It's not because women don't like science, or aren't studying science. The numbers just drop between graduate school and getting jobs.\n\nThat means that most women entering graduate school aren't seeing other women in those positions of responsibility.\n\nAnd, if seeing is believing, then we still have work to do.\n\nBut, that will come with time, and in the meantime, I'd like to thank all the women, like Ada, who toiled in the science or technology that inspired their questions.\n\nThe Red Queen has to keep running just to stay in the same place. In the same vein, drug development for infectious diseases has to constantly keep on its toes. Infectious disease sources, like some bacteria, can evolve resistance to our drugs, and when that happens we need new drugs to maintain our effective battle against the threat to our health.\n\nBut, is there a way to get around this process of evolution - to be done with this race for survival? Dr. Andrew Read and several other researchers think there is, and they are working on ways to create \"evolution-proof\" drugs.\n\nI spoke with Dr. Read last week on Dr. Kiki's Science Hour. We discussed this idea of \"evolution-proof\", focusing specifically on the malaria parasite and strategies that he and his colleagues are working on to reduce the impact that malaria has on people around the world. We also spent time talking about evolution generally, and why Dr. Read finds it so fascinating.\n\nI invite you to take a listen to the show - you can find it in audio format here. Or, you can watch it in video at ODTV.me.\n\nIf you have ever thought critically about the American educational system, and come away with the impression (as I have) that the future of our nation is doomed, you might find this episode uplifting.\n\nNo matter what you have heard, there are teachers who care. There are teachers who try new and different approaches to teaching. There are places in the United States where children are actually learning science.\n\nZach Ronneberg is a science teacher at Da Vinci High School in Davis, CA. He has been recognized as among the best science teachers in the US. I got to talk with him about the ways he employs hands-on learning in the classroom, and about the KSTF Teaching Fellowship he was awarded.\n\nA couple of weeks ago I had the distinct pleasure of talking with Ariel Waldman of Spacehack.org on Dr. Kiki's Science Hour.\n\nWe talked a lot about citizen science and the importance of opening up science to the public. She told me about several interesting projects, like GalaxyZoo, which relies on the public to process massive amounts of astronomical data.\n\nAriel also talked a bit about what got her interested in space and the realm of collaborative science.\n\nI'm just looking for original science-y music for the This Week in Science 2010 Compilation Album.\n\nThe guidelines are that it needs to be about science or inspired by science AND YOU MUST BE ABLE TO GRANT ME LICENSE TO USE IT.\n\nI don't want something by Blackalicious unless you are in Blackalicious. That said, if you are a friend ofBlackalicious, tell them to get in touch with me.\n\nWhy am I making a science-y music album? Well, I've made an album for our home radio station's annual fundraiser each year for the past four years, and I'd like to go for a fifth.\n\nOur station, KDVS 90.3 FM in Davis, is a non-commercial, free-form radio station that gets more than half of its budget from its annual fundraiser. We set aside a portion of the limited cd pressing for use as premium gifts for people who donate to KDVS during our show. The remainder of the cds are sold later in the year in order to recoup our production costs. TWIS makes no money from these albums.\n\nWhat we need, however, are super cool science-y songs donated for use on the album. Without songs, there is no album.\n\nAs a musician what do you get in return?

{"text":"Meta\n\nArchive for April 10th, 2009\n\nFor millennia, people have watched the birds and bees and wondered: \"How do they do that?\"\n\nThanks to high-speed film and some persistent scientists, at least one of the secrets of flight is now revealed. When birds, bats or bugs make a turn, all they have to do is start flapping their wings normally again and they straighten right out. That came as a surprise to researchers who thought turning and stopping took more steps.\n\nLead researcher Tyson L. Hedrick of the University of North Carolina compared it to sitting at a desk chair and turning left. It's a three-step process, launch the turn by pushing with one foot, turn, then stop by pushing with the other.\n\nIt's a simpler, one-step process for flying animals, he explained in a telephone interview, launch a turn and then simply flap normally to end it and fly away. The findings are reported in Friday's edition of the journal Science.\n\n\"We didn't expect things to fall out this neatly,\" he said, particularly since the process is the same for animals of all sizes from the fruit fly to the bat to the cockatoo. \"It's sort of unusual\" to find a general rule to cover six orders of magnitude in size, he said. The findings should help in the development of robotic flying machines, he said. But, of course, this study focuses only on one type of maneuver, turning left or right, which is known as yaw in aviation. There's still pitch, nose up or nose down, and roll, which is tilting left or right, to be dealt with.\n\nAFTER billions of years of runaway expansion, is the universe starting to slow down? A new analysis of nearby supernovae suggests space might not be expanding as quickly as it once was, a tantalising hint that the source of dark energy may be more exotic than we thought.\n\nFor more than a decade, astrophysicists have grappled with evidence of a baffling force that seems to be pushing the universe apart at an ever-increasing rate. Exactly what constitutes the dark energy responsible for this cosmic speed-up is unknown, says Michael Turner at the University of Chicago. \"The simplest question we can ask is 'does the dark energy change with time?'\"\n\nSo far, the evidence has suggested that dark energy is constant, though its effect on the universe has become stronger as the universe has expanded and the gravitational force between objects weakens with distance.\n\nNow an analysis of supernovae suggests dark energy may actually be on the wane. In a paper on the physics preprint website, a team led by Arman Shafieloo at the University of Oxford examined a newly released catalogue of supernova explosions, including a number of relatively recent blasts nearby ( They found that the new data made the best fit with a universe in which dark energy is losing strength. \"It seems acceleration is slowing down,\" says Shafieloo.\n\nThe first evidence of dark energy emerged in 1998, when two teams of astronomers spotted distant supernova explosions that appeared dimmer than expected, and so further away. The find suggested the exploding stars were receding from Earth faster than anticipated, and therefore so was the rest of the universe. \"Dark energy\" was invoked to explain the apparent anomaly. Since then more supernovae have been catalogued to help build up a picture of how the universe has expanded over time\u2026\n\n\u2026 a potential bias could have been introduced thanks to dimmer objects being easier to see if they are nearby. It is possible that the Harvard team happened to catalogue a disproportionate number of nearby supernovae that were faint or obscured by dust. Astronomers must correct for the dimming effect of dust and other subtleties in order to estimate a supernova's true peak brightness. But the team may have overcompensated in this correction, producing a catalogue of nearby supernovae that are slightly too bright for their distance. That would create the illusion that the universe's acceleration has been slowing.\n\nWe've seen mood pencils and mood radios, and some creative Mini Cooper Promotions. Now, we've just found out that Mini is going to start making the Mini Chameleon, the world's first color changing car. The key is a special kind of coating: \"Cars treated with FeintPaint comprises tiny magnetic iron oxide particles which can interact with a low grade magnetic field to change the spacing of the particles, and hence its ability to reflect light and change color.\"\n\n\"BMW's MINI division will debut its first color-morphing car in Singapore in June. Called the MINI Chameleon, the car changes color according to weather conditions.\n\nFor example, on a rainy day, the car's paint brightens to improve visibility while on a sunny day, it lightens to reflect heat and cool down the vehicle.\n\nThe color-morphing technology was made possible due to a special treatment called FeintPaint by Spanish company Payola Forlids.\n\nCars treated with FeintPaint comprises tiny magnetic iron oxide particles which can interact with a low grade magnetic field to change the spacing of the particles, and hence its ability to reflect light and change color.\n\nThe color changes take effect in seconds, and should be quite a sight to behold!

Scientists at the University of Calgary have created a new instrument that is able to track the transition between the relatively gentle winds of Earth's atmosphere and the more violent flows of charged particles in space \u2013 flows that can reach speeds well over 1000 km\/hr. And they have accomplished this in unprecedented detail.\n\nData received from the U of C-designed instrument sent to space on a NASA launch from Alaska about two years ago was able to help pinpoint the so-called edge of space: the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space.\n\nWith that data, U of C scientists confirmed that space begins 118 km above Earth and the results were published this week in the Journal of Geophysical Research.\n\nThe instrument \u2013 called the Supra-Thermal Ion Imager \u2013 was carried by the JOULE-II rocket on Jan. 19, 2007. It travelled to an altitude of about 200 kilometers above sea level and collected data for the five minutes it was moving through the \"edge of space.\"\n\nThe Canadian Space Agency invested $422,000 in the development of the Supra-Thermal Ion Imager instrument on JOULE-II.\n\nThe ability to gather data in that area is significant because it's very difficult to make measurements in this region, which is too high for balloons and too low for satellites.\n\n\"It's only the second time that direct measurements of charged particle flows have been made in this region, and the first time all the ingredients \u2013 such as the upper atmospheric winds \u2013 have been included,\" says David Knudsen, associate professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Calgary. \u2026\n\n\"When you drag a heavy object over a surface, the interface becomes hot. In JOULE-II we were able to measure directly two regions being dragged past each other, one being the ionosphere \u2014 being driven by flows in space \u2014 and the other the earth's atmosphere,\" says Knudsen, who also is the head of the Space Physics Division of the Institute for Space Imaging Sciences (ISIS). The institute is a research partnership between the University of Calgary and University of Lethbridge.\n\nThe measurements confirmed what other scientists consider the boundary or edge of space.\n\n\u2026 The paper \"Rocket-based measurements of ion velocity, neutral wind, and electric field in the collisional transition region of the auroral ionosphere\" was published this week in the Journal of Geophysical Research. It can be found on-line at\n\n\nThis confirms that space is 387,139 feet (73 miles ) up. Here is a related story from Poker Flat AK (SPX) Jan 24, 2007:\n\nFrom Poker Flat Research Range north of Fairbanks, four NASA rockets launched into an aurora display over northern Alaska, starting at 3:29 a.m. Alaska Standard Time. Scientists hope to learn more about electrical heating of the thin atmosphere from about 60 to 120 miles above Earth's surface with the launch of these rockets. The project is called JOULE II. Staff at Poker Flat Research Range coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure that airspace was secure before launching all rockets. Each rocket's flight lasted about 12 minutes, and all rockets performed as planned, flying to their desired locations in space, with precision greater than 95 percent.\n\nMiguel Larsen, a professor at Clemson University, was the principal investigator for JOULE II, which consisted of two Terrier Orions, a Black Brant V, and a Black Brant IX. The rockets launched in two pairs\u2013the pairs consisted of one rocket with instruments to read the detailed structure of the electrical currents within the aurora, while a second rocket released a visible tracer of trimethyl aluminum vapor to measure the winds and turbulence at that altitude range.\n\nUsing sensitive digital and film cameras, scientists watching from Poker Flat, Coldfoot, and Fort Yukon determined how winds in the upper atmosphere contorted the visible tracer. They will use the information to track the winds in the aurora region.\n\nThe two releases of trimethyl aluminum produced a milky white glow when exposed to oxygen in the upper atmosphere, and may have been visible over parts of Alaska. \u2013 space-travel.com\n\nJaguar is located at the National Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS), part of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee, and has a peak operating performance of 1.64 petaflops, meaning it can perform more than a million billion mathematical operations every second.\n\nJaguar has 181,000 processing cores, compared to the one or two found in most desktop machines. The world's only more powerful computer is the US Nuclear Security Administration's 1.7-petaflop Roadrunner at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.\n\nYes, it is possible to repair and even regrow your teeth using a completely natural method that is actually based on science. A team of Alberta researchers applied for a patent that claims they created a miniature device that will stimulate the jaw bones and gums around the affected tooth. Using the low intensity ultrasound technology, they claim they were able to regrow the root of a tooth and stimulate tooth grow and repair.\n\nAlthough the technology is not going to be in your local dental office for a few years, I believe we don't have to wait for it and apply the common sense to do the whole process ourselves. First, we need a low frequency ultrasound source and from all the legally (you can't buy a real ultrasound machine unless you are a doctor) available sources two come to mind.\n\nFirst is a Novasonic Massager that can generate a sound vibration of 20,000 Hertz. It is not your regular massager and all you have to do is slightly touch the skin and you can feel the sound waves go deep within your body. I have one myself and love using it.\n\nSecond device is more sophisticated and you can find them selling on Ebay. The link searches for the Ebay results for \"ultrasound massager\" and you will see a bunch of them selling from $100 to $150. They are much more powerful then a Novasonic model and can generate up to 3-5 mHz frequency, so be very careful when using one. You should get one that generates only 1-2 mHz, as 3-5 mHz vibrations don't go very far \u2013 about 1\/8\u2033-1\/4\u2033 deep.\n\nSo, what I do is I apply the sound waves from the device to my teeth and gums for a few minutes every day and get a gentle but thorough massage this way.\n\nI have a tooth I'd like to regrow, right NOW. Has this worked for anyone? I want to do this \u2026 so if any doctors know of cancer risks from ultrasounding your tooth roots and jaw, speak up. Or if the people in Alberta have any tips based on their research, let us know. This from Science Daily:\n\nScienceDaily (June 28, 2006) \u2014 Hockey players, rejoice! A team of University of Alberta researchers has created technology to regrow teeth \u2013 the first time scientists have been able to reform human dental tissue.\n\n\u2026 Using low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS), Dr. Tarak El-Bialy from the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry and Drs. Jie Chen and Ying Tsui from the Faculty of Engineering have created a miniaturized system-on-a-chip that offers a non-invasive and novel way to stimulate jaw growth and dental tissue healing.\n\n\"It's very exciting because we have shown the results and actually have something you can touch and feel that will impact the health of people in Canada and throughout the world,\" \"braces\"\"If the root is broken, it can now be fixed,\" said El-Bialy. \"And because we can regrow the teeth root, a patient could have his own tooth rather than foreign objects in his mouth.\" \u2013 scienceDaily\n\nThis is about our eighteen month test of using LIPUS to regrow pulp and dentin at an accelerated rate for mature and senior people. The process invigorates the inside of our teeth for increased healthier tissue. The added growth of dentin bolsters the enamel as it was when you were a younger person. In addition to the above an increase of density in mandible bone and upper tooth support solidifies tooth roots. Our experience shows a solid bite equal to that in our teenage years. The ringing of teeth when biting down hard, which we had forgotten entirely, was back again. Professor Paul Sharpe, Head of the Department of Craniofacial Development, King's College London stated: \"A key medical advantage of this newAt the present time our technology is at the stage where regrowing teeth is limited to teeth with live roots. The inner part of the tooth, dentin is alive and in regrowing will expand into its initial, youthful proportions. The dentin thereby puts equal pressure on the Enamel part of the tooth as in the younger person. This naturally recurring rejuvenation has a propensity to expel such parts of the tooth enamel which have previously been broken, which may result in its loss. Our experience is based on our use of this methodology and equipment and is now in its third year. Any person planning to use this Canadian LIPUS technique can inquire with questions to our test section. \u2013 hopp , lipus.org"}

{"text":"Neuroscientist Takes on Criminal Justice System: In a fascinating article published this month in the Atlantic Monthly, David Eagleman argues that criminal behavior (and the decision not to engage in criminal behavior) may not always be a matter of choice, but for some at least may have more to do with biology.

When the FAAH enzyme breaks down the endocannabinoids, the opposite of paranoia happens: tolerance for fear shoots up. So what scientists have essentially created is a set of mice that have no fear and are probably very high.\n\nWe were going to Photoshop a No Fear shirt on Willie, but it felt so wrong\n\nThis discovery is intended to treat post traumatic stress disorder, but it can do so much more. Mice were conditioned to fear electric shocks to their feet, then turned in to a bunch of John McClains (from Diehard, kids) and just shook off their foot injuries while under the influence of the drug.\n\nBut, hey, they're only mice! So what if they don't fear anything! It's not like they can do anything special, like, say, run one-foot per-second for a solid three miles?\n\nOh, wait. Some researchers from Case Western Reserve University did exactly that. As you can see in the video below\u2026\n\n\u2026the normal mouse struggles to maintain a steady run for more than a few seconds, while the so called \"mighty mouse\" treads that mill with the same determination that Speedy Gonzales uses to chase down whatever Speedy Gonzales likes (meth, probably).\n\nEven more terrifying is the following quote from one of the researchers about these genetically enhanced terrors:\n\n\"They are metabolically similar to Lance Armstrong biking up the Pyrenees.\"\n\nIn other words, these are mice that can survive boat loads of cancer in their bodies and still have enough energy to beat everyone in a bike race across France multiple times, and on top of that still have enough energy to bang Sheryl Crow at the end of the day (probably twice because he only has half the goods).\n\nThe explanation of how scientists singled out the gene that can make this happen is packed with science jargon. In fact, it would probably make you flash back to your high school chemistry class and fake an illness so you can spend the rest of the time it would take to read this article failing to lose your collective virginities by hitting on the nurese. We researched it, like, hard, and came up with the following explanation:\n\nStep 1: They found a thing that does a thing.\n\nStep 2: They made that thing work harder than usual via an energetic and inspirational 80s-inspired movie montage.\n\nStep 3: They created little monsters with this newly enhanced thing.\n\nStep 4: We all die at the fast hands and rapidly nibbling little teeth of the monsters created by the enhanced thing. (This step has not yet come to pass, but it's certainly scheduled).\n\nSo now they don't fear us and they can outlast us in a foot race, but at least we can communicate. It's safe to say that communicating has been a big advantage for us. Luckily, mice lack the capacity for speech. Or rather, they lacked the capacity for speech. Like a bunch of antisocial jerks, some scientists from the Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology straight up gave some mice the genes we use to speak and it rewired the communication areas of their brains so they functioned more like ours. Those were our genes, dammit! Well, sort of.\n\nThe gene that gives us the ability to speak, called FOXP2, is present in pretty much every animal, including the mammals we evolved from, chimps. At some point in our parallel evolution, chimps and soon-to-be humans split off, and we eventually developed a more robust FOXP2 gene. Again this was done through another 1980s-inspired movie montage in which early humans lifted a lot of logs with their mouths as \"Eye of the Tiger\" blared and those unable to lift logs died off for some reason.\n\nWe're not so different after all.\n\nMice have FOXP2 as well, but their version of the gene, along with every other non-verbal communicating animal on earth that isn't a human, is non-functional. It's the genetic equivalent of an appendix or wisdom teeth. So the aforementioned asshole scientists from Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology gave some lab mice small samples of our version of FOXP2 and, lo and behold, the secretly-smart rodents \"showed changes in brain circuits that have previously been linked to human speech.\" The mice aren't flapping their lips, talking about how they've never actually liked cheese, and that we're idiots for assuming that. However, the baby mice began to sub-vocally communicate (kind of like vibrating their vocal chords) when they were taken away from their nests. Yes, you read that right: We're not only giving rats superpowers, but we're snatching the young super-mice away from their mothers. One day, they're going to get really pissed at these scientists, we're just saying.\n\nConclusion: They may not be able to hold lengthy conversations just yet, but a sub-vocally communicating mouse is far scarier than one that squeaks non-specifically and then drops a pellet.\n\nWhat's worse, scientists from the University of Ottawa played God and made mice smarter.\n\nIn an effort to further our understanding of developmental disorders such as autism, researcher David Picketts and his team took some mice and messed around with their Snf2l gene, a gene that aids in the organizing of a cell's genetic material, and also determines which other genes are active or inactive. In other words, Snf2l is your cable company and it has the final say in whether or not you're watching TV tonight by turning off your access to Keeping Up With The Kardashians at its discretion.\n\nAt this rate we might as well give mice some sort of anti-aging protein that extends their lifespans by 16%, and then implant false memories in to their brains so they can have some deeply rooted yet not completely understood psychological desire for revenge like a bunch of maze-running Jason Bournes (from Bourne identity, old-timers)\n\nAs you could have guessed, we've done both of those awful, awful things.\n\nIsraeli scientists found something remarkable about a set of proteins called sirtuins. There are seven types of sirtuins, and it is theorized they play some role in our aging process and in the fighting of disease. The sixth type of sirtuin, SIRT6, is what the researches focused on. They didn't focus on our SIRT6, of course; they focused on the SIRT6 of mice. Turns out, if you load up a mouse with a bunch of SIRT6, the animal's life expectancy rockets, making them live up to 16% longer than normal. Not only that, but the SIRT6 packed mice were able to eat the fattiest, nastiest, most unhealthy foods in huge quantities (for a mouse) and never show a single sign of heart disease or a fatty liver.\n\nThe researches don't know why the sirtuin proteins hold the key to making us impervious to disease and possibly allowing us to live forever, but mice are getting it first and we're screwed\n\nJust do this and get it over with, already\n\nPerhaps the creepiest experiment of all involved implanting false memories in to mice. Mark Mayford of the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, California, created a drug that could forcefully make a brain think it was experiencing one event when it was actually experiencing a different event.\n\nMayford starting by placing a series of mice in to individual boxes that had a specific color and smell. Color and smell are strong memory makers, so the brains of the mice took a sort-of \"mental snapshot\" of their surroundings. The mice were then transported to a second box with a completely different color and smell. Then, the mice were given a shot of a wonder drug that forced their brains to fire off the neurons that helped create their memory of the previous box. Finally, while still in the second box, the mice were given an electric shock to their feet. Under normal circumstances \u2013 circumstances in which being electrocuted is a \"normal\" thing \u2014 the mice would be terrified of the second box. These mice weren't. The drug they were injected with had brought up their memory of the first box, the box where there was a different color and smell, and wasn't a mouse-sized electric chair. Even with all of these physical factors telling them otherwise, the mice thought they were still within the safe, loving confines of the first box.\n\nNow all it takes is for some mad scientist to combine all these wonderful medical advancements and discoveries to create a legion of hyper-intelligent, verbal, super-fast, immortal, and brain washed mice. Or maybe all it could take is one mouse getting really smart to set off a Rise of the Planet of the Apes chain of events. Sure, all of these advancements are intended for our use, but who actually has them right now? The mice. Therefore, they have the upper hand.\n\nIf you need a picture of a satellite firing a deadly laser beam, run a generic search for the words \"James Bond\"\n\nKeep in mind that rodents came pretty close to accomplishing their goal of ultimate human annihilation once before with bubonic plague (a simple virus). Just imagine what they'd do with mutant-brains, hyper-speed, and (probably) a burning desire to rebuild society so it is completely free of science."}

{"text":"During the holiday season, it's natural to ask philosophical questions such as, \"what is the essence of being human?\" Well, one way to answer that question is purely scientifically. Humans are mostly water (ugly bags of mostly water, according to Microbrain, Stardate 41463.9, Star Trek: The Next Generation,, Episode 17). More than half the human body is made up of water, and we can use that fact to measure how many humans are present at large gatherings. Such an experiment was performed at the 2006 American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting in San Francisco, as reported in a November 2007 paper by Darin Desilets et al. of the University of Arizona. The experiment made use of the fact that cosmic rays are continually bombarding the earth, creating fast neutrons as a by-product of nuclear disintegrations. When these neutrons encounter large concentrations of hydrogen (such as found in ugly bags of mostly water), they get scattered. One can look at the resulting scattering pattern and deduce how much hydrogen is present, and make an estimation of the number of people present.\n\nFigure 1. Ugly bag of mostly water (and co-founder of the Weather Underground) Perry Samson (right) poses in front of his Poster at the 2007 AGU meeting. Also pictured: Russ Rew and Mohan Ramamurthy of Unidata. Fast cosmic ray neutrons scattered from their bodies were used to help estimate the number of people present at the 2006 meeting.\n\nThe equipment needed to do so costs about $10,000, and was set up in the Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco during the 2006 AGU meeting. The scientists were able to show when lunch breaks occurred by pointing out a sharp reduction in neutron scattering when all the scientists filed out to grab a bite to eat. Desilets et al. estimated about 1,700 scientists were present in the Exhibit Hall of the convention center during the height of the conference, which is probably a reasonable estimate, given the stated capacity of 3575 people. The technique can also be used to perform measurements of water content of snow and soil, and Desilets et al. advertise that they are open to paid invitations to count crowds at Rio de Janerio's Carnival, Pamplona's running of the bulls, and the next World Cup Finals.\n\nA 1013 stationary non-tropical low pressure area centered in the Eastern Atlantic near 27N\/39W. Forecast models and surface observations continue to show possibility of subtropical transition by this low as it continues to be blocked south of the bridging Azores High pressure System. Satellite imagery also resemble subtropical storm models with most of the convection in the Eastern and Northwest quadrants. The system continues to be embedded within an upper trough but latest observations show this pattern maybe waning. The low has a small chance of becoming fully subtropical much less tropical as a front pulls in from the Northwest. However, there are some difficulties in forecasting this storm. The front may not interact with the system at all. Also a 500 mb trough and low accompanies the low. This set up is similar to subtropical storms in the Eastern-Central Pacific Ocean, called Kona Lows. This is indeed an interesting storm. Winds with this system are estimated to be 20-30 knots. QuikSCAT is currently processing the area and there are few nearby observations.\n\nTropical Disturbance Summary 2100z 27Dec ======================================== Tropical Disturbance 06F [1010 hPa] located near 20.5S 162.0W as of 2000 UTC. Poor based on Multispectral visible imagery with animation and peripheral surface observation. Sea Surface Temperatures is about 25-26C. The system is slowly moving into cooler waters ans is weakening as it does. Low level circulation center remains exposed with most convective activity still in the southern quadrant. The upper level cyclonic circulation associated with the disturbance remains embedded in a mid to upper level trough in an area of low to moderate shear.\n\nMost global models continue to analyse a surface trough over the area. This is also evident in the latest quikscat pass. The potential of this system to form into a significant tropical cyclone within the next 24 hours remains LOW.\n\n105. MichaelSTL 1:04 PM EST on December 21, 2007 I don't really find that swirl interesting, especially to call it \"Pablo\"; shear may be lower than average in that area, but it is certainly not favorable. And if the NHC ever did name that, it would just provide more fodder for the people who say that half of this year's storms didn't deserve to be named, even the ones that affected land and killed people (even if indirectly, as is the case a lot of the time).\n\nA broad upper ridge centered over the Caribbean is producing southwesterly flow over the region with mid-upper level cloudiness advected from the Eastern Pacific across Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico to the Big Ben Area of Florida. Surface high pressure and dry air dominates elsewhere with fair to partly cloudy skies. Fog and low clouds blankets the Southern Mississippi Valley and much of Northern Texas below this dry air regime.\n\nMultilayer cloudiness is over much of the Western Atlantic due to wind shear within the atmosphere. Surface high pressure is advecting patches of shallow cloudiness in easterly-southeasterly flow below high level clouds advected in westerly flow around the upper ridge over the Caribbean.\n\nCENTRAL AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN REGION....\n\nA typical winter weather pattern continues over the Caribbean with easterly flow dominating the area south of the subtropical ridge. The easterly flow continues advect their typical patches of shallow moisture across the Islands, Greater Antilles and Central America north of 15N, with very dry air above in the mid-upper levels as indicated by upper air observations out of Kingston, Jamaica and St. Maarten.

The city baked under sunny skies and scorching northerlies that lifted the mercury to 43.7 degrees shortly before 2pm. It was the second day in a row above 40 degrees and the warmest two day period for December. A weak sea breeze struggled to provide relief, only managing to bring the temperature back to the 40 degree mark by 4pm.\n\nCooler, southwesterly winds will provide relief from the extreme heat on Thursday. The city is expected to reach 33 degrees, but the onshore winds will mean higher humidity levels creating sticky conditions. Over the next week, temperatures will begin to rise as winds tend around to the north once more. Next Wednesday could see Perth reaching 39 degrees.\n\nHOLIDAYMAKERS and residents along the Queensland coast are bracing for a fierce and volatile weather system this weekend with the bureau warning of gale-force winds, dangerous surf and abnormally high tides.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology has advised coastal communities from Bowen in north Queensland to the Gold Coast to prepare for the intense low-pressure system.\n\nSevere weather forecaster Jeff Callaghan said the system was unlikely to develop into a cyclone. \"It's a different sort of beast,\" Mr Callaghan said.\n\n\"It's more like a Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race storm. That's not to downplay it. This kind of system can be really ferocious.\"\n\nSevere thunderstorms hit NSW yesterday afternoon, with heavy rains and flash flooding in the Hunter and Central Tablelands, Illawarra and western parts of Sydney.\n\nBallina recorded 25mm of rain and hail began falling in Lithgow and Katoomba at about 1pm, a bureau spokesperson said. The sky blackened above the drought-parched earth outside of Dubbo, in central NSW, late yesterday afternoon as a welcome thunderstorm rolled in from Wellington, bringing heavy downpours, winds and a spectacular lightning display.\n\nBrian Harvey, a Dubbo local travelling along the Mitchell Highway to visit his father, pulled over to marvel at the sky as the storm moved in towards the city.\n\n\"It's very welcome rain indeed. The farmers will be very much relieved, it's been a good year or two since we've had rainfalls like this and now there'll be considerable subsoil moisture for the crops,\" he said.\n\nProperty owners in northwest NSW are also bracing for havoc this weekend, with slow-moving floodwaters and stormy weather expected to hit Nyngan and other areas along Bogan River.\n\nThree people were rescued yesterday after they abandoned their 10m yacht in heavy seas north of Fraser Island. The Energex Rescue Helicopter picked up the trio, two men and a woman, who abandoned the yacht after its mainsail was ripped by fierce winds and its motor failed.\n\nThey were taken to Hervey Bay Hospital, but were all in good health.\n\nThe system threatening the Queensland coast was forecast to be about 500km northeast of Yeppoon this morning and moving southeast.\n\nHuge waves whipped up by the system will coincide with king tides and are likely to cause the biggest tides this year.\n\nMr Callaghan said holidaymakers most at risk would be the thousands of people camping on Fraser Island.\n\nIt was unclear whether the system would bring heavy rain to parched southeast Queensland, which is still suffering from severe drought despite the recent heavy rain and flooding in the state's west and in western NSW. The combined level of the three dams supplying Brisbane has fallen below 20 per cent for the first time since April.\n\n\"Because this kind of system is so unpredictable, it's difficult to say how much rain it will bring,\" Mr Callaghan said.\n\n\"It will have to move west (towards the coast) to bring any significant rain, but while some computer models say it will move west by Sunday, others say it will move east.\"\n\nThe bureau is also closely watching a low-pressure system in the Gulf of Carpentaria.\n\nMr Callaghan said this system had the potential to develop into a cyclone early next week.\n\nMeanwhile, South Australian fire fighters are on standby over the coming days with the bureau forecasting extreme heatwave conditions throughout the state.\n\nTOP PRIORITY FOR IMMEDIATE BROADCAST SEVERE WEATHER WARNING for Abnormally High Tides\/Dangerous Surf and damaging winds developing Sunday For people in Offshore Islands south of Rockhampton including The Capricorn and Bunker Groups, Fraser Island and the Sunshine and Gold Coasts. Issued at 12:50 pm on Friday 28 December 2007\n\nSynoptic Situation: A tropical low with a central pressure of 1002hPa is developing in the Coral Sea and is located 270 km northeast of Gladstone. The low is expected to intensify and move towards the southeast to be located about 600km east southeast of Gladstone at 9pm tonight. The low is then expected to continue to intensify on Saturday and become slow moving and is likely to move back towards Fraser Island during Sunday.\n\nVery large waves are expected to be generated by this system and will affect areas north from Fraser Island and the Sunshine Coast on Saturday and extend down to Coolangatta Tweed Heads by Sunday. Gale force winds and waves will cause abnormally high tides which should exceed the highest tides of the year with some waves likely to extend up above the beach zone particularly on the east coast of Fraser Island on Sunday. Winds are expected to increase during Sunday when wind gusts may reach 90 km\/hour in exposed coastal areas between Sandy Cape and Cape Moreton.\n\nThe State Emergency Service advises that people in the affected area should, if near the coastline, stay well away from the water's edge.\n\nThere are no significant tropical low currently in the region. However, an active monsoon trough lies near 10S. A low is expected to form along the trough between 90-100E in the next 24 hours and develop over the weekend with an increasing chance of tropical cyclone formation.\n\nTropical Cyclone Outlook (28December) =============================== A low pressure system has developed over the western Coral Sea near 22.0S 153.0E. Although this system is not expected to develop into a tropical cyclone in the next three days, it is however expected to intensify into a deep extra-tropical low overnight into Saturday as it moves southeast off the coast of Queensland.\n\nElsewhere, the monsoon trough is developing over Cape York Peninsula, but there are no significant tropical disturbances at present."}

The beetle\nsurvives by collecting condensation from the ocean breeze on the\nhardened shell of its wings. The shell is covered in tiny bumps\nthat are water attracting (hydrophilic) at their tips and\nwater-repelling (hydrophobic) at their sides. The beetle extends\nand aims the wings at incoming sea breezes to catch humid air; tiny\ndroplets 15 to 20 microns in diameter eventually accumulate on its\nback and run straight down towards its mouth.

Each method is a viable medical process, but with\nshortcomings: electrospun materials typically don't have the\nability to promote cellular growth, nor do they have the\nflexibility needed for cartilage replacement. And inkjet printed\nmaterials lacks the structure and strength needed to support\nthe loads that cartilage carries.

It\nworks by projecting images through the screen using optics in the\neyepiece for refraction purposes. After peering into the eyepiece,\nthe user has to then align a series of patterns.

{"text":"\"In a nutshell, it is looking at waste as an opportunity, as a resource, looking at it beyond the fact that it's waste,\" Yeh told the Tampa Bay Times recently.\n\nYeh's machine is called the NEW (nutrients, energy and water) generator, and uses microbes to break down human waste into all its usable components, producing not only energy in the process, but also fertilizer and water for irrigation.\n\n\"I keep going back to the fact there are 7 billion people on the planet,\" said Yeh, in a USF interview. \"It's kind of a wake-up call.\n\n\"How are we going to make enough food? Where's the energy going to come from? We have to stop having everything being a one-way street. We need to close the loop.\"\n\nYeh is closing that loop with poop. And the potential is enormous. In a large scale test of the system, Yeh is using Gates grant money to help fund the construction of larger prototype to be installed at Learning Gate Community School, a Hillsborough County charter school with a sustainability focus.\n\nIn the meantime, Yeh continues to refine the small version of the NEWgenerator currently operating in his lab at the College of Engineering. The \"waste\" matter used for testing at this stage is actually dry cat food soaked in water which, according to Yeh, \"mimics the properties of human waste\" . That's probably another story altogether, but check out the video below to learn more.\n\nLike this:\n\nFlorida inventor Fred Maxik, founder and chief technology officer of Lighting Science Group Corp of Satellite Beach, is testing a new LED bio-bulb \"that could regulate the body's circadian rhythm by helping control the production of melatonin, the body's sleep hormone that tells us when it's nighttime, \" according to Discovery News.\n\nMaxik's goal is to \"help people see what they are doing at night \u2014 reading, doing homework or watching TV let's say \u2014 without making it hard to fall asleep when they are ready. \"\n\nLike this:\n\nOn Saturday, March 31, we'll be holding the very first Tampa Bay Mini Maker Faire, and Learning is for Everyone (LI4E) is very excited to be bringing this wonderful festival of the inventive spirit to the Tampa Bay area! Tampa Bay Mini Maker Faire fits in perfectly with our mission to support the Curiosity Driven Life in the service of inspiring the lifelong love of learning that we all need in order to live intentionally, meaningfully and successfully in the 21st century.\n\nTampa Bay Mini Maker will be a family-friendly event showcasing both established and emerging local \"makers.\" We'll have be showcasing everything from machines, to DIY science and technology, alternative energy efforts, unique hand-made crafts, music and food, and educational workshops and installations.\n\nWe'll be holding this one of a kind event at a one of a kind facility, thebeautiful University Area Community Center Complex on 22nd Street North, in Tampa. Owned by Hillsborough County and operated by the University Area Community Development Corporation, Inc. the center is a 50,000 square foot collection of classrooms, offices, a fitness center, multi-purpose gymnasium, auditorium with stage, music and art studios, computer labs, daycare facilities, and more for area residents who enjoy free access to everything from childcare to the cultural arts in this state-of-the-art facility.\n\nCheck out the related pages on participating as a Maker or as a Sponsor and check back regularly as we continue developing plans for this celebration of DIY Fun and Learning!"}

{"text":"Yawning is a behavior that everyone is aware of, and we all take part in it, yet no one knows the precise reason why we do it. There's a ton of theories: A need to rapidly get oxygen into the blood, a way to remain alert for possible danger, imbalances in neurotransmitter levels, and even regulating brain temperature. None of them have been completely proven right or wrong.\n\nThe social aspect of yawning is much better understood. It is likely a way for social animals to synchronize their mood and sleep schedules, as well as communicate empathy. Of course, a fetus can't communicate with anyone (except via kicking), so why would they need to yawn?\n\nNew research (check out the paper in PLOS One) suggests that it could be part of brain maturation. As the fetal brain develops, the neural cycles that will later become sleep and wakefulness are kicking in. It could even be as simple as a way to exercise the jaw movements that will later be necessary in nursing and crying. Whatever the reason, we now have visual proof of certifiable yawns kicking in long before birth, and it's kind of freaky looking. More research (in adults, children and prenatal infants) will be needed to get at the \"why\".\n\nBy the way, if you yawned while reading this, you aren't alone. About 60% of people reading or thinking about yawning will yawn.\n\nA coloured honeycomb from a beehive is seen in Ribeauville near Colmar, Eastern France.

It's most dangerous for toddlers or kids who are putting things in their mouths,\" Page said.\n\nRaccoons create latrines, particular locations they visit repeatedly. While this practice may be sanitary for the animals, humans\u2014particularly small children prone to putting strange objects in their mouths\u2014can contract a deadly, parasitic roundworm when they encounter these animal outhouses.\n\nHowever, recent research may have struck upon a prevention strategy. The study found that sterilizing these latrines and leaving out medicated bait for the raccoons\u2014as is done to control rabies\u2014can reduce the presence of the parasite.\n\nThere are only 18 known cases when the worm, Baylisascaris procyonis, has infected humans, and all occurred in North America. However, infection doesn't become obvious until the worm's larvae move into a victim's eyes or central nervous system, where they cause blindness, permanent neurological damage, or death. As a result, it's possible cases have escaped detection, according to Kristen Page, a disease ecologist at Wheaton College in Illinois and the lead author of a paper published in the January issue of the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.\n\nThere are multiple ideas as to why raccoons create latrines, which multiple animals use to defecate repeatedly, including as a means of communication or sanitation, she said.\n\nA microscopic image shows the texture of tablets recovered from the second century B.C. shipwreck identified as the Relitto del Pozzino, near the Tuscany, Italy, coast.\n\nScientists are trying to unravel the mystery of whether pills found in a 2,000-year-old shipwreck were, in fact, created and used as effective plant-based medicines.\n\nAnd the bigger question: Could the ingredients of these ancient tablets still work to help with modern illnesses?\n\nAround 130 B.C., a ship, identified as the Relitto del Pozzino, sank off Tuscany, Italy. Among the artifacts found on board in 1989 were glass cups, a pitcher and ceramics, all of which suggested that the ship was sailing from the eastern Mediterranean area.\n\nIts cargo also included a chest that contained various items related to the medical profession: a copper bleeding cup and 136 boxwood vials and tin containers.\n\nInside one of the tin vessels, archaeologists found several circular tablets, many still completely dry.\n\n\"They were less than an inch in diameter and about a third to a half inch thick,\" said Robert Fleischer, an evolutionary geneticist with the Smithsonian's Center for Conservation and Evolutionary Genetics in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory, built over a decade at a cost of $271 million, is buried under the South Pole... and longer than the world's tallest skyscrapers combined.\n\nLate last week, construction of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory wrapped up at the National Science Foundation's Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica. The team of international scientists behind the effort has come up with something truly remarkable in building the world's largest neutrino observatory. The massive telescope, which is the size of a cubic kilometer and located 1,400 meters underground, took a decade to build and cost approximately $271 million.

{"text":"Recently in\nWater\nCategory\n\nTom Johnson, a University of Minnesota Duluth Regents professor and Institute on the Environment resident fellow, knew his work on Lake Malawi in 2005 would yield significant scientific discoveries. Now, eight years later, he and his colleagues have announced research that impacts our knowledge of the near extinction of the human race. They have determined that 75,000 years ago, the Toba volcanic eruption in Sumatra did not cause a volcanic winter or the dramatic drop in human population in Africa, as some anthropologists had proposed.\n\nMany of the increases in food production during the Green Revolution can be attributed to a single element in the periodic table -- nitrogen. Begun in the early 1900s as an effort to convert nitrogen gas from the air we breathe into a solid form that could propel ammunition farther, the Haber-Bosch process later became the key mechanism for boosting crop yields through mass production of nitrogen fertilizer. Unfortunately, excess nitrogen degrades our drinking water quality, causes many coastal areas to be oxygen-depleted \"dead zones,\" and adds a very powerful greenhouse gas to our atmosphere. How can we manage our farmlands more effectively?\n\nTrout Unlimited Alaska is fighting to protect two critical habitats and communities that rely on them: Bristol Bay in southwestern Alaska and the Tongass National Forest in the southeastern panhandle. Both areas boast productive salmon fisheries that have vital economic benefit to the communities that rely on them, said Bristol.

Humans have always had an energy crisis, said Larry Wackett, IonE resident fellow and professor at the BioTechnology Institute, at the first Frontiers seminar of the spring semester: Is Frac(k) A Four-Letter Word?\n\nThe exhibit, which will look at food production throughout history and address the challenge we currently face of feeding an ever-growing population without destroying the planet as we do so, comes just days before Thanksgiving, the nation's holiday most focused on food as celebratory act. Obviously, as this is an annual holiday, the exhibition planners no doubt planned the opening with Thanksgiving in mind. The second reason the timing is interesting, though, is due to an event that no one could have anticipated well in advance. The AMNH is located in New York City, which, along with other areas of the East Coast, is still recovering from Hurricane Sandy. In recognition of these dichotomous events, Ellen V. Futter, president of the AMNH, said in a press release, \"As the Museum prepares to open this comprehensive exhibition on the subject of food, we find ourselves disquietingly poised between the extremes of Hurricane Sandy--with its extensive devastation, including disruption to the food supply--and...Thanksgiving. In such a timely and vivid context, the Museum presents Our Global Kitchen, which addresses the vital and complex topic of food from the perspectives of the environment, food supply, and human culture.\"\n\nSeveral reports estimate that we need to double current crop production by 2050 in order to meet the needs of a growing population that eats more meat and uses more crops for fuel. Some strategies - like reducing waste and reducing meat consumption - would reduce pressure on our land and water resources and free up more food calories that are potentially available. But we commonly assume that increasing crop production will come at a cost of increased environmental damages to our climate, water and natural habitat. It turns out that does not have to be the case."}

{"text":"Monday, January 30, 2006\n\n\"Water Bears\" belong to a lesser known phylum of invertebrate animals, the Tardigrada. They are similar to arthropods, which include crustaceans and insects.\n\nTardigrades are supertiny critters, typically 0.3 to 0.5 mm (For you non-scientists, a millimeter is about the thickness of a dime). They need water, but if the environment is too dry they just go into hibernation\u2026. For up to TEN YEARS! They can also survive staggering amounts of radiation (5700 grays, while five grays would be fatal to a human). Oh, and they can survive being heated for a few minutes to 151 \u00b0C or being chilled for days at -272.8 \u00b0C (almost absolute zero). How sweet is that?\n\nThey have 4 pairs of legs with claws and five body-segments. They move like little bears, with a slow lumbering gait. The first link below has a short video. Tardigrades are found all over the world, including salt and freshwater environments, in humid rain forests and dry deserts, in low canyons and high altitude mountain-tops. Tardigrades are aquatic organisms and need to be in water to eat, breath, reproduce, and move. They are commonly found in the interstitial (water between leaves) environment of moss and lichen. Some tardigrades are carnivores, others are herbivores or omnivores. They feed on each other, as well as mites, aphids, nematodes, and other microscopic organisms. These microscopic creatures play an important role in the cycling of nutrients. And they're really really cute.\n\nThursday, January 26, 2006\n\nGreat news: Matt went to see his cardiologist today and his ejection fraction has returned to normal. \"One for the record books,\" the doc said.

Scientists have long known that V. cholerae gets infected by viruses. In fact, there's some evidence suggesting that these viruses can bring cholera outbreaks to a halt. As the V. cholerae hosts multiply, their viruses multiply even faster, until they send the bacteria's population crashing down. Camilli and his colleagues set out to survey these viruses, to see how many species were making life hard for the bacteria.\n\nTuesday, 5 March, 2013\n\nThe first detailed study of skin strength was carried out in the 1860s by Karl Langer, an Austrian anatomist working in Vienna. He mapped the natural lines of tension within skin by puncturing the skin on a cadaver with a circular tool and then measuring the shape of the resulting hole. The tension within the skin makes these holes elliptical in a direction parallel to the tension. Consequently, a simple measurement of the orientation of these ellipses allowed Langer to map out lines of force in the skin over the entire body. Today, these lines are known as Langer lines.\n\nI would like to think that our skin is strong enough and serves its purpose\u2026 without subjecting it to extremes of force or treatment.\n\nThursday, 20 December, 2012\n\nThe mass extinction that killed off some 90 percent of animal, plant, and insect species on Earth around 251 million years ago, could be attributable to an ocean residing microbe called methanosarcina, thinks Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Daniel Rothman:\n\nCalled methanosarcina, this sea-dwelling microbe is responsible for most of the methane produced biologically even today. Rothman and his team discovered that methanosarcina developed the ability to produce methane 231 million years ago. While that ability came around too late to be single-handedly responsible for the link. However, mathanosarcina requires nickel in order to produce methane quickly. Nickel levels spiked almost 251 million years ago, likely because of a spike in Siberian lava from the volcanoes themselves. This indicates that methanosarcina was directly responsible for producing the methane that killed off an overwhelming majority of the Earth's species.\n\nBound to hotly disputed but will surely make for a talking point or two over the year-end break.\n\nOn its own, the story of the crabs in Rome is an interesting tale of the persistence of nature despite us. These crabs certainly make one wonder what else can be found up Rome's cloaca. But there is more to the story. When Scalici and colleagues described the biology of the Roman crabs \u2013 having studied more than four hundred of them and compared them to populations from across Italy, they found that they were, well, \"different.\" They were slower growing but lived longer, and so ended up being roughly one and half times as big as other crabs of the same species. They were urban, modern, and fat. They also appeared to mate at a different time of year than do the other river crabs.\n\nWhite-footed mice, stranded on isolated urban islands, are evolving to adapt to urban stress. Fish in the Hudson have evolved to cope with poisons in the water. Native ants find refuge in the median strips on Broadway. And more familiar urban organisms, like bedbugs, rats and bacteria, also mutate and change in response to the pressures of the metropolis. In short, the process of evolution is responding to New York and other cities the way it has responded to countless environmental changes over the past few billion years. Life adapts.\n\nThursday, 30 June, 2011\n\nGood question, if there are different species of fish for instance, why is there only the one human species? Well, until relatively recently, at least on universal time scales, Homo sapiens shared the planet with other humans, including Homo erectus, Neanderthals, and Homo floresiensis, who died out about 12,000 years ago.\n\nPlanning, communication and even trade led, among other things, to the development of better tools and weapons which spread rapidly across the population. The fossil records suggest that H. erectus went on making the same basic hand axe for more than a million years. Our ancestors, by contrast, created smaller, more sophisticated weapons, like a spear, which can be thrown, with obvious advantages when it comes to hunting and to fighting. The same advantages helped Homo sapiens outcompete another rival human, the Neanderthals, who died out about 30,000 years ago as the Ice Age limited available food supplies.\n\nTuesday, 3 May, 2011\n\nMathematical concepts are increasingly being applied in the field of biology, not only bringing about a new branch of science called biomathematics, but also creating an opportunity for scientists to make sense of long standing biological puzzles.\n\nI would be surprised if mathematics ever came to dominate biological thinking in the way it does physics, but it is rapidly becoming an essential part of the discipline: 21st-century biology makes use of mathematics in ways that no one would have dreamed of at the start of the 20th.

Scientists also saw the woeful ramifications of global warming take effect through the likes of Hurricane Katrina and took steps to develop technologies to better forecast and communicate during disasters.\n\nIn the first shuttle mission since the destruction of Columbia in 2003, NASA launched the space shuttle Discovery to land at the International Space Station this year. And although the 14-day mission was successful in restocking the ISS, NASA temporarily grounded future flights of its aging shuttles after learning that a large chunk of insulating foam broke off Discovery's external fuel tank during launch. The action threw future missions into a state of uncertainty, and NASA announced in December that it hopes to pass on the job of transporting cargo and crew to and from the space station to private companies.\n\nMeanwhile, NASA also started testing a series of robots such as Robonaut, which it hopes to put on a shuttle flight in 2007 as part of a program to develop bots to assist humans in outer space.\n\nAnother big theme this year was technology development for detecting natural calamities faster and alerting the populace beforehand. Disasters like the Indian Ocean tsunami of late 2004 and Hurricane Katrina, which hit the Gulf Coast in early September wreaked havoc on habitants of those areas, and prompted demand for better systems to understand, forecast and protect against future hazards.\n\nMeanwhile, artificial intelligence got a big boost this year. Scientists around the country engineered AI-powered cars to race in the second annual DARPA Grand Challenge, a government sponsored 144-mile race in the desert. This year, for the first time, four contestants crossed the finish line, a milestone for the field of robotics and what will likely touch off a wave of innovation in cars and other products in the years to come.\n\nArtificial intelligence technology is already catching on commercially. The Massachusetts-based robotics specialist iRobot went public in October and maintained healthy sales of its smart vacuum cleaner, the Roomba. The company also announced a follow-up product, the Scooba, which adds mopping capabilities to the device"}

When transplanted, these 'bioengineered' organs starting filtering the rodents' blood and making urine just as a normal kidney would.\n\nATOM COUNT\nIt is hard to grasp just how small the atoms that make up your body are until you take a look at the sheer number of them. An adult is made up of around 7,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (7 octillion) atoms.\n\nOTHER LIFE\nOn sheer count of cells, there is more bacterial life inside you than human. There are around 10 trillion of your own cells, but 10 times more bacteria. Many of the bacteria that call you home are friendly in the sense that they don't do any harm. Some are beneficial.\n\nATOMIC COLLAPSE\nThe atoms that make up your body are mostly empty space, so despite there being so many of them, without that space you would compress into a tiny volume. The nucleus that makes up the vast bulk of the matter in an atom is so much smaller than the whole structure that it is comparable to the size of a fly in a cathedral. If you lost all your empty atomic space, your body would fit into a cube less than 1\/500th of a centimetre on each side. Neutron stars are made up of matter that has undergone exactly this kind of compression. In a single cubic centimetre of neutron star material there are around 100 million tons of matter.\n\nFUR LOSS\nIt might seem hard to believe, but we have about the same number of hairs on our bodies as a chimpanzee, it's just that our hairs are useless, so fine they are almost invisible.

If we can figure out the total weight of all the world's ships, we can figure out how much water they're displacing, then divide that volume by the surface area of the ocean to figure out how much the water level would drop.\n\nWeighing ships is confusing. There are a bunch of different measurements of the size of a ship, and many of them, like gross tonnage, are actually measures of the volume of the ship's rooms and other internal spaces, not its weight.\n\nThe UN Conference on Trade and Development publishes estimates of the size of the world shipping fleet.\n\nWhat the UNCTD publishes is \"deadweight tonnage\", which is the maximum weight of the ship's fuel, cargo, and crew. What we want is \"displacement\". Unfortunately, comprehensive numbers for displacement are harder to find.\n\nFortunately, we can estimate it. Brian Barrass's book Ship Design and Performance for Masters and Mates gives a table of ratios of deadweight tonnage to displacement for different types of ships.\n\nExtrapolating from the last few years of UNCTD data, and using the coefficients from the book, suggests that the world fleet weighs about 2.15 billion tons when fully loaded.\n\nA ton of water is about a cubic meter. 2.15 billion cubic meters divided by the surface area of the oceans equals about 6 microns (0.006 mm).\n\nSo there you go, if every ship were removed all at once from the Earth's waters the sea level would fall by about six microns\u2014slightly more than the diameter of a strand of spider silk.

Normally, a portion of this water would fall, scattered, as rain\u2014at most, 6 centimeters of it.\n\nIn this storm, all that water instead condenses into one giant drop, a sphere of water over a kilometer in diameter.\n\nThe water would hit the ground moving at over 200 m\/s (450 mph). Right under the point of impact, the air is unable to rush out of the way fast enough, and the compression heats it so quickly that the grass would catch fire if it had time.\n\nFortunately for the grass, this heat lasts only a few milliseconds because it's doused by the arrival of a lot of cold water. Unfortunately for the grass, the cold water is moving at over half the speed of sound.\n\nThe wall of water expands outward kilometer by kilometer, ripping up trees, houses, and topsoil as it goes. The house, porch, and old-timers are obliterated in an instant. Everything within a few kilometers is completely destroyed, leaving a pool of mud down to bedrock. The splash continues outward, demolishing all structures out to distances of 20 or 30 kilometers. At this distance, areas shielded by mountains or ridges are protected, and the flood begins to flow along natural valleys and waterways.\n\nEveryone knows the secret to building sandcastles is a little water. But while too little leaves the sand useless, too much makes it heavy enough to cause disastrous landslides. Fortunately, scientists have unravelled the secrets behind sandcastle building for you.\n\nWhile it might sound flippant, building the best structures out of sand is a tricky civil engineering problem. That's why a team of scientists set to a complex series of experiments involving theoretical and practical modelling of sand castles.\n\nBy testing different levels of sand wetness, they studied how columns of sand buckled as they were built higher and higher. Eventually, they found that there's an optimum sand wetness: you should be aiming to have a liquid volume fraction of 1 per cent. That means that, by volume, you need to combine 99 parts of perfectly dry sand with 1 part water to build the ultimate castle. Learn more here or here."}

Well, don't fret. Your problem has been solved by a team of engineers and artists at Cornell University who have created the Robotic Chair, a deceptively simple-looking wooden chair that collapses into several pieces and then proceeds to put itself back together.\n\nDescribed as \"the culmination of a 20-year-long investigation into the engagement between the individual and the object,\" the Robotic Chair is a fine example of computer-assisted robot autonomy. After the chair collapses, the images from a camera mounted above the chair's platform are digitized by a computer with software that converts the location of the chair's pieces from the video into points on a grid. This information is then transmitted wirelessly to the processing unit in the chair's seat, which uses 14 motors and an array of sensors to find its pieces in the correct order and reassemble itself.\n\nThis isn't the first time the Cornell folks have dabbled in robotic furniture. Their previous piece, the Table: Childhood, was a table with a brain. The Table, fully mobile thanks to a mechanical set of wheels, could express emotions and even display preferences toward an individual in the room by either following or avoiding a person. Perhaps one day the Table or the Robotic Chair will be honored to join the ranks of the Ig Nobels along with a previous winner, an alarm clock that runs away from you when you try to turn it off.\n\nWhether you appreciate the chair for its artistic value or the engineering skill that went into its creation, or file it away with the rest of the YouTube videos you've been forwarded, just be thankful it was created by people calling themselves the D'Andrea Group and not an organization as ominous or clearly evil as Cyberdyne. \u2014Dan Smith\n\nSome ornithologists contend that variations in the songs of birds delineate different species.

Peering through a microscope at a slice of dinosaur bone, she spotted what looked for all the world like red blood cells. It seemed utterly impossible--organic remains were not supposed to survive the fossilization process--but test after test indicated that the spherical structures were indeed red blood cells from a 67-million-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex. In the years that followed, she and her colleagues discovered other apparent soft tissues, including what seem to be blood vessels and feather fibers. But controversy accompanied their claims.

But in Europe crustaceans contain more lime, so processing is more complex and not economical. Also, the high content of calcium carbonate (known as CaCO3) of EU crab shell waste has prevented cost effective conversions to chitosan so far.\n\nHowever, a solution has come from the ChiBio Project, which is developing an integrated biorefinery for processing chitin rich biowaste, to specialty and fine chemicals.

{"text":"The Aberdeen Treasure Trail!\n\nWelcome to Au Science, a science magazine from students at the University of Aberdeen! From the 17th August until the 9th September we are running a special science-themed treasure hunt, designed by us and brought to you by the Aberdeen Branch of the British Science Association.\n\nTake part, pick up a copy of the trail from the Belmont cinema, Kilau, or print one off below. When you're done, email the answer, along with a picture of you taking part, to ausciencemag@gmail.com for a chance to win a host of science goodies and cinema tickets for the Belmont Cinema! There's also some great discounts for those taking part at our supporters Bibi's Bakery and Kilau coffee!\n\nThe trail starts at the Belmont Cinema and takes a circular route for 2 miles. It is suitable for families and adults. If you're stuck on a clue, or want to discuss the science around Aberdeen with like minded people, visit our forum!\n\nAu Science Magazine is produced by students from the University of Aberdeen. You can read it online here follow us on twitter @ausciencemag and on Facebook!\n\nTo find out about all the amazing events that will be happening in Aberdeen between the 4th and 9th of September, visit the festival website.\n\nHere's a little more about the science behind the treasure hunt.\n\nWhat is\u2026?\n\nThe science behind science fiction:\nTime travel, hyperdrives and teleportation may all seem a long way off but a great deal of the technology we have today was written in the pages of science fiction yesterday. Submarines, the Internet and even e-books themselves all started out on the pages of fictional works. Star Trek, most notably, predicted things like touch screens, motion sensor doors, and voice controls. So pay attention next time you're in the cinema, because there might be a gadget on the silver screen that needs some scientific input.\n\nAn Endorphin:\nDiscovered by John Hughes and Hans Kosterlitz at the University of Aberdeen in the 1970s, endorphins are a natural opiate (a bit like a painkiller) that are released when the body is stressed. Endorphins are released when we exercise which gives us a feeling of well-being. The Iron lung:\nThe iron lung is a mechanical device that helps a person to breathe. In the 1930s Dr Robert Henderson introduced the first iron lung to Britain, he created devices that fitted onto cots in the children's ward at Aberdeen City Hospital, it became known as the Henderson Respirator.\n\nInsulin:\nThis year celebrated the 90th anniversary of the discovery of insulin to treat diabetes. Insulin is a vital hormone produced by the pancreas that is involved in the storage of glucose in the body, but diabetics are not able produce insulin properly. Insulin was co-discovered by John Macleod who was a professor of physiology at the University of Aberdeen, and received a Nobel prize for his work in 1923.\n\nSound made of:\nThe vibration of an object causes the air around it to vibrate, these vibrations are known as sound waves, it's a bit like when you see ripples on water. When these waves hit the ear drum it sends a signal to the brain that we interpret as sound.\n\nElectromagnetism:\nThis refers to electric currents and magnetic fields, these were originally thought to be entirely separate but James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated how the two interact, and the study of electromagnetism was founded.\n\nA parallax:\nThis is when a single object appears to differ in it's position when viewed from different angles. Our own eyes give us two different fields of vision that overlap allowing us to determine a depth of field. Sir David Gill applied this method to planets to determine the distance to the sun.\n\nA Comet:\nComets are made of rock and ice and according to NASA can range from the size of a baseball to 1\/3 size of the moon! It is collisions between comets that created Earth. The name comet comes from the Greek word meaning 'hair of the head', it came from Aristotle who observed comets as 'stars with hair'\n\nThe oldest tree:\nThe elm trees in Union Terrace Gardens may be 200 years old but there are young compared to other tree species in the UK. Oak trees can live for over 1000 years while it is believed that one of the oldest yew trees in the UK may be around 4000 years old!\n\nGetting into Science\n\nIf you're interested in studying science at university there are numerous different courses at Robert Gordon's University and the University of Aberdeen. Covering topics from forensic science to computer science there's disciplines to suit all, you can find out more on each university's website. Or you can find about some of the fantastic research going on throughout Aberdeen right here in Au!\n\nWe've been exercising our neurons and experimenting with colourful, bubbling liquids to bring you a fresh new website and"}
{"text":"Daily Archives: September 26, 2011\n\nScience: Space weather is expected to become more severe over the next few decades, partly as the Sun's activity changes. Frequent flyers and astronauts will face greater radiation hazards as a result.\nIn times of higher activity, the Sun emits solar energetic particles (SEPs) more consistently, but at the same time generates a strong magnetic field that shields Earth against galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). Right now, the Sun has been declining to a new minimum, from a peak in about 1920. At this minimum more GCRs will reach Earth. However, although there are fewer SEP events, those that do occur are more intense. Frequent fliers are at increased risk because the thin air at high altitudes doesn't give much protection from space weather. Astronauts, especially those traveling to the Moon or beyond, would face more potential problems; expected radiation doses from a roundtrip to Mars would increase at least twofold. This may limit space travel to Mars until 2050 at the earliest.\n\nBBC: While researchers have been making advances toward developing a Harry Potter\u2013style invisibility cloak containing metamaterials that guide light waves around the cloak's wearer, a group in Spain has designed a \"cloak\" that renders the wearer invisible to magnetic fields, according to a paper published in the New Journal of Physics. Because light and magnetism are two facets of the same physical force, many of the same principles apply. Thus Alvaro Sanchez and coworkers at the Autonomous University of Barcelona have developed an antimagnet, which uses an inner cloak of superconducting material, surrounded by layers of metamaterials whose response to the magnetic field varies in a prescribed way through the thickness of the cloak, writes Jason Palmer for the BBC. Their device could have many uses, including protective shielding of pacemaker wearers during MRI scans.\n\nDaily Mail: Three-dimensional printing has taken off in recent years, with the creation of such diverse objects as flutes and human tissue and organs. Now a Canadian company called KOR EcoLogic has designed and printed its first automobile. The Urbee is \"built\" from layer upon layer of an ultrathin composite material that is slowly fused into a solid. It has three wheels, two seats, and a hybrid gas\/electric engine. The company claims the car is among the greenest ever made: It uses one-eighth the energy of a similar-sized vehicle and can get 200 miles to the gallon on the highway. It will be some time, however, before the Urbee can be mass produced and available to consumers.\n\nNature: Texas remains determined to phase out \"low-performing\" physics programs at state-funded universities if they fail to graduate at least 25 students every five years. This could affect nearly half of the 24 undergraduate physics programs in the state. The plans are consistent with the business-based approach advocated by Texas governor Rick Perry; they are also being considered by Florida governor Rick Scott as a way to reduce higher-education budgets in his state. While other undergraduate programs in Texas will be subject to the same metrics, physics programs are more at risk because they tend to enroll fewer students to begin with. Many smaller programs that don't meet the metric are in areas with predominantly African American, Hispanic, or other disadvantaged populations. Cutting programs in those areas could deny minority students access to science-related education. About 35% of undergraduate degrees in physics awarded in the US go to students in programs that don't meet the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board requirements."}

{"text":"Since I have nothing much else to blog about (not true, I'm just lazy) I thought I'd post some old news articles I submitted to SGNews... when it was still a thriving, active and interesting feature of the site. Remember SGNews on the front page? Anyway... the first of a few. Hopefully the links still work. Enjoy!\n\nLake Vostok - The Robots and the Mutated Fish\n\nFlux'sarticle about the Tunguska event made me start thinking about another of my favourite unsolved mysteries of our planet, Lake Vostok, and what was going on with it these days.\n\nI'll give you a little run-down for those of you who don't know the story of Lake Vostok. In 1996 a bunch of Russian scientists (think the crazy cosmonaut in Armageddon) were drilling ice core samples (to put in their vodka I'm sure) in Antarctica. When they reached 3623 m (11,886 feet) they stopped because they couldn't figure out why the ice down this deep was so relatively clean. After a bunch of tests were conducted using radar and seismic waves it turned out that this ice was actually the uppermost region of the world's largest (think Lake Ontario) warmwater (by warm they mean not frozen, it's still -3 \u00b0C) subglacial lake. It's freshwater and it's been isolated down there for somewhere between half a million to a million years!\n\n\"So what?\" a person named Jason, who has no imagination, might ask at which point I'd slap him and yell \"think of the possibilities, Jason!.\" Naturally, the first thing that came to the scientists' (and my own) mind was that this was the most pristine liquid environment on Earth... and it could be full of living creatures that, due to isolation and adaptation, live no where else in the world! So, they tested the core samples taken close to the water and, sure enough, they found microbes that have never been found anywhere else. Yeah, yeah, microbes schmicrobes... where are the freaky species of giant mutated dinosaur fish with glowing fluorescent bodies, Nessie's cousins, and aquatic Gollum type creatures!? Thanks to the detection of local seismic activity, suggesting geothermal activity, these are all still a real possibility because:\n\n\"Geological processes make it much more likely that thermal energy and minerals are coming up from below,\" says Robin Bell of Columbia University.\n\n\"So what's the hold up? Why isn't anyone going in there!?\" First of all Jason, you're an idiot. There's no way they could send anyone down there even if they wanted to; especially since there's a possibility of hostile creatures lurking in the deep, dark water. Secondly, because the lake is under so much pressure, to breach the ice would be like opening a giant shaken beer can. *sigh* No, there isn't beer down there Jason. Thirdly, and most importantly, anything sent into this pristine environment would have to be as sterile as possible to avoid contamination.\n\nThat's where the Cryobot (it even sounds cool!) comes in. In 1999 NASA approved funding for the development of this torpedo like probe equipped with a heated tip that will allow it to slowly melt its way down to the lake, unwinding communication cables from within as it goes. As the probe moves down, the water refreezes behind it and once it's about to breech it gives itself a hydrogen peroxide bath to decontaminate and away to goes! Once inside, Cryobot releases the remote controlled Hydrobot (this shit just keeps getting better), that is equipped with a camera and other instruments, to go and find my mutated dinosaur fish!\n\nSadly, funding for the project was cut in 2003 (another casualty of war) despite promising tests. One hope is that, due to the discovery that Mars also has subglacial lakes and Jupiter's moon Europa may have as well, the project may be re-opened as a means of testing the technology so it can be used for the same purpose in future space missions.\n\n\"But that's ages away!\" How right you are Jason... Right now I just want my fish.\n\nI recently spent 2 weeks road tripping New Zealand. It's an amazing place. I can't imagine trying to see as much as I did without my own transport though, at least not in the 2 weeks I was there.\n\nIt's a bit like England and Scotland in the sense that the back roads are the best way to see the country and you'll want to stop frequently on the sides of roads to take pictures and enjoy the scenery, of which there is a monumental amount, especially on the South Island. Many of the places you'll want to\/should see just aren't accessible by coach or train and require either booking a tour or missing out.\n\nThere were some huge driving days, many of which were spent on some of the windiest roads I've ever driven (that's saying a lot after living and road tripping in Scotland for 2 years). I did almost all of the driving, but I really enjoy driving and have no problem on windy roads. Having said that, there were times, especially on the drive from Nelson to Picton, where even my driving patience was taxed.\n\nI've been drinking, not smoking, working and playing a lot of Diablo 3... I'm headed to Melbourne this weekend for my birthday so I'm pretty excited about that. I've never been but this is going to be a trial run of sorts. Thinking if I like it (and everyone says I will) that I might move there.\n\nThere's people I wish I had time to meet down there but I'm pretty much only there for 2 days. Still, if I move there it'll all be good!"}
{"text":"Science & Technology News\n\nAmericans hunted Mastodon\n\nPosted Fri, 21 Oct 2011 17:20:00 GMT by Dave Armstrong\n\nNorth Americans will be pleased to find that their history has been backdated by 800 years. Texas A&M University researched in Washington State with the help of universities from Colorado, Washington and, of course, Denmark. The research is published in the journal, Science. A mastodon is the original star of the show, found in a pond at the Manis site on the Olympic peninsula.\n\nLow Flying Objects\n\nPosted Fri, 21 Oct 2011 11:04:00 GMT by Dave Armstrong\n\nDASH, short for Dynamic Autonomous Sprawled Hexapod was a robot investigating stability. Designing a 25 g, 10 cm robot was easy, but they couldn't decide whether it should be a bird or an insect. There was a clue though - it had six legs.\n\nGlass is half full for nano disease diagnosis\n\nPosted Thu, 20 Oct 2011 15:43:01 GMT by Colin Ricketts\n\nNanotechnology is a potentially exciting future medical tool but it remains prohibitively expensive. An MIT scientist sought inspiration in glass blowing to find a way to mass produce these super tiny diagnostic tools.\n\nNew star clusters unveiled by ESO telescope\n\nPosted Thu, 20 Oct 2011 15:07:00 GMT by Dale Kiefer\n\nAstronomers from the European Southern Observatory in Chile have announced the discovery of two new rare globular clusters of stars in the heart of our Milky Way galaxy. The discoveries represent the fruits of an ambitious project to survey the center of the galaxy in infrared light.\n\nMystery of dark matter deepens\n\nPosted Wed, 19 Oct 2011 07:34:00 GMT by Dale Kiefer\n\nA new study shows that mysterious dark matter is even more mysterious than cosmologists thought. Now scientists will need to come up with new theories regarding the nature of the strange stuff that astrophysicists believe makes up the bulk of the universe.\n\n'Minibeasts' rule the world, it seems\n\nPosted Tue, 18 Oct 2011 22:12:00 GMT by Dave Armstrong\n\nWe look down on it. We trample all over it. We very rarely give it a thought, but, ''most of Earth's biodiversity is found in soil,'' NSF program director Matt Kane states! The NSF (National Science Foundation) in the US are aided and abetted in this study by Colorado State University, riding to the rescue of the unloved soil denizens.\n\nMiddle Stone Age ochre toolkit and workshop found in Blombos Cave\n\nPosted Sun, 16 Oct 2011 10:05:00 GMT by Dave Armstrong\n\nCape Town has been the focus of many ethnic groups over the years. 100,000 years ago, during the Middle Stone Age, a processing workshop was set up 300 km east of the modern settlement. The journal Science published the results of Professor Christopher Henshilwood's investigation of this workshop on Friday. It consists of two abalone shells, filled with an ochre rich mix, found in the Blombos Cave. Ochre is basically a red rock, rich in iron oxides.\n\nMars Carbs.\n\nPosted Thu, 13 Oct 2011 15:18:01 GMT by Dave Armstrong\n\nThe oldest rocks known include the Martian meteorite ALH84001, from the Allen Hills in Antarctica. Geologists believe it started life, 4 billion years ago, tens of metres below the Martian surface and was 'snookered' off the planet by another meteorite when it struck that area, a mere 16 million years ago.\n\nESO travel through time with VLT\n\nPosted Thu, 13 Oct 2011 11:11:00 GMT by Dave Armstrong\n\nVery Large Telescope (VLT) researchers time-travel back to 1 billion years after the Big Bang. Up to that time neutral hydrogen fogged the view of early events in the young galaxies as they 'reionised'. This age of reionisation now has a timeline, after a three year search with the VLT for distant galaxies at this stage of development.\n\nStudents, Space and Streaming Experiments\n\nPosted Tue, 11 Oct 2011 12:20:00 GMT by Dave Collier\n\nYouTube and Space Agencies across the world are collaborating on an online educational project. If you know a student between the ages of 14 and 18 who has a keen interest in science, you might want to tell them about YouTube Space Lab, an innovative venture that will see Google working with the ESA, Lenovo, NASA, JAXA and Space Adventures to promote scientific experimentation in space.\n\nSupply questions asked as rare earths are getting rarer\n\nPosted Mon, 10 Oct 2011 16:18:00 GMT by Dave Armstrong\n\nThe elements rarest in the Earth (rare earth) are the most expensive, until we mine the Moon or Mars. However, rare earth minerals are increasingly used in new technologies such as electric vehicles, photovoltaic cells and smart phone displays. At a conference in Minneapolis, the Geological Society of America is discussing a situation that is beginning to cause problems.\n\nCrab Nebula pulsar gamma rays energy amazing astronomers\n\nPosted Sun, 09 Oct 2011 09:50:00 GMT by Dave Armstrong\n\nWe still receive gamma rays from the Crab Nebula's pulsar source, six million light years away. What is amazing astronomers is the sheer energy, even more than the first-seen light rays. Even a year ago, 100 GeV (electron - volts) was not expected from these pulses or anywhere else.\n\nOld Hubble images reveal new planets' orbits\n\nPosted Fri, 07 Oct 2011 01:09:01 GMT by Dale Kiefer\n\nOld images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope have allowed astronomers to calculate the orbits and other characteristics of the only known exosystem with four planets circling a distant star. Astronomers reviewing old images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1998 have discovered evidence of two planets that were missed the first time"}
{"text":"YOUR FRIENDS' ACTIVITY\n\nThe Year's 10 Strangest Science Stories\n\nHold the sex, pass the DNA\n\nSure, birds do it, bees do it, but rotifer worms don't bother. Having sex is a key way for species to increase their genetic diversity and prevent the buildup of harmful genetic mutations. But an all-female worm called the bdelloid rotifer seems to have kept its kind alive for 80 million years without engaging in sex. Instead of cozying up to a fellow rotifer, the creature devours fungi and bacteria and incorporates some of that DNA into its own genetic code. The DNA meals may provide a healthy dose of antioxidants, the researchers propose.\n\nColorful honey\n\nHives of sugar-crazed bees in France are turning chocolate M&Ms into colorful honey. The bees got hooked on the candy because a biogas plant in the region processed waste from a local Mars Chocolate Factory. The bees collected the sugar in their storage stomachs and then transferred it to other bees in the colony. The artificial coloring in the candy dyed the honey striking shades of blue and green.\n\nMother-child brain meld\n\nAnd you thought pregnancy hijacked the brain. New research revealed that fetal cells migrate to a woman's brain, where they can linger for decades. The scientists found traces of male sex chromosome DNA in the cadavers of women as old as 94. While scientists don't understand exactly what these cells do, some theorize they may help the woman's body repair tissue and may even play a role in Alzheimer's disease.\n\nLiving longer with a snip\n\nFile this under life-prolonging treatments few would want to try. Until 1894, some Koreans had their testicles removed in order to rise in a traditional court hierarchy and get invited to exclusive sleepover parties at the royal palace. The Korean eunuchs lived up to 20 years longer than their intact male counterparts. Though it's not clear exactly why this happened, the male sex hormone, testosterone, is known to suppress the immune system and worsen heart health. [Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100]\n\nFossil forests return\n\nOne unforeseen side effect of global warming: Ancient fossilized Arctic forests may come back to life, according to one study. With temperatures across the globe rising fast, these forests, which lived about 2.5 million years ago, may soon revive. The forests grew when the annual temperature was around freezing, or 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees C). The current average yearly temperature in the Arctic is 5 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 15 degrees C), but if the climate warms significantly, grandchildren of people living today may be able to visit newly revived Arctic forests.\n\nCockroach to the rescue\n\nCockroaches: They can go where no man can and are impervious to the most hostile conditions. Now scientists have turned those bugs into features by creating remote-controlled cyborg cockroaches that could scurry into disaster areas to look for survivors. Because they are so small, the remote-controlled roaches could skitter under rubble after an earthquake.\n\nBridge to nowhere\n\nA giant bridge of dark matter, an elusive substance that can be sensed only by its gravitational pull, lies between two massive galaxy clusters about 2.7 billion light-years from Earth. The findings support the idea that galaxy clusters form where dark matter filaments cross. The Subaru telescope in Hawaii picked out evidence of the filament in 2001, but it wasn't until this year that physicists went back and discovered the mysterious bridge.\n\nMaggots ID the dead\n\nJust when you thought CSI couldn't get any stranger, it's now possible to identify human bodies from the maggots that eat them. Police in Mexico identified a body that was so badly burned there was no soft tissue left. The bugs harbored traces of human DNA in their intestinal tracts, allowing forensic scientists to identify the body as the remains of a girl who had been abducted several days before.\n\nBaby crime fighters\n\nWhat's the best way to fight crime? Put up adorable images of chubby little babies. At least, that's the strategy a few shopkeepers are turning to in Gravesend, a rough part of London that was heavily looted in riots last year. The hope is that would-be vandals will look at the innocent little faces and find that their looting, stealing hearts are turning to mush. While it may sound silly, the idea has some basis: Previous research showed baby faces activated loving, caring circuits in the brain.\n\nNew human species"}
{"text":"Elementary, my dear Newton\n\nThe sleeper TV hit of the season, CSI, is proof positive that it's possible to package science and technology in a way that people other than engineers find fun and entertaining. Short for Crime Scene Investigations, the show features a team of forensic detectives who use their knowledge of esoteric topics such as the life span of maggots, blunt objects, and tire tread marks (on a dead body) to find out \"who done it.\"\n\nIt's little wonder the show is a big success. Given the choice, I know I'd rather watch live insects eating dead people than watch live people eating dead insects\u2014or were those bugs still kicking on Survivor?\n\nGranted, CSI takes a few shortcuts\u2014like when the detectives get some important DNA test results back in less time than it takes to brew a cup of coffee. But that's splitting hairs\u2014literally, I suppose.\n\nLike the writers of CSI, at Design News we strive to develop editorial content that is both entertaining and educational for our engineering audience. Given that goal, I am pleased to introduce a new Break Time! column that features our very own detective\u2014of sorts\u2014debuting on the back page in this issue.\n\nCalled \"The Z Files,\" the column is authored by Dr. Larry Zirkle, P.E. A forensic engineer, he investigates cases involving failed systems, rather than dead bodies. In fact, because he specializes in vehicle accident reconstruction and mechanical product liability, Zirkle is more likely to find a smoking radiator than a smoking gun.\n\nIn a series of upcoming columns, many based upon his actual case files, Zirkle will explore just exactly what happens when people experience first-hand the laws of physics. In \"The Case of the Dead Daredevil,\" his detective work centers around Evel Knievel-like stunts and projectile motion. In \"The Case of the Immovable Object,\" our intrepid investigator tackles the subject of incompressibility to explain why a pig is one of the most dangerous obstacles you can run into on the road.\n\nSo, like the fans of CSI, we hope you enjoy our show.

It can be considered as a satellite for the seas. According the engineering team developing the robot , it would be capable of ambitious missions like trans-Atlantic crossing, measure oil leaks, the Pacific garbage patch, boundary currents, marina life, coral reefs and icebergs.\n\nWe are used to hear about abundance of garbage and dealing with this as a problem. Well, Oslo could solve it by importing other's garbage and generate heat and energy for almost half of the city and most of its schools by burning it. And believe it or not, the city has literally run out of garbage to burn. And it's not just Oslo that needs garbage, The New York Times reports. Across Northern Europe burning garbage to generate heat and energy is a quite common practice in recent decades and the demand for trash already has exceeded the supply. This kind of waste management in Oslo plays a role in the achievement of a reduction of its CO2 emissions by 50% by 2030.\n\nPlants are the best converters of solar energy and in the searching for alternatives of conventional power sources the scientists are coming closer and closer to nature. Researchers for the University of Georgia are developing a new technology that allows using plants to generate electricity. Plants use sunlight to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen and electrons, which help in producing sugars (energy), are freed. \"We have developed a way to interrupt photosynthesis so that we can capture the electrons before the plant uses them to make these sugars,\" said Ramaraja Ramasamy, assistant professor in the UGA College of Engineering and the corresponding author of a paper describing the process in the Journal of Energy and Environmental Science.\n\n\"Biomass\" is a satellite which will be launched in 2020 and will calculate the amount of carbon stored in the world's forests. Over a five-year mission it will monitor for any changes in the forests and should help researchers understand better the role trees play in the Earth carbon cycle and the influence this has on the planet's climate, BBC reports. The \"Biomass\" mission was approved by the European Space Agency and the satellite will be the seventh of the agency's Earth Explorers \u2013 a series of spacecraft designed to do innovative science in obtaining data on issues of pressing environmental concern.\n\n\"Climate change 'will make hundreds of millions homeless'\", the Guardian alarms. According to Lord Stern, an economist and climate change expert, it is very likely that millions of people will have to leave their homelands in the near future as a result of global warming. Despite all the warnings of scientists about raising levels of CO2 concentrations, the output is still increasing and consequences have already become more or less clear and unfortunately considered as severe. The recently announced 400 ppm concentration of carbon dioxide is considered as a point where the world will inevitably experience a catastrophic rise in temperatures. The article is warning that agriculture could fail on entire continents leading to migration of people and conflicts over land."}

A new study by researchers at Caltech suggests that when there are high financial incentives to succeed, people can become so afraid of losing their potentially lucrative reward that their performance suffers.\n\nBy analyzing stalagmites, a team of Caltech researchers has determined that the climate signature in the tropics through four glacial cycles looks different in some ways and similar in others when compared to the climate signature at high latitudes. The results suggest that Earth's climate system might have two modes of responding to significant changes.\n\nWhat's it like to build an entire research program from scratch?

Has anyone been successfully revived from cryonic suspension?\nNo. Fortunately, successful cryonics is a two-step process:\n(1) put the patient in suspension and\n(2) revive the patient from suspension\nFor cryonic suspension to be worthwhile, we only need to master\nstep (1) right now and have reasonable expectation that we might\nmaster step (2) later.\n2-2. What advances need to be made before people frozen now have a chance\nof being revived?\nA number of advances in basic areas of research such as medicine,\nmicrobiology, engineering, and information sciences are required\nbefore any serious attempt can be made to revive patients suspended\nwith current technology. Nanotechnology, the design and fabrication\nof molecular scale machines, is an emerging technology that will\nprobably be both necessary and sufficient for revival.\n2-3. Is there any government or university supported research on cryonics\nspecifically?\nThere was suspended animation research sponsored by NASA as late as\n1979 at the University of Louisville, Kentucky.\n2-4. What is the procedure for freezing people?\nRead an account of a cryonic suspension. Briefly, circulation is\nrestored by CPR, and the blood is replaced by other substances that\nprevent blood clots and bacteria growth and decrease freezing damage.\nAs this happens the body is cooled as quickly as possible to slightly\nabove 0 degrees C. After the blood has been replaced the body is\ncooled more slowly to liquid nitrogen temperatures.\n2-5. How can one get a more detailed account of a suspension?\nCryomsgs 601 and 602 is The Transport of Patient A-1312 (28K bytes)\nand cryomsgs 696, 697, and 698 are The Neurosuspension of Patient\nA-1260. (35K bytes). These messages give a first-hand description\nof the initial stages of two suspensions.\n2-6. Is there damage from oxygen deprivation during a suspension?\nNot if the suspension happens under good circumstances. One of the\nbig goals of the suspension procedure is to get the HLR machine onto\nthe patient as soon as possible, to prevent this damage. The\nbarbiturates they give reduce brain metabolism, as does cooling. In a\nwell done suspension, the damage from oxygen deprivation should be\nminor. In a more perfect world, the suspension procedure would be\nable to start before legal death, which should reduce the damage from\nischemia even more because there wouldn't be any time when the\nheart is stopped and the body is warm.\n2-7. Do memories require an ongoing metabolism to support them, like RAM in\na computer?\nNot long term memories. When children nearly drown in cold water,\nthey can often be revived after having no apparent metabolism and\nstill have their memories. Likewise large doses of barbiturates can\nsuppress all measurable brain waves without destroying long term\nmemories.\n2-8. If these frozen people are revived, will it be easy to cure them of\nwhatever disease made them clinically die?\nRepairing the freezing damage looks much harder than curing any\nexisting disease, so if revival is possible then curing the disease\nought to be trivial. This doesn't include diseases that lose\ninformation in the brain, such as Alzheimer's, mental retardation, or\nbrain tumors; in these cases, even if the disease were cured and the\nperson revived, the problem of replacing the lost information looks\nhard.\n2-9. If I'm frozen and then successfully revived, will my body be old?\nNo. Old age is a disease that ought to be easier to cure than the\nfreezing damage.\n2-10. Why is freezing in liquid nitrogen better than other kinds of\npreservation, such as drying or embalming?\nStraightforward chemical arguments lead to the conclusion that\nsignificant amounts of decomposition do not occur at liquid nitrogen\ntemperatures. (See Hugh Hixon's article \"How Cold Is Cold Enough?\"\nfrom *Cryonics* magazine, January, 1985, or fetch cryomsg 0015.)\nThis isn't true for either dried or embalmed tissue kept at room\ntemperature.\nAlso, Alcor and Trans Time have done experiments with dogs that\ndemonstrate that part of the suspension process does not cause\ndamage. Dogs have been anesthetized, perfused with a blood\nsubstitute, and cooled to slightly above 0 C for several hours.\nAfter rewarming and replacing the original blood, the dogs revived\nwith no obvious brain damage. Experiments like this cannot be done\nwith drying or embalming.\nAnother option that may become possible in the future is vitrification.\n2-11. What is vitrification?\n(Next paragraph copied from CRYOMSG 6)\nThe cover article of the Aug. 29, 1987 issue of Science News describes\nvitrification, which achieves cooling to a glassy state without the\nwater crystallizing into ice. The advantage of this is that the cells\ndo not suffer the mechanical damage from the crystallization. The\nmain disadvantage is that the concentration of cryoprotectants\nrequired to achieve this is toxic. It is also, currently, a\ntechnically difficult and expensive process requiring computer control\nof cooling rates, perfusion, etc. The March, 1988 issue of Cryonics\nmagazine (\"The Future of Medicine\", Part 2 of 2) suggests that\nvitrification may not be needed for ordinary organ banking, since\nother, cheaper methods may be good enough. For tissues and cells,\nthough, it has a lot of promise for the commercial market. Thus,\ncommercial research into vitrification may stop short of what is\nneeded for making it viable for preservation of large organs or whole\nbodies required by cryonics.\n2-12. How is the baboon? Did it live? Any brain damage?\nAccording to Art Quaife as of 14 Jul 92, the baboon is well and has\nno signs of brain damage.\nThis is part of what CRYOMSG 865 has to say about the baboon:\nBerkeley, California, May 29 1992. BioTime Inc. has, for the first\ntime, successfully revived a baboon following a procedure in which\nthe animal's deep body temperature was lowered to near-freezing and\nits blood was replaced with BioTime's patent-pending blood-\nsubstitute solution.\nThe animal was anesthetized, immersed in ice and cooled to below 2\ndegrees Celsius, using the BioTime solution with cardiopulmonary\nbypass procedures. After being bloodless and below 10 degrees\nCentigrade for 55 minutes, the animal was rewarmed and revived. The\nbaboon is presently under study by BioTime scientists to determine any\nlong-term physical effects.\nThe company intends to conduct further experiments on primates, using\nits blood-substitute solutions.\n2-13. Who has successfully kept dogs cold for hours? Did they survive? Any\nbrain damage?\nSeveral people have achieved that. The first cryonics organization to\ndo so was Alcor, in the mid 1980's. For example, the Jan. 1986 issue\nof Cryonics magazine describes, in the article \"Dixie's Rebirthday\", a\nGerman Shepherd dog named Dixie who \"experienced the privilege (and\nthe peril) of having all her blood washed out and replaced with a\nsynthetic solution and then being cooled to 4 C. For four hours she\nwas held at this temperature: stiff, cold, with eyes flattened out,\nbrain waves stopped, and heart stilled. Then, she was reperfused with\nblood, warmed up and restored to life and health.\" She made a total\nrecovery. Several variations, with different perfusates and slightly\ndifferent temperatures and\/or times were also performed by Alcor.\nLater, ACS performed a similar experiment on a beagle named Miles and\nrecently (1992) BioTime successfully cooled and revived a baboon.\nIn comparison, hypothermic cardiac surgery was pioneered on humans\ndecades ago, although the temperatures used were not nearly as low as\nin the dog experiments above. More recently, the October 1988 issue\nof The Immortalist described successful surgery on a brain aneurysm in\nwhich the patient was cooled to 15 C for almost an hour. During that\ntime the patient's blood remained drained from the body, there was no\nrespiration, the heart did not beat, and the brain barely functioned.\n2-14. Who froze the roundworms? What happened?\n(This text is quoted from CRYOMSG 790)\nGerry Arthus, our New York Coordinator, has announced preliminary\nresults of an experiment which was designed to investigate whether\nmemories will survive cryonic suspension.\nFor his experiment, Gerry used Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode\n(tiny worm) that's one of the simplest living creatures. It has a\ncomplete nervous system, however, and can be \"trained\" in a\nrudimentary way. Worms that are raised in a warm environment will\n\"remember\" it and will prefer it if they are given the choice.\nConversely, worms that were raised in a cooler area will tend to\nprefer that environment.\nGerry placed a small number of worms in a cryoprotective solution and\nfroze them to -80 degrees Celsius for two hours. After he revived the\nworms, the ones that survived the experience still \"remembered\" their\nformer environmental preferences. So far as we know, this is the\nworld's first experiment designed to verify that memory is chemically\nencoded and will survive the freezing process.\nThe sample that Gerry used is too small to prove anything\nconclusively. Soon, however, Gerry hopes to repeat the experiment with\na larger sample. He also intends to devise tests to eliminate the\npossibility that the worms changed physiologically to adapt themselves\nto warmer or cooler environments.\n2-15. What were the circumstances under which cat brains produced\nnormal-looking brain waves after being frozen?\nThis was reported by I. Suda and A.C. Kito in Nature, 212, 268-270 (1966).\nThe cat brains were perfused with 15% glycerol and cooled to -20 C\nfor five days and, upon rewarming and perfusion with fresh blood,\nshowed normal brain function (as measured by EEG). Since this experiment\nwas done so long ago, and technology has improved considerably since\nthen, there is some interest in redoing these experiments to see how\nwell we can do now.\nThe April 1992 Cryonics, volume 13 number 4 page 4, talks more about\nthis and gives more references. Appendix B of CRFT talks about the\nplausibility of repair in general.\n2-16. Would it be possible to use some improvement on modern CAT or MRI\nscanners to infer enough about the structure of a brain to reconstruct\nthe memories and personality?\nThis was discussed on the cryonics mailing list some time back. The\nconclusion was that using radiation to infer the structure of the\nneurons in a brain in a reasonable amount of time would require enough\nradiation to vaporize that brain. Then the discussion moved on to\nnuclear-bomb x-ray holography devices in outer space that record the\nresults on film that has to be moving by at an astronomical speed so\nit doesn't get caught in the blast. Cremation and immortality, all in\none convenient package. I find nanotechnology-based approaches more\nbelievable, albeit less spectacular.\nTo read about this yourself, fetch articles from the cryonet archive\nwith the words \"brain scan\" in the subject. There are 18 as of July\n30, 1992. See the \"What is a cryomsg?\" question below."}

The most recent one lasted about 60,000 years and ended 10,000 years ago, apparently, without any government assistance. In today's terminology, it is called global warming, and I wonder what caused it then?

That humans can document the existence of water on Mars is intrinsically fascinating.

There are many other small actions that can help save Earth-and the animals and people who call it home. 1. Use cotton diapers instead of disposable ones. A disposable diaper takes approximately 500 years to decompose in a landfill. 2. Insist on paper bags at the grocery checkout counter instead of plastic bags.\n\nIn a perfect world, there would be no conflicts, just peace and freedom. Yes the absence of conflict in our lives would give us the peace we seek and the freedom to enjoy it. In addition to the many conflicts between countries, there are conflicts we see in many relationships, between ethnic groups, between political parties--and the list goes on. We can see how this fact keeps us from enjoying true peace and harmony.

{"text":"Page 2 - Science Facts\n\nTo be clear, unlike products such as Viagra and Kleenex, which were made for one purpose and were discovered to be highly useful for another, Lysol was always a disinfectant.\n\nNever was it specifically made as birth control, yet from the 1920's until the 1960's, it was largely marketed for reasons other than cleaning doorknobs or tables like we use it for today.\n\nAdvertising suggested that Lysol should be used for feminine hygiene, and that it was a highly effective birth control product due it's supposed ability to kill sperm. Of course, this wasn't quite an era where one could say anything false for forty years without someone finding out, so Lysol invented European doctors to give credibility to their claims.\n\nWhat's shocking is that products like Lysol were the leading contraceptives until 1960, when oral contraceptives were introduced. So did Lysol work? Nope. A study showed that 250 out of 507 women using the disinfectant got pregnant, which was about the same as those using no birth control at all.\n\nWhat's worse, Lysol usage as contraceptive could cause severe inflammation, burning, and even death, in several cases.\n\nSonic Hedgehog is one of three proteins in the mammalian signaling pathway family called hedgehog.

However, a potential inhibitor has been found, and dubbed Robotnikinin, a play on the name of Dr. Robotnik, Sonic's nemesis.\n\nSome people criticize the naming as being frivolous and a little inappropriate when people have to be told that their child has a serious illness because they have a mutated sonic hedgehog.

For the alien enthusiasts out there, you should know that the number of known planets is now well over 700 and rapidly climbing.\n\nThe discovery of these planets are a result of astronomers and researchers observing 'retired' stars.

The reason for NPT is the release of a chemical called Nitric Oxide in the nerves of your Johnson during REM sleep - the deep sleep that allows you to dream.\n\nThe chemical Nitric Oxide is only released subconsciously by the body during REM sleep in order to make sure everything is in order.

{"text":"Yemeni professor develops invisibility theory\n\nShatha Al-Harazi\n\nYemeni migrants shine in various areas in science. However, their work, which has grabbed attention worldwide, has failed to be recognized even in their homeland.\n\n2011 was full of success stories for Yemeni figures who received honors abroad. Tawakul Karman, the first Muslim woman to be awarded a Nobel Peace Prize received particularly strong coverage.\n\nOne who wasn't featured in Yemen's media was Dr. Akram Al-Omainey. The Yemeni professor was recently honored in Britain for his theory on the invisibility of objects. At the British Science Festival, Al-Omainey received the Isambard Kingdom Brunel Award, an award given annually to young engineers and scientists who exhibit outstanding communication skills when before a non-specialist audience.\n\n31-year-old Dr. Akram Al-Omainey's award-winning research was on the \"engineering cloak of invisibility,\" a theory which suggests that human beings can be made invisible.\n\nLast September in London, he delivered his reception speech to a large audience that included famous scientists and proponents of education. From then until the present time, Al-Omainey has continued to deliver his talk throughout the United Kingdom.\n\n\"My main research focus was on the influence of radio signals on the human body and vice-versa, which to the external spectator seems to be a straightforward and direct problem and solution equation. It is, however, a complex issue due to the realization that we humans are not only physiologically and psychologically complex: we are also one complicated electric machine, with each organ and blood vein carrying different properties,\" he said.\n\nAl-Omainey explained that he worked with a great professor and scientist as he completed his PhD and initial research, and that he was always encouraged by him to think outside the box.\n\n\"The idea of using non-natural meta-materials with different characteristics to focus images and light into one place \u2013 hence making the perfect lens \u2013 came from Professor Sir John Pendry from Imperial College in London. He went on to prove that objects can theoretically be made invisible by bending light.\n\n\"The idea was quite intriguing since it was based on making stuff disappear \u2013 or correctly making them invisible.\"\n\nHe explained that theoretically the idea was proven possible, but had yet to be in reality.\n\n\"In theory, there is no difference between theory and measurements \u2013 but in measurements, there is! So the major challenge was to prove that human being can bend light around an object so that it appears invisible; we can see things because they reflect light and if we can manage to bend light around an object, no-one could ever see it.\n\n\"Many groups around the world are now working towards making this a reality...but taking into consideration all the obstacles and challenges, it could take us around 20-25 years to actually make an object \u2013 a small book, for example \u2013 invisible in all situations and in any place,\" he said.\n\n\"This isn't only to make stuff disappear so that we can live out Harry Potter fantasies; it has many beneficial applications. These include making building and other obstacles appear invisible for radio and mobile signals, so that we may have the best possible telephone call quality. Making things invisible do so not only for our eyes, but for any kind of signal, such as having better satellite links without influence from buildings or trees.\"\n\nAl-Omainey completed his secondary education in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in 1998 as one of the top students in the kingdom. He completed his higher education in London with the support of his family.\n\nHe received his Master's degree in Communications Engineering from Queen Mary University in London in 2003. He was then awarded an Overseas Research Scholarship, which is awarded by the UK government to outstanding international students.\n\nHe obtained his PhD in Advanced Electrical and Electronic Studies in 2007 from the same university and continued to work as a researcher on topics related to body-centric communications and the role of wireless technologies in our everyday lives.\n\nThis work led to his obtaining a lectureship position at Queen Mary University. In addition to continuing his research, he taught university students about the basics behind many of the advanced technologies people use today.\n\n\"I became interested in the communications and electronics fields at an early age. This interest was nourished and encouraged by my father and mother, who were always and still are supportive, loving and above all great parents, providing guidance for myself, my elder brother and younger sister,\" he said.\n\n\"From my first day at university, I was interested in radio signals and their behavior. I made sure to acquire knowledge and learn more about this topic, which led to a few projects of mine related to this field. This influenced my research topic choice, which was electromagnetics and theories behind wireless technologies.\n\n\"One of the major global challenges in science and engineering is marketing the fields' advantages. From the start of my lectureship, I became involved with outreach activities, promoting science and engineering to children, young adults and the general public, no matter what their background was.\n\nMy main goal and objective now is to deliver science awareness and an enthusiasm to better our societies in the ever-changing Middle East,\" said Al-Omainy.\n\nAlthough his successful journey started in Saudi Arabia, where he was brought up, and continued in the UK, Dr. Al-Omainy says that he still considers Yemen to be the center of his life.\n\n\"Yemen has always been the center of my life, as my parents made sure that we remembered who we are and where we came from. We knew everything about Yemeni culture and heritage. We visited our country frequently, and we managed to enhance the bond with our homeland, Arabia Felix,\" he concluded.\n\nIn the summer in a glass guts the cool sprite seems to be a wholesome creme de la creme, but if the sprite \"feet\"?

{"text":"Tag Archives: General Physics\n\nHawking radiation is a concept that sees photons escaping the event horizon of a black hole, where the gravitational effects start to draw all particles and light into its centre. A team from the University of British Columbia have designed an experiment with a trough of flowing water that contains an airplane wing shaped obstacle, to model the Hawking radiation effect.\n\nThe obstacle creates a region of high velocity flow which blocks surface waves generated downstream from flowing back upstream. Shallow surface waves split to form pairs of deep water waves similar to photons in Hawking's theory, seeing one flow upstream and the other down and like a black holes they show a thermal spectrum.\n\nAnswers to black hole evolution on the horizon?\n\nAnalysing the region outside of the event horizon of a black hole may provide ways of determining its evolutionary state. Researchers at Queen Mary's college, University of London have developed a method based on the Kerr solution of black holes, that which is time independent in general relativity and rotating. This new analysis looking outside the event horizon shows how much a dynamical black hole differs from the Kerr solution and at what final evolutionary state the black hole is in.\n\nBetter turbine spacing for wind turbines\n\nWind farms are cropping up on larger and larger scales across the orld, however operators are still looking for the most efficient way to space them.\n\nCharles Meneveau a fluid dynamics and turbulence expert has found the optimal spacings for wind turbines, which require greater spacing between individual turbines. Currently the average spacing required between turbines is 7 turbine diameters, however the optimal spacing predicted to improve the efficiencies by up to 10% require spacings of 15 turbine diameters. This new model accounts for why current arrays appear to produce less energy than predicted. Taking into account local atmosphere wind flow and turbulence drawing stronger air from the upper atmosphere, the power drawn from the wind can be increased.\n\nInsect eyes inspiring solar cells\n\nJapanese researchers have been inspired by the eyes of moths to create anti reflective coatings for solar cells that will reduce the amount of light that is reflected thus ensuring the maximum amount of light is absorbed by the cell. Moth eyes were the best anti reflective coatings found by the team studying the eyes of numerous insects. The difficulty ahead for the team is to produce a seamless high throughput that will roll out into a film for the coating.\n\nHow to tame hammer droplets\n\nIn old buildings people tend to hear pounding noises in the plumbing systems, this is a well known effect called a water hammer. A water hammer occurs when a valve suddenly opens or closes in a pipe carrying water or steam causing a pressure wave to travel down a pipe with enough force to cause a burst pipe. New research has shown a similar effect happening when a droplet hits a surface. The effect can be applied to steam based power stations to explain turbine degredation and can be used to increase durability in the future. This should increase the longevity of turbines and overall efficiences, reducing downtime and increasing output thus curbing emissions.\n\nSmaller effects are used in the research of hydrophobic (water repelling) surfacess. When a droplet hits the surface it undergoes rapid deceleration and high pressures exerted account for pitting and erosion occurring on turbines. Studies will look at small scale texturing to reduce pressure exersion and wetting on the surface of turbine blades.\n\nIn starting this blog I am to inform about various discoveries happening in the world of Physics and Astronomy giving any extra background where necessary for anyone not totally familiar with the subject, this may manifest itself as an article or a round up of the week in Physics. When time allows I will probably even do some subject reviews focusing on previous research and fundamental theories and maybe even include some book\/documentary reviews (although I make no promises about the frequency of these!).\n\nI hope that this blog ends up being informative and any suggestions I will take onboard and try to answer or fulfill."}

{"text":"RIGHT FOR FLIGHT: An 800 Km flight from Warton in Lancashire to Inverness in Scotland isn't really anything special, unless it's a drone passenger jet flying on commercial routes and controlled by a pilot on the ground. That's the flight that a British Aerospace Jetstream made recently. There was a pilot aboard who handled the takeoff and landing but otherwise the aircraft flew on auto, testing its detect-and-avoid technology on fake objects fed into the computer during flight. It will be a big step, having drone aircraft flying passengers to their destinations, but surely safety considerations would keep a pilot aboard, just in case. New Scientist.\n\nGLUED TO THE WALL: Scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology wanted to create a robot that could climb walls. While other robots have used the technique that allows geckos to climb, these robots use thermoplastic adhesives to stick to the wall temporarily. When the adhesive is warmed it flows into the kind of gaps found on rough surfaces. At a critical temperature above 70 degrees the adhesive is very tacky allowing the robot foot to stick to the wall. Cool it again and the robot can kick free and move a step. In tests, a 1 Kg droid slowly carried a 7 Kg weight up walls made of wood, plastic, stone and aluminium. Now they need to find a way to speed up the heating and cooling. New Scientist.\n\nFIGURING THE FORESTS: In 2020 the Biomass satellite will be launched by the European Space Agency to weigh the Earth's forests. Its radar system will be able to sense the trunks and big branches of trees from orbit. Then the satellite will calculate the amount of carbon stored in the world's forests and allow researchers to better understand the role forests play in the carbon cycle and climate. Not all of the world's forests though: the satellite will not be permitted to operate over North America, Europe and the Arctic in case it interferes with missile early-warning and space-tracking systems. Defence against protection is a difficult trade-off. BBC.\n\nHAIRY FLIGHT: The satellite ESTCube-1 is testing out a new method of propulsion. Solar sails reflect photons from the sun to push the spacecraft forward. The new method uses wires with a positive charge that extend from the craft and repel positively charged protons. The repulsion pushes the craft. The tiny satellite is only 10 cm wide and its 10 metre long positively charged wire is only half the width of a human hair. While this tiny craft is only a test, full size craft with 100 wires, each 20 Km long, could move quickly enough to reach Pluto in less than 5 years. Manufacturing 20 Km wires with a diameter less than a human hair will be challenging enough. New Scientist.\n\nIN THE HOLE: Suppose you want to hide from microwaves, how might you do it? Surprisingly, researchers at Duke University discovered all it takes is a cheap 3D printer and some plastic with holes in just the right places. Of course, it's those holes that are the key. Algorithms determined the location, size and shape of the holes so they deflect microwave beams. A hole in the centre of the disc is where an object to be hidden must be placed, then microwave beams must travel through the side of the disc. The holes guide the microwaves around the object, effectively hiding it. So it'll be a while before humans can hide using this technique. redOrbit. an Oreo cookie from its cream \u2014 a surprisingly challenging task for a robot, but obviously an essential skill. In the end one side prevailed \u2026 Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nGENERATOR PLANT: When researchers at the University of Georgia in the US wanted to find a better way to generate electricity they studied plants \u2014 photosynthesis, to be precise. Using structures called thylakoids, plants capture photons of sunlight and convert them into almost an equal number of electrons, splitting water atoms into hydrogen and oxygen. The electrons eventually create sugars that allow the plants to grow. The researchers manipulated proteins contained in the thylakoids, interrupting the pathway along which electrons flow. Then they added carbon nanotubes to act as electrical conductors. Their approach resulted in greater levels of electrical current than those reported in similar systems. They suggest this system could be used for remote sensors or other portable electronic equipment that requires less power to run. We're still only playing catch-up with nature. PhysOrg.\n\nC+ FOR FRUIT: LED lamps are the in thing for those wanting to save energy. It turns out they also boost the amount of Vitamin C in tomatoes grown under them. Researchers at Wageningen University suspended special LED modules between the plants around tomato clusters, exposing the tomatoes to extra light. Some varieties of tomatoes grown under the LEDs contained up to twice as much vitamin C as the tomatoes not exposed to the lights. Hmmm, is there any effect LEDs are having on us then?

These days it takes a computer and co-ordinated raids on ATMs. Recently a worldwide gang of criminals drained $45 million dollars from ATMs in just a few hours by using bogus swipe cards with fraudulently increased withdrawal limits. First attackers breached a couple of Middle Eastern banks and tinkered with access codes and withdrawal limits. Then data was loaded onto random cards that use a magnetic strip, such as hotel key cards. Finally operatives all over the world used the cards to withdraw cash from ATMs. See what can be achieved with a bit of planning.

Technology Review.\n\nMOVIES IN SIGHT: Some people, such as the vision or hearing impaired, find movies challenging or perhaps even pointless as they may not see or hear what's going on. Captioned screenings are rare, and current personal captioning devices that fit inside a cup holder with a screen attached are bulky, display text out of the line of vision to the screen, and distract other patrons. Now some cinemas are introducing Sony Entertainment Access Glasses that display captions only to those wearing them. The captions appear to float a couple of metres in front of the wearer. Audio tracks also describe the action on the screen for blind people. Of course, this depends on the movie maker supplying captioned tracks and on the theatre having the necessary digital equipment. Next thing to work on: translation subtitles. All Tech Considered.\n\nTHE INSIDE STORY: Traditional umbrellas are tricky to work with: they quickly turn inside out in a decent gust of Wellington wind, may poke someone's eye out if you're not careful and are likely to block your vision as you keep the rain off your face. The Rainshader has a new approach, based on the shape of a motorcycle helmet. It's particularly aimed at people watching sports who need to be able to see the action while keeping the rain at bay. The makers claim it's virtually impossible to blow inside out, and its fibre glass ribs and rubber handle mean you're less likely to be zapped by lightning in a thunderstorm. So it's a bit like an expanded hood really. Rainshader.\n\nA $2 CLEAN: Clean water is essential to our survival, but it can be expensive to remove bacteria and other harmful particles. At the Indian Institute of Technology researchers found that silver nanoparticles combined with an aluminium composite can do the job at low cost. As water flows through the filter the nanoparticles oxidise, releasing ions that kill viruses and bacteria, and neutralise toxic chemicals such as lead and arsenic. In tests a 50 gram composite filtered 1500 litres of water without needing reactivation. The researchers estimate a family of 5 could have clean drinking water for a year from a single $2 filter. That could prove affordable for people even on extremely limited incomes, though even better would be for governments to supply filters for free. New Scientist.\n\nONE UP: The semiconductors in our electronics, carry along the electrical charge of electrons, and that's good. But electrons in the presence of a magnet have a property that's not being used: they have spin, up or down. One spin state aligns with the magnetic field, while the other opposes it, which could be used to mark the 1 or 0 of a computer bit. A team at the University of Delaware have confirmed the previously only theoretical presence of a magnetic field generated by electrons, which could in turn allow them to exploit the spin property. Or maybe electronics just make your head spin. University of Delaware..\n\nDRONE RESCUE: The Canadian Mounties are onto it \u2014 recently they saved the life of someone whose car had flipped at night in remote Saskatchewan by sending out a drone to search. The Draganflyer X4-ES helicopter drone was flown towards the driver's last known location where it used an infrared camera to search for life signs. Nearby searchers on the ground were able to rescue the driver once the drone had pinpointed his location. This seems a perfect use for drones.

Would we send brains into space and capture their thoughts and memories?:\n\nSet in the not-too-distant future, the story unfolds as project personnel talk about the mission and their various roles within it. But just as things start to get rolling, the team is confronted with something far more profound.\n\nMICROSCOPIC MOVES: People have made movies before by animating small toy figures, but the world record for small now goes to IBM with their animated atoms. Researchers used their scanning tunneling microscope to make a stop-motion film where the characters and action are formed by positioning individual carbon monoxide molecules and their component carbon and oxygen atoms, and using copper 111 as the surface of the animation. But are the characters well rounded? IBM.\n\nCRANKING: It's only a concept at the moment but the 4StrikeBike wants us to pedal with our hands as well as our feet. To that end it adds pedals to the handlebars. The crankshaft has a special freewheel system that allows the bike to be cycled with both arms and legs or with the legs alone, or the hand pedals can each be fixed in place in their highest position and allow the handlebar to be like that on a normal bike. There could be a lot of power in that bike. 4StrikeBike.\n\nPRINT SHOOT: There are plenty of problems around guns, but one is that if the wrong person gets hold of a gun people can be killed. Safe Gun Technology is creating a fingerprint reader to effectively lock a gun unless an authorised user is holding it. The fingerprint reader can be set to allow multiple users. The company has created a prototype of a Remington 870 pump shotgun often used by US law enforcement and is now working on adding its system to handguns. While those intent on crime can probably disable this kind of thing easily enough it may at least stop some kids from shooting one another. Safe Gun Technology.\n\nTWO IN THE SUN: The Sunseeker Duo will be not only the fastest solar-powered plane ever built but it will also be the first to carry a passenger. The solar cells have an efficiency of almost 23% so the Duo will have enough power to maintain a steady climb on direct solar power. Meanwhile folding wings mean it can fit into a regular hangar in spite of its 22 metre wingspan, or it can quickly be taken apart and transported in a special trailer. No tow plane required. Solar Flight.\n\nSTEP CHANGE: Wheelchair users aren't specially thrilled by steps. But if they use the Japanese Unimo electric chair perhaps they'll change their minds. The wheelchair looks more like an armchair and is designed for rest homes and hospitals. Instead of wheels it uses rubber crawler tracks and can do a 360 degree turn in a confined space such as a lift. It can also climb over a step that's 15 cm high. That means it can move on rutted roads, gravel roads in parks and in sand on beaches and other places where conventional electric wheelchairs and mobility scooters cannot travel smoothly. The user controls the chair with a joystick. So how many hospitals have rutted roads and sandy beaches? Tech-On.\n\nGLOVE ALERT: If you work with toxic substances it's a fairly safe bet that you wear protective clothing such as gloves. Even so, how can you tell when a toxic substance may be present? Researchers at the Fraunhofer Research Institution for Modular Solid State Technologies EMFT engineered a glove that recognizes if toxic substances are present in the surrounding air. Custom-made sensor materials are embedded in the glove along with sensor-activated dyes. If a toxic substance is detected the glove changes colour, for example, from white to blue. That's handy. Fraunhofer.\n\nDEADLY DNA: After a crime police may take DNA from a suspect to match with DNA found at the scene. If the samples manage to get accidentally mixed the DNA may falsely show a suspect was at a crime scene. But there are some DNA sequences, called nullomers, which don't exist naturally because they're incompatible with life. Tagging a suspect's sample with nullomers can help show when samples have been mixed, and may clear some wrongly accused people. In tests which diluted the DNA samples 100,000 times, the nullomers were still identifiable, and didn't interfere with analysis of the original DNA profile. In some countries such deadly nullomers could mean the difference between life and death for an accused person. New Scientist.\n\nBUG EYED: Insects such as bees and flies have compound eyes that give them a panoramic view and great depth perception. Now US researchers have created a camera that uses a hemispherical array of 180 microlenses that give it a 160 degree field of view and the ability to focus simultaneously on objects at different depths. Those features could make the camera extremely useful for security cameras, surgical endoscopes and micro aerial vehicles. Ah, but it'll be the software that's really crucial. Wired.\n\nTHE BANDED HUMAN: The Myo armband measures the electrical impulses produced by physical activity. But it's no ordinary life logger counting steps or tracking heart rate. Instead it's a gesture control device. A flick of the wrist may call up the next slide in a presentation, or perhaps clench your hand to stop video playback. Squeeze an imaginary trigger to fire a weapon in a game. The device pairs with gadgets via Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy, uses rechargeable Lithium-Ion batteries and an ARM processor. It features a 6-axis inertial measurement unit for motion sensing. Presumably it works equally well on either arm and could perhaps even be worn on the leg. Thalmic Labs.\n\nFULL COLOUR PLASTIC: The ProDesk3D printer doesn't limit you to printing with just a single coloured filament. Instead it offers true full colour printing through its 5 colour PLA cartridge system that mixes primary colours. It is capable of printing objects down to 25 microns and uses a dual-extruder head to provide PVA-based support material alongside the main design. 3D printing seems to be maturing quickly. BotObjects.\n\nBEES WITH BRAINS: Carbon fibre RoboBees created at Harvard University are about the size of a coin and weigh less than a tenth of a gram. Although they have to be tethered to a power supply and controller they fly vertically and horizontally with ease. The independently controlled wings flap at up to 120 times per second using piezoelectric actuators. Such tiny robots could be used for environmental monitoring, or perhaps pollinating crops where real bees are in short supply. Now the researchers want to find tiny power supplies and computers that can let the bees off their leashes. One day the skies may be full of tiny robots. Harvard University. Video:\n\nOIL SOAK: Boron nitride is also known as white graphene and it can do a particularly useful job: cleaning up organic pollutants from waterways. The material has a large surface area for its weight, so it can mop up a lot of pollutants. In recent tests researchers found it could mop up 29 times its own weight in engine oil yet still float on water. Then the oil can be driven out in a furnace or by being ignited so the sheet of boron nitride can be used again. Even better would be to find a way to extract the oil so it could be used productively. BBC.\n\nSILVER EAR: A team from Princeton University recently used 3D additive printing to create an ear with embedded electronics. They combined a matrix of hydrogel and calf cells to form cartilage with silver nanoparticles that form an antenna. Potentially electric signals from the printed ear could be connected to a person's nerve endings and restore or enhance human hearing. I guess the calf cells would be replaced with human cells. EurekAlert.\n\nSPIN CHARGE: An integrated motor drive and battery charger for electric vehicles may reduce charging time from 8 hours to two. The new power transfer method involves a rotating transformer that includes the motor and inverter in the charger circuit to increase the charging power at a lower cost. At the moment the system works in the lab, but the researchers aim to enhance it for industrial use. Getting those charging times down is crucial.

They did it with two devices: one is implanted between the skull and brain surface to monitor long-term electrical signals in the brain. The other is implanted under the chest and sends signals recorded in the brain to a handheld device. The handheld device used red, white and blue warning lights to indicate the likelihood of a seizure. After a month of simply recording EEG data an algorithm was developed for each person. Although the warnings weren't always correct, 8 of the 11 patients had their seizures accurately predicted between 56% and 100% of the time. Which, after all, is a lot better than no warning at all. The University of Melbourne.\n\nGOODBYE HERSCHEL: We all know the need to maintain equipment we use \u2014 adding oil to the car, tightening up the bike chain. But when that equipment is out in space and it runs out of liquid helium coolant it turns out that's just hard luck. The Herschel Space Observatory has been collecting loads of data since 2009, but the other day it ran out of coolant and observations have ceased. Astronomers will continue to analyse all the images and other data the HSO recorded though and may yet make new discoveries. The spacecraft will soon be propelled to a stable orbit around the Sun where it will remain indefinitely. Rescue mission anyone? European Space Agency.\n\nA DIFFERENT STRIPE: TV crime shows frequently have a computer quickly sorting through thousands of faces to identify a suspect, but that kind of facial recognition doesn't work well for identifying animals by their patterning. That led researchers at MIT to develop a system called SLOOP that could help conservationists. The system uses algorithms to recognise patterns such as stripes or spots and produces a short list of likely candidates. The images are then turned over to crowdsourcing, asking online users to pick the most similar pair. Researchers need this kind of system when studying creatures such as whale sharks or skinks, where it's by far easier and quicker to take a photo than to catch the animal and tag it. Turn it into a pattern-matching game and people are sure to play it. MIT News.\n\nPAPER TRAILS: Laser Enabled Advanced Packaging is a way to create really thin RFID tags \u2014 thin enough to be able to embed them in a sheet of paper. That could open up possibilities in stopping counterfeiting in bank notes or for tracking paper documents. It could also reduce the price of RFID tags, meaning they could be more widely used. North Dakota State University.\n\nSNEAK PEEK: Imagine walking up to a shop window and after a few moments ads related to the object you're looking at start to play. The SideWays eyetracking device uses an ordinary video camera and a special program to assess where you're looking. It first recognises the corners of your eyes and then works out where your pupils are and which direction you're looking in. A prototype device was able to track the gazes of 14 testers, though it can be confused by glasses and can't recognise when people look up or down. The developers want to work next on being able to recognise multiple gazes at once. Before long the watchers will know more about us than we know ourselves. New Scientist.\n\nFIRE LIGHT: Put the Voto in a hot cooking stove and the small fuel cell creates and stores energy for an LED light or to charge cell phones. The device has two parts: a fuel cell box contains fuel cards designed to derive energy from the heat of charcoal burning around the box. The other part is a rechargeable handle that remains outside the stove to collect and store the energy. Disconnect the handle after the fire cools and use it to charge a phone or light the included LED. The Voto is designed for developing nations where cookstoves and kerosene lamps are the norm. It's a superb idea, though the initial cost could be a barrier for those who most need this and similar gadgets. Point Source Power.\n\nA NEW WHEEL: Bike wheels have spokes, as we all know. Except for Loopwheels \u2014 bicycle wheels with integral suspension. They're designed for smaller folding bikes that don't usually have any room for suspension. The wheels reduce vibration and give a smoother ride. Rather than spokes radiating to the rim from a central hub, Loopwheels have 3 oval loops of carbon composite material between the hub and the rim. Aluminium extrusion connectors attach the springs to the hub and rim. That's a clever idea. Loopwheels. Video:\n\nTHE WIND AND THE LIGHT: The new LED streetlights PingQuan, China are interesting. Rather than being connected to the grid via underground wires each one has its own HoYi! wind turbine, two 280 watt solar panels and a storage battery, allowing it to function completely off-grid. I guess maintenance costs could be quite a bit higher than regular streetlights though. Inhabitat.\n\nDNA TO GO: Extracting DNA is no easy task, given that it involves a centrifuge, lots of toxic chemicals and 20 or 30 minutes of work. Researchers compare it with picking up human hairs using a crane. A handheld device from the University of Washington does the job easily in 3 minutes thanks to microscopic probes and electric fields. DNA-sized molecules stick to the probe and are trapped on the surface ready for collection and analysis. The handheld device can handle 4 human fluid samples at a time, but it should scale easily to handle the more usual 96. Perhaps this could be useful for crime scene forensics. University of Washington.\n\nTB ON A STICK: If a doctor suspects you have TB it can take a couple of weeks to culture a sample and make a diagnosis that may or may not be accurate. A new microfluidic device the same size as a standard lab slide can reduce that wait time to a couple of hours. The new system detects DNA from the tuberculosis bacteria in small sputum samples. The device amplifies any target DNA sequences and captures them with polymer beads. Then a miniature nuclear magnetic resonance imager identifies the TB. Test results from known samples produced no false positives and were highly accurate. The device isn't yet ready for real-life use yet, but it could be very valuable for controlling the spread of TB in developing countries. This move to handheld medicine is very encouraging. KurzweilAI.\n\nTWO FACED ADS: There's a poster on a bus stop in Spain. As seen by most adults it displays an innocuous message, but viewed from lower down, where a child would see it, there's a phone number and information about getting help if you're being abused. The aim of course is to help children even where they're being accompanied by an adult who's abusing them. The ad uses lenticular printing which many of us are familiar with from cards that show different pictures depending which way you turn them. How long until junk food advertisers twig to this? The Verge.\n\n]]> morning on the farm with seals\n 06 May 2013 03:40:24 +0000Miraz Station, the West Wind windfarm, New Zealand Fur Seals \u2014 I spent a fabulous morning on a bus tour the other day. ]]>\n\nAn opportunity came my way on Saturday 04 May 2013 to join a bus tour to the West Wind windfarm I often see when I walk our dogs round the top of Mt Victoria. As we walk our circuit and look across Wellington we sometimes spot the majestic arms of the turbines peeking above the western hills.\n\nOf course, I also often write about wind turbines in my Tech Universe column for the NZ Herald Online, so I was interested to get a closer look.\n\nI've visited the lone turbine on Brooklyn Hill several times, but West Wind is much much bigger. The towers are around 70 metres tall, while each of the 3 blades is 40 metres long and weighs around 10 tonnes. By comparison, the Brooklyn Hill wind turbine is around 31 metres tall and each blade is 13.5 metres long.\n\nAn added attraction was a stop to see the New Zealand Fur seals on the South Coast, so I signed up for the tour.\n\nTurbines in the cloud.\n\nThe wind farm\n\nThe Wellington Rover bus picked 8 of us up outside the City Council offices, while a couple of other buses picked up others in the group at the railway station. All together there were three 9-seater buses on the tour. It was a mild day with some light cloud, occasional sunshine and no wind \u2014 perfect for the 4 hour tour.\n\nOur driver, Craig, was friendly and knowledgeable, and looked after all of us really well.\n\nTurbine, almost 70 metres tall.\n\nAfter a short drive out through Karori and down to South Makara Road all 3 buses met up at the gate to Terawhiti Station on the corner with Oteranga Bay Road.\n\nThe wind farm itself has 62 turbines in total within the bounds of the massive 53 square kilometre Station. That's 13,000 acres for the metrically challenged.\n\nWe spent a few minutes admiring views at the base of one of the turbines. They're huge, with enormous blades which seem to disappear in an optical illusion as they reach the bottom of their arc.\n\nI find the turbines majestic and quite beautiful with their smooth curves and regular shape. Certainly seeing lines and groups of them spread across the landscape is spectacular.\n\nTurbines on the hills.\n\nTurbines in the sun.\n\nTerawhiti Station\n\nTerawhiti Station is huge. It went on and on and on. It was more like driving through a national park than through a farm. The hills are covered with bush and scrub, inhabited by wild goats, wild pigs, even deer, apparently. There are also farm animals: cattle and sheep. Hawks hovered overhead playing in the air currents as they came off the turbines.\n\nWe drove up rough roads until we reached the first of the turbines and in other parts of the tour too. Some roads were steep and relatively narrow, while others, created for transporting the turbines, were wide and easy.\n\nThe power company created a temporary wharf at Oteranga Bay on the South Coast and built 33 kilometres of roads so as to transport everything into place. We saw occasional notices of height restrictions for vehicles: 12.5 metres, or 11 metres.\n\nAt one place our guide pointed out the remnants of the gold mining that took place in the late 1800s. He mentioned a time when there were maybe a thousand miners. Most gave up quickly when a seam they'd found stopped suddenly, thanks to Wellington's fractured landscape. It could take months of hard graft to find where any seam continued.\n\nM\u0101ori settlements were in the area too. We saw the vestiges of one area where they would trap the wood pigeons or kereru that would gather to feast on the fruits of the trees.\n\nDown by Oteranga Bay one area is sectioned off because it was an urupa, or graveyard.\n\nThe Army had a presence in the area in World War Two. As with most of Wellington's hills they installed bunkers, creating roads so they could bring in the supplies they needed. We didn't visit any of the bunkers or even spot any of them on our tour though.\n\nApparently Oteranga Bay was also where in the early days the farmers would drive their cattle to so they could be loaded on to barges to be taken to market. Driving them on the tracks over the hills would have taken days.\n\nNear the old homestead.\n\nThe seals\n\nAt some point we stopped at the old homestead on the coast for a toilet break. There's a rather surprising large flat area of grass by the sea with a couple of houses on it, one of them the old homestead.\n\nThen it was a short drive down to and briefly along the coast to the spot where the seals haul out. Our guides gave us a cup of tea (or coffee or soft drinks) and a muffin or two. Then we had some free time to wander around and observe the seals, without getting close enough to bother them.\n\nNew Zealand Fur Seals in amongst the rocks. There are more in the sea beside the rocks but they aren't really visible in this photo.\n\nThere were probably a dozen or more seals sunbathing on the beach, with perhaps a couple of dozen more on the rocks or in the sea nearby. Apparently in July and August there can be hundreds on the beach. Even the ones we saw were pretty pongy. When there are hundreds on the beach the stench must be overpowering.\n\nSeals, zoomed in.\n\nOur guide explained something interesting to us too: seals move on land with a looping motion like a caterpillar, while sealions lift up and walk on their flippers. The New Zealand Fur Seal (its official name) is actually a sealion.\n\nThe seals on the beach are males \u2014 the females are away out at sea fishing and looking after any pups.\n\nNot far away were various small fishing and recreational boats, and several divers were in the water too. While access through Terawhiti Station is extremely limited, those with a good 4-wheel drive vehicle can drive around the coast on the beach from Owhiro Bay. In New Zealand the Queen's Chain is a strip of public land along beaches and beside rivers, that allows access to the water even where private land might seem to lay claim to the beach.\n\nMy impressions\n\nAs the tour wore on I became more and more aware of what a privilege it was to be taking part in it. Terawhiti Station is enormous, rugged and beautiful.\n\nThe wind turbines are enormous, sleek and beautiful. There are so many of them, and they stretch into the distance on the ridges of the folded hills.\n\nIn retrospect it seems obvious that they require a huge amount of infrastructure. All the roading that had been created so they could be trucked into place was impressive. There are even spare turbines in one storage spot along the route we took.\n\nI count myself lucky to have seen the seals. I have seen them before, at Red Rocks and also when my partner bought me a brief helicopter tour of the South Coast for a birthday once. But every time we can enjoy the creatures around us is special.\n\nI was thrilled to have learned about the gold mining past and the M\u0101ori settlements, and enjoyed the isolation, the rugged terrain, and the beautiful warm still day with part cloud, part sun, and views my iPhone didn't do justice to. The other people on the tour were interesting and pleasant, and the driver was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.\n\nA bonus of the tour was the opportunity to look back at Brooklyn Hill from the western side. I've looked down on this section of coast from Te Kopahou Reserve, and from above on our helicopter tour, so this completed my mental image of the area.\n\nPEDAL CHARGER: Gadgets you use while cycling, such as for GPS, can quickly run out of juice, so wouldn't it be handy if all your pedalling could help charge them up? The Atom does just that, charging an iPhone 1% for every two minutes of pedaling. It easily attaches to the axle on the rear wheel and charges devices via a USB cable or by powering its own battery that can later be used as an external battery for your phone. Because it's siphoning off some of the energy from pedalling it adds a slight drag to the bike \u2014 about the same as a 0.3% gradient, and uses internal gearing to maximise efficiency. That beats draining your phone just to track a ride. Gizmodo.\n\nGET THE SUNSHINE IN: IBM are working on a High Concentration Photovoltaic Thermal system that can make the most of the solar energy it concentrates. Usually solar collectors are limited in how much sunshine they gather as otherwise they'd simply get too hot. This highly efficient and low cost collector will be cooled by water that will remove some of the heat and could itself be used for air conditioning. The system uses a large parabolic dish made from many mirror facets and photovoltaic chips, while a tracking system determines the best angle based on the position of the sun. It converts 30% of collected solar radiation into electrical energy. The cooling system is inspired by the hierarchical branched blood supply system of the human body. Engadget.\n\nPATCH GAMES: One child in 50 is likely to have a problem with amblyopia where one eye is weaker than the other. The traditional treatment is to have the child wear an eye patch for months. Researchers at McGill University think a better option may be to have the kids play Tetris \u2014 it worked in a small study with 18 adults. They had volunteers wear special goggles for an hour a day while playing Tetris. The goggles allowed one eye to see only falling blocks, while the other eye could see only the resting blocks. After two weeks their vision had improved more than that of a control group. I'll bet most kids would prefer the video games to the eye patch. BBC.\n\nFLYING THUMBS: It can be hard work typing on a tablet's touchscreen keyboard. After studying millions of English-language tweets that originated from mobile devices a team of researchers has designed a new KALQ keyboard layout optimised for typing with thumbs. After several hours of training novice users were able to reach 37 words per minute on the new layout \u2014 the fastest thumb typing speed ever reported. The layout puts most vowels by the spacebar, on the righthand side, and the most commonly used letters are clustered. Left handers can swap orientation, and key size can be changed to match thumb size. Several hours of training for typing on a touchscreen? That's dedication. GigaOm.\n\nBIG HEAD: Bike helmets are fine when they're on your head, but a pain to carry round when they're not. Carrera's foldable bicycle helmet has a flexible frame, elastic fitting system and adjustable side straps that adapt the helmet to the shape of the head. An included belt wraps around the folded helmet so it attaches easily to the bike frame when not wearing it. Now, if they could just find a way to also make it fold flat. Carrera.\n\nRIGHT LIGHTS: Light pollution is a huge waste of energy and money, damages our health and stops us from enjoying the natural wonders of the night sky. Unfortunately conventional sodium or mercury vapour streetlights contribute to the problem, scattering and leaking light in all directions. Now a team of researchers has an idea for LED streetlights that send a rectangle of light on to the street where it's useful. A special lens focuses the light's rays so they travel parallel to each other in a single direction, while a reflecting cavity captures any rays that escape. Meanwhile a diffuser reduces glare. Now they're working on a prototype that can prove the concept. Let's keep the skies dark. BBC.\n\nNO BOOM IN IRON: There are quite a few problems with fertiliser, one of which is its potential for use in home made bombs. Researchers at the Sandia National Lab found something that could help: mix in some iron sulfate, a waste product from steel foundries. They say that the new mix not only prevents the use of the fertiliser to make bombs, but also helps the fertiliser's performance by improving the pH of soil and increasing the levels of iron in food. It sounds like a simple way to do a lot of good. Technology Review.\n\nLIVING PRINTS: Researchers studying how the human liver works also need to test how drugs interact with it. Now they can print tiny livers for themselves. A 3D printer created by US company Organovo makes livers half a millimetre deep and 4 millimetres across that can perform most functions of the real thing. The printer works by building up layers of hepatocytes and stellate cells and also adds cells from the lining of blood vessels. The miniature livers can be used for studying the effects of drugs, but the company has a goal of creating full size livers suitable for transplant. And perhaps being able to print tiny livers for testing can free up more of the real thing for transplants. New Scientist.\n\nTHE ENEMY WITHIN: Pancreatic cancer is very difficult to treat, partly because of the way it spreads to other parts of the body. US biologists may have found a way to defeat it though, by using genetically modified bacteria to deliver radiation directly to the cancer cells. Studies in mice have been very successful. The technique uses a bacterium, modified with the radioactive compound rhenium-188, that can burrow inside key immune cells. The researchers believe that after further development and testing this technique could supplement standard treatments. Just point those bacteria the right way. Wired.\n\nGROWING DIESEL: We may have the University of Exeter to thank if we can fill up our trucks soon with diesel produced not from oil but from bacteria. The diesel produced by their special strains of E. coli bacteria is almost identical to conventional diesel fuel and the engines that run on it won't need any modification. The next challenge is to make the process commercially viable. Bacteria \u2014 so useful. University of Exeter.\n\nA MOTE IN THE MOUSE: Back in the day a computer would fill a huge room; now you often carry one in your pocket. Researchers at the University of Michigan are working on smart dust, with prototypes only a cubic millimetre in size. Their Michigan Micro Motes include sensors to monitor temperature or movement then send data via radio waves. Of course you'll be wanting to know if these microscopic computers need AA batteries. The idea is that they'd scavenge energy from nearby sources, perhaps via a solar panel or by exploiting temperature differences. Although this all seems more a fantasy than a practicality, the Michigan team has implanted a Micro Mote inside a mouse tumour so that it can report back on its growth. There may yet come a day when a magician can sprinkle a handful of dust and wave a wand to work miracles. New Scientist.\n\nSOAPY SAVINGS: Mosquitoes famously help transmit malaria \u2014 a big problem in some parts of the world. Hundreds of thousands of people die from malaria each year. That's why two students in Burkina Faso invented a mosquito repelling soap. Faso Soap, is made from karate citronella, and other secret local herbs. Who needs nano-stuff? Low tech can also save lives. Clutch.\n\nDID YOU SAY?: The Chinese Si-Rui brand cars are gaining voice recognition supporting Mandarin Chinese. Soon drivers will be able to us voice commands for the radio, TV and DVD player, media player and navigation system. For example, apart from just playing the next song, a driver may be able to say \"Search gas station\" to find the nearest place to fill up. Actually, it's the DVD controls that concern me. Nuance.\n\nEARTH AND WATER: Hydrophobic materials are usually made from thin polymer coatings that degrade when heated and are easily destroyed by wear. This reduces their usefulness in equipment for taking salt out of water or in steam-based power plants. Researchers at MIT created a new class of hydrophobic ceramics that can endure both extreme temperatures and rough treatment. That's an achievement because ceramics generally attract water, rather than repelling it. It's rare-earth oxides that do the trick. By fusing them into a solid ceramic form through sintering the result is materials with strong hydrophobic properties. Technology Review.\n\nTHE THINKING PHONE: We already control lots of devices with our brains \u2014 it's just that the signals pass through an intermediary such as fingers or voice box to do it. Now Samsung's Emerging Technology Lab want to let us be more direct. Their research involves a cap studded with EEG-monitoring electrodes. They've already shown that people can concentrate on an icon blinking at a distinctive frequency to launch an app and make selections within it, for example. Unlike traditional EEG monitors that can take nearly an hour to set up this cap takes only a few seconds as it doesn't require any gel. At this stage it's all very slow and clunky, but further research should help speed things up. It's good to see plenty of research going on around controlling devices by thought alone. Technology Review.\n\nTELL-TALE BREATH: Swedish researchers using a simple, commercially available breath sampler found they were able to detect up to a dozen different drugs, including methadone, amphetamine, methamphetamine and cocaine in the breath of testers. The analyser collects micro-particles from breath on a filter which is sealed and stored for later analysis. Later analysis using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry reveals the trace of drug use on the breath. It stands to reason that our breath can reveal what's gone into our bodies. Phys.org.\n\nSWIM TIMER: Serious sportspeople may aim to keep their hearts beating within a specific rhythm range while training. For those on dry land there are various gadgets available, but for swimmers it's another matter. It's not only waterproofing that's the problem, but that most devices may interfere with swimming. A Lebanese device clips to the forehead, just below swimming goggles to measure heart rate and keep track of laps and turns. The Instabeat device reads the temporal artery and displays a readout in the goggles. It weighs 30 grams and the rechargeable lithium-ion battery lasts for 8 hours. And conversely, this one may help the land-based athletes too. MedGadget.\n\nTHIRD ARM: Imagine you're an engineer out in the field working on unfamiliar equipment in an unfamiliar environment. There's a lot of potential for messing up. A robot arm could help, by relaying video back to base or from base back to you, by pointing out which parts to use, where to start or where items belong. The Mobile Repair and Operations prototype pairs with a smartphone and can overlay on the phone's screen guides such as arrows or signs. At the worksite a microphone, video and projector on the robot arm can be used to help the engineer with the job, or potentially guide them to safety in an accident. If the robot could also offer a hand that would be even more useful. BBC.\n\nWAVING WALLS: Rather than just sticking solar panels on the roof of a house one architect believes they could instead be incorporated in the walls in the form of fabric strips. At least one house in Germany has used this idea. The Soft House features a network of textile strips on the facade with integrated photovoltaic cells, generating up to 16,000 watt-hours of electricity. The strips can move with the sun and be angled to maximise shade in summer or light in winter. Fabric strips wouldn't immediately spring to mind as being able to withstand years of weather. Discovery News.\n\nBETTER BATTERIES: Australian researchers have found a way for electric vehicles to travel further on a charge. A material based on Germanium stores 5 times more energy and can carry a car twice as far on one charge as the batteries currently in electric vehicles. What's more the material is cost-effective, easy to synthesise and allows a battery to charge more quickly. What's not to like? University of Wollongong.\n\nDELIVERY DOG: Search and rescue is a hazardous job, especially in collapsed buildings. In fact there may be some places where only a robot shaped like a snake could reach. How to get the robot into place may still be a problem though, so why not send in the dogs? Researchers attached a snake robot via a harness to a trained recue dog and sent the dog into a collapsed training building. The dogs are trained to bark when they find a point of interest. At that time the researchers trigger the harness to fall off the dog and release the robot. The robot is then able to writhe and slither around, relaying video back to the rescue team. Now they need a robot dog to deliver the snake robot. BBC.\n\nSEND A ROBOT: All those huge wind turbines generating electricity are doing a great job, but they have to be inspected regularly and that's quite a challenge. Of course it's the ideal job for a climbing robot like the HR-MP20 that can run up the wind turbine and crawl out onto the blades. The little 4-wheeler works wirelessly, hanging on with magnets and can carry cameras, sensors and various inspection devices. The robot weighs 9 Kg and can climb at up to 13 metres per minute. Its radio control range is around 760 metres in line of sight. That's quite an inspection gadget. Helical Robotics.\n\nTOUCHING ROBOTS: Our skin is an amazing sensor, detecting even the lightest of touches. Matching that with an artificial skin that can detect touch, for robots, for example, is a big problem. Now researchers at Georgia Tech may be onto something. They built tiny arrays of around 8,000 transistors bundled together with nanoscale crystals of zinc oxide, a semiconducting material. These taxels produce electronic signals when subjected to a mechanical force such as a touch. They're about as sensitive as a human fingertip too \u2014 much more sensitive than previous approaches to the problem. Taxels: nice name. io9.\n\nTHE SPOKEN WEB: There are plenty of people who have no access to the Internet: even if they had a computer they still can't read and write. The Voices project in Africa lets users of specially created web content control it by speaking, listening to the page and by pressing certain buttons on their phone. The system can also push voice messages out to individual handsets, allowing for the creation of a voice version of Twitter called Tabale. One problem is that many languages, such as Bambara spoken in Mali, haven't been studied sufficiently for good voice recognition. Technology can bring huge benefits, but there's still so much research yet to be done. New Scientist.\n\nTHE QUIET TUK: In some parts of the world the 3-wheeled tuk-tuk serves as a taxi. Now Terra Motors in Japan are introducing an electric version that can travel 50 Km on a 2 hour charge while carrying several passengers. The Philippines plan to replace 100,000 of their petrol-powered tuk-tuks with electric vehicles by 2016. The electric vehicles are quieter and will help reduce air pollution. They look quite swoopy too. TechCrunch.\n\n]]> is up for auction\n 02 May 2013 00:33:30 +0000Miraz MacTips website, 13+ years old, is for sale. ]]>\n\nSometimes life changes happen suddenly.\n\nBack in March I took all the MacTips I (and a handful of others) had written between 01 January 2012 and 28 February 2013 and compiled them into a book I optimistically named A MacTips Sparkler, Volume 1, March 2013. Buy a copy for yourself.\n\nWhen I chose that title I was expecting to follow up over the next few years with Volumes 2, 3 4 and so on. I launched the book around 27 March 2013, a day or so before the Easter break.\n\nAfter a few days off, offline and at the beach, I sat down to work on Tuesday 02 April and thought Nooo, I really don't want to write another MacTip.\n\nThen I considered the idea of stopping MacTips, of never writing another one again, and a feeling of utter relief washed over me. After 13-some years of writing weekly (sometimes twice-weekly) Tips for users of Apple products it was time to change direction.\n\nMiraz Jordan is auctioning off her 13-year-old MacTips.info Web site, complete with nearly 1,000 posts. As of this writing, the price is at $3,400, which doesn't seem bad at all for that amount of content and a site that averages 30,000 unique visitors per month (with a peak of 105,000 visitors in January 2012), along with 350 email subscribers, 600 Twitter followers, 2,100 RSS readers, 400 YouTube channel subscribers, and 500 Facebook \"likes.\" The Flippa auction is slated to end on 7 May 2013.\n\nI've never sold a website before, though I've sold plenty of items on New Zealand's local auction website, TradeMe. It turns out the principles are the same: give it a clean, establish relevant data points, list with plenty of helpful information.\n\nThe first bid came in almost immediately, meeting the reserve price, and as I write several bidders are slowly ratcheting up the price. With a week to go I'm optimistic of earning a bit of very welcome cash. My budget's been extremely tight for quite a few years now and I'm looking forward to things easing.\n\nAnd with the 4 to 6 hours per week I'm gaining by not writing MacTips and looking after the site? My partner says I should take it easy and relax for a while, so I'm doing that.\n\nI'm also putting a bit more energy into another informational website I set up a couple of years ago: Run Spot Run is a site for people in Wellington, New Zealand who have dogs. It reviews local off-leash areas (and some enjoyable on-leash walks), and carries bits of news of interest to its target audience.\n\nMeanwhile, I continue to write my Tech Universe column for the NZHerald Online, 5 days per week. I am available though for part-time, casual and short-term jobs writing or training. Let me know if there's something I can do for you.\n\nSTICK TO IT: One problem surgeons have is how to anchor skin grafts so they have time to heal. Stitches and staples are useful, but cause their own trauma to the skin. And we all know that sticky dressings usually fall off if they get wet. A team at Brigham and Women's Hospital in the US took inspiration from a parasitic worm that lives in the guts of fish. They've created a patch that's covered with microscopic needles. Like the spikes on the parasite, the needles easily penetrate skin, but then swell up and lock in place. There's less trauma, and the patch is 3 times stronger than materials currently used for burns patients. Tests in animals have proven the patch a success. You'd think that would be handy for ordinary sticking plasters too. BBC.\n\nTHE BIG PICTURE: The US military uses long-wave infrared cameras to detect humans at night by their heat signatures. That works well, but the cameras are so large they have to be mounted on vehicles and they're costly too. It would be much more convenient if individual soldiers could carry them. That may soon happen though as the latest prototype LWIR camera has a sensor whose pixels are so small 12 would fit across a single human hair. The pixels are configured in a high-resolution 1280\u00d7720 focal plane array. The new cameras are relatively cheap, but their perfomance is comparable to that of the larger imagers. That's one more item for soldiers to carry.

A new microbattery from the University of Illinois manages both high power and high storage. The batteries can also recharge 1,000 times faster than competing technologies. The team have achieved this feat with a 3 dimensional microstructure for both anode and cathode. Now the obvious question: how long until these batteries are being implemented in our gadgets? University of Illinois.\n\nPILL POPPER: People may take too many prescription painkillers on purpose or by accident, and may die as a result. Students at Brigham Young University created Med Vault to help reduce such overdoses. Their pill container resists tampering and breaking and dispenses pills only on a schedule programmed in by a pharmacist. Patients must key in an access code to retrieve pills that are ready to be dispensed. Let's hope the pain's not bad enough to prevent them keying in the access code. Brigham Young University.\n\nYELLOW GOLD: From sulphur to plastic \u2014 a team at the University of Arizona has used a new chemical process to transform waste sulphur into a lightweight plastic that can be used to make batteries. Lithium-sulfur, or Li-S, batteries are more efficient, lighter and cheaper than those currently used. The new plastic is easy and inexpensive to produce on an industrial scale and makes use of a waste product from refining fossil fuels. The process adds an unnamed chemical to sulphur to polymerise it. Making waste products useful is always a good idea. University of Arizona.\n\nCARAVAN CLASS: The 8.5 metre 2014 Land Yacht travel trailer from Airstream is a very upmarket caravan. It uses luxury materials and Italian design in its 3 rooms. A bedroom, bathroom, living area and a hideaway galley kitchen provide enough room for 5 people to holiday or even live in. Features include hidden LED lighting, ducted air conditioning, a powered awning and a hidden storage area under the bed. Its look remain classic Airstream though. No need to rough it while caravanning. Wired.\n\nAGING ANTS: How do you track individual ants in a colony of thousands? With barcodes, of course. A team of Swiss scientists glued barcodes to hundreds of ants and recorded all their movements for more than a month. Then they used video to analyse the position and orientation of every ant twice a second. They also tagged ants with different colours to denote their age, which allowed them to see how ants undertook different tasks as they grew older. Pity the lab technician who had to glue on all the barcodes. Ars Technica.\n\nHOUSING SPHERES: If you're building habitations in extreme environments you can expect that they'll be pretty unusual. At The Ekinoid Project that means spheres raised up off the ground and self-sufficient so they don't need infrastructure such as pipelines, powerlines and sewage systems. Each sphere would be around 10 metres in diameter and could be joined to several other spheres to create a hub. At the moment the project is only in its early design stages, but it looks intriguing. And somewhat alien. The Ekinoid Project.\n\nTHE INNER ROBOT: In keyhole surgery it's very handy for surgeons to actually be able to see what they're doing. One technique may be to use tiny robots. But the problem lies in how the robots can crawl around on the slippery surfaces inside the body. Researchers from the University of Leeds used a treefrog as their model when they created the feet on their robot. The feet use capillary action to adhere to even wet surfaces, but on a scale of a thousandth of a millimetre to gain enough adhesion. Their prototype robot is still too large to be used in surgery, but they aim to sort that out soon. Caution: robots inside. University of Leeds.\n\nA SUNSHINE BUZZ: South Korean researchers have created a hybrid energy harvester using silicon nanopillar solar cells and piezoelectric generators. Since it captures solar and sound energy simultaneously, it can still generate power even if one source is absent, for example when the sun's not shining. The hybrid harvester could be particularly useful in moving vehicles. Keep that engine roar up. PhysOrg.\n\nBIG DIFFERENCE: The world's oceans receive 80% of the solar energy that arrives on our planet. To make use of some of that energy China may soon be home to the world's largest Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion power plant, supplying 10 megawatts. The OTEC system takes the natural temperature difference between surface and bottom of the ocean in tropical regions and uses it to create power consistently 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This plant's still a fairly small pilot though. A fullscale 100 megawatt OTEC plant could produce the same amount of energy in a year as 1.3 million barrels of oil while decreasing carbon emissions by half a million tons. All by exploiting a difference in temperature. Lockheed Martin.\n\nWATER YOUR PHONE: The MyFC PowerTrekk, developed at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, uses ordinary water and connects via USB to extend battery life for devices of up to 3 watts. What's more the water doesn't need to be completely clean, and can be fresh or salt water. The charger is both a fuel cell and a portable battery, providing a direct power source as well as a storage buffer for the fuel. Inside the unit is a small recyclable metal disc. When you pour water onto it hydrogen gas is released and combines with oxygen to convert chemical energy into electrical energy and provide between 20% and 100% of a battery charge. Now that's a charger to keep around. KTH Royal Institute of Technology.\n\nFORK IT IN: The HapiFork may help you eat better, by counting bites and vibrating to alert you when you eat too quickly. Studies have suggested that eating more slowly improves digestion and helps control weight, so if you take more than one mouthful every 10 seconds the fork lets you know. The fork synchs with a smartphone and also has a web dashboard. The electronics it needs are housed in the handle and can be removed before washing. Data from test users shows people take about 70 fork bites per meal. Reduce portion size too. CNN.\n\nSENSITIVE ROBOTS: Nobody want to be roughed up by a robot, so researchers at Harvard have developed a very inexpensive tactile sensor for robotic hands to make them more sensitive. The TakkTile sensor is intended for commercial inventors, teachers, and robotics enthusiasts. The sensor adds a layer of vacuum-sealed rubber to a tiny barometer that senses air pressure. Added to a robotic hand, it helps pick up a balloon without popping it, or pick up a key and use it to unlock a door. The sensors can be built using relatively simple equipment and standard fabrication processes. This is particularly important for medical and personal care work too. Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.\n\nKEEP MOVING: The Karma Chameleon at Concordia University in Canada is working on interactive electronic fabrics that harness and store energy directly from the human body, then use the power to change the visual properties of the garments. The project weaves electronic or computer functions into the fibres which consist of multiple layers of polymers. It's not yet possible to manufacture clothing with the new composite fibres but the designers in the project are creating conceptual prototypes. For example, garments could change their shape and colour while being worn, or capture the energy from human movement to charge a smartphone. Now hook it up to mood detectors so your clothes can reflect how you feel. Concordia University.\n\nRUN IN PLACE: While you play video games your character may run, walk, jump and be incredibly athletic. Meanwhile, chances are you're sitting comfortably. Virtuix hope to change that with their omnidirectional treadmill, a natural motion interface. The Omni is a small octagonal platform, with an enclosing rail above it to hold you in place. As your onscreen character moves, so do you. You can walk and run in any direction, stand still, look around and generally be more engaged in your character. Add a VR headset for the full immersive experience. That could be a whole more fun at the gym too. Virtuix.\n\nCOOLING STEAM: If you have an electric car then you may have to trade off heating and air conditioning against the distance you can travel on a battery charge. Researchers at MIT are working on a new thermal battery that can be used for either heating or cooling. Water is pumped into a low-pressure container, evaporating and absorbing heat in the process. Then an adsorbant material pulls water vapour out of the container, keeping the pressure low so more water can be pumped in and evaporated. That process keeps the passengers cool. Or the heat that's released from adsorption can be used to warm up the passenger compartment. Eventually the system needs to be recharged, which could use heat from a solar water heater, and happen while the battery's charging. A steam engine in a car, eh? Technology Review.\n\nLIVING ON THE RIVER: The WaterHouses are smart, 34 eco-friendly apartments in Hamburg, Germany. They're actually built directly on the Elbe river, connected to shore by footbridges. A building control system provides a touchscreen to individually adjust heating and cooling, while heating and hot water come from a geothermal heat pump system and solar thermal elements in the facades. And when the river floods, do they rise with the tide? WaterHouses.\n\nLIVING ON THE ROAD: The Kiwi designed Romotow isn't your ordinary caravan. It features an aerodynamic shape and plenty of glass, and is lightweight for added fuel efficiency. Its big point of difference though is that the main body is contained within a shell. The inside portion with the indoor living area can be swivelled by 90 degrees, leaving the outer shell as a covered outdoor area. Unfortunately the caravan's still only a design awaiting a protoype but it would be great to see these on New Zealand's roads. Romotow.\n\nPICKABOT: Industrial robots are superb at tirelessly repeating the same action over and over without change, for example in welding parts. But Industrial Perception are aiming to give robots the ability to make some decisions for themselves, for example, picking a particular object out from a pile of many objects. Their robots use multiple 3D sensors and engineered algorithms to carry out assigned tasks. The robots start by creating a real time digital 3D model of the scene. Then they search for a specific shape by fitting a 3D mesh of the desired object over the shapes in their field of vision. Finally the robots act on the object, perhaps picking it up and moving it. They may be slower than a human worker, but can work without breaks and without tiring. No smoko for robots. Singularity Hub.\n\nCommander Chris Hadfield is definitely someone to follow on Twitter. He frequently posts gorgeous photos of Earth from the International Space Station. Now he has a video showing us how he goes about taking those photos: fleeting glimpses of our changing world that has galvanized a vast and diverse audience of space-lovers.\n\nHOT SLIME: The BIQ House in Hamburg runs on algae. The facade of the building includes 129 bioreactors containing microalgae that generate biomass, provide heat and offer some soundproofing. An energy management centre harvests and stores solar thermal heat and algae to to create hot water. That's one building where the green slime stays. Daily Mail.\n\nTHINK IT SO: Fingerprints or iris scans may be used to protect important data or facilities, but such systems are slow and expensive. Researchers at UC Berkeley may be able to create a low-cost and fast way to use thoughts for computer passwords. In tests they had people wear a low-cost Neurosky MindSet that connects via Bluetooth. Test subjects were given a task such as imagining singing a song of their choice. The distinct brainwaves were enough to authenticate users on the computers. Now that would have to be easier than remembering hundreds of passwords, but how does it handle tiredness or the influence of medication? UC Berkeley.\n\nPHONE IT IN: Smartphones can do a lot of clever things, but how about reading fingerprints, scanning irises and identifying a face? AOptix has hardware and an app that turns an iPhone into a mobile biometric reader. A special case around the phone collects fingerprints, while the phone's camera is used for iris scanning and facial recognition, and the built-in microphone collects recordings of the voice. The user can add notes and email data back to base. This isn't for the general public though and is likely to be used by government agencies. That's a lot of power in a small device. Wired.\n\nSMART READS: Have a reading assignment for your studies? Maybe you diligently read the whole book, or perhaps you flick through a few pages, or maybe you never even open the book. Beware the power of ebooks: your lecturer may know just which pages you have and haven't read, what notes you made or where you failed to highlight key parts. CourseSmart technology allows lecturers to track the progress their students make through digital textbooks. It collects data and then creates an engagement index for each student that can highlight factors such as how often the student opened a particular textbook. On the other hand, it won't know if a student makes notes on paper or in a separate computer file. The New York Times.\n\nA LONG VIEW: A camera featuring a low-power infrared laser beam and superconducting nanowires can tell when a single photon has hit. With that information it can create high-resolution 3D images from up to 1 Km away. The infrared capability means the camera detects a wide variety of different items, like clothing, that don't normally reflect laser beams well. The camera could perhaps be used to scan a forest from a plane, or scan the ocean floor. One problem is that superconductors have to be cooled to a few degrees above absolute zero, so this won't be a handheld gadget any time in the near future. 3D from a single camera isn't bad. Wired.\n\nIN A SPIN: E-Volo's VC200 is a two-seater volocopter that should soon be granted a provisional airworthiness certificate. The developers aim for a flight time of more than 1 hour, and a speed of more than 100 Kph. The minimum flight altitude is around 2,000 metres. The electric Volocopter is a vertical takeoff and landing craft that uses many propellers placed within a circular frame above the body of the craft. The whole craft broadly resembles a helicopter without a tail. That looks like a fun way to fly. E-Volo.\n\nON THE GAME: The Reactive Grip from Tactical Haptics is a device for gamers that brings a more realistic sense of using weapons during a game. Slider bars in the handle move as the player uses various weapons in a game, for example simulating the kick of a gun or the resistance of fighting with a sword. The system also has potential for sportspeople and surgeons. The developers hope to fund developer kits later this year. It seems slow going with making interactions with virtual worlds feel more realistic. Road To VR.\n\nHANDS FREE: One US man who lost both hands after a vehicle accident now has bionic hands he can control directly or through an iPhone app. The i-Limb Ultra Revolution hands from Touch Bionics have 5 individually powered fingers, including a fully rotatable thumb. The app lets him choose from 24 different types of grip patterns. He can now easily pick up a pen or a lolly, use an electric drill, play pool or shake hands. Prostheses have made huge advances in such a short time. CNN.\n\nDON'T HANDLE THE FRUIT: Fingerprints are still a really useful tool in crime fighting, but one area where they haven't been used is with food. It's pretty tricky to lift a print from porous surfaces like those on fruit and vegetables. Forensic scientists at the University of Abertay in Dundee modified a substance known as Powder Suspension and were able to lift high quality prints from onions, apples and tomatoes. Which goes to show that criminals should stick to their crime and not take breaks for snacks. BBC.\n\nPLANE WORRYING: A commercial airline pilot and IT security consultant recently gave a talk that showed an Android phone with a special app could take control of a plane. The transmissions between an aircraft and the control tower aren't secured, so he used them to demonstrate the hijack possibilities on a virtual plane. What's next? No taking phones on planes? Net Security.\n\nANY OLD BITE: Snake bites, bee stings and many other things can fill your blood with venom. So how can that venom be removed? The answer may lie in a nanosponge invented by researchers at the University of California. The nanosponges are made of a biocompatible polymer core wrapped in a natural red blood cell membrane. In tests with mice the nanosponges lowered mortality rates to around a half or even a tenth, depending on when the nanoparticles were injected. This means the nanosponges could be used as a generic therapy for toxins, rather than the current method of using specific remedies for specific bites and stings. Perhaps that could eventually mean an over the counter kit travellers could carry for emergency use. U-T San Diego.\n\nVISIBLE BRAIN: Researchers have problems studying the brain because they simply can't see through the lipids or fats that surround each cell. Instead they have to slice a brain into sheets only a fraction of a millimetre thick and study each sheet separately. In the process they may sever vital connections or introduce deformities. A new technique from Stanford University called Clarity uses a hydrogel to replace the lipids that hold everything in place. The result is a brain that is transparent to light and permeable to molecules that can act as markers. Researchers can now study the brain or in fact any organ much more easily. It's just a pity techniques like these can't be used on live brains. io9.\n\nLIT UP BRAIN: US researchers used tiny devices containing LEDs the size of individual neurons to activate brain cells in mice. The LEDs caused the mouse brains to release dopamine, a chemical associated with pleasure. The LEDs, thinner than a human hair, were housed in a fibre implanted deep into the brain, so the mice were free to run around, go through a maze or run on a wheel. The researchers used the LEDs to reward the mice for specific behaviours. The devices may be used in future to learn more about the brain or perhaps for pain control. And eventually, we'd guess, may end up in the same markets as illegal substances. Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.\n\nLIGHT WORK: More than 19% of the world's electricity consumption is accounted for by lighting. A prototype tube LED from Phillips could bring huge savings of both money and electricity because at 200 lumens per watt it's twice as efficient as lights currently used in offices and industry. Philips expects the light to go on the market in 2015. Save even more by installing windows and skylights too. BBC.\n\nKIDNEY EXCHANGE: People whose kidneys fail may need to wait a very long time for a donor organ. A team at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston achieved a breakthrough in growing a new functioning kidney for a rat. They used a collagen scaffold made from healthy rat kidneys and a wash of human stem cells in a bath of oxygen and nutrients. The kidneys grew and were shown to function in a rat, although only at 10% efficiency. This approach could eventually lead to human kidneys being grown from a recipient's own stem cells, based on kidneys from a pig. Which would change a great many lives, if it's ever actually achieved. New Scientist.\n\nBABY PRINTS: Prenatal sonograms give those expecting a baby an exciting glimpse of the new life within. But what if those parents are blind? One Brazilian industrial designer solves that problem with 3D printing. Sophisticated programs take the sonogram data and turn it into a simulation or a life size printed model. The simulations are useful to doctors who may be able to discover things like a cleft lip or Downs Syndrome. The 3D models make it possible for visually impaired family members and friends to appreciate the fetus. A full model of a fetus at 12 weeks costs around $200. Let's hope those costs can be reduced. Tech Page One.\n\nLIE BACK AND PEDAL: Electric bicycles are one thing, but Outrider USA makes recumbent electric trikes that can travel at up to 65 Kph. Choose between pedal only, electric only, or pedalling with electric assist. Range is up to 265 Km if you do some of the work or 175 Km if you don't. The Lithium Polymer battery charges from 0% to 100% in 180 minutes. It looks like a nice ride. Outrider USA.\n\nREMEMBER THE CHARGE: While older batteries had an annoying memory effect caused by incomplete charging or discharging, lithium-ion batteries don't. Or so we thought. Scientists have now found that in fact LiFePO4 batteries, such as those used in electric vehicles, can suffer the effect too. The good news is that the effect is tiny and can probably be counteracted in the software used for managing the battery. The last thing we need is for expensive electric vehicle batteries to run out after a brief trip to the shops. PhysOrg.\n\nSWIPE THAT: Fujitsu Laboratories are working on a new user interface that detects finger positions and gestures so you can interact with real world objects such as pieces of paper and books. A camera and projector together detect fingertip position, while a processor compensates for potential errors like those caused by curved pages in open books. That means, for example, that you could select part of a document with your finger and automatically capture the data into your computer. Tap or swipe to turn the page?

Construction is to start early in 2014, with observations starting in 2021. As one of the largest optical telescopes in the world, it should be able to observe light from 13 billion years ago and track extrasolar planets. That's a particularly huge telescope to have on the ground. New Scientist..\n\nPATCH PERFECT: Many people need to monitor their health closely, perhaps after a stay in hospital. The Bio-patch sensor is a skin patch that's as thin as a piece of paper. It's inexpensive, versatile and comfortable to wear. The patch measures bioelectrical signals through the skin. Exactly what it measures depends on where it's worn: it measures electrocardiography on the chest, but brainwaves on the skull. On the forearm it tracks muscle response. The wearer can analyse the readings in their smartphone, or data can go straight to a health worker for professional analysis. There's a tiny battery in the patch, which is equipped with wifi too. KTH The Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.\n\nVIDEOS BY NUMBER: Have you been watching videos online? If they were smooth and easy you can probably thank the data centre hosting the videos for using redundancy, data distribution and cueing techniques. Any individual video is likely to be cut up, duplicated and stored across different discs to help create a smooth and unbroken experience. But that approach also uses a lot of electricity. A new technology called network coding may be able to reduce both redundancy and power draw. Rather than storing copies of videos, the system uses algorithms to transform the data that makes up a video into a series of mathematical functions. Devices can then use the functions to compensate for missing portions of the data. There's logic in that. Technology Review.\n\nWORD SHAKE: If you have to spend a while on a treadmill perhaps you'd like to do some reading at the same time? It's not easy though as your head bobs up and down. Engineers at Purdue University have created ReadingMate to solve the problem. The system adjusts text on a monitor to counteract the bobbing motion of a runner's head and allows them to read normal-size text on a small monitor mounted in front of the machine. Because our eyes already try to compensate for the movement the system can't just move the text in synch with the head, so an algorithm handles the calculations. A system like this could be helpful for pilots or people operating heavy machinery to compensate for turbulence while trying to read from a display. Meanwhile, maybe an audio file is a better choice.

The cleaner operates at 48 decibels for up to 100 minutes on a charge. Voice control's a handy feature. FarEastGizmos.\n\nHOME PRINTER: A team of architects in Amsterdam has a 3D printer that's 6 metres tall. They're planning to use it to print a whole canal house from different types of plastics and wood fibres extruded through a flexible tube. The architects draw their plans on a computer and feed them to the printer. The printer will first create exterior walls, followed by ceilings and individual rooms, then finally furniture. The pieces will then be assembled on site. This project is an experiment to prove the concept, although the cost will likely be more than for a conventional house. And the great thing is it's easy to produce scale models beforehand on a regular sized 3D printer. Let's just hope it can work with plastics produced from renewable sources.

{"text":"How The Kilogram Itself Put on Weight\n\nDon't trust your weighing scale too much, it may not be functioning as punctual as it should be. It turns out the kilogram itself has gotten fatter over the years. The official piece of metal representing the kilogram gained weight because of contaminants building up on its surface, researchers discovered.\n\nIn 1875 a match box-sized piece of metal was pointed out as the official weight of the kilogram. 40 Replicas of this weight were distributed around the world, to globally standardize mass. But the piece of metal hasn't stayed the same, researchers from Newcastle University discovered. They published their findings in this months journal of Metrologia.\n\nAlthough the metallic kilograms were especially shaped as a cylinder, with few surface areas to collect dirt, hydrocarbons did settle on the metal. The problem is that each replica is probably contaminated differently, destablizing the global standard.\n\nBut we can fix this, the researchers point out. With a mixutre of ultraviolet light and ozone the metal can get cleaned and brought back to its original weight.\n\nIs this big news for people that are detecting extra christmas kilo's on their balance? Not really, we are only talking about 100 micrograms, you won't even be able to spot that difference on your scale. But the micrograms do have an important impact on the weight of things like radioactive materials. So it's definetely time to give the kilogram a suntan."}

Nice metaphor, but this is nowhere near academic worthiness. Mere exposure to violence does not account for enough variance in violent behaviors. Applying a disease model to violent crime or violence oversimplifies the phenomena and discredits the vast archive of criminological research on violence that has been established.\n\n'People often don't have an answer why violence goes up or down.

{"text":"Listen\n\nClick the play button above to listen now. A full text transcript is available.\n\nSue Nelson:Hello, I'm Sue Nelson and welcome to the Planet Earth podcast. Today we've got a touch of James Bond style science and details of the first ever map showing which UK power grids are most at risk from GM magnetic storms.\n\nKieron Begon :Our map is basically a very simple representation of the UK power grid and what we do is we use the geology of the UK, because that's the controlling factor actually, to try and figure out how the electricity flows between one part of the UK and another when there is a very large geomagnetic storm.\n\nSue Nelson:I'm at the University of Birmingham and you can hear the clock tower that's just ahead of me, and I'm outside the universities Monroe Sports Centre. Inside a group of scientists are piloting the equipment for an unusual experiment that's about to begin in just a few weeks time. Now, I gave you a clue there with the James Bond style science reference but we're not talking gadgets here - think back to the opening sequence of Casino Royale where Daniel Craig is 007 is chasing a man in Madagascar. It's a thrilling scene as the man leaps from a giant crane and then skids, jumps and somersaults across rooftops and buildings and in and out of windows. It was a stunning display of a recreational running sport called 'parkour', also known as free running. And inside this sports centre a parcel athlete is under scrutiny and all for the benefits of science. Let's go through then into the sports centre and the warmth, through the turnstile and towards where the action is. I will make my way through the hall - here we go, the Slater gymnastics hall and in we go and it looks they're having a discussion here about what exactly they're going to do.\n\nDr Suzanna Thorpe from the universities biomechanics lab at the School of Biosciences is one of the team doing this research. So, Suzanna, I think we had better begin by basically saying what are we doing here in a gymnasium with a parcel athlete?\n\nSuzanna Thorpe:We are trying to understand the locomotion of one of our closest living relatives, which is the orangutan, and also the locomotion of all of the apes and the common ancestor of humans and the other apes. And in that area we have had a big problem, traditionally, in that we know a lot about how they move around the forest. I've been out to the forest and spent a year recording the different types of locomotion they use but we have no idea about their energetic cost of how they move around the forest and the solutions that they find to problems of moving around the canopy. And what we're doing here is using the parkour athletes as an analogy for a large bodied ape moving around a complex environment. We're getting them to move around an assault course that we've made that they've never seen before and we're going to record their energetic expenditure while they're doing it.\n\nSue Nelson:It is quite an assault course. We're right beside a lovely...it reminds me of my school days, sort of, vault, wooden vault there. We're got some beams over in one corner, a trampoline at ground level in another corner, some asymmetric bars, some rings, parallel bars - I mean this is perfect for you really isn't it?\n\nSuzanna Thorpe:This is absolutely perfect because there are lots of surfaces that the parkour athletes will be familiar with outside in their normal world, but inside in our little locomotor assault course world there are different supports that they will never have seen and supports that we can make behave in a way that they wouldn't expect. So, for example, we have springboards that you would expect to bounce underneath their weight and if we put solid chocks underneath them they're doing to behave in a solid way.\n\nSue Nelson:Which is probably what these athletes are used to because they are more likely to be doing their feats and stunts on concrete, let's face it, not softly sprung gymnastic tailored floor.\n\nSuzanna Thorpe:That's quite true. Yes. So, the reason why we're doing the study is that orangutans and the other great apes move around the canopy of tropical forests and the branches there are very flexible underneath their weight because the animal is so large. So, flexibility or compliance is a really important problem for large bodied apes in the canopy. And here we have lots of supports that we can make behave like branches in the forest, we can set up the assault course so that it's very complicated as moving around a forest canopy would be and we confound how the support behave. So, we can have supports that appear to be stiff that we make compliant and supports that are quite compliant that we actually make to behave in a stiff way and mimics the challenge that a large bodied ape would face moving around the canopy when they have to look ahead of them and judge how the supports available to them are going to behave without being able to test them.\n\nBrendan Riley:The way I would do it to get the best swing is I would jump off them backwards and reach one arm up, swing to the other side and as I get to the end point swing that one arm back down and then land.\n\nSue Nelson:Now, the athlete that's helping the scientists is Brendan Riley from EMP Parker. Brendon, how difficult is it to do, because the professionals, including yourself, they make it look very, very easy, and I suspect it's not.\n\nBrendan Riley:When you see them in the movies jumping from a crane to a roof top, it's obviously not where you start. We start on the ground, we learn how to roll, we learn how to fall over safely, because we do fall over a lot, but that's part of the fun and we gradually build up our skills and as you become stronger and more confident you move into more complex movements.\n\nSue Nelson:It's got certain moves, hasn't it - I've heard of 'tick tacks' and what have you. What are the basic moves?\n\nBrendan Riley:Yeah, there is a skill set, the founders of it would say that the moves aren't important and actually in France, where it came from, they try not to use the names of movements too often. They will use passemont (sl) meaning vaulting but they won't get too specific on what kind of vaulting, it's just get from A to B. A simple vault would be the cat pass, which is like a through vault in gymnastics. You have the tick tack, that's kicking off a wall to propel yourself higher or further. You have speed vault, that's a really efficient vault, just one handed and made famous by David Bell in his movie 'District 13'. Then there's a bunch of other ones which are less efficient but just as much fun and then the main thing we do is a precision, that's just jumping from one thing to another, or if you grab hold with your hands and that's called an arm jump.\n\nSue Nelson:How do you feel then about helping scientists here examine how primates move. I assume you're not insulted by this.\n\nBrendan Riley:Not at all. I love monkeys, I love apes, I wish I was a gibbon. I think I probably was in a previous life. It sounds weird but we look up to primates. We look at their movements and it's very inspirational. I know some guys who have actually been to different parts of the world just to see how the monkeys move and have been training with them. I think it's brilliant, it's great.\n\nSue Nelson:For you as an athlete, what's your advice for them in terms of modifying what they want keeping it in terms of what human beings can actually do and by keeping safe?\n\nBrendan Riley:What we're trying to do today is set up a course but not make it too obviously exactly what we want them to do. We don't want it to be too regimented; we want them to be moving quite animalistically. Like if you did set an ape free in here what would it do. We want to set out a rough course but we want them to move in their own individual style, get around how they want to, so we'll say get from this end of the room to this end of the room, touch that, that and that and that's about as much instruction as we will give them. I'm here today just because they don't necessarily know what some of the guys are going to be capable of, some I'm going to say, yeah, they can do this movement here and they can shimmy along that or fall off that with no problem.\n\nSue Nelson:How many parkour athletes then are going to take part in this experiment?\n\nBrendan Riley:Between 6 and 10 of my guys from Birmingham and there's also going to be a bunch of guy coming down from London.\n\nSue Nelson:In order to work out what the energy costs for the parkour athletes as they complete the circuit you need to take some measurements and that's where Dr Lewis Halsey comes in. He's a senior lecturer in environmental physiology at the University of Roehampton in London. So, Lewis, what are you going to measure and how are you going to do it?\n\nLewis Halsey:The primary thing we're interested in is the energy costs for our parkour athletes as they traverse the circuit as they use various bits of apparatus and we're going to measure that by measuring their oxygen consumption. So, we're going to put onto their backs, essentially, a portable oxygen analyzer, they will have a mask and the oxygen consumption of the person and the carbon dioxide output at the same time is measured by this mobile gas analyser which is strapped to their back. And that's all relayed to a computer. So in real time we can see the various costs of the various apparatus they're using. There's an added twist to this, which is at some points they may partly use an aerobic metabolic pathway and the analyzer can't pick that up because it's measuring oxygen consumption which is involved with aerobic pathways.\n\nSue Nelson:But, also, I would have thought that for athletes thought they're so fit that you wouldn't necessarily get much energy expenditure, not because they're not expending the energy but because they're used to it - it's not as much expenditure as, say, you and not wishing to be insulting, you or I if we did it.\n\nLewis Halsey:That's absolutely right. So, a parkour athletes - they're professional athletes, they're very, very fit and they can do lots and lots of these exercises before they get tired and that's really important. However, and similarly we would presume for these primates that are living in, sort of, arborial environments they will get tired sometimes, they will build up lactate and we have to be careful that it doesn't happen too much because then our method of measuring energy expenditure via oxygen consumption actually doesn't work.\n\nSue Nelson:What's lactate? Is that to do with when you hear lactose feel the burn? Is that the chemical that makes your muscles ache?\n\nLewis Halsey:That's a by product of at least partial anaerobic metabolism. So when we obtain energy from the substrates in our body so our fats or our sugar stores, if we don't use oxygen entirely for that process a by product is lactate and if we get too much lactate in our bodies we stop working so well, we feel that burn and we have to stop, but we can measure the extra oxygen that consumed by the body to deal with that lactate build up and so still get a good idea of the energy expenditure of athletes even though they're going to be working pretty hard.\n\nSue Nelson:How long is the project going to go on? How hard are you going to work your athletes?\n\nLewis Halsey:We're going to have an athlete a day, so they're going to be with us all day, so they're going to be pretty tired by the end of the day doing quite a lot but with lots of rests. We're going to start collecting the data proper this month and we will carry on until March.\n\nSue Nelson:Suzanna, it's an amazing experiment and I can't wait to find out what the results are going to be but there's quite an important reason isn't there for actually doing this project.\n\nSuzanne Thorpe:It's important for lots of different reasons. One from the perspective of understanding human evolution and the challenge that the common ancestor of all of the great apes would face and also our ancestors would face when they were partly arborial and partly moving bipedially on the ground and secondly from a conservation or an ecological perspective, if we understand a lot more about the challenges that orangutans face in the canopy and the solutions that they find to solve them and the energetic cost of doing so then we can better construct conservation strategies for them and they have of course been predicted to be extinct within ten years in the wild if we don't do something about it. So, finding the most effective way to structure a habitat or picking the most effective habitat for them for rehabilitance is a good way to help contribute towards their conservation.\n\nSue Nelson:Suzanna Thorpe and Lewis Halsey and parkour athlete, Brendan Riley, thank you all very much indeed. And I've been taking a few photographs as they've been walking around and setting up and thinking about how the course is going to go and you can see those pictures on our Facebook page. We will also keep you informed of how the project gets on in the future and don't forget you can follow the latest news from all of the natural world on Planet Earth online.\n\nScientists recently produced the first ever map of the UK that shows which regions of the power grid are most at risk during geomagnetic or solar storms. If eruptions from the sun are large enough these storms can disrupt satellites, communications and power supplies. Kerion Begon from the British Geological Survey helped produce and analyse the data for the map and he began by explaining exactly what causes these storms.\n\nKerion Begon:The sun can often erupt very large amounts of gas and magnetic fields known as coronal mass ejections, these are known as solar storms and if they cross space and they hit the earth's magnetic field then they interact together and they basically load up the earth's magnetic field of energy and that energy flows down from space to the upper atmosphere, say maybe 100 kilometres up above our heads and causes the gas there to glow slightly. And that's actually what gives the arura that you occasionally see in the UK.\n\nSue Nelson:Auroras are considered something that, particularly if you don't necessarily live in the north of Scotland, is particularly beautiful and rare thing to actually see, but these can be dangerous as well.\n\nKieran Begon:Yes, arura coincide with large scale changes in the magnetic field and magnetic field changes can induce electro currents into the ground. These are normally very small but when you get very large arura then the electric fields can be larger and the electric fields or currents tend to flow through the rocks in the ground, but if they become large enough they can then flow through into the power system to the transformers which are connected into the ground.\n\nSue Nelson:Approximately how many of these power station transformers are there around the UK?\n\nKieran Begon:There are approximately 600 at the moment and they stretch all the way from the very north of Scotland, all the way down to the south coast of England.\n\nSue Nelson:There have been occasions around the world, famously, one in Quebec where these produce more than just a brief power outage don't they.\n\nKieran Begon:Yes, a very famous incident occurred in Quebec in 1989 where a very large geomagnetic storm, the largest one in that decade, caused the transformer to trip in Quebec and then there was a chain reaction event all the way down the east coast of the US and a similar incident occurred in Sweden in 2003 and that was, again, a geomagnetic storm triggered a collapse in a transformer which then caused all the electricity in the country to fail.\n\nSue Nelson:So how likely is that to happen in the UK? It is a real possibility?\n\nKieran Begon:It's very hard to say how likely it is. At the moment we're just trying to identify where it might occur and that's what our map has tried to do. So, our map is basically a very simple representation of the power grid and what we do is we use the geology of the UK because that's the controlling factor actually to try and figure out how the electricity flows between one part of the UK and another when there is a very large geomagnetic storm. So, we've discovered that the extremities of the grid are the bits that are most likely to be affected by geomagnetic storms.\n\nKieran Begon:Yes, so the north part of Scotland is where the electricity tends to go into the grid and it will tend to flow out at the other extremities so as in Wales, in Norwich and in Cornwall.\n\nSue Nelson:Does that mean that the type of rocks in those particular areas, like Cornwall, like East Anglia are the same. What type of rock are we talking about?\n\nKieran Begon:Rocks of different electrical properties - so if you have a hard rock like a metamorphic rock or a granite, for example, it tends not to conduct electricity very well, so the electrical current will tend to flow the surface, it's much more likely to then flow into the power grid. Something like chalk or sandstone, which tends to be what the south of England is made from, is actually more porous, it tends to have a little bit more water in it and so the electricity will tend to flow deeper into the ground and that way it will avoid flowing into the national grid.\n\nSue Nelson:So you now know then which parts of the UK are most at risk because there's this map that you've produced and it's never done before. What can the power companies do about it?\n\nKieran Begon:One thing that they're going to do is install monitoring equipment, have certain ranges that are more likely to be effective and over the years they do know that geomagnetic storms cause problems but they've never been able to understand quite where the problems are. So this map will help them identify which regions they should have been installing equipment in and also which transformers they should be monitoring more closely for signs of damage, for example.\n\nSue Nelson:Now the sun famously has its 11 year solar cycle, I assume this affects the possibility in the number of geomagnetic storms that you get during these 11 years as well, so what part of the cycle are we currently in?\n\nKieran Begon:So we've just come out of a very deep low part of the cycle and we're moving through the middle part of the cycle and it will peak in 2013, around about mid 2013 and it tends to fall off the end.\n\nSue Nelson:So this in fact is perfect timing then? You've produced the map with two years notice effectively for the power stations to act on your information and your advice?\n\nKieran Begon:Yeah, that's correct. This has been driven from Government level and actually there's been a lot of concern in the last couple of years that national hazards to the UK have may be not been studied as much as they could have been, so this is all part of just looking at what natural hazards there are threatening the UK at the moment and solar geomagnetic storms are one of them we're looking at way of trying to understand alleviate those effects.\n\nSue Nelson:Kieran Begon from the British Geological Survey.

{"text":"Apropos of Dayo's earlier post on superbugs, the tiny microbes often referred to as \"extremophiles\" that scientists are studying for their crafty energy-processing skills, comes this piece from the Washington Post, which places the bugs at the nexus of another modern scientific challenge: the search for extraterrestrial life. The connection between biogeologists like Indiana University's Lisa Pratt and planet-hunters like Paul Butler seems obvious: if biogeologists are able to discover bacteria thriving on the radioactive decay of nearby rocks, without exposure to sunlight for millions of years, or microbes living in 120,000 year old ice in Greenland, who's to say there aren't similar critters in Mars's frozen soil, in Titan's hydrocarbon lakes, or in the vast sea believed to be underneath Europa's crust of ice?\n\nAstrobiology, a relatively new field of study, has the scientists who study extremophiles at the fore in the search for alien life. Admittedly, the chance of discovering another life form is by no means imminent. Astrobiology became a formal NASA program in the mid-1990s, spurred by the discovery of a meteorite from Mars that scientists initially believed to contain fossil remains.

And by madness, I mean madness. A recent study suggests that we have our big brains at a high price: schizophrenia. It comes down to the massive metabolism needs that our brains have. A team led by evolutionary biologist Philipp Khaitovich of the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology created an experiment to see how much genes that are involved in schizophrenia have evolved since humans split from chimpanzees.

The surgery replaced both limbs of a farmer who lost his arms in an accident in 2002. He lost both arms below the shoulder. From the Guardian article:\n\nChristoph H\u00f6hnke, a surgeon on the transplant team, said that the complicated procedure was completed without any unforeseen problems. It involved a team of 40 doctors, nurses and assistants working together, attaching one arm and then the other. \"The whole thing went according to script,\" he said.\n\nWith a surgery as complicated as this, though, many things can go wrong. The patient can reject the transplants, although close matching of blood and other immunological factors can minimize this, along with drugs that can dampen the immune system's reaction to foreign bodies. The bones may not completely graft together. It's like recovering from two severely broken arms on top of everything else.\n\nNerve regeneration has come a long way, however. The man who received a single arm transplant in 2006 was able to write with the transplanted hand within a year.\n\nI remembered that I had come up with a similar thing for standard deviation back when I was developing clustering algorithms that could use that value.

Data mining is used to learn and predict. This is applied to biology, neuroscience, fraud detection, national security, and even sports.\n\nSome of these are more successful than others. For instance, text mining has been very successful at extracting proper nouns (names, places, etc.) from text, and what might be considered the biggest success of data mining comes from text mining: internet search engines. But at the same time, text mining has been less successful at automated text summarization.

Because matter-antimatter reactions produce so much more energy than fusion reactions, those initial stars would more quickly reach their Eddington luminosity, or the upper limit of star brightness beyond which the star throws off its own mass due to excessive energy. This can be seen as a possible way that the first gases were dispersed across the universe, seeding later stars in the way that current supernovas do.\n\nThe first stars are hypothesized to have formed within reservoirs of dark matter, possibly providing the first \"lumpy\" features in the universe. As the stars grew in size, they accumulated dark matter through gravitation. As the dark matter accumulated at the center of the star, they began to annihilate, producing some of the first light in the universe."}

But a new Ocean Health Index throws that notion into the recycling heap.\n\nThe new index is based on a scoring system that evaluates ecological, social, economic, and political factors to determine the value countries extract for their coastlines. What makes the index so groundbreaking is that a country can receive a poor score not just for over-exploiting its waterways, but for failing to fully harness their economic potential. Dump too many pollutants into the water, lose a point. Net too few fish, same deal.\n\nNow, imagine if such an index were available for the air and land. Would it reframe how we think about, say, climate change? Imagine a score that punished a country for not maximizing its economic output by refusing to build a pipeline but also rewarded it for avoiding fracking. Such a score wouldn't just punish actions that harm the environment, but reward for making the most of the world's resources.\n\nAs you consider the implications of a global environmental health index, it's worth noting another bit of research that isn't all that it appears: The X-51A, the Mach-5 missile that hopes to revolutionize air travel, promising flights from the U.S. to London in a mere 45 minutes.

(image: Harold Agnew)\n\nIn 1943 the United States Army established a top secret research facility in Los Alamos New Mexico to build the world's first atomic bomb. It was the greatest assembly of the physicists the world had ever seen. Hundreds of the country's top scientists came together to win World War II by splitting the atom. Early morning on July 16, 1945, the Manhattan Project detonated Trinity, the world's first atomic bomb.\n\nMonday, May 06, 2013\n\nMany commuters can relate to the common plight of cracked windshields. The ride may be going smoothly until a pop signals a small crack in the corner of the windshield \u2014 a small crack that will soon radiate into a spider-like obstruction.\n\nRecently, researchers from Aix-Marseille University in Marseille, France published research on this topic, and they revealed a relatively simple relationship between the velocity of an impacting object and the number of radial cracks in the glass. Nicolas Vandenberghe and his colleagues found that the number of cracks is proportional to the square root of the impact speed for small steel projectiles hitting samples of plexiglass.\n\nFor example, quadrupling the speed of a small rock would double the number of triangular cracks emanating from the impact site. While this may provide little solace for an angry motorist, the research may prove useful in ballistics testing, forensics, and even protecting spacecraft from the dangers of the cosmos."}

I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet. Bio-inspired design was the theme of last year's Kids' Science Challenge. One of our winners, 5th-grader Olivia Smith-Donovan, took her inspiration from a maple seed, which rotates as it falls slowly to the ground. Her idea was to build a rotor-like device that could be used to drop relief packages into remote areas, sort of like a giant maple seed. Well, University of California professor Christopher Viney came on board to help make Olivia's idea fly.\n\nCV: Olivia's basic idea is sound, but what we've learned is that it's not necessarily going to work if you take a maple seed and just make it bigger. There are other designs which could be very good at slowing down the descent of something if you drop itWhat are we calling these? OD: Floppy Fliers. CV: Floppy Fliers.\n\nJM: The design that Olivia and Christopher came up with is like a miniature paper tree. You can picture branches fanning out of a paper trunk, acting like helicopter blades to slow the descent of whatever's attached to the Floppy Flier.\n\nOD: You fold up the paper. Well, you roll it up. ER: And I'm going to cut through all the layers of paper.\n\nGraduate student Emily Reed helped with the design and construction of the floppy flier.\n\nOD: Woo hoo! It worked!\n\nJM: The Floppy Flier really worked, descending gracefully to the ground. There are many other possibilities that could make it work even better. And Christopher Viney and Olivia suggest a few variables that you might try.\n\nCV: Is there a particular shape that might work best, is there a particular size that might work best. Perhaps the material we make it out of, perhaps the way the wings are twisted.\n\nJM: To see Olivia's experiments in action and to learn how to make your own version of the floppy flier, visit kidsciencechallenge.com.

Last check: 2007-10-22)\n\nThroughout the climb and from as high on the mountain as possible, they'll be transmitting audio updates and digital images over satellite phones.\n\nBradford Washburn is a noted cartographer, explorer, and photographer whose maps, including that of Mount Everest, have been considered definitive.\n\nThough no longer in the field himself, Washburn continues to promote and inspire the search for ever more precise knowledge of mountains by sponsoring (through the Boston Museum of Science) and collaborating with scientists like Roger Bilham and Fred Blume, and climbers such as the Alpine Ascents team on this year's expedition.\n\nIn 1997, USGS monitored seismic unrest at three Alaskan volcanoes and tracked eruptions at an additional three, as well as one in the Kamchatka Peninsula of Russia.\n\nNot only is this information critical to resource managers and emergency management coordinators during times of flooding, but citizens also use the information for making decisions about when and where to repair the dikes and levees on their farms, when to move their property to higher ground, and when to evacuate.\n\nThe USGS role is to provide integrated earth science information about land and water use in support of management and other policy decisions, develop analytical tools for improved decision-making, and enhance the understanding of how natural processes at the Earth's surface are affected by changes in climate or land and water use.\n\nA new frog discovered in Cuba is the smallest in the Northern Hemisphere and is tied for the world record with the smallest frog in the Southern Hemisphere, say a team of biologists from Cuba and Penn State.\n\nThe Hobby-Eberly Telescope will be commissioned in late 1997 at the McDonald Observatory in a remote area of western Texas known for having the darkest skies in North America.\n\nThis research was sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the Petroleum Research Fund of the American Chemical Society, and the David and Lucille Packard Foundation.\n\nDuring the academic year the science faculty meets weekly on Tuesdays in the Science Common Room to have lunch, to discuss matters of interest to the sciences as a whole, and to hear informal reports of faculty research and other science developments.\n\nThe goal of the Program is to promote and encourage continuing participation in science and science related studies by members of minorities that have historically been underrepresented in the sciences.\n\nOne of the primary purposes of Sigma Xi is to recognize graduating science students who have demonstrated exceptional ability and promise for further contributions to the advancement of scientific research.\n\nHowever appropriate that statement may be for 1997, it actually introduced the first annual review of notable scientific advances--for the year 1927.\n\nThis year, Science News celebrated its 75th anniversary We used the occasion to step back from the rush of new research findings and ponder the larger picture of where science is going and how it is changing people's ideas.\n\nScience Service's archive of photos from the 1920s to the 1960s, developed into an exhibit by the International Center for Photography in New York, has been displayed in New York, Washington, D.C., and the March 15 Science News.\n\nhe previous microgravity science mission flown in July of 1997 has yielded a rich harvest of science information that is still providing benefits to the National Interest.\n\nUSMP-4, scheduled for launch in November 1997, is the next step in our ongoing efforts to use the unique environment of space for scientific research, and to bring the benefits of that research to life on Earth.\n\nDuring the mission, you'll find extensive coverage of the science research being conducted aboard the space shuttle Columbia and why that research is important to the future of America and the world.\n\nThe third annual Organization Science Winter Conference (OSWC) continued the trend of creative excitement expected by (and demanded from) its participants.\n\nThis was followed by a more informal, and wider ranging, discussion at the \"fireside

of idea-generating interaction informed by practice (in the conference, on the ski lift, and during \"off-line\" discussions).\n\nFor the May 1997 tests, the rover was deployed to the Sunshine Flow, Lavic Lake, and an alluvial fan.\n\nThe rover started on the flow, the surface of which was covered with a desert pavement of basalt cobble underlain by approximately 1 m of aeolian silt, and traveled down onto the cratered surface of the playa.\n\nA variety of science targets (rocks) were to be examined with the spectrometers.\n\nHow does science affect ME?!?\" If these questions intrigue you, then this science symposium is for you.\n\nOne way to combat the rise of scientific illiteracy in society is to help students discover the myriad ways in which science impacts their daily

Following a week-long meeting of international experts, the World Health Organization's cancer panel has classified diesel engine exhaust as carcinogenic to humans, citing evidence that exposure is linked to a higher risk of lung and bladder cancers. Diesel fumes come not only from cars and buses, but also from other engines such as those in diesel trains, ships, and power generators.\n\nCancer\n\nDespite doctors' advice that omega-3 fatty acids can prevent a decline in cognitive function, a new study review suggests that taking omega-3 supplements may not offer any brain benefits at all. After analyzing data on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on the cognitive function of more than 3,500 older people, researchers conclude that people who took the supplements did not perform better on standardized tests than those on a placebo. The researchers do, however, stress that omega-3s may offer other benefits, such as protection from cardiovascular disease.\n\nFor those of us with a rather unhealthy addiction to our iPhones\u2014you know who you are, you texters-under-the-table, you\u2014Apple wants to help with their new \"Do Not Disturb\" app. When you turn the feature on, your phone will refrain from alerting you to calls, texts, or emails for a specified time, while still receiving them as they arrive.\n\nThere's no shortage of confusion surrounding those little blue, yellow, and pink packets of artificial sweeteners.

So is it better to just dump plain old sugar into your iced tea? In terms of relative risk, concludes one expert, artificially sweetened beverages are \"much less bad\" than the full-sugar beverages, given the nation's obesity epidemic.\n\nNatural fluctuations alone do not explain the warming of the planet's oceans, confirms a new study in the journal Nature Climate Change. So what can account for rising water temperatures in the last 50 years? Humans' greenhouse gas emissions. While attributing global warming to humans is hardly a new conclusion, this study conclusively separates the effects of natural climate cycles from changes caused by human alterations to the environment.\n\nBy now, the risks of tanning beds are widely known, which means that the bronze-look lovers among us have been turning to spray tans to get our glow on. But now spray tanning is coming under fire for containing the potentially cancer-causing chemical dihydroxyacetone (DHA), which may cause DNA damage. While more studies need to be done to confirm the risk, experts worry that the spray can go straight into the lungs, which means it's going faster into the blood stream.\n\nWho has the time\u2014or interest\u2014to slave away over a hot stove when it's so gorgeous out? That's why it's the perfect time to give this easy (tasty!) Couscous Tabbouleh Salad recipe a try. If you're unfamiliar with cooking couscous, it couldn't be easier: You simply pour the dry couscous into boiling water, turn off the heat, and let it sit for 10 minutes.

Researchers found that the organism shares characteristics with bacteria and eukaryotes (which includes plants, animals and humans). But it has genes that \"do not look like anything we've ever seen in biology before,\"says Dr. J. Craig Venter, a scientist on the project.\n\nIn the ocean, Archaea thrives under extreme conditions, where the water temperature hovers around boiling. Neither bacteria nor eukaryotes could survive these conditions.\n\nScientists believe their discovery could lead them to what they call the universal ancestor, the living cell that gave rise to life on Earth some 3.6 billion years ago."}

The brain-to-brain interface (BTBI) in the study allowed for a real-time transfer of meaningful action from one rat to another resulting in similar action from the rat receiving the signal. Watch the video of the experiment posted on YouTube.\n\nThe Duke study follows earlier experiments linking animal brains to machines through an implanted brain chip. The BTBI works in both directions. Researchers were able to show that the rats exhibited behavioral collaboration over time even though they were never together. BTBI also worked over long distance with researchers getting rats to collaborate, one located in Brazil and the other in Durham, North Carolina.

Just like the standard urinalysis done at your doctor's office or at a medical laboratory. Collect your urine in a cup. Dip the test strip in the urine for a couple of seconds. Then place the test strip on a color-coded mat that comes with the uChek application. The test strip changes color to reflect chemicals concentrated in the urine. Using the app take a picture with the iPhone camera. The app then analyzes what it sees and produces easily understood information in graphical format.\n\nA cautionary note. Don't do this test over an open toilet bowl. You don't want to have to fish out your iPhone should you drop it.\n\nChinese Scientists Improve Irrigation Technology to Use 50% Less Water\n\nIn arid farming areas drip irrigation is commonly used. But as the world witnesses growing droughts and freshwater scarcity, any improvement that reduces the amount of water needed to sustain growing crops can mean the difference between feast and famine.\n\nResearchers at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, in Wuhan, have developed trace quantity irrigation. The technology deploys control taps buried close to plant roots. The taps sense the rise and fall of moisture levels in the soil and then deliver water where needed. Films within the tap prevent reverse osmosis and clogging.\n\nThe team who invented and perfected the technology were able to successfully grow field and greenhouse crops in a variety of regions across China.

In tracking their activities the researchers were able to get wintertime measurements of the continental slope as far down as 1,800 meters (over 5,900 feet). That's when they discovered a densely saline waterfall descending to the deep ocean. The discovery fills a gap in climatologists' understanding of the role Antarctica's ice sheets and the surrounding Southern Ocean play in global climate.\n\nA Postscript\n\nToronto got a renewed taste of winter this week with two days of wet snow covering the city to a depth of 25-30 centimeters (over a foot). I normally wouldn't mention the weather but I can tell you these last few weeks with multiple snow dumps has made me want to hop back on a plane to Jamaica.\n\nThanks for continuing to visit this site to read my postings.

{"text":"Global research expedition to Everest set to depart Canada\n\nThe majestic Himalyas, with flags flying in the foreground at the Pyramid laboratory.\n\nOkanagan scientists lead trek to investigate high-altitude maladies\n\nCanada's international scientific expedition to Mount Everest is preparing to depart for Nepal on Sunday April 22. Everest 2012, a six-week, six-country research investigation into the effects of heart and brain blood flow and oxygen deprivation at high altitudes, will settle into the Pyramid Laboratory near Everest base camp for a six-week stay through the end of May.\n\nThe acclimatization process takes two weeks including the final leg of the journey, an eight-day walk to the remote lab, 5,050 metres, or five kilometres above sea level. The 25-member expedition will be weighed down by about a tonne of gear and equipment, though the burden will be eased by use of yaks, which will carry some of the load.\n\nThe researchers' progress during the Everest stay can be followed online, as team member and Okanagan College human kinetics professor Greg DuManoir blogs live from the lab. Follow the Everest expedition at: \n\nExpedition leader Philip Ainslie, Canada Research Chair in Cerebrovascular Function in Health and Disease and associate professor in the School of Health and Exercise Sciences at the University of British Columbia's Okanagan campus, says the scientific and medical experiments are designed to mimic the symptoms and outcomes that occur in heart and stroke victims and those suffering from sleep apnea.\n\nThe Pyramid Laboratory seen in winter.\n\n\"This is an opportunity to take healthy people and expose them to low levels of oxygen to see how their heart, lungs and brain adapt or maladapt to that exposure,\" says Ainslie. Hypoxia can severely decrease oxygen delivery to the brain. Reduced blood flow to the vital organs is characteristic of many chronic conditions.\n\n\"The research we conduct and the results we achieve have the potential to provide new insights into illness prevention and better human health,\" says Ainslie.\n\nThe pioneering expedition is expected to achieve a number of firsts in terms of scientific investigation and discovery.\n\n\"Low levels of oxygen occur in many pathologies,\" says Ainslie. \"Lung disease and heart failure occurs when we grow older. So it forms a way to understand how low levels of oxygen affect the body at an early stage.\"\n\nExpedition members will themselves be the test subjects for the experiments. Many of these were initially conducted as baseline studies at UBC's Kelowna Health and Exercise Sciences lab during March and April. Team members travelled from Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, U.K. and U.S. to take part in the procedures.\n\nSome experiments, like one measuring pulmonary arterial hypertension, involves invasive minor surgery to place arteriovenous shunts in wrist and neck arteries to measure acute hypoxia (oxygen deprivation) following ascent to high altitude.\n\nA physician and bioengineer from Duke University, North Carolina, were in Kelowna recently to conduct the baseline research and they are part of the Everest 2012 team and will supervise the experiment at Everest.\n\n\"This was the first time that these procedures have ever been done in Canada,\" says Ainslie.\n\nThe international contingent includes members from UBC's Okanagan and Vancouver campuses, Okanagan College, Duke University, University of Oregon, University of Sydney, Mount Royal University (Calgary), University of Cardiff, University of Otago (New Zealand) and University of the Netherlands.\n\nMembers of the team include researchers, sleep technicians, physicians, a bioengineer, and a hardware\/software specialist.\n\nLauren Ray of Nelson, B.C., a third-year Health and Exercise Sciences student at UBC's Okanagan campus, is excited to be part of the Everest excursion.\n\n\"I want to go on this expedition because I strive for success and to achieve at the highest level. Mount Everest is the best of challenges,\" says Ray. \"The physiology is ground-breaking work. I am stoked to be a part of it and I want to be immersed in that environment.\"\n\nThe Ev-K2-CNR Pyramid Laboratory at Everest base camp in the Khumbu Valley in Nepal is one of the only facilities in the world where all eight experiments can be conducted on members of the expedition, including invasive procedures and the study of sleep apnea, a common occurrence at high altitudes.\n\nThe expedition also plans to test a number of permanent high-altitude residents of mountainous Nepal, recruited from the Periche region, which is at 4,200 metres. Some have already volunteered for earlier experiments through collaborations with local physicians and scientists.\n\n\"We will compare results with some high-altitude residents who are born and bred at high altitudes over many generations,\" says Ainslie. \"So we will see how people can adapt over long and short terms.\"\n\nAinslie \u2013 an accomplished mountaineer who has been to Everest several times \u2013 says the conditions in the Himalayas offer the best and most cost-effective opportunity to conduct research.\n\n\"It is quite hard to do these experiments. It takes three or four years minimum to organize and get use of lab space up there,\" says Ainslie. \"There are only one or two labs at that elevation in the world. So we have use of this lab and that will maximize our productivity there.\"\n\nCanada Research Chair Philip Ainslie is seen outside the Pyramid Laboratory on a previous research mission to Everest Base Camp.

Understanding the past environment of Mars can help future missions \"follow the water\" in the search for alien life.\n\nDid fornicating Farm Girls boost the rise of atheism in Britain? (Epiphenom)\nThese days, Britain is one of the most atheistic countries around. It wasn't always like that, of course, but one of the problems with trying to work out how the present state of affairs came about is that there are very few statistics on religion the stretch back far enough.\n\nIn the 7 May 2010 issue of Science, Green et al. report a draft sequence of the Neandertal genome composed of over 3 billion nucleotides from three individuals, and compare it with the genomes of five modern humans.

{"text":"Today we have some really cool questions sent in by students. First we're going to look at electronic mosquito repellents, then at the validity of the Petition Project signed by over 30,000 scientists who say anthropogenic climate change \u2014 meaning caused by humans \u2014 isn't happening. Next, what are the real facts about whether or not you can get sick from someone sitting near you in class? Finally we're going to look at a couple of really interesting biological questions. One is the explosive issue of athletes of different races: Is it true that some races are good at some sports? \u2014 because it sure seems like it. And last, the urban legend that Einstein spent an extra month in his mother's womb, which is what made him so smart. Let's get started with an important question on health that affects people all over the world:\n\nHi Brian this is Rohan from the University of Cambridge. I'd like to know what your thoughts are on these new contraptions that claim to repel mosquitoes by using ultrasound. Has anyone tested them?\n\nYes, they've been tested, and no, they don't work. Field trials of electronic mosquito repellents conducted in ten different parts of the world where mosquito-borne malaria is a problem found no evidence that they repel mosquitos at all, and this includes those that are said to simulate the sound of a dragonfly's wingbeat. If you want to repel mosquitos, you've got to turn to chemical repellents. Since malaria is such a major cause of death in some parts of the world, a lot of money has been thrown at trying to solve this. According to the Centers for Disease Control, you can't do much better than DEET. Generally, synthetic repellents work better than natural repellents, although some plant-based compounds do work just as well. The old folk remedy of taking Vitamin B has been conclusively shown to have no effect whatsoever as a mosquito repellent. Citronella oil does work almost as well as DEET, but its shortcoming is that it must be reapplied every 30-60 minutes.\n\nThe best repellent of all, of course, is a properly closed mosquito net.\n\nHi I'm Eric From the University of Oklahoma and I was wondering what your take is on the claim that 32000 scientists supposedly refute Anthropogenic Climate Change.\n\nYou're referring to The Petition Project, which has collected over 30,000 signatures of people worldwide who, supposedly, reject anthropogenic climate change. (In a moment I'll explain why I say \"supposedly\" reject it.) Understand two things about this petition. First, 30,000 is only about 0.3% of degree holders in the relevant fields, so we can be pretty certain that the vast overwhelming majority of scientists have rejected this petition. Second, the actual petition is fundamentally flawed in that it requires the signer to agree to three unrelated points, any one of which is debatable:\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol is deeply flawed;\n\nHumans are not causing a rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide; and\n\nA rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide has beneficial consequences.\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol is a political question that has nothing to do with climate science itself, placing strangling restrictions on wealthy nations while allowing the largest producers of greenhouse gases, China and India, to continue to do so unchecked. Plenty of people disagree with this strategy, regardless of their feelings about the science. The second point, that humans are not causing an increase in global warming, does contradict the best science that we have, which shows that human activity is a factor. But there are natural factors as well. There are some global warming activists who are deeply concerned about climate change but who dispute the degree to which human activity contributes. The third point, that a rise in carbon dioxide is beneficial, is quite true in some cases. It's great for plants, for one thing. But the science shows that it will have other negative consequences that more than make up for the few benefits.\n\nSo how is the average person to respond when presented with such a schizophrenic petition? Many climate scientists may well feel conflicted about any one or two of these three points. There's no doubt in my mind that the petition was consciously designed to be ambiguous, and to give as many people as possible some reason to agree with one of its points. The best example is showcased on the Petition Project's home page, which shows the petition signed by the late Manhattan Project nuclear physicist Dr. Edward Teller. Teller was profoundly concerned about global warming, and proposed sprinkling aluminum dust into the atmosphere as a much cheaper way to address the problem than the disastrous Kyoto Protocol. He was pretty much the opposite of a global warming denier. His being showcased on their home page proves, to me, that their Petition Project lacks integrity.\n\nHi, my name is Erika. My question is: Kids at school worry every time someone sitting near them gets sick. Could they get sick, and what are the chances?\n\nThat's a great question, and an important one. Yes, you can potentially catch a cold from being near someone who has an active cold. The most likely way you'll catch it is through contact. We often don't realize how many things we touch: The doorknob to the classroom, the button on a drinking fountain, books and papers that might be passed around the room, the backs of chairs, etc. But guarding against this is the easiest thing to do. Wash your hands frequently. If you wash your hands throughout the day when you're near someone with an active cold, using soap and water or an alcohol-based cleanser, you have a very good chance of not catching it. Also be sure not to touch your face. The virus usually enters your body through your eyes, nose or mouth from your hand.\n\nBut there's one thing you can't control quite so easily: If that person is coughing or sneezing into the air, they put the virus into the classroom's air; and if that happens, then people nearby are indeed at much higher risk. Students with a cold who are actively sneezing or coughing should stay home. If they do come to school, they should cough or sneeze into a handkerchief or tissue. If they're just blasting away, then you may indeed have a problem, and not even a facemask will protect you from particles that fine.\n\nHey Brian, my name is Tate and I'm a high school student in Oregon. I've heard that all human DNA is practically identical. Is it true that certain racial groups are significantly more athletic than others?\n\nYes and no: Certain populations throughout the world do indeed tend toward certain sizes and shapes, but this doesn't have as much to do with their race so much as with other factors. A great place to study this is Africa, where we see immense diversity of body proportions among different populations, ranging all the way from the Bambuti Pygmies of the Congo whose men average only 137cm (4'6\"), all the way to the Watusi Tutsi whose men average 193cm (6'4\") with many over seven feet. Populations of the same race also differ geographically: Caucasian men in the Netherlands average 185cm (6'1\") but only 174cm (5'9\") in Romania; Asian men in Taiwan average 172cm (5'8\") but 163cm (5'4\") in Cambodia. Worldwide, women average slightly shorter than men. Since athletic ability is dependent on size more than any other physical characteristic, it's never going to be accurate to correlate race with athleticism.\n\nThere are two main factors that determine a given population's physical characteristics. The first is their haplotype, a group broadly defined by a certain mtDNA mutation that identifies them as a group. There are several dozen main haplogroups in the world's human population, each subdivided into more specific groups. They can be mapped, showing the oldest haplogroups originating in Africa, and then newer haplogroups appearing over thousands of years as populations migrated through Europe, Asia, and the Americas. mtDNA is passed on by the mother only, so each of us can be traced back to a genetic land of origin based on our haplotype. We share many common physical characteristics with other members of our haplogroup, wherever they live; including other traits that affect athleticism like relative lung capacity, tendencity toward obesity, and so on.\n\nThe second factor is often more dramatic, and that's selection pressure from marriage. Although the Watusi are probably the world's tallest population, they are not genetically different from the rest of the Tutsi who average only 170cm, a full 23cm (9 inches) shorter. The Watusis' height is solely the result of selective marriage. The true story of human genetic diversity is much richer and far more interesting than simple racial stereotypes, which are (a) wrong and (b) obscure the actual science. It's a fascinating area of study.\n\nHello Brian this is Zachary Nixon from Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. I am in grade 9 at Westwood Community High School, and I was wondering. My friend told me about Einstein and the reason he was so smart is because he had an extra month in his mothers womb, is this true or fiction?\n\nYou're really asking two questions here: First, was Einstein born a month late; and second, are babies born late more likely to be smarter?\n\nThe first question is not easy to answer. Einstein was born in his parents' home in 1879, when prenatal care was both rare and unscientific. It's unlikely that anyone made records of the date of conception or his mother's menstrual cycles, however gestation time was generally understood as 40 weeks. None of the Einstein biographies I looked at said anything about any prenatal records having been preserved, so it appears this claim about Einstein is an invented urban legend and is not based on any actual history. There have been fictionalized accounts in which Einstein gestated longer, but those are dramatic inventions and also not based on historical record.\n\nThe second question is easier. The relationship between gestation and intelligence has been extensively studied, and we've learned that there is none. The healthiest babies are born on schedule, as both premature birth and prolonged gestation can result in troubled births.\n\nAnd so, despite what your friend may have heard, the claim that Einstein spent an extra month in the womb, and was smarter because of it, is fiction.\n\nGot a student question you'd like Skeptoid to answer?

We find the same issue with gender differences; people who can't think for themselves believe that women and men are exactly alike, and that any differences MUST be the result of societal forces. The truth is, genetics play a significant role in many of the clusters of human interest and ability that we blame on racism, sexism, etc. Read the book I referenced above and then get back to me with the evidence for your refutation.\n\nSheldon W. Helms, San Ramon, CA July 23, 2010 8:58pm\n\nI don't have the poll data to back it up, but I think it's fair to say that the vast majority of NBA players didn't come from rich families. There are far too many variables to pinpoint the reasons for any observations in any sort of meaningful way. However, it is also silly to pretend that black athletes don't dominate sports in the US.\n\nOne potential reason is that years of selective breeding by slaveowners would likely weed out any weaker traits in their slaves. Chances are, if you were genetically prone to injury or could not work long hours, you died out. However, there is so much myth and legend revolving around slavery that hard data would be difficult to come by.\n\nBlack athletes are still vastly underrepresented in professional hockey, despite US players making a significant inroads into the NHL. There are a few very notable exceptions- Jarome Iginla and Dustin Byfuglien, to name two great ones. I suspect that this is more due to hockey not being embraced by many black men.\n\nOur country is far too touchy about taboo subjects to have any real data on the subject.\n\nDaniel K, Garland, TX August 28, 2010 9:25pm\n\nSorry, didn't see your reply till now Sheldon.\n\n\" provide any good evidence for a strong correlation between economic background and athletic ability\/prowess.\"\n\nThat wasn't the claim. The claim was about being employed in professional sports, not athletic ability itself.\n\n\"Your opinions are clearly based upon a post-Civil-Rights belief system that has impressed upon you the mistaken notion that people have to be equal in every way to be valued.\"\n\nDon't you tell me what my beliefs are based on. I get enough of that when I challenge black victimization claims. My opinion is based on observation and a discussion I had with a professor of sociology a few years back. Should I make assumptions about what your opinions are based on? I'm sure that would be fine speculation. See \n\n\"The truth is, genetics play a significant role in many of the clusters of human interest and ability that we blame on racism, sexism, etc.\"\n\nThe truth is that genetics play a significant role across the board, but not to the exception of cultural, environmental, and other biological factors. This is especially true on something as loose and scientifically meaningless as modern 'race' definitions. If you want to talk about sub-populations, go for it. Race is simply a stupid way to divide up humanity, even for sports. See \n\nBrandon, Falconer September 30, 2010 1:01pm\n\nYour argument that the environmental petition is invalid because it asserts three unrelated claims is a bit odd. If I was offered a petition with three points, two of which I agreed with and one that I didn't, I would NOT sign it. The idea that an educated scientist would ot down his or her name, especially when it related to such hotly controversial topics, is a bit silly. Surely the way its presented would mean that less people have signed it than otherwise might have if it contained only a single assertion.\n\nWhich is not to say that the petition is worth the paper it's printed on (if it is printed on paper). As you said, it represents only a tiny minority of degree holders in the relevant fields and I'm sure I remember hearing that a number of scientists had actually sued to have their names removed from it (though I might be thinking of something else).\n\nE.B. Joseph, Bangkok November 07, 2010 9:03am\n\nIncreased atmospheric carbon dioxide may in fact be detrimental to plants - especially crops. There is a line in the original article that suggests the reverse is the case - that increased CO2 is universally beneficial to plants. This may be because the lead article is a little out of date. Science ever moves on, producing new data that requires analysis and amendment of earlier hypotheses. Climate Science is a very responsible area in this manner. Errors are quickly revealed and adjustments made.\n\nLatest research is disturbing in that is suggests that it is only beneficial so long as temperatures are not coincidently raised and even then the question remains open. Many items that do react favourably are weeds.\n\nMore research is needed on this and I understand closed environments are being used in large scale experiments\n\nThe jury is definitely still out on this one. But if the conclusion should be that the increased CO2 is indeed detrimental, there should be no further argument as to whether in human terms it might be considered a potential pollutant - above certain close levels\n\nPhi, Sydney March 24, 2011 8:46pm\n\nThe problem with most input on the debate is not who has more bikkie points than the other.\n\nIts clear that nearly everyone who comments either has at least the odd climate or related paper in but doesnt comment much on the other and the over all analysts and finally, but 99.999 % of comment you will ever hear, that from the rank and file folks who just have a view.\n\nyep, we have a problem.

I swim and sued to swim a lot, and my observation is that black folks do not seem to be as interested in swimming as the whites do, so with a smaller number of black swimmers you would expect less 'competitive' black swimmers.\n\nI think in places like the US, where IQ studies seem to show that white folks are 15 points up on blacks, maybe sport is the only outlet for many blacks to get a 'career', whereas white folks may have the choice of sport or academia, law etc If you had the choice would you choose the life-long career potential of academia, law etc or a short <perhaps a decade> career in sport, with all the health risks that may entail.\n\nMaybe Africa doesn't have enough chlorine fuming, Olympic-sized pools to encourage enough blacks to swim competitively, water is a precious resource in much of Africa. Whereas, the transport system in much of Africa means a lot of leg work, and the weather - mostly - isn't too wet or snowy to force people into covered transport - although auto use is low there.\n\nI think a lot of it stems from the westerners being lazier and fatter than Africans. The west have lots of people who will never undertake manual work because it is beneath them, even cleaning the house or auto; all calorie busting exercise for an active human.\n\nCompare a country where folks are more physically active with one where they are not, is it surprising?\n\nGavin Thomas, Cardiff, Wales September 01, 2012 6:42am\n\nGavin, if that is the case how do you explain the Olympic medal tables? The UK, US and China each had more medals than all African countries combined. If Africa was full of athletic superhumans I cannot see how a nation of 60 million people, the UK, could obtained more medals than a continent of one billion people.\n\nI dare say that training and coaching is more advanced in the UK than most of Africa but does that explain the near 17 to 1 population advantage?\n\nPerhaps that Olympics are everything from swimming to cycling is part of the answer, maybe Africans are only 'good' at 'natural' land based events like running? Throwing, cycling and swimming events hardly seem to have black competitors at all.\n.\n.\n.\nAs for the podcast, lol @ the electronic mosquito repellents, I just use good old lotion and have never had an issue.

According to the\nlatest USGS water use report, nearly half of all water used in the United\nStates goes to cooling thermoelectric power plants. Irrigation accounts\nfor 31 percent. Eleven percent of water is used for public supply, and\nthe remaining 9 percent is used for industrial, livestock, aquaculture,\nmining and rural domestic uses. For details, listen to episode 108 of the\nUSGS\nCorecast or check out\nthe full\nreport.

These caves could provide shelter for\nfuture Mars exploration missions. They could also shed light on whether\nmicrobial life forms have ever existed on the \"Red Planet.\" The\ndepressions were detected by the USGS Astrogeology Science Center using\nhigh-resolution images conveyed through Mars-orbiting satellites. Scientists\nbelieve some of these caves were created from a massive volcano, when solid\nceilings of cooled material formed over lava channels during ancient volcanic\neruptions. Sections of these ceilings collapsed at some point to form the\nobserved skylight entrances, or caves.

The carbon enters the Arctic from the atmosphere\nand is trapped in the permafrost, the frozen layer of soil underneath the\nland's surface. This layer is an effective carbon sink because the permafrost\nis too cold to for the carbon to decompose very quickly. However, global\nwarming is causing the permafrost to thaw, exposing the previously frozen\nsoil to decomposition and erosion, and could make the permafrost a source\nof atmospheric carbon, rather than a sink.

Experts believe these\nconditions are caused by faulty wallboard. Wallboard is made out of the\nmineral gypsum. The USGS collects information from gypsum producers as\nwell as gypsum production information from other countries. Based on these\ndata, experts believe the faulty wallboard is manufactured in China. Gypsum\nis a byproduct of coal-burning powerplants, and many wallboard manufacturers\nuse this source of gypsum in their manufacturing process. This production\nprocess in the United States is similar to that in China, and experts are\ntrying to determine the chemical differences between the wallboard originating\nin the two different countries.

This mixture\ncan create menacing slurry, capable of destroying bridges, roadways and\nstructures. USGS scientists found that some watersheds in the burn area\ncan generate debris flows with enough material to fill a football field\n60 feet deep with mud and rock. The USGS identified and mapped areas with\ndebris flow hazards to assist state and local planners as they work to\nprotect lives and property from these potentially destructive events.

Already in South Florida,\nbreeding populations of boa constrictors and Burmese pythons have become\nestablished and appear to be spreading. Other constrictor snakes caught\nin the wild include anacondas and other python species. These non-native\nsnakes are likely to thrive in suitable environments because they mature\nearly, produce many young, travel long distances, and can eat native birds\nand mammals. Adequate control tools have not been established, although\nseveral are being tested. A new USGS report documents the occurrence of\nthese snakes, the potential for further invasion, and ecosystem risks in\nthe United States.

A streamgage measures the height and how much water\nis flowing in a river or stream. This information is used by drinking water\nsuppliers, water treatment plant operators, engineers, wildlife managers,\nrecreationalists and many others. There are over 7,500 streamgages in the\nUnited States that transmit real-time data by satellite every one to four\nhours. This streamflow information is available to everyone for free online.The amount of water in rivers or streams is not constant, and knowing\nhow much water is available is critical to those who use and manage the\nwater.

These systems are used to store, view and\nanalyze information, especially maps. They can contain data about human\npopulations, storm damage, migratory bird routes and the location of crops.\nGeographers at the USGS National Wetlands Research Center measure coastal\nland loss along the Gulf\nCoast by combining information from aerial photography, satellite images,\nradar and elevation data into GIS. Using GIS, they can accurately map the\n1900 square miles of coastal lands that Louisiana has lost since the 1930s.\nThese systems are especially important after events like Hurricanes Katrina\nand Rita, which together caused the loss of 217 square miles. Scientists\nalso use GIS to forecast what land loss may occur in the future, which\nis critical information for restoration projects that save wetlands.

There will also be increased emphasis on educating student-athletes on such issues as proper tackling technique, concussion symptoms, and the potential short- and long-term costs of repetitive brain trauma. \"It is important for our student-athletes to not only recognize symptoms of concussion in themselves and their teammates but to also understand the severity of such injuries and the need to relay that information to medical personnel,\" Skorton says. \"Our goal is to emphasize that a concussion is a serious injury that requires immediate and proper treatment, including physical and cognitive rest, to promote healing.\"\n\nUniversity Raises Income Limit on No-Loan Aid\n\nIn July, the University announced a number of \"adjustments to the financial aid program.\" The most notable change was an increase in the family income limit for no-loan aid. This had been set at $60,000, but will be raised to $75,000 for students matriculating in 2013 and after. The change does not affect current students. Administrators stated that the adjustments were necessary to ensure the \"long-term sustainability\" of the financial aid program. Under the new guidelines, students with family income of less than $60,000 will have no loan requirements and no required parental contribution. For those in the $60,000 to $75,000 family-income bracket, financial aid packages will include loans that are capped at $2,500 per year.

In a bench trial in Tompkins County Court, former Sigma Alpha Epsilon pledges Max Haskin '14, Ben Mann '13, and Edward Williams '14 were found not guilty of misdemeanor hazing and providing alcohol to a minor; the fraternity chapter, which did not offer a defense, was convicted on all counts. A fourth student was also charged, but due to his status as a minor his case was disposed of separately and the outcome has not been disclosed.\n\nAccording to criminal court documents, Desdunes had a blood alcohol content of .35 when he was taken to the hospital after a custodian found him unresponsive on a fraternity house couch. The nineteen-year-old Brooklyn resident had allegedly participated in a mock kidnapping ritual in which pledges \"abducted\" him and another brother, bound them, and required them to drink if they gave wrong answers to questions about fraternity trivia. The accused students have since left the University, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon has been banned from campus for at least five years. Desdunes's mother has filed a $25 million wrongful death lawsuit against the national fraternity, its Cornell chapter, and more than a dozen of its members.\n\nHotel Dean Emeritus Dies at 91\n\nRobert Beck '42, PhD '54\n\nRobert Beck '42, PhD '54, dean emeritus of the Hotel school, died July 31. He was ninety-one. Beck served as dean for two decades starting in 1961, years which saw significant institutional growth including the doubling of its undergrad enrollment. Current dean Michael Johnson calls him \"one of the most beloved figures in the history of our school.\" A World War II veteran, Beck lost a leg in the invasion of Normandy. He joined the Cornell faculty in 1954; in 2004, the school named an addition to Statler Hall the Beck Center in honor of him and his late wife, Jan. He is survived by three daughters.\n\nLaw School Expansion Breaks Ground\n\nLegal maneuver: A rendering of the underground addition\n\nAt Reunion, the Law School broke ground on an underground expansion\u2014the first phase of a $60 million project. The addition, hoped to be completed by 2014, will comprise two classrooms and a 170-seat auditorium. Later phases will include the reconfiguration of the law library and the conversion of the residential Hughes Hall into offices and meeting spaces. At the groundbreaking ceremony, Dean Stewart Schwab noted that since Myron Taylor Hall's dedication in 1932, the school has more than tripled its faculty and student numbers and now hosts various research centers, institutes, visiting scholars, and exchange students. \"We're bursting at the seams from all this activity,\" Schwab said, \"and we need to expand our facility.\" The addition will be the campus's third underground structure, following the Cornell Store and Kroch Library. In June, the Law School announced one of the largest gifts in its history, $25 million from an anonymous donor to expand endowment support for faculty research, student aid, and other programs.\n\nSchwarz Honored with Essay Book\n\nDaniel Schwarz\n\nEnglish professor Daniel Schwarz has been honored with a festschrift, an essay collection marking his contributions as a teacher and scholar.

'It was still completely dark,' she says, but soon the early morning light revealed a group of around six jays close by. 'There was a lot of squabbling.' This was her favourite shot because of the angle of the birds and the way their feathers are spread apart. The low light also helped bring out their beautiful colours.\n\nCOMMENDED - Hannah Bedford (UK) 'CAUGHT IN THE ACT\n\n'There was a commotion in the garden,' says Hannah, 'and this was what was causing it.' The fox had killed all four hens in the chicken run and was in the process of eating one of them. Hannah dashed in to get her camera, and caught the fox still on top of the hen house, mouth full of feathers, frozen in fear at seeing the family of humans. 'I loved seeing a fox soclose up,' adds Hannah, 'but we don't keep chickens any more.'\n\n11-14 YEARS:\n\nWINNER - Owen Hearn (UK) 'FLIGHT PATHS\n\nHarvest time at Owen's grandparents' farm draws in the birds of prey to feed on the fleeing small mammals, and it also attracts Owen, with his camera at the ready. 'Seeing this red kite with an aeroplane in the distance was a moment I couldn't miss,' says Owen. The shot is symbolic for him for two reasons. It was taken at the centre of the Bedfordshire site chosen for London's third airport back in the late 1960s. 'Opposition to the planned airport stopped it going ahead, which is why I can photograph the wildlife on the farm today.'

'The effect was so unusual \u2013 it gave a beautiful setting for an urban wildlife image.' Like all true photographers, Eve had noticed what others most often fail to see, even when it's right in front of them.\n\nCOMMENDED - Oscar Dewhurst (UK) 'BITTERN IN WINTER\n\nOne of Oscar's favourite photographic subjects is the bittern. And one of his favourite places to photograph it is at the London Wetland Centre, where several of these secretive herons usually overwinter in the reedbeds. They tend to stay tucked among the reeds, searching for fish at the water's edge and are notoriously well camouflaged and shy. But when the water freezes, they are sometimes forced out onto the ice to look for food. 'During the very cold winter of 2010,' says Oscar, 'there were seven bitterns at the site.' He explains how he was in the public hide, photographing a bittern close by, when a blizzard started. He was just about to pack up and leave when he saw 'another bittern suddenly set off across the ice.' The image ended up being his favourite shot of the day.\n\nVeolia Environnement Wildlife Photographer of the Year is owned by the Natural History Museum and BBC Worldwide.\n\nYou probably already know that bullying is something that does happen in schools, but do you realize the devastating effect it can have on schoolwork and the personal lives on those being bullied?\n\nThe Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA) is calling on everybody to get involved in Anti-Bullying Week and to make sure that anyone who is experiencing bullying is aware that they can speak out and will be taken seriously.\n\nThe ABA produces a campaign pack for schools as well as tips to help inspire awareness activities during Anti-Bullying Week.\n\nTo find out more go to \n\nDWARF MONGOOSES AT EDINBURGH ZOO\n\nA group of dwarf mongooses grew by three when they welcomed a trio of new arrivals recently. They are currently just over two months old.\n\nIn the wild, dwarf mongooses can be found inhabiting the dry grassland and bush lands of Africa. Small by name and small by size, these little creatures are usually around 16 to 27 centimetres in length and are Africa's smallest carnivore, as well as the smallest of the mongoose species.\n\nThe silk moth caterpillar makes its cocoon from silk. It is inside the cocoon that the caterpillar will slowly change into an adult moth. Each cocoon is made from one strand of silk fibre, which may be up to 950 metres long, if carefully unravelled. Because it takes a long time to rear the silk moths and great care is required to get this fibre, silk has always been expensive. Silk has a unique texture; it is very light and smooth to touch, as well as having a very appealing shine. What is so special about the silk fibre that gives silk these properties?\n\nWHAT IS SILK?\n\nSilk is mainly protein, sometimes called fibroin. Proteins are one of the basic building materials of all living things and are biological polymers, very large molecules made up of hundreds of repeating subunits. Plastics like polyethene (carrier bag plastic) are chemical polymers in which all of the subunits are identical.\n\nBut proteins are different; they are made up of 20 different units (called amino acids), in almost any order, although the joints between them are all the same.\n\nThe strength of the polymer is to do with how strong the bonds are between different chains. In the case of silk, nearly all of the amino acids are quite small ones. This means that the protein chains can pack together tightly. The more tightly or regularly packed the protein molecules, the stronger the forces holding them together. This is what makes silk very strong as well as smooth.\n\nApart from being used to make beautiful light clothing, silk has been used for many years in parachutes, because of its great strength to weight ratio. A huge area of parachute can be packed into a small space. Silk thread is also used to make sutures (stitches) in surgery.\n\nSPIDER SILK\n\nSpiders make different kinds of silk for different purposes. Spinning a web is one use, of course, but spiders also use silk for making cocoons for eggs and \"ballooning\". In warm weather some spiders extrude several gossamer threads into the air, which carry them off in the breeze. Spider silk is thinner than silk moth cocoon silk, and stronger, and more elastic: it will stretch a lot before it breaks.\n\nSPIDER SILK CAPE\n\nIt isn't easy to collect spider silk, but it can be done. Recently a beautiful cape was woven using silk from Madagascan Golden Orb spiders. These spiders are as big as your hand. It took Simon Peers and Nicholas Godley eight years and about a million spiders to make the cape. The spiders were returned to the forest afterwards. You can learn more about this at:\n\nScientists compare the strength of materials by measuring the force required to stretch it until it breaks. Spider silk can be much stronger than steel, comparing fibres of equal mass (up to 20 times). It can also be up to five times stronger than the strongest man-made fibres, such as Kevlar (used in body armour). Its strength and ability to stretch comes from its structure being slightly different from silk moth silk.\n\nSPIDER SILK GENES\n\nBecause of its lightness, great strength and toughness, scientists are very interested in using spider silk as a material, but spiders are difficult to work with and they have a tendency to eat each other. New biological methods have recently tackled this problem. Spiders have DNA just like other animals, and it contains the genes that provide the building information for making spider silk. Recently, scientists have been able to extract spider silk genes and put them into other organisms.\n\nThe bacterium, Escherichia coli, can be genetically modified with spider silk genes and grown to make spider silk, but not in the form of a fibre. It must first be harvested and then spun into a thin fibre.\n\nScientists at the University of Wyoming have managed to put the spider silk gene into some silk moths. This special strain of silk moth makes large amounts of silk, like a pure-bred moth, but their Genetically Modified silk is a mixture of normal silk and spider silk and is just as tough as spider silk. This GM silk is expensive, but uses much less energy to make than synthetic \"plastic\" fibres. There is a BBC news article about this at \n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nA strand of the thinnest spider silk long enough to encircle the Earth would weigh only 500 grams (that's as heavy as five apples).\n\nYUMMY FRIED SILKWORM TAKE-AWAY\n\nSilkworms are best known for their silk-producing ability. But silkworm larvae are popular in many East Asian countries for their rich flavour and protein content. Cans of larvae can be found in supermarkets.\n\nSILK THREAD IS USED FOR EMBROIDERY OR FOR WEAVING SOFT, BEAUTIFUL FABRICS. IT WAS NORMAL FOR MANY BRITISH CHILDREN TO WORK LONG HOURS IN THE SILK INDUSTRY OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.\n\nSILK PRODUCING AREAS\n\nThe Spitalfields area of London, and Cheshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Coventry were important silk-producing areas. Fibres from the silkworm cocoon are processed into silk thread, which can be woven into cloth. Silk cloth was woven on a handloom: a 'shuttle of 'weft thread was pushed in and out of 'warp threads stretched over a frame. Weaving silk required great skill.\n\nCHILD LABOUR\n\nChildren helped their parents as they wove silk at home. Their parents taught them to weave so they could earn a living. Sometimes children assisted weavers in factories, or in workshops. Some children in workhouses (where very poor people were cared for by their local parish) were set to work winding silk to pay for their upkeep.\n\nWILLIAM\n\nWilliam Hutton began working at Lombe's factory in Derbyshire when he was seven. William was too small to reach the machinery, so he wore special overshoes to make him tall enough to work.\n\nADAM\n\nAdam Rushton was a farmer's son in Cheshire. But Adam's father lost his farm and the family became very poor. In 1829, when Adam was eight years old, his parents sent him to work in a silk-throwing mill at Macclesfield.\n\nAdam worked as a 'piecer for twelve hours a day: 'a murderous length of time. 'Piecers tied together any silk threads, which broke during the winding process. Adam only stopped work for meal times (one hour and forty minutes for the whole working day). He hated the noise of the factory, and the stifling atmosphere inside. He only earned 6d (in today's money, maybe 20 pounds or so) per week, but his wages helped his family buy food. Adam did not have time to go to school during the week, so he learnt to read and write at Sunday School.\n\nTHOMAS\n\nIn the 1860s, boys worked as 'loom-turners, turning a wheel to operate a handloom. Twelve-year-old Thomas Eld worked in a silk ribbon factory at Hillfield. He is recorded as saying, 'It is hard work turning a loom . . . I sweat a good deal . . . I earn 3s 3d.\n\nGERALD\n\nGerald Massey (born in 1828), was the son of a canal boatman at Tring in Hertfordshire. Gerald learnt to read at a 'penny-school (paying a penny a week for lessons). If no work was available, the family had very little money. When Gerald was eight years old, he started work at a silk factory. Every day he got up at five o'clock in the morning and worked until half-past six at night. Like Adam Rushton, he only earned a few pennies weekly. One night the factory burnt down, and all the children danced around the flames. When Gerald grew up, he became a poet, and campaigned for workers rights.\n\nCHANGING LAWS\n\nIn the early 1830s, parliament set a minimum age of nine years, and a working day of twelve hours, to protect child workers in cotton factories. In these factories, children breathed in cotton dust, which made them poorly. But silk factory owners said their factories were cleaner than cotton mills, so there was no minimum age for child workers in silk mills. Investigators discovered some children as young as six years old at work.\n\nAt last in 1844 a new law said that only children at least eight years old could work in textile factories, including silk mills. Now children under thirteen must attend school for half a day, too. But as late as 1875, 15 per cent of silk factory workers in Britain were children under thirteen years old.\n\nFive years later, compulsory education was introduced for all children under ten. Cheap silk imports from abroad also meant fewer jobs were available. Finally, in the UK, child labour in the silk industry became a thing of the past.\n\nWHAT KINDS OF WORK DID CHILDREN DO?\n\n- 'Reelers unwound the silk moth cocoons to form bundles or 'skeins of 'raw silk.\n\nScreen printing was first used in China over a thousand years ago. By using simple shape masks on a specially prepared screen, you could make your own unique picture.\n\nYOU WILL NEED:\n\nVoile (semitransparent net curtain fabric) enough to cover your\n\nframe with overlap\n\nA stiff piece of smooth card for squeegee (about 10 cm high)\n\nThin card\n\nAn old picture frame (A4 is a good size)\n\nDrawing pins\n\nRed and green acrylic paint (or any two colours of your choice)\n\nWaterproof PVA glue\n\nPencil\n\nMasking tape\n\nScissors\n\nPaper to print on\n\n1. Making an empty screen\n\nCut a piece of voile fabric to fit your frame. Leave a few centimetres overlap.\n\n2. Pin the fabric to the flat edge of the frame using drawing pins. Pull the fabric as tight as you can (see tips below).\n\nMAKING MASK SHAPES\n\nDraw seven petal and two leaf shapes, together with a small circle for the centre of the flower on a piece of thin card and cut out.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nHold the card squeegee at an angle.\n\nUsing the edge of the squeegee pull the paint across the surface of the screen.\n\nThe paint is squeezed through the screen on to the paper.\n\nMAKING THE DESIGNED SCREEN AND PRINTING\n\n1. Place the masks on the inside of the screen. Draw around the masks with pencil, and then remove them.\n\n2. Paint all of the fabric screen surrounding the pencil outlined shapes, with thick PVA. Leave overnight to dry.\n\n3. Hold the screen up to the light to check for any tiny holes in the fabric surrounding your shapes (see tips).\n\n4. Replace the leaf masks on the screen and secure with masking tape.\n\n5. To print the flower: Place the screen on the printing paper and squeeze out the red acrylic paint in a row at the top of the screen. It should be about 2 cm thick and look like a long sausage.\n\n6. Wrap masking tape along the length of your card squeegee, to give it extra strength.\n\n7. Line up the bottom of your card squeegee, behind the row of paint and tip the card forwards at an angle. Using both hands, pull the card towards you dragging the paint to the end of the frame (see tips).\n\n8. Lift off the screen carefully, to see your printed design and leave it to dry.\n\n9. Remove the leaf masks and wash the screen carefully to remove the red paint and leave to dry. You could do this over the bath using a shower head.\n\n10. Cut a circle of thin card, making sure it is big enough to cover the flower area on the screen. Secure it with masking tape.\n\n11. Follow steps 5 to 8 again, this time using the green paint or second colour of your choice.\n\nScreen printing is a simple method of making multiple copies, ideal for your Christmas cards.\n\nHANDY TIPS\n\n- When pinning your fabric to the frame, start the pinning in the middle of the frame and stretch outwards towards the corners.\n\n- When applying the PVA glue, you may need a smaller brush when going around your design.\n\n- If there are any gaps in the glue, repaint the screen with more glue avoiding the pencil outlined shapes and leave to dry thoroughly.\n\n- Craft PVA glue is fine if you want to do just one colour. The glue must be waterproof if you are going to wash your screen.\n\n- If there are gaps in the paint, push it back to the top and repeat step 7.\n\n- You could use leaves as a template, or any other object that you like, which can be drawn around easily and cut from thin card.\n\nGODDESS OF SILKWORMS! EVER HEARD OF HER? WELL, IT IS SI LING-CHI, CHIEF WIFE OF THE CHINESE YELLOW EMPEROR, WHO LIVED AROUND 3,000 BC.\n\nOne story is that Si Ling-chi happened to be walking under a mulberry tree in her garden, when out of curiosity she picked a white cocoon from its leaf and later accidently dropped it into her tea. Can you imagine her amazement when she discovered she could pull a continuous long thread from it?\n\nAN IMPORTANT SECRET\n\nSi Ling-chi and others not only learned to rear the silkworms but discovered how to reel the thread and weave it into silk. The production of silk (known as sericulture) was so important to the Chinese that the women of every family were made responsible for producing silk, even empresses and princesses! During several periods in Chinese history, taxes were payable in silk. This meant that a family's fortune often depended on women's skill and hard work in sericulture. The secret of silk production was known by practically every household in China, but it was kept from the rest of the world for 2,000 years.\n\nWHO COULD WEAR SILK?\n\nAfter silk was first discovered, only the emperor, his close relatives and the very highest of dignitaries could use it. It is believed that the emperor wore a white silk robe within the palace and a yellow silk robe while outside, along with his principal wife and heir. Yellow signified the colour of the earth. Gradually the various classes of society began to wear tunics of silk.\n\nSILK USE IN INDUSTRY AND CURRENCY\n\nFinally, it began to be used for industrial purposes: musical instruments, fishing-lines, bowstrings and the world's first luxury paper. During the Han dynasty, and later the Tang dynasty, silk was not merely an industrial material but became very valuable. Values were calculated in lengths of silk as they had been calculated in amounts of gold. It soon became a currency used in trade in foreign countries.\n\nTHE SILK ROAD\n\nFor thousands of years, traders and travellers journeyed to and from East Asia, the Middle East and Europe on ancient routes through some of the most difficult landscapes stretching 4,000 miles. This journey came to be known as the 'Silk Road. The route actually existed much earlier than the trade in silk. The earliest trade was in rock salt mined in Afghanistan, essential to preserving meat.\n\nWhile sericulture reached Korea around 200 BC with the arrival of waves of Chinese immigrants, it didn't reached Europe until around the thirteenth century.\n\nSILK IN BRITAIN\n\nIn 1608, King James 1st had a large number of mulberry trees planted on what is now the garden of Buckingham Palace in an attempt to create a homespun English silk industry. He was extremely fond of silk clothes, which were an expensive luxury of the day. Unfortunately he chose the wrong kind of tree and the silkworms weren't interested. But, by the early 1620s silk production was established in Britain and machinery was developed for the spinning of silk giving rise to silk production mills in the early 1700s.\n\nSILK MOTH\n\nSpiders and even centipedes produce silk, but the silk that we use in textiles comes most commonly from the moth Bombyx mori. It has been domesticated for so long that it probably no longer survives in the wild. The blind Bombyx mori moth has lost its power to fly and is only capable of mating and producing eggs for the next generation of silk producers. The female moth lays 500 or more eggs in four to six days and then dies soon after.\n\nEGGS, WORMS AND COCOONS\n\nThe production of silk is a long process and needs many workers. The eggs have to be kept at the perfect temperature till they hatch. The baby worms are fed day and night on fresh mulberry leaves until they multiply in weight. The silkworms feed until they have stored up enough energy to enter the cocoon stage. The worms produce a jelly like substance in their silk glands, which hardens when in contact with air. They spend three or four days spinning a cocoon around themselves and look like puffy white balls.\n\nAfter eight or nine days in a warm, dry place the cocoons are ready to be unwound. First they are steamed or baked to kill the pupae. The cocoons are then dipped into hot water to loosen the tightly woven filaments, which are wound on to a spool. Between five and eight of these super-fine filaments are twisted together to make a single thread.\n\nWHY SILK IS SO POPULAR\n\nThe beauty of silk is that it is the softest, lightest and most breathable natural fabric. It is hypoallergenic as no chemicals are used in its production and is resistant to mould, fungus and dust mites. It is versatile and can be used in summer or winter, as it feels cool to the touch in summer and warm in winter. Silk thread can be dyed into different colours and woven into the most exotic designs. Today we can all enjoy the luxury of silk, which once was only used by emperors.\n\nDid you know?\n\nAround the years 2697-2597 BC, writing was developed in China, inspired by the patterns of bird tracks in the sand? Paper was originally made from scraps of silk and plant fibres. So the early silk paintings and first written communications appeared on this material.\n\nNOT HAVING MET A SINGLE SILKWORM IN MY LIFE I HAD TO ASK A FRIEND OF MINE TO TELL ME ALL ABOUT THEM, AND I FOUND IT FASCINATING. IT IS CERTAINLY GREAT NEWS ABOUT THE PEACE SILKWORM, AS YOU WILL FIND OUT IF YOU READ ON.\n\nWhen silkworms are born, they learn quickly to eat their greens, gobbling up mulberry leaves to make themselves big and strong! After 35 days of munching and chewing happily, it is time for metamorphosis - this means they turn from a worm into a moth!\n\nCOCOONS\n\nFor the change to happen they need to build a silk cocoon, so they start work by pushing liquid silk out through their heads. This solidifies when it comes into contact with air. It takes the busy, hard-working worm about two or three days to spin one mile of silk. More than enough to make a cocoon in which he or she can sleep while the change happens.\n\nJust imagine how exciting that must be . . . going to bed thinking that in the morning you will be a beautiful moth! But what if the morning never arrives?\n\nKILLING THE WORM\n\nThere is a dark side. In the production of ordinary silk, these hard-working little creatures never get to wake up from their slumber. Their cocoon is dipped into boiling water by silk farmers, which kills the worm and enables people to use the silk cocoon to make fine garments.\n\nPEACE SILK IS WORM-FRIENDLY\n\nDon't despair because there is a better way! Eri, known as 'peace, silkworms, make their cocoons in the same way, but their cocoons are open ended. This means, when they are ready to hatch, the moths crawl out safely. The farmer doesn't collect the cocoons until the moths have abandoned them, so the worms turn into big moths. They have a combined wingspan of up to 15 centimetres! They are free to fly away and have little baby worms of their own!\n\nThe 'peace silk produced by these worms is considered to be eco-friendly and is gaining popularity worldwide as an ethical alternative to traditional silk. Peace silk has a cottony texture but can also be soft and shiny. It has a long history of use in the developing countries where it has traditionally been made. In India it is commonly used for bed sheets, curtains, shawls and jackets.\n\n\"This elephant was not meant for work,\" complained Suresh, the mahout (elephant trainer). Hopping off the giant beast, he shook his head in disgust. He looked over at his son, Arjun, whose eyes clearly pitied the elephant.\n\n\"I'm sure he will work out father. I think it's just that ... that you don't have to hit him so hard with the stick.\"\n\nSuresh took the boy by his shoulders. \"Look around you Arjun. The men here in the forest rely on these beasts for their livelihood. They spend hours every day chopping down these gigantic rosewood trees, but without the elephants to lift and carry them to the villages ...\"\n\n\"I know but...\" Arjun began to interrupt, but his father ignored him.\n\n\"Our tradesmen make musical instruments and furniture from these trees, without them they would starve. I'm afraid Akbar is the type of elephant that will never learn. I've worked with him for a year now, but he resists doing even simple tasks. Tomorrow I will talk with the foreman, and suggest he be returned deep within the forest.\"\n\n\"But father,\" Arjun protested, but his father cut him off.\n\n\"It's no good Arjun. Perhaps he will be accepted by another group of elephants and live out his life far from here. Meanwhile, let me see if he will at least obey the simplest of commands.\"\n\nHe turned his attention to the elephant.\n\n\"Head, head, head,\" he ordered, hoping the elephant would lower his head in an attempt to scoop up the heavy trees. But the elephant did nothing. In fact all he did was to turn his tortured face towards the boy where he seemed to be looking for help.\n\nThe boy guessed his age at about five years and remembered that same look of terror in his eyes when the elephant was first captured. His father had been abrupt with him from the very start, hitting him hard on the left flank to make him turn direction, and then repeating the process on his right side.\n\nA high-pitched screech of pain echoed from Akbar, clearly unsure of what was happening. The mahout began yelling at the elephant, repeatedly having the elephant watch as others of his kind reached down at the fallen trees, cradling them delicately between their tusks and trunk. \"Now let's try it again!\"\n\nBut as Arjun's father gave the command again, the animal suddenly backed away from his task, prompting his father to take a stick to the elephant's forehead. \"Lower your trunk, Akbar, NOW!\"\n\nIt appeared that even beating the elephant would be useless as he defiantly locked his knees and curled his trunk into his mouth. \"That's it,\" Suresh shouted. \"Tomorrow, back to the forest you go, you lazy animal!\"\n\nArjun waited as his father dismounted before approaching him. \"Father, do you think I might be the one to take Akbar back into the forest? After all, you've trained me well. I am almost fifteen and soon will be a mahout myself.\"\n\nSuresh sighed deeply. \"Alright, take him into the forest tomorrow, then return before noon. The foreman told me he has a new elephant that we will be breaking in then.\"\n\nThe following morning, Arjun began his two-hour trek into the jungle, his body bobbing up and down with every step the elephant took. He sensed it knew that something different awaited him.\n\n\"I'm sorry that we have to let you go Akbar. I know how ruthless my father was with you. I wish he'd let me handle you but...\" His voice faded as he heard the sounds of other elephants gathered in some deep vegetation at a nearby creek. \"Stop Akbar.\" The elephant did as he was told, then lowered his head, allowing the boy to dismount. Arjun nuzzled up to Akbar, stroking his trunk. \"Good luck my friend. I hope you'll be happy in the wild.\"\n\nA moment later Arjun was gone, jogging through the jungle and back to the worksite, his heart heavy with sadness.\n\nTwo years went by, and Arjun was now a professional mahout just like his father. They worked hard from sun-up to sundown, directing their elephants to lift logs that weighed over 450 kilograms. But, occasionally, while sitting in the shade drinking tea, the boy would catch sight of an elephant off in the distance, watching them. This made him smile, for he knew it was Akbar. These sightings would only last for a few minutes before Akbar disappeared into the jungle. \"I miss you too,\" Arjun would always mutter to himself.\n\nLater, as the monsoon season was fast approaching, the last days of work were hurried. Finally the morning arrived when several mahouts would drive the elephants up into the highlands for the season, to keep them safe. The villagers themselves lived just on the outskirts of the jungle, in small thatched huts that ringed the forested area.\n\nWhen all the work was completed, the village planned on having a celebration, but the rains were attacking them even more intensely than ever. Flood waters, mixing with high winds, swept through the village forcing the villagers to dig a series of canals to redirect the water. But this proved useless. This season's monsoons were the worst they'd had in years. Numbers of people were gathering their belongings and heading for the eight-hour march to the highlands to join the elephants.\n\nArjun and his father remained sealed up in their hut. \"This will pass, boy.\" But the worried look on his father's face showed otherwise. The winds howled so loudly Arjun had to yell at the top of his lungs to make himself heard.\n\n\"Father, I think we must go with the others.\"\n\n\"No we're staying ... or, at least, I must stay,\" he added. \"Your late mother and I built this hut together and I could never leave it. But perhaps you should go.\" He bent over grabbing a family photo, which had hung over his bed. He'd made his decision. \"Here, take this and go.\"\n\nArjun knew it was useless to argue with his father. He nodded, and then embraced him. \"I'll be back the moment it's over, father. Please take care of yourself.\" Reluctantly, he stepped outside.\n\nLooking down, he noticed the water enveloping his feet and ankles. Whipping winds tore at his face and clothes forcing him to bend low in the storm. Wading through the water, he'd only got twenty feet from his home when he heard a loud crash directly behind him. Turning around a look of horror etched his face. A fifty-foot sandalwood tree had been completely uprooted and fell directly on to their family hut.\n\n\"Papa,\" he cried. The tiny hut was completely crushed. The roof had splintered into hundreds of pieces exposing his father, lying trapped under the fallen tree. He lay on his back, his legs unable to move. Immediately Arjun attempted to lift the tree, but failed - the tree was just too heavy.\n\nAgain and again, he strained, but the tree wouldn't budge. Frantically, he looked around the village for help, but everyone had already gone to high dry ground. Rains continued to pour into the now flattened house and water had risen to a dangerous level. The boy cradled his father in his arms and bundling up an old rug he'd found, he lifted his father's head above the pooling water. But the boy knew the rising water levels would mean disaster for his father.\n\nIn desperation he looked in every direction for an answer. And it was when his eyes met the forest that an idea came to him. \"Hold on father, I'll be back as soon as I can.\" Without waiting for a reply, off he went, forcing his way through the flooded village and into thejungle \u2013 looking for Akbar.\n\nAfter twenty minutes of pushing his way through the heavy foliage, he came to a clearing and there Akbar stood, calmly seeking shelterunder a large heavily branched tree. His ears were flapping wildly in the penetrating winds and he was looking directly at Arjun. \"Do youremember me Akbar?\" asked Arjun tentatively as the giant elephant's eyes narrowed. In answer, Akbar slowly raised his trunk and movedit alongside Arjun. He's smelling me, the boy told himself.\n\n\"Yes, Akbar, yes it is me Arjun and I need your help. Only your strength can help us now.\" Standing on his tiptoes Arjun tapped the elephant on the forehead. \"Down,\" he commanded. The elephant responded immediately, allowing Arjun to climb atop him. Then came another tap on his right flank. \"Go Akbar.\" The elephant turned and it didn't seem too long before they entered the flooded village.Arjun prayed that the waters had not risen any higher than when he'd left. Otherwise his father \u2026 he dare not think any further.\n\nTrudging through the waters, Arjun leaned low on the elephant trying his best to avoid the howling winds. At last they reached the ruins of the family hut. The boy saw that the rising water level had reached his father's neck and was climbing higher. The elephant stoppedabruptly, quickly recognizing the mahout who had mistreated him for nearly a year. Lifting his trunk the elephant trumpeted excitedly then began backing away.\n\n\"No Akbar, no,\" pleaded the boy. \"My father is trapped under the tree, please help him.\"\n\nAkbar halted, his eyes riveted on the mahout. He inched forward to where he stood directly over him. But Suresh lay unconscious,unaware of the elephant's presence. Arjun stretched forwards and tapped Akbar's jaw. \"Lift Akbar. You must lift the tree. I know you can do it.\"\n\nPrecious seconds drifted by before the giant head swooped down, his tusks pointing in the right direction. Carefully he placed them under the water-logged tree, inches from the mahout's chest. With the tree firmly held between trunk and tusks he lifted it slowly, moving the half-ton tree off Suresh successfully and placing it outside the ruined hut where the flowing waters escorted it down stream.\n\n\"Good boy, Akbar,\" cried Arjun, leaping off the elephant and scrambling to his father.\n\n\"Father, can you hear me?\" He placed his hand on his father's face. Suresh remained motionless, his eyes closed. Arjun shook his father's shoulders. \"Please father, please, please wake up!\"\n\nSlowly, Arjun's father began to regain consciousness, opening one eye. As he focused on what was around him, he let out a panicky sound. Staring down at him was the elephant he knew as Akbar. \"Uh \u2026 uh \u2026 keep him away from me,\" he shuddered. \"He might try to\u2026\"\n\n\"You're perfectly safe father,\" Arjun reassured him. \"It was Akbar who saved your life. He lifted a tree which had broken our roof and pinned you down.\"\n\nWincing in pain, Suresh brought himself up on one elbow. \"Akbar? How would he know the commands?\"\n\n\"I told you Akbar was intelligent,\" Arjun explained. \"It was your methods he didn't like. I gave him the commands and he knew exactly what to do, even after two years.\"\n\nRising to his feet, Suresh shuffled unsteadily over to Akbar, who appeared to stiffen. Arjun watched as his father studied the animal.\n\n\"When you took him to the forest did you notice if he tried to mix with any of the other elephants out there?\"\n\n\"No father, I don't think he did. When I occasionally saw him, he would be standing alone just beyond the clearing watching us work. I think this is really where he wants to be.\"\n\nThe older mahout put his hand to his chin, clearly in thought. The rains had suddenly stopped and a sliver of sunlight had broken through. \"You know boy, I think you may be right. When things settle after the rainy season I will go to the foreman and tell him Akbar is ready to be a worker.\" Arjun couldn't believe his ears.\n\n\"However,\" his father went on, \"he is going to need an experienced mahout who can control Akbar and perhaps help us rebuild our humble home.\" He turned to his son and with a wide smile and added, \"I don't suppose you would know of anyone?\"\n\nIt's so great to receive my own copies of your magazine, no borrowing from the school library! This magazine is perfect for me because you write about very interesting things and because you publish kids letters and help to find friends with similar hobbies.\n\nI like puzzles and enjoy projects to create something new. It can be writing stories, making videos and designing stuff. I am doing a big research project now, which is about the mind in humans and machines. There are so many amazing facts and mysteries about the mind, Dad and I love talking about it all the time. From Maria Sipols\n\nPS. I am 101\/2, live in London and I love art, science, sports and music.\n\nDear Aquila\n\nIn response to Bryn Mollet (September issue), I love birds too and my favourite one is the peregrine falcon. It's the fastest 'animal in the world and can reach speeds of 242mph in a full stoop (the downwards flight it uses to catch its prey). I enjoy reading, does anybody else? I recommend 'The Last Dragon Chronicles by Chris d'Lacey. I also love animals and I am thinking of working for the RSPB or the RSPCA one day. Your magazine is BRILLIANT! I've been getting it for about four years now. I have a VERY greedy pet shubunkin (colour variety of goldfish) called Winner. I'm calling my next three Podium, Silver and Bronze! I play the piano and the recorder. From Lucy Snowdon, age 81\/2\n\nDear Aquila\n\nI live with my mum, dad, sister and my dog. I play the flute and the piano. I have only been getting AQUILA for a year but I already love it! My favourite animals are golden retrievers. In the summer holidays I went to Turkey and stayed with a lady called Pauline who took in stray dogs and cats and gave them names! One of the dogs was found on the road in a sack. They were called: Bran, Watson, Holmes and Max (dogs) and Gremlin, Teacat, Mrs Thatcher and Blackadder (cats). Pauline takes them to the vet and cares for them. She makes sure that they are all healthy and loved. From Cecily Foggitt\n\nPS Please could you do an issue on music?\n\nDear Aquila\n\nI like your magazine a lot. I drew some pictures for you of Polly Chrome, Pepe and Aquila. Can you do something about the Stone Age please? From Shara Samara, age 10\n\nWe hope you enjoyed our September issue, which was all about the Stone Age.\n\nDear Aquila\n\nI have been reading AQUILA for about six months and I love them! In September's magazine I have noticed something very odd. It does not have anything about Stig of the Dump and he was a caveman. Never mind. From Elena Graziano, age 11\n\nThank you for reminding us about a fantastic story which is well worth reading. Anyone who hasn't already read it, should be able to find Stig of the Dump, by Clive King, in the library.\n\nDear Aquila\n\nI really enjoy doing origami, so I bought a book called Easy Origami. It also has lots of hard ones too! (PHOTO) Here are some I can make: pinwheel, penguin, lantern, sailboat, tall cap and piano. Could you feature origami so that readers can learn some folding skills. I love cycling, swimming, running and tennis and of course AQUILA. From Jodie Cheetham\n\nDear Aquila\n\nYour magazine is awesome! It's so much better than all those girly, gossip magazines. On the 2nd of January 2012 I set off for a three-month trip to South Africa. I think my trip there was amazing. I loved the scorching hot weather (it was summer) and I loved having a chance to go swimming every day. Another brill thing about it was school. The name of the school I went to was Nongoma Primary School. It was an English-speaking school for Zulu-speaking children to get better at English. The work at the school was too easy for me and the grammar was very bad, but even if there were boring lessons the playtimes were even more fun than the English playtimes. At break we would munch on food from the snack shop, whilst playing a wide variety of games. The downside of South Africa was 1) frogs (which since going to South Africa I am very scared of) would hop into my room. 2) the food wasn't very good. 3) the water was hardly running. 4) church was in Zulu not English. Apart from that I really liked South Africa.\n\nI've noticed that in most letters people talk about their pets. Unfortunately, I do not have a pet, but I am soon going to get a kitten. I can't wait! I may not have a pet but I sure do love animals. My favourites are cheetahs, tigers, pandas and kittens. They are all so cute and clever.\n\nIn reply to Joshua Kinderman (July\/August issue), I LOVE Tintin comics, but am not as keen on Asterix. In reply to Chloe Kinderman (same issue) I draw manga. My friend just taught me how to. My favourite pages of AQUILA are Ian, Brainfeeders and Over to you. My interests are reading, writing, drawing, playing Moshi Monsters, listening to music and reading AQUILA. When I am older I would like to be a lawyer, a zoologist or a singer. Does anybody else want to be one of those? Does anybody enjoy singing? I really do. From Jessica Catgill Thompson, age 9\n\nPS. Could you please do an issue on Ancient Egypt?\n\nDear Aquila\n\nI have been longing to write to you for ages, but I have never had enough courage to write in, so there is quite a lot I need to tell you. Firstly, I absolutely love your magazine, and it encourages me to carry out lots of experiments. Also, in response to Hope (April issue), I really, really like your poems, especially your poem 'Mummy's Dog Jetson. As well, in response to Jane Ambler (same issue), I really enjoyed reading your poem, I'm also against animal testing, and I loved your painting of a cheetah! In response to Caitlin Cox (July\/August issue), I'm learning French and also I'm so jealous! You camped in the Sahara Desert! Lucky! I learn a lot from AQUILA, and in my opinion, it's much, much better than all the other magazines. My favourite parts of AQUILA are Brainfeeders to test my brain, Aquila peers into the past, to see how things used to be before, Over to you to see other people's opinions of AQUILA and Kit's page because I adore sport and I'd do anything to try out new sports. Here is a poem I wrote, I hope you like it.\n\nDown in the Jungle\n\nDown in the jungle,\n\nWhere trees and bushes grow,\n\nThere are lots of animals and wildlife,\n\nwhere blue waterfalls flow.\n\nDown in the jungle\n\nEverything's quiet and calm\n\nUntil come some hunters\n\nWho make all the damage and harm.\n\nDown in the jungle\n\nThere are big crashes and bangs,\n\nThe hunters are ruining everything,\n\nWith their guns making twangs.\n\nDown in the jungle\n\nThere is a ferocious roar,\n\nAnd out come some more animals,\n\nReady to make war.\n\nFrom Gezana Rai, age 9\n\nPS. I'd really appreciate it if you did an issue on Education or on our Solar System\n\nPPS. Also, completely randomly, I'm a TOTAL tomboy!\n\nDear Aquila\n\nI am sure that loads of people have written letters to you and have said that your magazine is epic or cool. I agree with everyone's comments as you are just unbeatable. My favourite character has got to be E.B. He is so adorable. My family have a hamster called Nutty. He has chocolate brown fur and has shining, black ebony eyes. He comes from Syria. Does anyone else have a hamster? To show how fabulous AQUILA is I've written a poem about it. From Olivia, age 8:\n\nEvery first day of the month I'm up and ready,\n\nWaiting for the clonk! and slap! of the post arriving.\n\nWhen I hear it I shout and cheer it\n\n\"AQUILA's here. Hurrah!\"\n\nPS. Hi to all my family and aunties, uncles, granny, grandpa, grandma and granddad.\n\nDear Aquila\n\nI've been reading your magazine for ten months now. I'm really enjoying it. My favourite sections are Paws for thought, Brainfeeders, Over to you and Things to make. My favourite people from the team are Pepe, Polly Chrome, Kit, E.B and Aquila and finally, Calculata. I cherish the time I have to read AQUILA and find facts. Can you please do an issue on Charles Darwin and Shrewsbury town, as it is the same town I live in? Every month (on the 1st of every month), I enjoy running to the mailbox to collect the magazine. From Eliza Mangham\n\nDear Aquila\n\nI have been getting your magazine for over a year now, and I'm really enjoying it. In response to Lucia Betts and Joey (July\/August issue), I like Club Penguin too and in response to Issy Donald, your cats are very cute! I like Pepe's pages because I love animals. I like the page E.B. did about big cats in Britain. I entered the competition in November [2011] and I won a Meccano set. I have a black and white cat called Tibby who likes to sleep. I really like drawing, does anyone else? From Abigail McCaffrey, age 11\n\nDear Aquila\n\nI live in Stavanger, Norway. In the summer I sailed to Kristiansand and saw beautiful sea trout and seals. On the 8th I saw a red squirrel (you can adopt one) and baby deer. Can you do a page on otter-watching in Surrey? From William Dove, age 9\n\nSTAR LETTER:\n\nDear Aquila\n\nI LOVE your magazine! It is really interesting and as soon as it comes through the post every month, my sister and I fight over who gets to read it first! We've been getting it for about three years now and I've always wanted to write a letter to you, but I've never known what to say.\n\nI went in June with my year group on a trip to Osmington Bay for a weekend. It was at a PGL activity centre and it was fab! We did loads of outdoor activities like abseiling, aero ball, Jacob's ladder, climbing, zipwire, archery and sensory trail. My favourite was definitely aero ball. You are in pairs and you bounce on trampolines and try to shoot balls into the other team's net. Has anyone else done aero ball? Has anyone else been to Osmington Bay's PGL?\n\nMy favourite parts of AQUILA are Over to you and Ian. To AQUILA readers who have written in with poems, I love them all! In reply to Beth Moore (June issue), I also went to the Aquatics Centre in March. I went to see Becky Adlington, who is my idol. I really want to be an Olympic swimmer when I'm older like her. My favourite sport is swimming and my best stroke is backstroke. My time for 100m back is 1:30 mins and for 50m back is 40 secs. Does anyone else do the IAPS? In the December 2011 issue, you had a double page on the history of Christmas. It proved to be VERY useful. Our class was doing a Christmas assembly and we had to research facts about the history of Christmas. I got lots of my facts from your magazine - I also brought it in and it was extremely helpful.\n\nI am writing a book at the moment called The Japanese Mystery and it is about this girl who has to move to Japan and she is unhappy because her father and mother have split up. She finds out her aunt is evil and goes on a mission to save her dad. Finally here is a poem:\n\nTHE BACKSTROKER\n\nStanding by the block,\n\nExamining the other competitors,\n\nAre they muscly? Do they look fast?\n\nSuddenly, the whistle blows,\n\nI jump into the freezing water,\n\nTake your marks - I hear,\n\nPull into the block,\n\nGO, the gun blows,\n\nAnd I'm off, my butterflies suddenly gone,\n\nMy racing suit, like another layer of strong skin,\n\nHelping me through the water,\n\nWill I make it?\n\nI'm catching up,\n\nAnd first place, I easily take.\n\nFrom Kaiya, age 11\n\nPS Hi to anyone at CLFS!\n\nGet in touch with your address, Kaiya, and we will send you a star letter prize.\n\nONCE AGAIN NURSE NANCY DROPS IN TO OFFER SEASONAL TIPS FOR STAYING SAFE AND WELL.\n\nSome people now think that the reason we get sniffs and snuffles in the winter isn't simply because of the cold weather. It is because we all spend more time together indoors and germs and diseases are passed on more easily. So what can we do to stay healthy? Diet, hygiene and exercise all play their part in keeping us fit and well during the bleak winter months.\n\nDIET\n\nTwo vitamins are very important all the time, but especially during the winter:\n\nVitamin C - If you eat enough leafy green vegetables and plenty of fruit packed with this vitamin this should help fight off any nasty germs lurking around.\n\nVitamin D - This vitamin is necessary for healthy bones and teeth and is produced in our bodies when we are exposed to sunshine. When the sun refuses to shine you can always top up your vitamin D by eating plenty of dairy products and oily fish such as salmon or tuna.\n\nFLUIDS\n\nYou probably won't feel as thirsty as you do in the summer months, but it is still important to drink plenty of fluids - low sugar juices high in vitamin C not only taste good but are good for you.\n\nHYGIENE AND GOOD HABITS\n\nCoughs and sneezes spread diseases - you may have heard that before. Coughing and sneezing in an enclosed room gives the dirty germs a real boost as they don't have far to travel to find someone else to infect. Keep plenty of tissues handy and if you can't reach them in time, sneeze into the crook of your elbow NOT your hands. Germs on hands are passed on whenever something is touched.\n\nWash hands often - always wash hands, using soap, after using the lavatory and touching cistern handles and flush buttons. Germs are always present on public transport, especially bus poles and stop buttons. Hundreds of people touch these every day and some folk might not be as hygienically savvy as you!\n\nASTHMA OFTEN GETS WORSE IN COLD WEATHER - all asthma sufferers should make sure they have their medication with them all the time AND USE IT!\n\nEXERCISE\n\nAlways wrap up warm - loose layers of waterproof and windproof clothing are best. Tight clothes and footwear restrict the blood flow and will make you colder. In extremely cold weather hats, scarves and gloves are a must. If you are playing outside for any length of time it is a good idea to go inside and warm up every now and then. You can run your hands under a warm tap to heat them but NEVER USE HOT water and dry your hands thoroughly to prevent chapping. Apply hand cream if hands become dry.\n\nICE SKATING, SLEDDING AND SLIDING - winter games are a fun way of exercising but you must follow some safety rules.\n\n5. a) Turkey (Roast turkey has certainly been the main Thanksgiving dish since the 1800s, and turkeys were plentiful in America when the Pilgrim Fathers first arrived, but they also ate deer and other wildfowl at the early Thanksgiving celebrations.)\n\n6. True, some bowstrings are made from silk.\n\n7. c) The first people in China to wear silk clothes were Chinese emperors. At first, they and their families were the only ones who could afford to have garments made from costly silk.\n\n8. a) a penny school was a school that charged a penny a week for lessons.\n\n9. b) In the early 1830s children worked for twelve hours a day in factories.\n\n10.) True. During the Second World War when clothes were rationed, some women actually used parachute silk to make their wedding dresses and also underclothes.\n\n11. a) The first episode of Doctor Who was shown in 1963. The outside of Doctor Who's time travelling machine was a police (phone)box. In 1963, before mobile phones, these were a common sight.\n\n12. b) November 11th is Remembrance day. Also known as Armistice Day and Poppy Day, when those who have died in war are remembered.\n\nThis all depends on what you mean by 'the same as. There are important differences between human beings and dogs.\n\nIf a dog year is the same as seven human years, this would mean that a 14-year-old dog would be the equivalent of a 98-year-old man.\n\nBut dogs mature much more quickly than humans.\n\nBy its first birthday a dog is practically an adult. A human being is not considered as being fully adult until their eighteenth birthday. So, by this reckoning one dog year is the same as eighteen human years.\n\nAlso, dogs have much shorter life spans than humans. Generally speaking, the smaller the dog, the longer it is expected to live. Some, like poodles and chihuahuas, may live for thirteen to fourteen years, whereas the big Irish Wolfhound and the Great Dane seldom make it past nine or ten years.\n\nThere are exceptions, of course. Some dogs have been known to live for twenty years. If the seven-year rule were true it would be the equivalent of one hundred and forty human years old!\n\nJOKES\n\nWhat day do monsters eat people?\n\nChewsday!\n\nFrom Faraz Ahmed, age 9\n\nDoctor, doctor!

{"text":"Cities Are the Future of Human Evolution\n\nHumans began to live in urban settlements about 7 thousand years ago. As humans continued to evolve over the millennia, so too did our cities.\n\nNow that the majority of humans live in cities, we're going to be confronting a new set of problems in urban life. For one thing, natural disasters in cities can cause much greater numbers of fatalities than in sparse, rural communities. So the cities of tomorrow will need to be robust against many kinds of disaster, from earthquakes and floods, to radiation bombardment. It's possible that many cities will built partly under ground, and partly under water. They might even be built inside a single building surrounded by farms. Not only will such structures allow us to conserve space, but layers of earth and water are excellent protection against radiation.\n\nMany future-minded designers and architects believe that cities of the future will survive these kinds of disasters partly by changing the materials we use to build. Instead of dead trees, we'll use living ones, combined with genetically modified algae and other plants that could purify water and air, as well as provide energy. In a recent book,Rachel Armstrong has described what she calls \"living architecture,\" where cities are built with semi-living materials that can repair their own cracks and heal themselves when damaged by a quake or just regular wear and tear. She proposes rescuing Venice from drowning by engineering a living reef underneath the city. It would be made with calcium-extruding protocells that latch onto the city's existing piles, strengthening them and attracting living creatures whose shells will eventually turn into a true ocean reef.\n\nMay 08, 2013, 6:57am\n\nUAS Attracting Interest From New Users but Still Prompt Worries, Speakers Say\n\nAUVSI President and CEO Michael Toscano appeared alongside MIT's Missy Cummings to discuss the state of the technology. Integrating unmanned aircraft into the National Airspace System will create more than 100,000 jobs, particularly in agriculture, Toscano said, and Cummings said the issue with integration is now more about psychological than technological barriers.\n\nA commercial revolution will take place in agriculture, Cummings said, and the United States is already behind.\n\n\"Japan basically does all its crop dusting with UAVs. An entire country,\" Cummings said.\n\nShe predicted that another revolution, that of unmanned cargo delivery, is already taking shape in Afghanistan in the form of the K-Max unmanned helicopter, which now supplies cargo to deployed soldiers and Marines.\n\n\u2026.\n\nAnother ongoing and growing use of unmanned aircraft is for monitoring wildlife, their habitats and the poachers who are killing some of them in record numbers, said Carter Roberts, the president and CEO of the World Wildlife Fund.\n\nGroups like the WWF simply don't always have good information about what's happening on the ground in remote locations and have started using UAS to track animals, discover poachers and then follow them back to their traders.\n\nPrivacy issues rarely come into play, because the areas are so remote and the systems help give a small technological edge against the poachers, who are better funded and better equipped, the said.\n\n\"We do not want to document the demise of nature,\" but instead use these systems to get real-time information into the hands of governments who can help the wildlife, Roberts said.\n\nMay 07, 2013, 8:07pm\n\nFunctionalism and mental boundaries\n\nAccording to extended cognitivists, the mind's location is only partly in the head.

It has become a byproduct of life itself, though is becoming less of a presence as greater activities emerge, i.e. new developing markets, scientific research, and exponentially growing technologies.\n\nU.S. anti-war activists and stockholders of Boeing have joined forces in opposition to the company's construction of drones being used for imperialist war mongering. In their show of opposition, they pointed out not only the thousands of lives being decimated as a result of drone strikes from Yemen to Afghanistan, but also the millions of dollars being wasted in the construction of these killer drones, rather than being spent on more important things like our education system.\n\nHundreds of U.K. citizens have taken up the cause against drone warfare as well. Recently over 600 activists came together and marched in opposition to what they deemed as \"drone sharing\" between the U.K. and U.S. governments and military. Not to mention opposition to their own govt's role in drone strikes throughout the ongoing war in Afghanistan.\n\nMay 06, 2013, 4:29am\n\nChina emerging as new force in drone warfare\n\nChinese aerospace firms have developed dozens of drones. Analysts say that although China still trails the U.S.\n\n\"China is following the precedent set by the U.S. The thinking is that, `If the U.S. can do it, so can we. They're a big country with security interests and so are we',\" said Siemon Wezeman, a senior fellow at the arms transfers program at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in Sweden, or SIPRI. \"The justification for an attack would be that Beijing too has a responsibility for the safety of its citizens.

The panel hosted on Wednesday by the Bi-Partisan Policy Center (BPC) followed this pattern.\n\nA crucial problem is lack of transparency. The Obama administration needs to prove that what they are doing is lawful. So far they have not succeeded. Who is making the decisions? What are the legal standards? Who are the targets and why? Restricted access to White House legal memos on the drone program inhibits Congress from constructing an adequate legal framework and from conducting oversight.\n\nNo other nation has publicly agreed with our drone program. To others, the US appears indifferent to civilian casualties.

{"text":"Discoveries And Advances\n\nSCIENCE\n\nDecember 29, 1996\n\nNew weapons in the fight against HIV\n\nThere were several advances in '96 in AIDS treatment and the study of HIV, the virus that causes the disease.\n\nProtease inhibitors were developed to reduce HIV levels in blood by disabling an enzyme necessary for AIDS virus replication, Taken with two other inhibitors, in what's called a cocktail, they can reduce HIV to undetectable levels.\n\nChemokine research also has led to new insights into how HIV infects cells. Chemokines are part of the body's natural immune system. Scientists found that HIV enters cells using chemokine receptors on the cell's surface. These findings may one day lead to treatments or vaccines against the virus\n\nNow anybody can find themselves\n\nThe military's Global Positioning System satellites were made available to civilian users. Now golf carts use the satellites to tell golfers exactly how far away from the green their ball is. And auto manufacturers have started installing GPS receivers in cars that allow drivers to pinpoint their position or even tell police or rescue workers where the car is in cases of emergency.\n\nIce on the moon?\n\nThe potential for usable reserves of ice deep inside some lunar craters was first raised in the 70s. But researchers in 1996 found some evidence that perhaps points to some ice patches on the moon's south pole. The water is thought to have been deposited by comets and water-rich meteoroids and kept frozen by a continuous 375 degrees below zero in permanently shaded areas of craters.\n\nAn unmanned probe set to launch in 1997 will look more closely to prove or disprove these initial findings.\n\nMatter of antimatter\n\nEarlier in 1996, scientists at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva announced the creation of the first ever man-made atoms of antihydrogen. Before the release of their research, the existence of antimatter was only a theory.\n\nAntimatter is the opposite of matter. Where hydrogen atoms have a positive proton core with an orbiting negative electron, antihydrogen has a negative proton and positive electron.\n\nThe experiment's antihydrogen lasted about 40 billionths of a second until it collided with ordinary matter.\n\nMars Global Surveyor, above, carries remote sensing instruments to create a global portrait on Mars by mapping its surface and studying its atmosphere, magnetic field and mineral composition. It should reach Mars in September.\n\nMars Pathfinder, right, will land on the surface in july 1997 to test the feasibility of a new low-cost method of sending a craft and its robotic rover to Mars. The rover will send back images from the surface and test the composition of Martian rocks and soil.\n\nLife on Mars?\n\nIn August, a team of NASA scien- tists announced that data from a Martian meteorite suggests primitive life may have existed on the Red Planet more than 3 billion years ago. The evidence was exciting but not conclusive.\n\nIn fact, subsequent studies of the meteorite have tended to cotradict the NASA evidence.\n\nOne research group says the rock formed in temperatures too hot to support life. Another group looking for life-related compounds found none.\n\nLucid sets U.S. record\n\nAmerican astronaut Shannon Lucid set a U.S. record for living in space for 181 days aboard the Russian Mir space station. She conducted microgravity experiments on the station with two Russian cosmonauts until the space shuttle Atlantis brought her back in November.\n\nAntiProtons interact with xenon gas and convert a small part ot its positron energy to create a positron (positively charged electron).\n\nWhen the velocity of the antiprotro, it orbits the antiproton creating an atom of antihydrogen.\n\nProbes away\n\nTwo U.S. missions to Mars successfully launched in 1996. The Mars Pathfinder and the Mars Global Surveyor crafts are due to reach the Red Planet in 1997. A Russian probe to Mars also launched in 1996 but crashed into the Pacific Ocean because of a rocket failure.\n\nEarth's core spins\n\nColumbia University scientists discovered the Earth's core rotates faster than the rest of the Earth. The finding may lead to new insights into the nature of Earth's magnetic field.\n\nThe solid iron inner core finishes one rotation about two-thirds of a second faster than the entire Earth. Every 100 years, the core gains a quarter turn on the Earth.\n\nNew ways to surf the Web\n\nComputing devices called network computers (NCs) will give users access to the Internet, word processing and other business applications. The network computer, also known as an Internet appliance, would have some benefits and drawbacks compared to a personal computer.\n\nTo cut down on costs, the NC essentially would be a stripped-down PC. It would carry the same processing power as a PC but would not have a hard drive or a lot of memory.\n\nLike PC users, NC users would be able to send and receive e-mail, write letters and papers, browse the Web, play games and use basic business software. The industry hopes to make these machines simple enough to attract buyers who don't want to buy a full-fledged computer. They also hope the low purchase and maintenance costs will attract businesses that need many computers to do tasks such as reading and updating databases."}

The process, using plants to remove contaminants, is called \"phytoremediation.\" At an experimental site at Argonne, agronomist Cristina Negri measures the trees' progress.

This is the most convincing example to date of long-term survival.\n\nBrian Schubert, a microbiologist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and colleagues studied salt crystals in a sediment core taken from Death Valley in California.

{"text":"Main menu\n\nPost navigation\n\nA new epidemic of measles has broken out in Wales. Vaccination rates fell after a paper linking the vaccine to autism was published in the 1998. The paper was later proven to be fraudulent. NPR reports: ,Most of the measles cases have been in children and teenagers between the ages of 10 and 18, according to British health officials. In that age group, vaccination rates dropped below 50 percent in some parts of England after the Wakefield paper was published.\n\nLast week, the New York Times brought news of an upcoming burger taste test in London. Scientists have been hard at work developing new lab grown meat that they hope to turn into hamburger patties.\n\n. (Indeed, Dr. Post, a physician, considers himself first and foremost a tissue engineer, and about four-fifths of his time is dedicated to studying how to build blood vessels.)\n\nYet growing meat in the laboratory has proved difficult and devilishly expensive. Dr. Post, who knows as much about the subject as anybody, has repeatedly postponed the hamburger cook-off, which was originally expected to take place in November.\n\nHis burger consists of about 20,000 thin strips of cultured muscle tissue. Dr. Post, who has conducted some informal taste tests, said that even without any fat, the tissue \"tastes reasonably good.\" For the London event he plans to add only salt and pepper.\n\nBut the meat is produced with materials \u2014 including fetal calf serum, used as a medium in which to grow the cells \u2014 that eventually would have to be replaced by similar materials of non-animal origin. And the burger was created at phenomenal cost \u2014 250,000 euros, or about $325,000, provided by a donor who so far has remained anonymous. Large-scale manufacturing of cultured meat that could sit side by side with conventional meat in a supermarket and compete with it in price is at the very least a long way off.\n\nThe scientists hope to be able to preview the meat in a taste test sometime this year.None of these techniques is new, but the researchers tested them in various combinations in more than 1,000 monkey eggs before moving on to human cells. \"They made the right improvements to the protocol,\" says Egli. \"It's big news. It's convincing. I believe it.\"\n\nThe experiments took only a few months, Mitalipov says. \"People say, you did it in monkeys in 2007. Why did it take six years in humans?\" Most of the time, he says, was spent navigating US regulations on embryo research.\n\nThe researchers carried out a battery of tests to prove that their SCNT cells could form various cell types, including heart cells that are able to contract spontaneously.\n\nTheir first cell lines were created using fetal skin cells; others were derived using donor cells from an 8-month-old patient with a rare metabolic disorder called Leigh syndrome, to prove that ESCs could be made from more mature donor cells. The technique does not require prohibitive numbers of eggs: it took 15 from one donor to produce one cell line and 5 from a different donor to make another. \"The efficiency was the most impressive thing,\" says George Daley, a stem-cell expert at Children's Hospital Boston in Massachusetts.\n\nTuberculosis still kills 1.4 million people a year, mostly in the developing world. So it is still beneficial to create new diagnostic techniques, especially when they can be used in rural communities. NPR recently reported on a team of scientists who train African giant pouch rats to sniff out the bacterium in patients' sputum:\n\nThe team trains the critters with a Pavlovian click-and-reward approach. When the rats are just a few weeks old, technicians teach the animals to associate a click sound with a small bite of mashed bananas and a special pellet of food. The next step is to link the scent of TB with the reward.\n\nA trained rat can correctly pick out a TB sample about two-thirds of the time, Beyene says. The rate increases to about 80 percent when two or three animals are put on the task.\n\nThe rats aren't as good as a trained pathologist in the U.S. with a microscope, but they get better results than many clinicians working in rural Africa can achieve, Beyene says. \"In an African setting, the sensitivity of the microscopy ranges between 30 to 40 percent,\" he explains.\n\nSo far APOPO only has around 32 rats in their TB program.\n\nCurrently the rats are being used to verify positive test results obtained from microscopic samples.\n\nThe past two weeks brought plenty of interesting science news, including the failure of a potential AIDS vaccine.

This artist's illustration shows a monoclonal antibody (green) developed by scientists at the University of Alabama binding to a 'death cell receptor' on a cancer cell (top left). This triggers the cell's inbuilt suicide program (apoptosis).\n\nIt looks like a setting for a sci-fi movie.\n\n(I wish those monoclonal antibodies were as super specific as the researchers would like them to be. They seem to end up hitting receptors on cells you don't want taken out.)\n\nDesertmar asked about the big spider trees and the reduction of malaria. I'm filching the nice caption explaining the life cycle of the organisms that cause malaria, Plasmodium spp. Plasmodium is a protozoa that requires mosquitoes to be vectors to spread the organism and needs them (as well as the human) to go through the life cycle and multiply. Mosquito nets can be extremely helpful in areas with malaria to reduce exposure to mosquitoes. I also remember when we learned about sickle cell anemia in various classes in vet school that sickle cell anemia is prevalent in people who live in areas (or have ancestry) where malaria is prevalent. The Plasmodium organism can't live in a sickled red blood cell and I remember hearing about it being an adaptation (albeit not a good adaptation) to the disease. That kind of not so great adaptation is thought to be behind cystic fibrosis which is a mutation of a chloride channel in the cell (and is prevalent in people who live or have ancestry in places where cholera is\/was endemic). I could say more but then I'll never publish this post and instead frantically keep trying to edit the draft and then finally give up.\n\nThe P.vivax life cycle involves two hosts. During a blood meal, a malaria-infected female Anopheles mosquito inoculates sporozoites into the human host (1). Sporozoites infect liver cells (2) and either enter a dormant hypnozoite state or mature into schizonts (3), which rupture and release merozoites (4). After this initial replication in the liver (exo-erythrocytic schizogony A), the parasites undergo asexual multiplication in the erythrocytes (erythrocytic schizogony B). Merozoites infect red blood cells (5). The ring stage trophozoites mature into schizonts, which rupture releasing merozoites (6). Some parasites differentiate into sexual erythrocytic stages (gametocytes) (7). Blood stage parasites are responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease.\n\nThe gametocytes, male (microgametocytes) and female (macrogametocytes), are ingested by an Anopheles mosquito during a blood meal (8). The parasites' multiplication in the mosquito is known as the sporogonic cycle (C). While in the mosquito's stomach, the microgametes penetrate the macrogametes generating zygotes (9). The zygotes in turn become motile and elongated (ookinetes) (10) which invade the midgut wall of the mosquito where they develop into oocysts (11). The oocysts grow, rupture, and release sporozoites (12), which make their way to the mosquito's salivary glands. Inoculation of the sporozoites (1) into a new human host perpetuates the malaria life cycle. (via Plasmodium vivax)\n\nThe life cycle of the parasite Toxoplasma gondii goes like this: Toxoplasma reproduces inside the intestine of a cat, which sheds the parasite in its feces. Rats then ingest the parasite when they consume food or water contaminated with cat feces. The parasite takes up residence in the rat's brain and, once the rat gets eaten by a cat, it starts the cycle all over again.\n\nResearchers have known for a few years that a rat infected with Toxoplasma loses its natural response to cat urine and no longer fears the smell. And they know that the parasite settles in the rat's amygdala, the part of the brain that processes fear and emotions. Now a new study in the journal PLoS ONE adds another bizarre piece to the tale: When male rats infected with Toxoplasma smell cat urine, they have altered activity in the fear part of the brain as well as increased activity in the part of the brain that is responsible for sexual behavior and normally activates after exposure to a female rat.\n\nThe double messages of \"you smell a cat but he's not dangerous\" and \"that cat is a potential mate\" lure the rat into the kitty's deadly territory, just what the parasite needs to reproduce. Scientists still don't know how the parasite works to alter the brain, though there apparently is a link to production of dopamine, an important neurotransmitter in the systems for decision-making and reward.\n\nThese are skeletons of victims of the Black Death from East Smithfield, London. Scientists have extracted fragments of bubonic plague DNA from their teeth. Fragments of 700-year-old DNA from the bug responsible for the Black Death have been pulled from the teeth of four plague victims buried in east London. Scientists used the degraded strands to reconstruct the entire genetic code of the deadly bacterium. It is the first time experts have succeeded in drafting the genome of an ancient pathogen, or disease-causing agent. The researchers found that a specific strain of the plague bug Yersinia pestis caused the pandemic that killed 100 million Europeans - between 30% and 50% of the total population - in just five years between 1347 and 1351.

It would be interesting to know what virulence factors were in that particular strain"}

In the last three years, six University researchers received SRFs, which is issued by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, which gives grants to institutions focused on science, technology and economics.\n\nAton \u2014 who graduated from the University in 2001 with a Bachelor of Science degree and set up her lab in July 2012 \u2014 expressed her gratitude to be included with future Nobel laureates. She will use the fellowship to continue investigating what she called the \"unsolved mystery of biology.\"\n\nAton's lab analyzes two aspects of memory and sleep: consolidation \u2014 where information is encoded into long-term memory storage \u2014 and how neurons in the visual cortex change after the organism has seen something new.\n\n\"When you're asleep, you're not looking for food, you're not looking for mates and you're not reproducing,\" Aton said. \"So, from an evolutionary standpoint, you would think it would not be selected again unless it was serving them a very, very important role that we don't understand yet.\n\nMost sleep studies involve sleep deprivation. Uniquely, Aton's lab studies sleep by turning on and off certain neurons and analyzing how those tweaks affect consolidation.\n\nFor Dick, the grant will support ongoing research in deep-sea hydrothermal vents. He said some vents include plumes that spew iron into the ocean, an element that alters photosynthesis. The vents also host organisms that survive in biologically harsh environments.\n\n\"These are examples of life in extreme environments, so they help us to define the limits of life,\" Dick said. \"They're supported primarily from chemical energy in these vents rather than energy from sunlight.\"\n\nDick said the research is basic, but identifying the enzymes these unique organisms possess has the potential to significantly advance biomedicine.\n\nThe fellowship, Dick said, does not fund a specific project, but rather will fund the five-year-old lab at the University.\n\n\"They're funding my lab to do innovative things,\" Dick said. \"What's really valuable about that is that we can take some risks. We can go after high-risk, high-reward type research.\"\n\nThis June, Dick's research team will travel to the deepest known sea vent, located in the Caribbean. In previous research, the team collected samples from vents and examined them in the lab.\n\n\"So far, what we've done is cataloging what's there, and that's generated a lot of hypotheses,\" Dick said. \"Now, we'd like to test those hypotheses with real experiments on the seafloor.\"\n\nMaldonado's electrochemistry projects seek to develop new processes for renewable energy technology. He predicts the majority of the funds will be devoted to researching an efficient way of producing crystalline, or pure silicon.\n\nIn order to produce silicon chips, which are used in technologies ranging from computers to solar cells, the silicon dioxide found in nature is heated up with charcoal to yield pure silicon. The energy-intensive process releases a large amount of carbon dioxide,which Maldonado hopes to change.\n\n\"We hope that this process will ultimately fill a niche,\" Maldonado said. \"It would allow the possibility of scaling stuff up without it having such a huge energy cost and environmental impact.\"\n\nThey are investigating a technique involving liquid metals, which involves lower temperatures and thus less energy, to produce the crystalline silicon.\n\n\"We use a liquid metal to both reduce the oxidized silicon precursor and then we use that liquid metal as a solvent to grow crystals,\" Maldonado said."}

What might NOT be readily apparent is that this lake is underwater.\n\nOff of the coast of the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula, in the Gulf of Mexico, there exist a number of undersea brine lakes. Way back in the Jurassic, the Gulf of Mexico was a shallow, mineral-rich sea. For a time, it was cut off from the ocean and dried up, leaving loads of salt deposits behind. Many years later, as the ocean reformed and the geography continued to evolve, we were left with the Gulf that we see today.\n\nBut much of that salt remains buried deep under ocean sediments. When it is exposed, super-salty brines are formed, far saltier than seawater.

Sometime, animals change their color due to it mood as well as its heath. Some animals also look very different with strange colors, but because they have to suffer from a surgeon or they were made up by their owners. Let's have a look at the photo as below to see how some animals change their color. read more\n\nBy: Joel Owens | 2008-10-29 | Culture Are you still clueless about what costume to wear this Halloween?

These chemicals are generally used to make plastic soft, for example in credit cards or plastic shower curtains. A study of nearly 3,000 children in the Journal of Pediatrics found that children between the ages of six and 19 who had been exposed to phthalates (measured by levels of breakdown products of the chemicals in their urine) had higher levels of blood pressure than those who didn't.\n\nMicro-plastic pollution is now prevalent throughout much of the the world's oceans, as a result of discarded partially- broken-down garbage. These microscopic bits of plastic are present in large enough quantities to cause significant problems for many ocean animals, as well as potentially having more significant effects on the ecosystem, or even human health. The full extent of the damage that this pollution causes is as of now unknown though, as there hasn't been much research done on the subject. And now, new research from EPFL has found that it isn't just the oceans that are filled with this micro-plastic pollution, lakes and other waterways are accumulating it as well.\n\nAlgae are an interesting natural resource because they proliferate quickly.

Young children have long been a primary audience for computer learning games. But with free games and learning sites now available all over the Internet, parents are finding that they do not need to buy software that can teach the A B C's.

The water is frigid and turbulent, food is scarce, and predators are on the prowl. So copepods, tiny herbivorous crustaceans that look like microminiaturized shrimp, head down deep and wait out the winter months in a hibernation-like state called diapause. A new study helps explain how they manage to stay down without constant swimming. Surprisingly, the trick is similar to the one sperm whales use when diving.\n\nCopepods are abundant, calorie-packed morsels that numerous marine creatures depend on for food, so biologists are keenly interested in their survival strategies, especially diapause. During diapause, copepods gather in layers, generally between 500 and 3500 meters deep depending on the species, for 6 months at a stretch. They don't eat. They don't move. Their metabolism slows way down.\n\nYet after copepods gorge on diatoms at the surface all summer, their bodies can be half fat and presumably pretty buoyant. For decades, researchers have puzzled over how diapausing copepods manage to stay at depth without wasting calories swimming downward. After all, their lives depend on it. \"If the animals can't maintain neutral buoyancy, then they burn up their energy really quickly, so they have to either reascend to the surface at the wrong time or they just die,\" says David Pond, lead author of the new paper, published this month in Limnology and Oceanography.\n\nPond, a biochemist, and Geraint Tarling, a zooplankton ecologist, both at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, U.K., collected Calanoides acutus copepods from various depths in the Southern Ocean. Analyzing the copepods' fat stores, the duo found that the deeper the animals had been caught, the more fat they tended to have and the richer the fat was in compounds called polyunsaturated wax esters. Moreover, lab tests showed that these wax esters had the peculiar property of changing from an oily liquid to a butterlike solid at temperatures and pressures that occur below 500 meters in the Southern Ocean.\n\nPond and Tarling think that, as summer ends and Antarctic copepods journey downward to enter diapause, their fat solidifies and becomes denser and thus less buoyant. Once they pass 500 meters, it functionally transforms from balloon to ballast. The descent ends at a depth where the copepod is neutrally buoyant, which depends on the composition of the fat it stored eating diatoms all summer...\"\n\n-- \"Stars, like bees, swarm around the center of bright globular cluster M15.

Yet the food they prefer to dine on is easiest to catch after dark. Most researchers assumed that penguins had poor nighttime vision, which was why they stayed out of the water after dusk.\n\nBut in a new study, two marine ecologists argue that the penguins actually have no trouble seeing in the dark. Instead, they say, penguins head for shore at night because they cannot gauge the risk of being eaten by leopard seals or killer whales. Even their migration patterns, when they move from some of the Southern Ocean's most productive waters into those that are marginal, are likely shaped by the fear of predators. \"They would rather be hungry\" than dead, says the study's lead author, David Ainley, a marine ecologist at H. T. Harvey and Associates, an ecological consulting firm in Los Gatos, California.\n\nTo show that the penguins can see in the dark, Ainley and his colleague, Grant Ballard, a marine ecologist at PRBO Conservation Science, a conservation organization in Petaluma, California, outfitted 65 adult Ad\u00e9lie penguins with time-depth recorders. The devices, which register depth and light every second, were taped to the lower back, so that they caused the least amount of drag. Data collected on nearly 22,000 of the birds' foraging dives showed that most were hunting prey at 50 to 100 meters below the surface, where the water is quite dark\u2014akin to early night. The birds also made a significant number of dives into deeper, darker waters, where they can forage successfully.\n\nAlthough the two researchers did not collect similar data on emperor penguins, other scientists have shown that these birds dive even deeper, into waters more than 500 meters below the surface. \"At that depth, it's absolutely black,\" Ainley says...\""}

The Adirondack region has its share of reported Bigfoot, or Sasquatch, encounters.When Bill Brann decided to investigate what has become the legendary Bigfoot encounters in Whitehall, Washington County, back in 1976, he didn't know then what he was getting himself into. An archaeologist by trade, Brann was intrigued and eventually sought out the parties involved.The incident on Abair Road in late August of that year involved three members of the Gosselin family in Whitehall, two of which were police officers. They reported encountering a large, hairy, muscular creature that walked upright and gave out loud, hideous screams when bright lights were shined in its eyes.\n\nExtract: Since then, some 170 sightings have been reported, the most recent one in 2003 by a man who claims he saw brilliant light moving to the surface and then a creature emerging briefly. When it disappeared again, it left a huge wave that lifted his tiny boat several feet out of the water.\n\nWay back in 1990, an episode of The Simpsons introduced Blinky, a mutated orange fish with three-eyes caught in the waters near the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, emblematic of mean Mr. Burns' callousness towards the environment -- and now, it seems, life has imitated cartoon. Recently, a group of fisherman on a lake in the Cordoba province of Argentina reeled in a fish that had an extra eye. And it just so happens that that lake is situated right next to a nuclear power plant, too. According to Infobae.com, the lake where the three-eyed fish was caught is a reservoir where hot water from the nuclear facility is pumped, and that folks living nearby have started to grow worried after seeing undeniable evidence of mutation. Never had such a fish been seen there before.\n\nTraces of bone-eating \"zombie worms\" have been found in a three-million-year-old fossil from Italy, say researchers.

The discovery suggests the worms were much more widespread throughout prehistoric oceans than thought. The findings of lead scientist Nicholas Higgs and colleagues are published in the journal Historical Biology.

In 1970, reports of a big-foot like, 7-foot tall hairy monster and its footprints instigated both the Bridgewater and Massachusetts State Police canine unit to conduct a search for a bear. However, neither man nor bear was ever found.In 1978, paranormal researcher Joseph M. DeAndrade claims to have observed another such creature as it slowly walked into the brush of the Hockomock Swamp, about 200 yards from his location. He chronicled his sighting in his 1997 book, Passing Strange: True Tales of New England Hauntings and Horrors8.Not all of the creatures that allegedly inhabit the Bridgewater Triangle are land-bound. Since 1971, several sightings of phenomenally large, black birds, with wingspans that stretched from eight to twelve feet, have been reported as well.

The principle of geometric progression has just debunked the myth of vampires .Who needs ghostbusters when you've got Newton, says a scientist who has used physics and maths to poke holes in the way Hollywood depicts ghosts and vampires.In a paper, published recently on the physics website arXiv, theoretical physicist Professor Costas Efthimiou of the University of Central Florida shows that when it comes to things supernatural, the figures just don't add up.For instance, the ability to walk through walls is a common talent of celluloid ghosts. But Newton's laws of physics suggest that if a ghost can walk it shouldn't be able to pass through walls, say Efthimiou and Cornell University postgraduate student Sohan Gandhi.Newton says a body at rest will remain at rest until it's acted on by an external force and for every action there is an equal but opposite reaction. So in order to walk, we apply a backward force on the floor with our feet, propelling the feet up and us forwards. But if a ghost can walk through walls, it must be \"material-less\", the authors argue, and incapable of exerting force. By the same token, a ghost that can walk through walls should also sink through the floor, and a ghost that can walk should be bouncing off the walls it tries to pass through .\"The depiction of ghosts walking contradicts the precept that ghosts are material-less,\" they write. Sharp drops in temperature are also associated with the arrival of a ghost. But the paper says physics, which suggests that a sense of cold is correlated more to the rate at which heat is transferred from bodies to the environment than actual temperature, can provide an explanation. What do you mean Newton says we can't walk through walls? .\"It has become almost a Hollywood clich\u00e9 that the entrance of a ghostly presence be foreshadowed by a sudden and overwhelming chill,\" they write. \"This feature of supposed ghost sightings lends itself naturally to physical explanation.\" Efthimiou and Gandhi say when a warm object is placed next to a cold object, energy flows from the warm body to the cooler body, cooling the warm body. In a room with a high window or a door with a gap, the cool air from outside displaces warm air inside, creating a system of heat cycles and eddies. The effect is increased because humans are more sensitive to rapid changes in temperature even if the absolute change is small. A 2001 UK investigation of the famous Haunted Gallery at Hampton Court, by the University of Hertfordshire's Dr Richard Wiseman, found that hidden doors were letting in draughts. This produced a combination of air currents that caused temperatures to plummet up to 2\u00b0C in some parts, the paper says. Efthimiou and Gandhi also use the mathematical principle of geometric progression to rule out the existence of vampires. They argue it would take just two and a half years for vampires to wipe out the entire human race from the day the first one appeared, based on the myth that vampires turn their victims into other vampires by sucking their blood. If vampires feed once a month, the great grandaddy of all vampires would have killed one human and produced one vampire in the first month. So in total there would be two vampires and one less human, or a tally of vampires 2, humans -1. By the next month, the 2 vampires would kill 2 humans, and so on. After n months there would be 2 x 2 x 2 ... x 2 = 2n, or a geometric progression with ratio 2.\"The vampire population increases geometrically and the human population decreases geometrically,\" they say.Using the principle of reductio ad absurdum, they conclude that vampires can't exist as their existence contradicts the existence of humans. Professor Alan Carey, dean of the Mathematical Sciences Institute at the Australian National University, says the paper successfully debunks the depictions of the supernatural in the movies. \"They poke holes in the clich\u00e9s and mistakes that are made, and that's not too hard to do,\" he says.\n\nA SKELETON exhumed from a grave in Venice is being claimed as the first known example of the \"vampires\" widely referred to in contemporary documents. Matteo Borrini of the University of Florence in Italy found the skeleton of a woman with a small brick in her mouth (see right) while excavating mass graves of plague victims from the Middle Ages on Lazzaretto Nuovo Island in Venice .At the time the woman died, many people believed that the plague was spread by \"vampires\" which, rather than drinking people's blood, spread disease by chewing on their shrouds after dying. Grave-diggers put bricks in the mouths of suspected vampires to stop them doing this, Borrini says.The belief in vampires probably arose because blood is sometimes expelled from the mouths of the dead, causing the shroud to sink inwards and tear. Borrini, who presented his findings at a meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences in Denver, Colorado, last week, claims this might be the first such vampire to have been forensically examined. The skeleton was removed from a mass grave of victims of the Venetian plague of 1576.However, Peer Moore-Jansen of Wichita State University in Kansas says he has found similar skeletons in Poland and that while Borrini's finding is exciting, \"claiming it as the first vampire is a little ridiculous\". Borrini says his study details the earliest grave to show archaeological \"exorcism evidence against vampires\".\n\nThe Russian Academy of Sciences has said it is highly likely that the Bigfoot really exists. Experts came to the conclusion after carrying out a microscopic analysis of hairs believed to belong to the yeti found in the Kuzbass region of Siberia. \u00adIn early October, professors from the USA, Canada, Sweden, Estonia and Russia came to the Kuzbass region to look for evidence that would prove the existence of the Bigfoot. The trip was not in vain \u2013 footprints apparently belonging to the yeti were found dotted all over the inside of the Azass cave where the creature is thought to live. The follicular evidence was found stuck to a huge footprint on the cave's clay floor. Professors from Moscow, St. Petersburg and Idaho Universities got themselves a couple of precious hairs each to do the necessary research. The hairs turned out to be identical to ones that allegedly belonged to a Californian yeti, another from the Russian Urals and a third from the Leningrad region, writes Komsomolskaya Pravda.The first to make the fantastic discovery was Professor Valentin Sapunov, a member of the New York Academy, St. Petersburg Scientific University \u2013 a geneticist and biophysicist. \"In St. Petersburg the hairs were examined through a special microscope,\" said Valentin Sapunov. \"This is a complicated, but a very efficient method. The hairs were sprayed with a chemical composition, and then various slices of the hairs were examined. This gave us an opportunity to draw comparisons between the hairs of different biological species,\" the professor explained.\nWhen the tests were finished, the hairs found at the Azass cave were compared to those brought from California, the Russian Urals and the Leningrad region. \"And they all proved to belong to one and the same species! The research of our American counterparts showed the same,\" said Sapunov with ill-concealed excitement.\n\nGrowing up on the prairies, the oldest daughter of a dad who liked to hunt, Cindy Dosen learned plenty about hunting and animal behaviour.But what happened to her four and a half years ago, an incident that changed her life, was unlike anything she witnessed during those years.\"Having that experience [hunting] really prepared me for going out in the woods,\" said Dosen. \"But it did not prepare me for what I heard that day.\"It was around 12: 45 p.m. on April 2, 2007, and Dosen was taking photographs near Maple Mountain of tree structures that resembled bigfoot evidence she had previously seen online. Suddenly, a group of deer ran past on a game trail, clearly fleeing something - Dosen suspected a cougar.When she emerged onto the road, she could see a dark shadow, and took off running back to where she had parked. The creature she had spotted repeatedly let out a \"yell\/scream\/roar\" - she later came close to duplicating the noise online by combining the sound of a mountain gorilla and an African lion - and followed her, about 20 metres behind, she suspects, breaking trees and pushing bushes over, until she got to her car.\"It's like it was herding me along,\" she recalled.Dosen drove home to Duncan, walked in the door and started crying, bewildered as to what had just happenedRead rest here: \n\nHe's called the national capital home for a while, but doesn't like to stay in one place for too long.

Driven by the desire for self-improvement and by scientific curiosity, it was possible for these amateur microscopists to make genuinely original scientific discoveries - and many did, after first honing their skills with the help of books like those illustrated above: Philip Henry Gosse's Evenings at the Microscope; the anonymously published Half-hours in the Tiny World; M.C Cooke's Rust, Smut, Mildew and Mould: An Introduction to the study of Microscopic Fungi ; and the Reverend J.G.Wood's Common Objects Under the Microscope, a rather shambolically organised volume with attractive colour plates. A favourite method of generating specimens for microscopy was to create an infusion of rotting plant material, and sample it at regular intervals. A whole succession of minute, single-celled organisms (then called protozoa, now known as protists) appeared; a single infusion could provide weeks of amusement for the whole family. I set up an infusion of decaying grass in a jar of water about three weeks ago and the predatory protist above, that goes by the name of Litonotus, is thriving in the scum that's floating on the surface of the water. It's propelled by a fringe of rhythmically beating hairs (cilia), rather like a Mohican haircut, at the front end and can change shape readily, engulfing food particles in the distended end of its body.

Just hours after birth, the eyes of newborns are drawn to facelike patterns. An adult brain knows it's seeing a face within 100 milliseconds, and it takes just over a second to realize that two different pictures of a face, even if they're lit or rotated in very different ways, belong to the same person.\n\nPerhaps the most vivid illustration of our gift for recognition is the magic of caricature -- the fact that the sparest cartoon of a familiar face, even a single line dashed off in two seconds, can be identified by our brains in an instant. It's often said that a good caricature looks more like a person than the person himself. As it happens, this notion, counterintuitive though it may sound, is actually supported by research. In the field of vision science, there's even a term for this seeming paradox -- the caricature effect -- a phrase that hints at how our brains misperceive faces as much as perceive them.\n\nIn\n\nCommunities in the Rocky Mountain region of North America rely on snowmelt to provide water for drinking, sanitation, irrigation, and industry.

{"text":"Friday, February 11, 2005\n\nAnimal lifespans and space-filling curves\n\nScience News has a review article on the 3\/4 law of animal lifespans and metabolism.\n\nIn 1883, German physiologist Max Rubner proposed that an animal's metabolic rate is proportional to its mass raised to the 2\/3 power. This idea was rooted in simple geometry. If one animal is, say, twice as big as another animal in each linear dimension, then its total volume, or mass, is 23 times as large, but its skin surface is only 22 times as large. Since an animal must dissipate metabolic heat through its skin, Rubner reasoned that its metabolic rate should be proportional to its skin surface, which works out to mass to the 2\/3 power.\n\nIn 1932, however, animal scientist Max Kleiber of the University of California, Davis looked at a broad range of data and concluded that the correct exponent is 3\/4, not 2\/3. In subsequent decades, biologists have found that the 3\/4-power law appears to hold sway from microbes to whales, creatures of sizes ranging over a mind-boggling 21 orders of magnitude. \u2026\n\nRubner was on the right track in comparing surface area with volume, but that an animal's metabolic rate is determined not by how efficiently it dissipates heat through its skin but by how efficiently it delivers fuel to its cells.\n\nRubner should have considered an animal's \"effective surface area,\" which consists of all the inner surfaces across which energy and nutrients pass from blood vessels to cells, says West. These surfaces fill the animal's entire body, like linens stuffed into a laundry machine.\n\nThe idea, West says, is that a space-filling surface scales as if it were a volume, not an area. If you double each of the dimensions of your laundry machine, he observes, then the amount of linens you can fit into it scales up by 23, not 22. Thus, an animal's effective surface area scales as if it were a three-dimensional, not a two-dimensional, structure.\n\nThis creates a challenge for the network of blood vessels that must supply all these surfaces. In general, a network has one more dimension than the surfaces it supplies, since the network's tubes add one linear dimension. But an animal's circulatory system isn't four dimensional, so its supply can't keep up with the effective surfaces' demands. Consequently, the animal has to compensate by scaling back its metabolism according to a 3\/4 exponent.\n\nThough the original 1997 model applied only to mammals and birds, researchers have refined it to encompass plants, crustaceans, fish, and other organisms. The key to analyzing many of these organisms was to add a new parameter: temperature.\n\nMammals and birds maintain body temperatures between about 36\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C, regardless of their environment. By contrast, creatures such as fish, which align their body temperatures with those of their environments, are often considerably colder. Temperature has a direct effect on metabolism\u2014the hotter a cell, the faster its chemical reactions run.\n\nIn 2001, after James Gillooly, a specialist in body temperature, joined Brown at the University of New Mexico, the researchers and their collaborators presented their master equation, which incorporates the effects of size and temperature. An organism's metabolism, they proposed, is proportional to its mass to the 3\/4 power times a function in which body temperature appears in the exponent. The team found that its equation accurately predicted the metabolic rates of more than 250 species of microbes, plants, and animals. These species inhabit many different habitats, including marine, freshwater, temperate, and tropical ecosystems. \u2026\n\nA single equation predicts so much, the researchers contend, because metabolism sets the pace for myriad biological processes. An animal with a high metabolic rate processes energy quickly, so it can pump its heart quickly, grow quickly, and reach maturity quickly.\n\nUnfortunately, that animal also ages and dies quickly, since the biochemical reactions involved in metabolism produce harmful by-products called free radicals, which gradually degrade cells.\n\n\"Metabolic rate is, in our view, the fundamental biological rate,\" Gillooly says. There is a universal biological clock, he says, \"but it ticks in units of energy, not units of time.\" \u2026\n\nThe team's master equation may resolve a longstanding controversy in evolutionary biology: Why do the fossil record and genetic data often give different estimates of when certain species diverged? \u2026\n\nThe problem is that there is no universal clock that determines the rate of genetic mutations in all organisms, Gillooly and his colleagues say. They propose in the Jan. 4 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that, instead, the mutation clock\u2014like so many other life processes\u2014ticks in proportion to metabolic rate rather than to time.\n\nThe DNA of small, hot organisms should mutate faster than that of large, cold organisms, the researchers argue. An organism with a revved-up metabolism generates more mutation-causing free radicals, they observe, and it also produces offspring faster, so a mutation becomes lodged in the population more quickly.\n\nWhen the researchers use their master equation to correct for the effects of size and temperature, the genetic estimates of divergence times\u2014including those of rats and mice\u2014line up well with the fossil record."}

{"text":"Sensational Science in the Popular Press: Can Anyone Get it Right?\n\nThis month for \"Sensational Science\" I decided to resist my go-to sensational blogs and look around some popular press (OK, TV). How popular? I'm talking ABC, FOX, BBC, etc. It doesn't get more popular than that. But before I get into some of the misleading headlines these giants dole out, I want to take a moment to reflect on the prominence of science news in the most popular of presses: the websites of these TV organizations. For lack of a better order, I'll go alphabetical.\n\nThe ABC News page does not have the word \"science\" anywhere on it. Instead you must choose either \"Tech\" or \"Health\".\n\nThe BBC however, has a link to their \"Science\" section in three places: very top, very bottom, and smack in the middle of the page. And their science section is quite good (pretend I used a British accept for \"quite good\"!)\n\nCBS is just like ABC, although once you click on \"Tech\" they start talking about \"Sci\/Tech\" which is better than nothing. I think.\n\nCNN also has the \"Health\" or \"Tech\" options from their homepage, with no science. Although, in searching the homepage for any mention of the word \"science\" I came across the headline: \"Science behind 'teh intarwebs'\". I literally couldn't bring myself to read the article, so let me know if it is any good.\n\nFOX has a \"SciTech\" link from their homepage, and that section has multiple sub-sections about different science and tech fields. In contrast, the \"Tech\" sections on the other broadcasters' sites focus on technology, the internet, gadgets, etc. instead of the natural sciences.\n\nFinally, NBC (in this case MSNBC) has a \"Tech & Science\" link at the top of their page and when you roll over it this crazy menu drops down and you can choose \"Science\" or other science and tech related sub-sections.\n\nOf course, that's not to say the quality there is great- two of the MSNBC top science stories were about mythical beasts: one about the Yeti and one about the kraken. And in their \"Tech\" beat CNN reports the BlackBerry outage has impacted almost every planet. If the other planets NEVER have BlackBerry can you really count it as an outage?\n\nIs that really science? Or is that really what scientific news has boiled down to? Either lumping it in with \"tech\" or not giving it much coverage at all. Plus, as I'll show below, even the coverage science gets is pretty weak.\n\nWhy it's misleading: The headline and opening paragraph of this article imply eating fruits and veggies can \"have an effect on genes linked to heart disease.\" Really? What you EAT can alter your genetic material? The article goes on to state \"that eating fruits and vegetables may actually change a gene variant, called 9p21, that is one of the strongest predictors for heart disease.\" That seemed far out to me, and of course that's not what the actual study suggests. Instead, the direct quote from the actual researcher notes: \"We found that in people with this high-risk gene who consumed a diet rich in vegetables and fruits, their risk came down to that of people who don't have that gene.\" That makes more sense, what you eat isn't going to change your genes. Whew!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWhy it's misleading: The reporting isn't too far off, but the author of the article interviews \"a co-author of the study, which pointedly does not use the word \"cloning\" to describe the results.\" In this way, the impression is given that they really did cloning, but are too nervous to bring up such a controversial topic. In reality, it is probably more likely that the researcher didn't call it cloning, because it isn't really cloning. They didn't create an exact genetic copy- they knew they had extra chromosomes in their cell lines. They were abnormal. They were close to making a clone, and it might be easier to explain it that way to lay people but call it what it is, and don't call it what it isn't! If they're able to use this technique without ending up with extra genetic material, then it would be a clone. How would you write that new story? \"Scientists who cloned are able to actually clone?\"\n\n.\n\n.\n\nNick Fahrenkopf is a Ph.D. candidate studying nanobiosciences- applying physics and engineering concepts and techniques to biological and medical problems.

{"text":"A SECOND LOOK THAT TAKES ONLY SECONDS\n\nSaturday, February 11, 2012\n\nOur DNA determines our preference in perfumes. Previous research found the MCH (major histocompatability complex) genes are related to being sexually attracted to someone else's scent. In a study published in the International Journal of Cosmetic Science, 116 volunteers \u2013 male and female \u2013 were asked to smell 10 scents commonly found in perfumes including rose, cinnamon, cedar and moss. Although they smelled them in different concentrations and settings, the volunteers' previously tested variations in MCH genes correlated with the perfumes they liked best. I'm guessing it won't be long before a perfume manufacturer markets a line of perfumes called \"Geneius\".\n\nTalking about an event helps us remember it. In a study published in the journal Child Development, 46 children ages 27-51 months played with a toy for 2 days. On day 3 the children were asked if they remembered the toy and how to use it. Six years later they were shown a medal they'd received for their participation and asked if they remembered why they got it. Twenty percent remembered. They were the children who had talked more about the toy after the study. Talking about something shortly after it happens helps memory develop \u2013 unless the researchers are \"toying\" with us.\n\nBirds are singing differently. According to research published in the journal Behavioral Ecology, city noise pollution is causing birds with low-pitched songs \u2013 like gray catbirds and robins \u2013 to sing at a higher pitch. Birds with high-pitched songs \u2013 like Northern cardinals \u2013 are singing at a lower pitch because buildings absorb and refract their songs. Bird song \u2013 like human speech \u2013 is learned. Science has already discovered birds hear subtle differences in their songs when choosing a mate. Because city and country birds of the same species will have different songs, \"birds of a feather may no longer fly together\".\n\nWhen trees branch, the smaller branches have an exact mathematical relationship to the branch they came from. Leonardo DaVinci knew that in the 1500's. In 2011 a French physicist stated \"Leonardo's rule\" mathematically. The sum of the surface areas of the two daughter branches is equal to the surface area of the mother branch. According to the French physicist, if you wanted to design a tree that was best able to withstand high winds, it would branch according to Leonardo's rule. However, trees seem to have figured that out on their own. That information is obviously part of the \"tree of knowledge\".\n\nTuesday, November 24, 2009\n\nA \"Bikestation\" for 130 bikes, lockers and a small repair shop opened outside Washington, D.C. in October 2009. It is conveniently located next to the Metro subway exit at Union Station for use by commuters who want to cycle in the city. For an annual membership or a daily usage fee, the system provides secure storage for bicycles, reduces traffic and encourages exercise. An annual survey of Bikestation users in California showed that 30% previously commuted by car. Comparable facilities in Germany and Japan handle 3,000-4,000 bicycles. Obviously, the idea of Bikestations has been \"peddled\" better outside the U.S.\n\nNot every good idea, however, involves new technology. California winemakers have tried a variety of ways to scare off grape-loving starlings at harvest time. Because shotguns and propane cannons scared the birds away only temporarily and netting rows of grapes is expensive, winemakers are turning to falconry. Falcons can spot starlings half a mile away and can fly 150 mph in pursuit of their prey. Many prominent vineyards \u2013 including E&J Gallo \u2013 have hired falconers. Releasing 1 falcon twice a day keeps the starlings away from the grapes. Solving this problem just needed a bird's-eye view.\n\nMany states are looking for ideas to prevent prison inmates from using cell phones to participate in illegal activities. A maximum sentence of 5 years and a $15,000 fine isn't enough to stop them and under current law the FCC allows only federal agencies to jam cell phone signals. As a result, New Jersey and Virginia are using specially trained dogs to sniff out phones. Phones have been found in light fixtures, Bibles and body cavities. Some phones have been hidden in jars of peanut butter to fool the dogs, but these dogs have a nose for their job.\n\nNutrition and economic experts are promoting the idea of a 1 cent tax on every ounce of sweetened beverages. This \"soda tax\" would discourage people from consuming extra calories while generating needed revenue. Thirty-three states tax soft drinks, but the average tax is 5.2% - only 5 cents on a 12 ounce can costing $1. The proposed soda tax would be 12 cents. A national soda tax would generate almost $15 billion its first year and an average 2-pound weight loss for soda drinkers. Because many people aren't aware that sugared beverages are a major cause of weight problems, the soda tax would help them \"pay\" attention."}

E-mail Alan, or connect via Facebook, Twitter or Google+.\n\n'Typical face' is Chinese ... for now\n\nBased on the world's demographics, the typical human is a 28-year-old Chinese man \u2014 but humanity's most common face could be radically different in just 20 years' time.\n\nThe \"typical face\" of our species was unveiled this week in the National Geographic video below, and it's featured as well in a poster supplement in the March issue of National Geographic magazine. The typicality project is part of a special report on global human population, which is expected to hit 7 billion by the end of this year.\n\nFor example, the world population's average age is 28, which is factored into the face's look. There are slightly more men than women on Earth, which is why the \"typical\" human is male. And the world's largest ethnic group is Han Chinese, making up an estimated 1.1 billion of the global population, which is why the magazine's editors went with an Asian look.\n\nAs for the specific look of that face, that's based on an visual averaging process conducted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which can draw upon tens of thousands of face photographs collected for a variety of databases over the past decade. One of these databases is part of a long-range study on face-recognition software for Asian ethnic groups. (Which sounds slightly scary.)\n\nThe fuzzy, averaged-out image was passed along to digital artist Joe Lertola of Bryan Christie Design, who re-created the face photo for National Geographic's poster using 7,000 computer-generated human figures. An interactive graphic on National Geographic's website provides more detail about the creation of the face and lets you zoom in on the composite image.\n\nHere are a few more factoids about the typical human:\n\nHe's right-handed, because more people are righties than lefties.\n\nHe makes less than $12,000 a year, in line with the world's average income.\n\nHe doesn't have a bank account, but he does have a cell phone.\n\nBecause National Geographic defines its typical ethnic group as the biggest plurality in the world population, that ethnicity could change over time \u2014 and in fact, the population of India is projected to surpass the Chinese population by 2030. At that time, India is expected to have more than 1.53 billion people, while China is expected to reach its peak population of 1.46 billion and begin a slow decline. By 2030, the total tally of the world's population will be well on its way to a projected peak of 9 billion or more.\n\nIf current trends hold true, the generic face of humanity will eventually be Indian, not Chinese. And there may be more changes in store as global population shifts. Isn't that just typical?\n\nUpdate for 12:30 a.m. ET March 5: A lot of the commenters are wondering whether it's really fair to use an all-Chinese face as a symbol for the world's entire population \u2014 and John Tomanio, senior graphics editor for National Geographic magazine, agreed that the concept is open to debate.\n\n\"There are many ways to define 'typical,' that's true,\" he told me in a follow-up phone call. The decision to go with an average Chinese face was based on the idea that the world's \"largest ethnic group was Han Chinese.\"\n\n\"We didn't mean it to be provocative,\" Tomanio said. \"But afterward we realized, 'OK, people might want to talk about this.'\" Which is fine with him. So feel free to talk about this in the comment section below, but please take the high road rather than the low road in your discussion. The Cosmic Log community has a reputation to uphold."}

Hello! I'm Chris Smith and also in this the March edition of the Chemistry World podcast are Bibiana Campos-Seijo, Nina Notman and Phil Broadwith.\n\n(Promo)\n\nThe Chemistry World Podcast is brought to you by the Royal Society of Chemistry. Look us up online at chemistryworld dot org.\n\n(End Promo)\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nFirst up this month, home sperm counting - sounds intriguing. Phil tell us more.\n\nInterviewee - Phillip Broadwith\n\nAbsolutely Chris. Well, one of the major problems that affects couples trying to have children and failing is the possibility that the man's sperm isn't possibly as effective as it ought to be and one of the things that might be wrong is that they're just aren't enough of them, so they need to be counted. At the moment, what happens is that you have to take your sample to a hospital, where a technician in a lab sits down with a microscope and physically counts the sperm. But obviously that's less than ideal. You've got to get your sample to the hospital relatively quickly and there's a level of human error. You've got to start manhandling the samples and whatever. So, it's not ideal.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nOkay those are constraints in mind, what's solution.\n\nInterviewee - Phillip Broadwith\n\nWell, Loes Segerink at the University of Twente in the Netherlands thinks that the solution is to have an automated microfluidic device and that's exactly what she has come up with.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nTalk us through it.\n\nInterviewee - Phillip Broadwith\n\nYour sample of sperm is mixed with some polystyrene beads and then passed through a microfluidic channel which detects the electrical impedance of the solution that's going past it and each kind of cell has a particular signal associated with it as do the polystyrene beads. Polystyrene beads with a known concentration within the sample, therefore if you compare the count of beads to sperm, you can get a concentration of the sperm.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd this is much quicker and presumably more reproducible than using a person to do that job?\n\nInterviewee - Phillip Broadwith\n\nYeah, absolutely and it doesn't involve having to take your sample to a specialised lab. So I mean, if you really want to do, you can have one at home or more realistically, we're talking about may be at a doctors surgery.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nWhen you say, have this at home, are they actually in a position where this is a device that could be rolled out tomorrow or is there still lots of development to do?\n\nInterviewee - Phillip Broadwith\n\nNo, they're still at the sort of prototyping stage. Obviously, there would have to be some way of getting the human sample of sperm into the device.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSome people are good, ain't Phil.\n\nInterviewee - Phillip Broadwith\n\nYes, because we can't count on that. So, we need a slightly more reliable mechanism for getting it in there.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nOkay. Well, we'll see how that turns out because it will be interesting too when they actually start trying it, whether it does bear fruit. Anyway, thank you Phil.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nBibi, assuming that someone doesn't have a low sperm count and they do have some children, we're all taught about the risk of second hand smoke, but there's this new concept that you're saying is third hand smoke. Tell us about this.\n\nInterviewee - Bibiana Campos-Seijo\n\nYes, this new term has been coined to describe nicotine residues that deposit on household surfaces.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nNicotine?\n\nInterviewee - Bibiana Campos-Seijo\n\nYes, nicotine residues from smoking have been observed in household surfaces and the concern here is that they further react with compounds from the environment at home. Gases like nitrous acid or nitrogen dioxide are now known to react with the nicotine residues and produce carcinogenic compounds.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo let me just check if I've got this straight in my mind. The person smokes a cigarette. The materials that the cigarette produces, they breathe out into the air. They deposit on wall surfaces and other surfaces. They then come back off the surfaces at a different rate and react with chemicals in the air to produce things that can cause cancer.\n\nInterviewee - Bibiana Campos-Seijo\n\nAbsolutely, that's exactly what happens. This group of researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in California experimented in a truck. Actually they used some cellulose inside a truck that was driven by a smoker and they monitored the cellulose for three days. They took it the lab and they found that three carcinogenic compounds had been produced as a consequence of the reaction that I was talking about. Two of them had already been found in tobacco smoke, but the third one is one that is not usually present in tobacco smoke and toxicological studies are needed.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nDo you know, what's really worried me about this though, is that you know, parents are pretty clued up, if you say to them, you're having some young children or you got some young children, don't smoke around them. They'll say yes I don't, but I still smoke, I get outside. So, this presumably means they're going to come in with that smoke material still on their clothes perhaps even on their hair and then presumably they'll just exude that into the air and they'll make those chemicals in the air in their house. So, even though they've taken the main body of the smoke outside, there's still the effect going indoors when they come back.\n\nInterviewee - Bibiana Campos-Seijo\n\nObviously, in the case of clothes or hair, you will obviously wash it frequently, but if you're talking about wallpaper for example, you can have children exposed for a weeks or even months. So it is a concern for sure. What hasn't been determined yet is how much of a concern it is. Interviewer - Chris Smith Indeed. I was going to say, its one thing to show this can happen when you're using very sensitive pieces of equipment, its another to prove it has a clinically relevant effect, isn't it that there's enough of this being produced to then trigger disease relative to all the other things we're being exposed to.\n\nInterviewee - Bibiana Campos-Seijo\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nIn the environment.\n\nInterviewee - Bibiana Campos-Seijo\n\nYeah, absolutely. At the moment what they have shown is the chemistry and then the next step would be to see how much exposure it generates. One of the concerns obviously with children is that they interact very differently from adults with their environment and it has estimated that their exposure could be 20 times higher than adults. So it is a concern, but we need to wait and see.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo, if the walls are yellow, probably worth giving the room a miss. Thank you Bibi.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nNow, how do you paint a Formula 1 car? Answer, quickly. Mark Korsmit.\n\nInterviewee - Mark Korsmit\n\nSo in the past, paints is often being used for protection in aesthetics to maintain gloss for centuries and the secondly it's about 200-years-old, so that's where it's derived from. However, you see more and more, their performance is being used as a field for development for paints, especially Formula 1 is critical. First and foremost, it's a substrate. These are not regular substrate or steel, aluminum etc, used on cars, but more the modern materials, composites and carbon. Besides that, the paint has to endure tremendous heat, vibration, battering by stones etc, from the track. On top of that, you also have to bear in mind that performance can be enhanced by using specific types of paints, but next to that a formula one car is well produced once and then used through out the season, but what you see is that the body itself changes as the season progresses and that means constant changing of panels, etc and they need to be painted. So, if you're able to deliver paint that cures faster than previous, it allows the engineers to have more time for finalising the designs and getting them to the racetrack.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nFor someone who probably spent far too much time eroding brain cells, by being exposed to these kinds of things, when I was a bit younger. Could you just explain when you put with the spray gun onto a surface, chemically speaking, what is actually going on?\n\nInterviewee - Mark Korsmit\n\nBasically, paint is consisting of a system. You start with a primer, for making sure there's a good bond and also a flat surface. After that, we apply a chrome, so that's the actual chrome look that you see and that's basically colour, but then a very special pigment because if there's too much resin in there, then you get a dull silver-like look, so then it will be polished and it really looks like high chrome and that's just for the effect. We finish it off with a clear coat which is a varnish and it's a two component product and that is actually the product that ensures the colour remains throughout the reason, but it also provides protection for rain, for UV light, stone chips etc. So, basically it's a three-stage system.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nIn the old days, we used to be able to get away with putting just about anything in paints, as long as it looked good. These days, the European Union are not so happy about that, nor are the people who have to spray these things on. So how has this industry had to respond to changing regulation and changes in the rules about which chemicals you can and can't use?\n\nInterviewee - Mark Korsmit\n\nIn the industry of coating, there's constant evolution and every now and then some revolution, but what you see that certain pigments are being restricted like lead-containing pigments and you see that happening throughout the industry on a constant pace. So AkzoNobel is continuously screening their raw materials for suspect materials and when materials are suspects they are not restricted; we will try to minimize the use of it or even replace with new alternatives, this is one of the key areas. On the chemist though, if it's on a molecule base, there is specific restrictions in place. First and foremost, its VOC emissions or the compounds of volatile organic compounds, you've seen in the past it could contain about 800 grams, 900 grams per litre. However, we're utilizing new technology, reducing the VOC compounds to 420 grams per litre maximum for a base coat and a varnish. The primer could be up to 540 grams and that is a significant reduction from what it was in the past and we use for example, water-bond technology for that. But you see the environment being managed also on another area. We're now using a new drying method and that is revolutionary in combination with paints and that reduces the CO2 emission with about 80%. Why CO2 emission, because the normal curing process of paint is by heating it up, so you heat the environment, the object up and that obviously is normally using natural gas and we've changed that system with McLaren. So therefore the CO2 emission caused by this heating up, which is significant, is reduced by 80%.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nYou mentioned that performance is important; obviously it's important in formula one.\n\nInterviewee - Mark Korsmit\n\nYes.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nFractions of a second determine who wins and who loses, but also given the number of miles that the average car is driving on the road, if you can get paint that is going to give slightly less air resistance, that presumably is going to translate into a huge environmental saving?\n\nInterviewee - Mark Korsmit\n\nExactly, so every small bit will contribute, although I must say that the Formula 1 environment is so different than from the normal conditions of our car, you have to think about exposure, formula one car last maximum for one season, whilst the cars that you and I drive have to last for 10-20 years and the paints from ours has got a lifetime warranty. So then if you talk about air resistance in these kinds of areas, we can make a sacrifice for formula one, a sacrifice, which we're not likely to be able to do so on a normal car, but also the speed generated and air resistance has got a strict relation with the speeds and object drives and you can imagine that 300 kilometres now on a track is a little bit different than we can do on a motor way. We utilize this technology also in our marine protective business unit, where we, for example apply it to the hull of a ship and because it's such low friction, it reduces drag of the ship and saves up significant amounts of fuel consumption and I heard the number between 6 and 7% is feasible.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nWhich of course is going to translate into a reduction in carbon emissions and things? Do you get to drive the F1 car?\n\nInterviewee - Mark Korsmit\n\nNo, the dream is still alive.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nWell, as they say, you can but dream. That was Mark Korsmit, he's from the Dutch Paint Specialists AkzoNobel.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nThis is the Chemistry World with me Chris Smith. Still to come, how scientists are tying molecules a knot and a revolutionary new battery design, but first Nina, now not everyone likes them, but spider silk definitely likes water. Tell us more.\n\nInterviewee - Nina Notman\n\nSo Chinese scientists from the Chinese Academy Of Scientists in Beijing have been looking how the spider silk captured the morning dew and they published this work in the journal, Nature. So when they went to find out how nature worked, they also wanted to use the information to make artificial materials to capture water from air. So they've been looking at the hackled orb-weaver spider webs using a scanning electron microscope and they found that the dry thread has loose hydrophilic puffs of very fine silk, in particular places along its length and when the web is exposed to water vapour, that's when changes occur, so these puffs shrink and become rough, then form knots and as the water kind of settles onto the web, it slides along the smooth silk and accumulates into the rough knot, so this is where the big droplets of water appear.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nIt's fascinating because that's saying basically a spider web is not a homogeneous structure along the length of each thread, there are these knots separated by these thin slippery bits, which is why you get the water collecting in these blobs.\n\nInterviewee - Nina Notman\n\nYes. That's these scientists have seen, yes.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nDo they think that this has got some kind of application or industrial application, or is this purely just an academic interest?\n\nInterviewee - Nina Notman\n\nYeah, they think industrially it could be useful for any kind of application, where you'd want to collect water from air and also from a chemistry point of view they could be used as filters to draw substances after chemical reactions.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nIf you wanted to do that how would you do it?\n\nInterviewee - Nina Notman\n\nFor having looking at the natural material, they've now been trying to make artificial materials. So they've made an artificial spider silk of nylon fibres and coated it with polymers and they've looked at the structures and this again under the microscope and they've found that when it is dry there are these really tiny knots and when it is exposed to mist, it behaves in a very similar material to the natural ones.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd that presumably collects water?\n\nInterviewee - Nina Notman\n\nYeah. And collects water in the same ways, so they found that initially random droplets appear on the surface and these kind of the droplets slide along the artificial body silk to form the bigger droplet in the knot area.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo presumably then we're talking rain catching machines, mist filters to get water in areas where there isn't much rain there?\n\nInterviewee - Nina Notman\n\nHopefully so, yeah.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nDo we know why the spiders do it though?\n\nInterviewee - Nina Notman\n\nWe don't know why the spiders do it, because normally when people are looking at spider silk, they're considering its extreme strength and people haven't looked into this before.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo, I guess from one knotty issue, knots in spider webs from Nina Notman to another knotty problem is you're tying molecules in knots, Phil tell us about this.\n\nInterviewee - Phillip Broadwith\n\nYes Chris. You'd really struggle to see these kinds of knots with an electron microscope; we'd need something a lot more powerful. We're talking about single molecules that are tied up into a true knot and if you want to know what a true knot is, go and ask a mathematician, but be sure to have a pillow handy because it might be a lengthy explanation, basically it comes down to the fact that to be a true knot, you have to have all of the ends tied up together. You can't unravel a knot.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo shoe lace, a knot in a shoe. That's not a true knot then?\n\nInterviewee - Phillip Broadwith\n\nAbsolutely not. No.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo what have they done to do this chemically?\n\nInterviewee - Phillip Broadwidth\n\nOkay, what Chris Hunter and his group at Sheffield in the UK have done is take a long stringy molecule, which has three sides that combined to a metal. When you add zinc to that, you get two of the metal binding sides, make loops out of sort of in the middle bit of the string, but then for the third one to get into position to bind it has to physically thread through the loop. So you then end up with what's called an open knot. So, the molecules has been tied up a little bit, but it still has the ends free.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo that doesn't' fulfil the criteria then? Does it? It's got the ends free. So what do you then?\n\nInterviewee - Phillip Broadwith\n\nSo that's where the next stage of the chemistry comes in. You got to try and tie those knots together. First of all, they tried using an ester bond, but the problem with that was what you really wanted to do is be able to get the metal out of the middle, when they tried to use chloride or lithium sulfide to get the metal out, it either just did nothing or it broke the ester bond. So what the group then did was to use alkene metathesis to close the loops instead. So you then have a true trefoil knot, which is a little bit like the sort of Celtic knots that you see. It's a very simplified form of that.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nBeautiful. But what can you actually do with it?\n\nInterviewee - Phillip Broadwith\n\nMolecular knots are very interesting from the point of view of comparing them with things that happen in nature. There are certain proteins which are naturally knotted up, but they tend to be mostly open knots. The other thing to thinks about what these knots is that they're handed, they're chiral so if you can make a knot structure, which is itself chiral and then you can decorate it with various other bits to do kind of catalytic chemistry or whatever, you can end up with a very rigid and very spatially defined catalyst which should hopefully give you some interesting catalytic activity.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd just for the sake of argument, how big are these knots?\n\nInterviewee - Phillip Broadwith\n\nWell, if you're comparing them to say a drug molecule that are a bit bigger than that because you have to have enough length to kind of fold up on itself, but they're nowhere near the size of a protein molecule for example. We're talking a relatively short polymer chain.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd given how hard they're to make, are we close to actually being able to make them in a viable way or is this just someone saying we can do this, but its going to be a little while before we can do anything useful with it?\n\nInterviewee - Phillip Broadwidth\n\nYeah, I mean, this kind of research is still very much at the early stages. People are still exploring what shapes we can make, whether we can make knots even more complex than this kind of very simple trefoil knot. So, yeah, we're still at very early stages and any kind of application is going to be a little way off. Because first of all, you've got to be able to make one hand of the knot rather than the other, so that's another problem entirely.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo they've got the knot sorted. Now researchers just need the nano bow tie to practice on. Thank you Phil. And now, here's Meera Senthilingam, with news of another chemical offering from Chemistry World.\n\nInterviewer - Meera Senthilingam\n\nEach week, the Chemistry in its eement podcasts bring you the tales, trials and tribulations behind the discovery and chemistry of the elements in our periodic table. So to you give a taster of what these podcasts reveal, I thought it best to share the element that some consider to be, the king of the elements. Well, that's Brian Clegg's view at least.\n\nInterviewee - Brian Clegg\n\nForget 10 Downing Street or 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the most prestigious address in the Universe is number one in the periodic table, Hydrogen. In science, simplicity and beauty are often equated and that makes hydrogen as beautiful as they come; a single proton and a lone electron making the most compact element in existence. Hydrogen has been around since atoms first formed in the residue of the Big Bang. It is the most abundant element by far. Despite billions of years of countless stars fusing hydrogen into helium, it still makes up 75% of the detectable content of the universe. This light colourless, highly flammable gas carries on its uniqueness by having the only named isotopes and some of the best known at that deuterium with an added neutron in the nucleus and tritium with two neutrons. Hydrogen is essential for life in the universe and just about everything. Without hydrogen we wouldn't have the sun to give us heat and light. There would be no useful organic compounds to form the building blocks of life and that most essential substance for life's existence, water would not exist. It's only thanks to a special trick of hydrogen's that we can use water at all. Hydrogen forms weak bonds between molecules latching onto adjacent oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine atoms. It's these hydrogen bond that gives water many of its properties. If they didn't exist, the boiling point of water will be below minus 70 degrees Celsius. Liquid water would not feature on the earth. Hydrogen was the unwitting discovery of Paracelsus, the 16th century Swiss alchemist also known as Theophrastus Phillippus Aureolus Bombastus von Hohenheim. He found that something flammable bubbled off metals that were dropped into strong acids, unaware of the chemical reaction that was forming metal salts and releasing hydrogen. However, the first person to realize hydrogen was a unique substance, one he called inflammable air was Henry Cavendish, the Nobel ancestor of William Cavendish, who later gave his name to what would become the world's most famous physics laboratory in Cambridge. Between the 1760s and 1780s, Henry not only isolated hydrogen, but found that when it burnt it combined with oxygen or dephlogisticated air as it was called to produce water. These clumsy terms was swept aside by the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier who changed chemical naming for good, calling the inflammable air, hydrogen, the gene or creator or hydro - water. Because hydrogen is so light, the pure element isn't commonly found on the earth. It would just float away. The prime components of the air, nitrogen and oxygen are 4 and 16 times heavier, giving hydrogen dramatic buoyancy. This lightness of hydrogen made it a natural for one of its first practical uses, filling balloons. Neon balloons soar as well as a hydrogen balloon. The first such airy vessel was the creation of French scientists, Jacques Charles in 1783, who was inspired by the Montgolfier brothers' hot air success a couple of months before to use hydrogen in a balloon of silk impregnated with rubber. Hydrogen seemed to have a guaranteed future in flying machines, reinforced by the invention of air ships built on a rigid frame called dirigibles in the UK, but better known by their German nick name of Zeppelins, after their enthusiastic promoter, Graf Ferdinand von Zeppelin. These air ships were soon the lioness of the sky, carrying passengers safely and smoothly across the Atlantic. But despite the ultimate lightness of hydrogen, it has another property that killed off air ships. Hydrogen is highly flammable. The destruction of the vast Zeppelin, the Hindenburg, caused by a fire probably from static electricity was seen on film by shocked audiences around the world. The hydrogen air ship was doomed. Yet hydrogen has remained a player in the field of transport because of the raw efficiency of its combustion. Many of NASA's rockets including the second and third stages of the Apollo programs Saturn V and the space shuttle's main engines are powered by burning liquid hydrogen with pure oxygen. More recently still, hydrogen has been proposed as a replacement for fossil fuels in cars. Here it has a big advantage over petrol of burning to provide only water, no greenhouse gases are emitted. The most likely way to employ hydrogen is not to burn it explosively, but to use it in a fuel cell, where an electrochemical reaction is used to produce electricity to power the vehicle. But even if we don't get the hydrogen fuelled cars, hydrogen still has a future in a more dramatic energy source, nuclear fusion, the power source of the sun. Fusion power stations are tens of years away from being practical, but hold out the hope clean plentiful energy. However, we use hydrogen though; we can't take away its prime position. It is numero uno, the king of elements. Interviewee - Meera Senthilingam Elemental royalty there, brought to you by science writer, Brian Clegg. And you can hear more stories about the discovery and reactivity of the remaining elements as the well the scientists behind them, by visiting the web site at rsc dot org forward slash chemistryworld forward slash podcast forward slash element.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nMeera Senthilingam. And you can also track down Chemistry in its element as a podcast on iTunes. In just a moment, how some carbon nanotubes and a bit of titanium dioxide looks at to revolutionize lithium based batteries. But first Bibi something that's out of this world!\n\nInterviewee - Bibiana Campos-Seijo\n\nRight, this story is about meteoroid getting a holistic treatment.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nWhat are the kinds of treatments can meteorites get then?\n\nInterviewee - Bibiana Campos-Seijo\n\nThis one has had a lot of probing and testing actually. It was discovered at the end of the 1960s in Australia and at the time, the analytical chemist that were dealing with it and tried to get some data out of it, were using all the technology that was at their disposal to try to get some information about it generally biologically active components to see if they could actually shed any light into the potential sources of life on earth. So they were..\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nWhat age was the meteorite then?\n\nInterviewee - Bibiana Campos-Seijo\n\nIt is at least old or of the same age of the sun.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo born from the same primordial soup that's born our solar system basically. So therefore things that are in it gave rise us to as well ultimately.\n\nInterviewee - Bibiana Campos-Seijo\n\nAbsolutely, the intention was to obtain information that would help us understand what was happening at those very early stages of the solar system, specifically looking at the chemistry that operated at or just before the birth of our solar system. So this meteorite would be very useful to analyse because of all the information that could be locked in. At the time they were using a very targeted approach which involved searching for a specific group of chemicals such as amino acids, but the analyses that is being carried out at the moment by a group of researchers at the Helmholtz Center at Munich in Germany is a non-targeted approach. So basically what they've done is to have use a new technology that has a very interesting name. The acronym is FTICR, which stands for Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance and they have analysed the meteorite, when thousands of different ionised molecules with the accuracy of the mass of one electron and their analyses have produced signals for over 14000 different elemental compositions which indicates according to their estimates that the meteorite must contain several million different organic compounds in total.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nIt's basically jam packed with interesting chemistry, which predates the planet being here, arguing that the earth was probably being fertilised from a very early stage with lots of interesting chemicals without having to make any of them. So this must give us some clues as to how things kind of got going there could have given us life processes, I presume.\n\nInterviewee - Bibiana Campos-Seijo\n\nAbsolutely. I think the main conclusion of this study is that extraterrestrial chemistry diversity is very high compared with terrestrial biogeochemical chemistry. So, the results at the moment are interesting, in that they have shown the meteorite was containing millions of different organic compounds. Now the hard task in my view starts, which is basically looking at what information can be extracted from that or what compounds are we talking about really.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nThere are many, many meteorites on earth though, so what makes this one special. Why are they so interested in this particular one?\n\nInterviewee - Bibiana Campos-Seijo\n\nThe importance of this particular meteorite is that it was retrieved very soon after it fell on the earth, which means that it wasn't weathered at all or affected by the earth's atmosphere.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nFantastic. Okay thank you Bibi. Well we'll have to watch the space, I guess, to see what else they dig out from that meteorite. Nina tell us about batteries.\n\nInterviewee - Nina Notman\n\nSo lots of group we know are developing batteries with lots of storage capacity and are able to charge and discharge really fast. So the technology which is mainly being used at the moment is lithium ion technology in laptops and in hybrid cars, but at the moment it isn't quite perfect. This work has been published in the Journal, Chemistry of Materials and is being done by a group based at the Max Planck Institute in Germany. The lithium ion batteries which we're all familiar with have lots of lithium ions held in a typically graphite electrode and when the batteries are turned on, the ions migrate to the cathode sending electrons to the circuit. The problem with graphite is that it doesn't store that many lithium ions and it also releases them both slowly.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nWhat have they done to improve on that because one of the reasons why these batteries are not good is because the lithium ions have to wheedle their way in and out of the graphite and it causes it to fracture, doesn't it, break up, which is one of the reasons why the batteries clap out eventually. So have they got around that?\n\nInterviewee - Nina Notman\n\nYeah they have. So this group have created carbon nanotubes which they coated with titanium dioxide and they found that the combination of these two compounds create really good anode material for the batteries.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo you've got nanotubes. So carbon nanotubes, long nanotubes and they're actually physically coated around the outside with the titanium dioxide.\n\nInterviewee - Nina Notman\n\nYeah, that's right.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo what happens to a lithium ion in that setting then?\n\nInterviewee - Nina Notman\n\nSo the lithium ions can accumulate really nicely in the titanium oxide. They're very good at holding the lithium ion and then when the battery is turned is on, they can transfer into the carbon nanotubes and then shoot along them in a fast release way.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nHow did they discover this? Was this trial and error?\n\nInterviewee - Nina Notman\n\nCarbon nanotubes and titanium dioxide had been tried separately for this purpose and had proved to be unsuccessful for various reasons, but I think along that way they realised that carbon nanotubes did the fast release power to titanium oxide would be very good at holding the lithium ion effectively until they had a go at combining the two and see how it worked.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo how much better is this than the existing electrode configuration? How many is it say five times, ten times better than what we've got at the moment?\n\nInterviewee - Nina Notman\n\nThe research hasn't had provided that information Chris, but I think, they have mentioned is the storage capacity in particular very comparison to the carbon nanotube and titanium oxide on the line. So the synergy molecules hold four times as many ions as the titanium oxide on its own and three times as many ions as carbon nanotubes on its own. In terms of the fracturing which you mentioned earlier, they've done studies where repeatedly charged and discharge the material and they've done this a hundred times and they found the material doesn't fracture.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nWhich is brilliant! Isn't it? But the big question is this viable to make? Because if this takes forever to make one tiny set of nanotubes decorated with the titanium compound, its going to be really hard to make this industrially. Are they able to do this?\n\nInterviewee - Nina Notman\n\nWell they say that the process is really simple and it's really cheap. So, yes they should be able to be used industrially.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo maybe my laptop will last a little bit longer in future. Thank you Nina. Well that is almost it for this month, but we do have one very important part of the program left to visit. So if you cast your mind back to last time\n\nInterviewee - Phillip Broadwith\n\nWell Chris, we though we'd take things up a notch and go with chemical joke at the month. Well what we want people to do is send in their favourite chemistry jokes, the more terrible the better really.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo basically you tell a crap joke and the worse it is the more likely you're to win.\n\nInterviewee - Phillip Broadwith\n\nThe funnier, you know, different people find different things funny. So we'll just have to judge on.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd you'll pick on each month.\n\nInterviewee - Phillip Broadwidth\n\nYeah, so every month we'll pick what we think is the best joke and that person will get the Chemistry World goodie bag.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo we invited you to send in your favourite chemistry themed gags. Now after we've been through three sacks of mail, I'm resuscitated Phil at least five times from laughter-induced cardiac arrest.

{"text":"Editorial\n\nThis week's CORDIS Express takes a closer look at some of the latest achievements and breakthroughs of European researchers. The combined findings from 14 EU-funded food traceability projects that investigated the safety and integrity of the whole food chain have just been published. A Grand Minima of solar activity can affect climate conditions. European researchers have discovered that embryonic stem cell properties are impacted by the laboratory conditions used to grow them.

The Czech Republic is becoming a Silicon Valley when it comes to robot-related technologies. In Finally and Briefly read about woolly mammoths and cooperation.\n\nNews - Top Stories\n\nThe combined findings from 14 EU-funded food traceability projects that investigated the safety and integrity of the whole food chain have just been published, representing over 10 years of research results. Now, in light of the February 2012 launch of the European Commission's Bioeconomy Action Plan, the forthcoming Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, continued negotiations on CAP reform, and an ever vigilant consumer, CORDIS News takes stock of how far we've come on the road to a safer food chain and how these EU-funded projects have made a difference.\n\nA European team of researchers has discovered that a Grand Minima of solar activity can affect climate conditions. Scientists from the German Research Centre for Geosciences GFZ, in collaboration with Swedish and Dutch colleagues, have provided evidence for a direct solar-climate linkage on centennial timescales. What the scientists found was that an abrupt cooling in Europe, together with an increase in humidity and in particular wind, coincided with a sustained reduction in solar activity 2 800 years ago. The study was presented in the journal Nature Geoscience.\n\nEuropeans are driving research and technology, and their latest achievement is in discovering that embryonic stem cell properties are impacted by the laboratory conditions used to grow them. In their groundbreaking study, a European team of researchers evaluated embryonic stem cells grown in a pure undifferentiated state. The use of next generation sequencing technology enabled them to analyse gene expression (i.e. transcriptome) and chromatin modifications (i.e. epigenome). The study, presented in the journal Cell, was supported in part by four EU-funded projects: HEROIC, PLURISYS, EUROSYSTEM and ATLAS. The results pinpoint key differences between pure stem cells and embryonic stem cells grown in laboratory settings.\n\nFocus on Innovation\n EU's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7). The findings were presented in The Journal of Biological Chemistry.\n\nFuture of Research\n\nIn a groundbreaking study, an international team of scientists has created a novel tool to identify hotspots of malaria parasite evolution, and to quickly and efficiently track the increase of malarial drug resistance. The findings are presented in the journal Nature. Led by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in the United Kingdom, the researchers used new sequencing technologies and informatics methods to evaluate malaria genomes from 227 patient blood samples in six countries. They identified a number of differences in how malaria develops in Africa, Asia and Oceania.\n\nAround Europe\n\nIn 1920, Czech writer Karel Capek introduced the word 'robot' to the world. His play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) was a work of science fiction, but robots, albeit very different from how Capek imagined them, are rapidly becoming a reality today. Their development is being helped by groundbreaking research taking place in the Czech Republic, a country with a long history of innovation in many fields. The Czech Technical University (CTU) in Prague, the oldest institute of technology in Central Europe, stands at the forefront of robotics research. Teams there are working on a range of technologies that promise great advances in robotic devices, applications and human-robot interaction.\n\nTop Events\n\nAn event entitled 'Unanswered questions in cancer sequencing' will take place from 2 to 3 November 2012 in Cambridge, UK. New generations of DNA sequencing technologies are enabling the systematic study of genetic derangement in cancers. The sequencing of cancer exomes or transcriptomes, or even entire cancer genomes, is now possible, though technical and economic challenges remain. Nonetheless, the application of new technologies is dramatically expanding our understanding of this disease. Although, the science community anticipates many exciting discoveries in the near future, the ultimate success of these endeavours rests on the ability to translate what is learned into better diagnosis, treatment and prevention of cancer.\n\nThe Sixth European Space Agency Workshop on Satellite Navigation Technologies will take place from 5 to 7 December 2012 in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. Navigation technology is becoming a major part of daily life. Behind the user-friendly apps and components, though, lie a complex and ever-changing systems of technologies. The Galileo system is expected to add to European capabilities and stimulate further developments in the field.\n\nCalls and Tenders\n\nThe European Commission has published a call for proposals under the Lifelong Learning Programme on the implementation of the European strategic objectives in education and training. The general objective of the call is to promote the implementation of the four strategic objectives of the 'Strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training (ET 2020)' (lifelong learning and mobility; quality and efficiency; equity, social cohesion and active citizenship; creativity and innovation) and a set of strategic priorities agreed for 2012-14.\n\nPartners Service\n\nThe Portugese Polytechnic Institute of Bragan\u00e7a is looking for partners to participate in a project that will be focusing on discovering new bioactive compounds in plants. The project's main aim will be the identification, characterisation and evaluation of the potential of bioactive compounds sourced from plants. The bioactive compounds will be characterised from the chemical and biological points of view. Those showing the most interesting properties will be tested in the formulation of innovative products. In order to promote the stability of the bioactive compounds during the final product processing conditions, or in order to obtain their controlled release, the substances will be micro\/nano-encapsulated, using biocompatible and biodegradable matricesAlthough many European countries have introduced bans on smoking in public, Europeans are having a hard time stamping out their nicotine habit. In some cases, that has forced governments to soften antismoking legislation. Lighting up doesn't carry the social stigma in Europe that it carries in other countries. The 'Tackling socioeconomic inequalities in smoking: learning from natural experiments by time trend analyses and cross-national comparisons' (SILNE) project seeks to analyse various natural policy experiments within Europe with the aim of generating new empirical evidence on the effectiveness of possible strategies to reduce inequalities in smoking. The project will first assess whether changes in national tobacco control policies have influenced inequalities in smoking cessation among adults in various EU countries. It will then do a comparison between European countries to assess whether cross-national differences in specific tobacco control policies were associated with inequalities in smoking initiation among adolescents. SILNE will review the published results of intervention studies, and integrate these data. Researchers from different European countries will work together, and bring together four large international networks relevant to inequities in smokingEvolution has sometimes been characterised as being a never-ending process which favours individuals that are the most competitive or adaptive. The fittest survive, the saying goes, and the weakest do not. However, this 'eat or be eaten' approach to history may be much more nuanced than it would initially appear.\n\nResearchers from the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Pl\u00f6n (Germany), Harvard University (US) and the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands) wanted to know if a process would that favours those who help themselves, and not others, would actually lead to cooperative behaviour."}
{"text":"Week of May 19 \u2013 26, 2003\n\nCollege move: dangerous precedent or positive change?\u2026While many BC parents are celebrating changes to the makeup of the BC College of Teachers, SFU education professor Peter Grimmett calls them foreboding. Education Minister Christy Clark recently announced that the number of political appointees to the 20 member college will rise from five to 12. While parents see the move as positive, because it will provide them with more opportunity as potential appointees to influence the regulation of teachers, Grimmett warns the reduction in the number of teacher appointees elected by their peers spells the end of the college as a self-regulating body. He adds the change also sets a dangerous precedent for professions. \"The principle of self-regulating professions having a majority of its council or board elected from the membership has been violated,\" says Grimmett. \"The real reason, I suspect, is a political opportunity to weaken the BC Teachers Federation, which is all rather ironic when the official explanation for the changes is that the College of Teachers has become too politicized.\"\n\nImproved Rover heads for 'Mars'\u2026There are no known aliens or armed and dangerous robots running around on Devon Island in the Canadian high Arctic. But that hasn't stopped scientists from making a risky road trip to the home of a Mars-like environment in the invincible Humvee Rover. Sci-fi star Arnold Schwartzenegger made the all-terrain rover famous in his Terminator movies. The military also uses the vehicle. Devon Island is home to Haughton Crater, which NASA is studying because of its likeness to Mars. The MARS Institute, a non-profit corporation advancing Mars exploration, recently had the Humvee's maker, AM General, refurbish the rover to traverse the Arctic's treacherous stretches of sea-bound ice from Cornwallis to Devon Islands. SFU scientist Stephen Braham, vice-president of the MARS Institute's board of directors, is leading the design of an advanced power, computing and communications system for the new Humvee called MARS-1. It will serve as a long-distance roving field lab for NASA scientists exploring Haughton Crater. The Humvee's maneuverability in the Arctic's craggy and climatically unforgiving environment will enable scientists \"to access and deliver data as we go about our scientific field work on Devon Island. From that experience we'll learn how to do the same thing for planetary exploration,\" explains Braham, who can elaborate on the significance of the new Humvee's inaugural trip to Haughton Crater in July. Braham can also expand on how this Canadian Space Agency funded project will advance the design of pressurized rovers for human moon and Mars exploration."}
{"text":"On the folding edge of origami\n\nMOST JAPANESE can quickly flick together without much thought an origami crane or some other object, using whatever paper that's handy. That's the result of Japanese kindergartens having taught the art of paper folding for more than a century.\n\nBut the modern world of origami has gone far beyond making birds out of scrap paper\u2014today artists square off in Bug Wars to produce paper insects requiring more than 100 folds, give their creations opus numbers, and use lasers to score the paper before folding.\n\nThe New Yorker recently gave its full-scale treatment to modern origami, focusing on scientist-turned-origami artist Robert Lang:\n\nFor centuries, origami patterns had at most thirty steps; now they could have hundreds. And as origami became more complex it also became more practical. Scientists began applying these folding techniques to anything\u2014medical, electrical, optical, or nanotechnical devices, and even to strands of DNA\u2014that had a fixed size and shape but needed to be packed tightly and in an orderly way. By the end of the Bug Wars, origami had completely changed, and so had Robert Lang. In 2001, he left his job\u2014he was then at the fibre-optics company JDS Uniphase, in San Jose\u2014to fold paper full time.\n\nThe artists are choosing subjects that transcend animal art:\n\n(John Montroll) also made origami models of complex polyhedra that no one had thought possible. \"John has done models in origami of all the Archimedean solids! All the Platonic solids! All the Johnson solids!\" Lang said excitedly. \"He did all the polyhedra!\"\n\nThe time it takes to read the article (it's five screens long) will be more than repaid\u2013it's excellent. The only slip-up I can spot is a reference to the old TV show Naruhodo Za Warudo as a Japanese \"What's My Line\".

{"text":"Unprecedented Journey Inside the Living Body\n\nSome of Marsh's favorite scenes are of small things we take for granted but never visualize \u2014 our salivary glands. \"It's almost like an alien monster, squirting out,\" he said.\n\nTo get the shot, Barlow squirted lemon juice into the back of a hungry subject's mouth and used a high-speed camera to capture the reaction of the salivary glands.\n\nAs the documentary notes, the glands are also a part of our immune systems, since saliva contains an enzyme that destroys bacteria. And tiny as they are, the glands produce a half gallon of saliva every day.\n\n'A Marvelous Machine'\n\nThis documentary also surveys, in often stunning images, many of the reasons we change so much as we age. For instance, our cells clone themselves every day to reduce the wear and tear on our organs. Old cells die; new copies take their place.\n\nBut as that process goes on, we also copy the imperfections in our DNA, and those defects accumulate as we age. If you've ever used a photocopier, you know what happens: Copies made from copies lose a little quality with each duplication.\n\nOver a lifetime, according to the documentary, we completely replace the bone in our face every 10 years; so your 70-year-old face is a seventh-generation copy of your baby face.\n\nAnd the imperfections are exaggerated with each copy.\n\n\"It's all one complex system that is ticking along, according to this clock that we know eventually will end our lives,\" Barlow said. \"But in the meantime, that's what makes us such a marvelous machine.\"\n\nNew Way of Seeing Ourselves\n\nThe technology used for the National Geographic Channel is also clearly on its way to helping revolutionize medical care. Palter contributed to the development of what's called an auto-fluorescent laparoscope, which exposes diseased tissue inside the body that a surgeon couldn't otherwise see.\n\n\"Instead of using visible light, it makes the disease fluoresce,\" Palter said. \"If you look with your naked eye, you see nothing. When you switch on the light and the filters, all of a sudden the disease is glowing green, and you can see disease that's beyond the resolution of your naked eye.\"\n\nHippocrates, the fifth century B.C. physician who is considered the father of modern medicine, was known for taking the fear of mystical superstition out of medicine. Marsh believes that some fear still exists in the discomfort many people feel about their bodies, and that having the ability to see what's inside those frontiers, and how they work, will help add balance to the most important of all fields of medicine: how we treat ourselves.\n\n\"We're given one chance to have our life,\" Marsh said. \"Modern society has taken us away from our physical beings, and I think that's had a damaging effect, in many ways, on how we live our lives, what we eat, how we behave. Hopefully, this [technology] can redress the balance in saying, 'Hey, this is who we are, this is what we've got. Listen to it, and don't be afraid of it.'\""}

Abstract\nPrimary liver tumors are mainly represented by hepatocellular hepatocarcinoma (HCC), one of the most aggressive and resistant forms of cancer. Numerous studies have reported the key role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in development, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tumor biology. The alteration of cancer-related miRNA expression can be associated with tumorigenesis. In HCC, deregulated miRNAs frequently act as oncogenes or altered tumor suppressors. Distinct subtypes of hepatic cancer can also be related to an aberrant expression of particular miRNAs, arguing for the significance of using miRNAs as tumor biomark...

{"text":"Zooxanthellae provide coral with food energy through photosynthesis and contribute to the organisms' vibrant color. Without them, the coral \"bleaches\" \u2014 turns white \u2014 and dies.\n\n\"The algae that live in the coral tissue and feed these animals explode or are just released by the tissue, thus leaving naked the skeleton of the coral,\" said study leader Roberto Danovaro of the Polytechnic University of Marche in Italy.\n\nThe researchers estimate that 4,000 to 6,000 metric tons of sunscreen wash off swimmers annually in oceans worldwide, and that up to 10 percent of coral reefs are threatened by sunscreen-induced bleaching.\n\nNew research shows that people with blue eyes have a single, common ancestor. A team at the University of Copenhagen have tracked down a genetic mutation which took place 6\u201310,000 years ago and is the cause of the eye colour of all blue-eyed humans alive on the planet today.\n\n\"Originally, we all had brown eyes\", said Professor Eiberg from the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine. \"But a genetic mutation affecting the OCA2 gene in our chromosomes resulted in the creation of a \"switch\", which literally \"turned off\" the ability to produce brown eyes\". The OCA2 gene codes for the so-called P protein, which is involved in the production of melanin, the pigment that gives colour to our hair, eyes and skin. The \"switch\", which is located in the gene adjacent to OCA2 does not, however, turn off the gene entirely, but rather limits its action to reducing the production of melanin in the iris \u2014 effectively \"diluting\" brown eyes to blue. The switch's effect on OCA2 is very specific therefore. If the OCA2 gene had been completely destroyed or turned off, human beings would be without melanin in their hair, eyes or skin colour \u2014 a condition known as albinism.\n\nProfessor Eiberg and his team examined mitochondrial DNA and compared the eye colour of blue-eyed individuals in countries as diverse as Jordan, Denmark and Turkey. His findings are the latest in a decade of genetic research, which began in 1996, when Professor Eiberg first implicated the OCA2 gene as being responsible for eye colour.\n\nSecurity expert Bruce Schneier notes that what \"our top spy\" \u2014 Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell \u2014 doesn't \"get\" when he says \"Privacy and security are a zero-sum game,\" is that Security and Privacy Aren't Opposites:\n\nI suppose an economist would say that we don't have to trade privacy for security unless we're on an efficient frontier \u2014 and we're clearly not trading off the least privacy for the most security right now.\n\nDoes the U.S. economy in early 2008 need a stimulus? If so, will tax cuts or attempts by the Fed to lower interest rates do the trick?\n\nI used to be able to answer such questions with confidence. Now I cannot.\n\nThe theory of the causes of unemployment, interest rates, and inflation falls under the subject known as macroeconomics. Macroeconomics is like astrology or Freudian psychology, in that a lot of people used to believe it, and a lot of people still do, but many with a scientific bent tend to stay away from it.\n\nMedicare is wonderful for relieving the elderly from the burden of worrying about health care expenses. By the same token, it is wonderful for relieving doctors of the burden of worrying about the elderly as customers. You get paid for understanding the billing system, not for understanding your patients.\n\nBy injecting small amounts of the marijuana-derived drug into different parts of a rat's brain and then watching for behavioral cues, they learned that THC works wonders in the prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus, but causes anxious behavior when dribbled into the basolateral amygdala.\n\nGerman biochemists had an even better story to tell: Beat Lutz and his colleagues at Johannes Gutenberg-University studied an enzyme that is partially responsible for anxiety. Make a drug that can slow it down and you may be able to prevent paranoia.\n\nThey proved their point in two ways: Knockout mice, animals lacking the genetic recipe for that protein, were resistant to nervous behavior. Also, unusually nervous lab mice were calmed by an experimental chemical that inactivates the same molecule.\n\nShai Agassi, who has spent his entire career in software, and who has no previous experience in either the auto or energy industries, is now facing The Electric Car Acid Test:\n\nJust over a year ago, on Dec. 31, 2006, Shai Agassi settled into a leather couch in the office of Ehud Olmert to meet with the Israeli Prime Minister. Agassi, then a top executive at German software giant SAP, had come to pitch the idea of his native Israel reducing its dependence on oil by replacing gas-powered cars with electric ones. Olmert liked the concept but laid down a steep challenge: He wanted Agassi to raise hundreds of millions in venture capital and get an auto industry CEO on board before he would pledge his support. \"You go find the money and find a major automaker who will commit to this, and I'll give you the policy backing you need,\" Olmert said.\n\nWithin a year, Agassi had pulled off everything Olmert had asked. He raised $200 million in venture capital and, with help from Israeli President Shimon Peres, persuaded Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Renault and Nissan, to make a new kind of electric car for the Israeli market. On Jan. 21, Agassi, Olmert, Peres, and Ghosn unveiled the novel project, under which Agassi's Silicon Valley company, Better Place, will sell electric cars and build a network of locations where drivers can charge and replace batteries. Olmert has done his part, too. Israel just boosted the sales tax on gasoline-powered cars to as much as 60% and pledged to buy up old gas cars to get them off the road.\n\nHis idea requires a decent amount of infrastructure, but that's not such a big barrier in a small, dense country where you have the government's support:\n\nThe trouble with traditional electric cars is that they can go only 50 or 100 miles and then they need to stop for hours to recharge their batteries. Hybrids overcome the mileage limitations, but only by burning gasoline. One of Agassi's unconventional ideas is to separate the battery from the car. That will allow drivers to pull into a battery-swapping station, a car-wash-like contraption, and wait for 10 minutes while their spent batteries are lowered from the car and fully charged replacements are hoisted into place. Better Place will build the service stations, as well as hundreds of thousands of charging locations, similar to parking meters.\n\n ThreeThe MMA episode was great, despite the laughable narration, written by someone who clearly does not \"get\" the sport. Two things really stood out to me. First, Bas Rutten really does punch twice as hard \u2014 well, almost twice as hard \u2014 as Randy Couture, a UFC champion \u2014 and kicks much harder than the Muay Thai \"expert\" they tested in a previous episode. Second, Couture's ground and pound strikes were four times as hard as his standing punches.\n\nThe Special Ops episode focused on environmental extremes. A Navy SEAL sat in an ice bath for an hour before he started showing negative effects from exposure. He was able to \"compartmentalize\" his blood flow to keep his internal organs and brain functioning \u2014 in fact, his core temperature went up when they put him in the ice water. When they put him through a tactical drill after that, he performed roughly as well as when he was fresh. Then they put an Israeli commando on a treadmill, in a plastic suit, with a fifty-pound vest on, under heat lamps. After they brought his core temperature up to 103-point-something, they put him through his own tactical drill, and he vastly outperformed his fresh run.\n\nThe next episode, Fighting Back, looks at self-defense techniques \u2014 which might explain the Krav Maga ad during the show.\n\nSmokers, heavy drinkers, the obese and the elderly should be barred from receiving some operations, according to doctors, with most saying the health service cannot afford to provide free care to everyone. [...] Obesity costs the British taxpayer \u00a37 billion a year. Overweight people are more likely to contract diabetes, cancer and heart disease, and to require replacement joints or stomach-stapling operations.\n\nMeanwhile, \u00a31.7 billion is spent treating diseases caused by smoking, such as lung cancer, bronchitis and emphysema, with a similar sum spent by the NHS on alcohol problems. Cases of cirrhosis have tripled over the past decade.\n\nAmong the survey of 870 family and hospital doctors, almost 60 per cent said the NHS could not provide full healthcare to everyone and that some individuals should pay for services.\n\nOne in three said that elderly patients should not be given free treatment if it were unlikely to do them good for long. Half thought that smokers should be denied a heart bypass, while a quarter believed that the obese should be denied hip replacements.\n\nGuillermo del Toro is in talks to direct back-to-back installments of J.R.R. Tolkien's \"The Hobbit,\" which is being co-financed by New Line and MGM. [...] Del Toro has built that goodwill through such films as the Oscar-nominated \"Pan's Labyrinth,\" \"Hellboy,\" \"Blade 2\u2033 (which was made by New Line) and \"The Devil's Backbone.\" [...] The December resolution of the Jackson suit, facilitated by MGM CEO Harry Sloan, paved the way for \"Hobbit\" to get back on the road to the screen. However, because of other commitments that included \"The Lovely Bones\" and \"Tintin,\" Jackson could not take on writing and directing roles, opting instead to become an executive producer with approval over creative elements of the pair of films.\n\nIn January 2006 while visiting Antarctica, we witnessed a most unusual method for orca to dislodge a crabeater seal from an ice floe \u2014 they made large waves to wash the seal off the relative safety of the ice. Later the orca put the seal back on the ice and dislodged the seal a second time which suggested strongly they were training their young.\n\nYears ago \u2014 wow, maybe a dozen years ago now \u2014 I went to one of the Dog Brothers' Gatherings of the Pack, back when it was an informal meeting in a park near one of the Dog's homes. I simply had to see live stickfighting, especially since it was \"no holds barred\" \u2014 in the sense that grappling was allowed, and minimal pads were involved. It was an experience.\n\nYou'll note that I didn't jump in that day, and I didn't ramp up my Filipino Martial Arts training in order to jump in next time either. Once you've seen a guy get hit hard enough that his fencing mask gets stuck on, you have to take the whole thing seriously.\n\nThe other night, National Geographic had an excellent documentary on the Dog Brothers, Fight Club: No Limits, which largely \u2014 with the exception of an interviewed professor or two \u2014 seemed to \"get\" the ethos of the event:\n\nThe \"elders\" of the pack run the event by these magic words: No judges, no referees, no trophies. One rule only: Be friends at the end of the day. Our goal is that everyone leaves with the IQ with which they came. No suing no one for no reason for nothing no how no way!\n\nOne element has changed over the years: the knife fights now use a Shocknife to keep things \"real\" \u2014 and it does hurt, from what I've heard. Too bad it's $500\u2026"}

Since the mid-1990s, agricultural seed companies developed and marketed seeds that were genetically modified to resist herbicides such as Roundup -- glyphosate -- as a more flexible way to manage weeds, Mortensen said. About 95 percent of the current soybean crop is modified by inserting herbicide-resistant genes into the plants.\n\nSome climate cooling caused by past volcanic eruptions may not be evident in tree-ring reconstructions of temperature change, because large enough temperature drops lead to greatly shortened or even absent growing seasons, according to climate researchers who compared tree-ring temperature reconstructions with model simulations of past temperature changes.\n\nThe bottom of a glacier is not the most hospitable place on Earth, but at least two types of bacteria happily live there, according to researchers. The bacteria -- Chryseobacterium and Paenisporosarcina -- showed signs of respiration in ice made in the laboratory that was designed to simulate as closely as possible the temperatures and nutrient content found at the bottom of Arctic and Antarctic glaciers, said Corien Bakermans, assistant professor of microbiology, Penn State Altoona. She said that carbon dioxide levels in the laboratory-made ice containing the bacteria, which were collected from glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica, indicated that respiration was occurring at temperatures ranging from negative 27 to positive 24 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nEngineering our way out of global climate warming may not be as easy as simply reducing the incoming solar energy, according to a team of University of Bristol and Penn State climate scientists. Designing the approach to control both sea level rise and rates of surface air temperature changes requires a balancing act to accommodate the diverging needs of different locations. \"Basic physics and past observations suggest that reducing the net influx of solar energy will cool the Earth,\" said Peter J. Irvine, graduate student, University of Bristol, UK, and participant in the Worldwide Universities Network Research Mobility Programme to Penn State. \"However, surface air temperatures would respond much more quickly and sea levels will respond much more slowly.\"\n\nIf you've ever enjoyed the sight of a field of flowering purple loosestrife, cease and desist immediately.

Their results were published in the Journal of Neuroscience.\n\nInvestigators also took urine samples from the subjects before the experiment and one month afterwards, so that they could measure the levels of cotinine \u2013 a metabolite of nicotine which is an indicator of smoking habits.\n\nFindings revealed that a strong argument was key to promoting dMPFC activity and tuhs future reductions to tobacco intake. Focussing on clever editing tricks, storytelling and other sensational aspects of film was less important.\n\nDr Langleben said: \"If you give someone an unconvincing ad, it doesn't matter what format you do on top of that. [...] In terms of effectiveness, content is more important. You're better off adding in more sophisticated editing and other special effects only if it is persuasive.\"\n\nMany of the campaigns launched by the Department of Health focus on delivering a shock factor, with the latest ads showing a cigarette develop a cancerous tumour, but it seems that presenting a solid argument for giving up the habit is the essential aspect.\n\n]]> calories to exercise could encourage diners to make healthier choices\n 23 May 2013 19:49:11 +0000Tania who are presented with information which shows the level of activity required to burn off the calories in a particular product or dish may be more likely to make healthier choices or limit their food intake, according to new research from a Texas Christian University team.\n\nInvestigators recruited 300 18 to 30-year-old participants in order to assess whether providing this sort of material on food menus would alter people's decisions when it came to ordering and consumption.\n\nThe subjects were split into three different groups: all of the food options were the same, but one group was provided with no additional information, another was shown calorie content, and the final was presented with calorie and the associated exercise information.\n\nMany people may underestimate the exertion required to counteract the consumption of high-calorie foods. According to the British Heart Foundation, a 25-year old who weighs ten stone burns just 445 calories in a one-hour jog \u2013 not enough for a McDonald's Big Mac.\n\nThe researchers cross-referenced data concerning the diners' consumption habits in each group and found that provision of exercise information was linked with consumption of 100 fewer calories.\n\nIt seems that increasing awareness of the physical exertion required to burn off a particular meal is encouraging eaters to make more careful choices. Providing calorie content alone is inadequate to motivate significantly healthier decisions.\n\nThe could be because the number of calories is relatively abstract, with many people potentially unaware of the recommended daily allowance and how this should be distributed in meals, drinks and snacks throughout the day.\n\nTranslating this figure into something more concrete that anyone can comprehend increases the average person's understanding of the impact of their dietary choices. Adopting this technique on food packaging and in restaurants could therefore help to fight obesity.\n\nHowever, senior dietician at the BHF Victoria Taylor told the BBC: \"While displaying the amount of exercise needed to burn calories is an interesting idea, there's more to a heart-healthy diet than calorie counting.\"\n\nDiners are also encouraged to take other aspects of nutritional content into account. Keeping within daily guideline amounts for things like salt and saturated fat and consuming adequate vitamins and minerals is vital to maintaining good health and tackling obesity.\n\nResearchers have found a combination of drugs which could lead to more effective treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).\n\nPublished this month in the journal Leukemia, the study is hoped to help address a basic problem of treating CLL.\n\nThe CLL which lives in the blood in circulation is relatively easy to kill, however when it occurs in lymph nodes and bone marrow it can be more likely to recur due to resistant CLL cells.\n\nThis latest drug combination if gossypol plus navitoclax is designed to target the stubborn CLL cells, inhibiting the protein, BCL-X, allowing the navitoclax to work more effectively to kill the cancer cells.\n\nCommenting on the results, Alan Eastman, senior researcher on the team and professor pharmacology and toxicology at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, said: \"Both drugs have been given to patients, but never in combination, because no one had the mechanistic rationale for doing that.\n\n\"Now we have what we think is the most promising drug combination so far for the treatment of CLL.\"\n\n]]> drinking 'increases cardiovascular disease risk in young adults'\n 22 May 2013 19:50:09 +0000Tania research has shown that binge drinking can be harmful to blood vessels and the heart, potentially causing cardiovascular disease (CVD) in older adults. However, a new study has revealed that young people could be equally prone to this negative consequence.\n\nA paper published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology shows that university students, who are often prone to adopting unhealthy drinking habits, could be putting their health at risk and significantly increasing their chance of developing medical problems.\n\nInvestigators analysed the healthcare records of two groups of non-smoking students aged between 18 and 25, who had no pre-existing conditions. While one set of young adults abstained from alcohol consumption, the other admitted to binge drinking.\n\nMen who frequently consumed five or more standard alcoholic beverages within a two-hour timeframe were classified as binge drinkers, whereas women who had four drinks in this period would be categorised in this way.\n\nThe binge-drinking students involved in the trial typically engaged in this unhealthy practice six times per month for four years. The NHS recommends that men and women do not drink more than one standard beverage per day on a regular basis.\n\nSo that they could account for confounding factors in their calculations, the researchers also questioned the participants about aspects such as diet and medical history. They then cross-referenced the data to see whether any trends were apparent.\n\nThey found that binge drinkers were far more likely to exhibit signs of cell impairment, with those involved in blood flow likely to be damaged. Older adults who have drank heavily over a long period of time demonstrate similar symptoms.\n\nThis issue can increase the risk of cardiovascular ailments, with poor blood flow potentially a contributory factor in the development of atherosclerosis, heart attack and stroke. These conditions can be life threatening.\n\nCo-author Dr Mariann Piano said: \"It is important that young adults understand that binge drinking patterns are an extreme form of unhealthy or at-risk drinking and are associated with serious social and medical consequences.\"\n\n]]> interests 'linked to obesity rates'\n 22 May 2013 17:01:00 +0000Tania have discovered that there is a link between a region's obesity rate and the associated inhabitants' interests as detailed on their Facebook profiles. The trends could allow for effective tracking of the prevalence of this condition in different parts of the world.\n\nA research team led by Boston Children's Hospital's Informatics Program (CHIP) investigators Dr Rumi Chunara and Dr John Brownstein utilised information readily accessible by the social networking site in order to determine whether any link between the factors could be evidenced.\n\nThe provision of comprehensive data in such large samples lends itself extremely well to scientific analysis \u2013 official Facebook figures show that the site had 618 million daily active users in December 2012.\n\nIn order to gain an understanding of the members' habits, the analysts looked at statuses and other contents that they has posted to their timeline, looked at the pages that users had 'liked' and categorised the relevant interests with regards to health and lifestyle practices.\n\nAnalysts were then able to cross-reference information garnered by these means and compare it to regional information concerning body-mass index (BMI) readings. A high score is an indicator of being overweight or obese, since it represents a height-to-weight ratio.\n\nThe data they used had been accumulated as part of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System-Selected Metropolitan\/Micropolitan Area Risk Trends (BRFSS-SMART), and New York City's EpiQuery Community Health Survey (CHS).\n\nGeographic relationships between obesity rates and Facebook activity were apparent, with increased BMIs in a particular area linked to prevalence of television-based interests.\n\nOn the other hand, regions in which Facebook members had a profile which suggested they were fit and healthy, perhaps because they had statuses about going to the gym or 'liked' cycling, tended to have lower obesity rates.\n\nDr Brownstein said:\n\n pound measles vaccination roll out in UK\n 21 May 2013 16:27:03 +0000Tania the public and healthcare professionals alike have been put on high alert as a measles epidemic currently sweeps through the country. As a result, the Department of Health has announced that a vaccination programme worth \u00a320 million is set to roll out across the UK.\n\nAround one million youngsters in England who have not had the MMR jab are set to receive the treatment, in a bid to eliminate the threat posed by the current epidemic.\n\nMMR is an acronym for the conditions against which it protects the patient \u2013 namely, measles, mumps and rubella (German measles). They are all highly infectious and can have extremely serious \u2013 even fatal \u2013 consequences should they be contracted. These include meningitis, pneumonia, deafness and swelling of the brain, known as encephalitis.\n\nFor pregnant women, they can be especially dangerous as the diseases can also cause problems for the unborn child, which could even result in miscarriage for the expectant mother.\n\nThe jab was introduced in 1988, since when it has been rare that children have developed these illnesses. However, when there is a measles outbreak \u2013 such as there is at the moment, with almost 1,000 cases in Swansea, for example \u2013 it is arguably vital that children at risk are up to date with their immunity.\n\nOn this occasion, the vaccination rollout will focus on youngsters aged ten to sixteen, with authorities claiming to already have 1.2 million jabs ready to be administered. It is hoped the rollout will be completed by September.\n\nProfessor David Salisbury, director of immunisation at the Department of Health, has urged parents to make sure their children are protected from developing the illnesses. He said: \"If you think your child has not had one or even two doses of MMR, for goodness sake contact your GP and get it sorted out.\"\n\nOfficial statistics from Public Health England reveal there has been 587 confirmed cases of measles in the first three months of this year.\n\n]]> nonfatal skin cancer patients 'don't benefit from surgery'\n 21 May 2013 10:53:11 +0000Tania providers are being encouraged to more carefully consider the potential complications involved with conducting surgery on benign skin cancer patients after new research revealed that elderly people may experience more harm than benefit from the procedure.\n\nUniversity of California San Francisco (UCSF) researchers conducted an investigation in order to determine what the best course of therapy was for patients affected by this nonfatal form of the disease.\n\nPreventing unneeded operations is important, since it reduces wastage of resources in the healthcare sector while improving conditions for patients, alleviating unnecessary cost, inconvenience and pain.\n\nTaking measures which ensure the most favourable outcomes is of course desirable, but doctors experience extreme difficulty determining whether the potential harm resulting from surgery is worthwhile.\n\nLead author and UCSF professor of dermatology Dr Eleni Linos said: \"It can be very challenging to decide whether and how to treat patients with non-melanoma skin cancer who have limited life expectancy, especially when the tumors are asymptomatic.\"\n\nGuidelines currently enforced in the US dictate that non-melanoma skin cancers must be treated, but the scientists warn that taking this tack without considering potential implications in terms of side-effects could be detrimental to patients' health and wellbeing.\n\nThe study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, reveals that many elderly patients are too frail to properly recover following a surgery to remove a cancerous skin growth. There are also difficulties associated with self-care, with cases of poor wound healing due to poor dressing and cleansing.\n\nThe cancer itself does not typically have an impact on an elderly patient's quality of life or survival, so conducting an operation is unlikely to be worthwhile. Doctors are therefore urged to consider the risk before recommending the procedure, especially in frail and vulnerable over-85s.\n\nThe NHS estimates that there are around 10,000 new cases of non-melanoma skin cancer every year, and old age is a risk factor for the condition. Ensuring a more tactical treatment course with regards to this factor could therefore provide huge populations of patients with a better quality of life."}

{"text":"NIH Podcast Episode #0121\n\nBalintfy: Welcome to the 121st episode of NIH Research Radio with news about the ongoing medical research at the National Institutes of Health\u2014the nation's medical research agency. I'm your host Joe Balintfy, and coming up in this episode, November is National Diabetes Awareness Month; we'll hear about treatment options, as well as resources for screening and prevention of breast cancer; we'll hear from leaders in research on women's health; and we'll wrap up our series on the History of Medicine. But first, this news update. Here's Craig Fritz.\n\nNews Update\n\nFritz: Researchers funded by the National Institute of Mental Health have found that digital images can be manipulated with the mind. In the study, scientists found that research subjects, whose brains were connected to a computer displaying two merged images, could force the computer to display one of the images and discard the other. The signals transmitted from each subject's brain to the computer were derived from just a handful of brain cells. The study involved patients with epilepsy who had fine wires implanted in their brains to record seizure activity. In this instance, the wires were inserted in a brain region important for memory and the ability to recognize complex images, including faces. While This work reflects progress in the development of brain-computer interfaces, which allow people to control computers or other devices with their thoughts. These interfaces hold promise for helping paralyzed individuals to communicate or control prosthetic limbs. In this study they were used as a tool to understand how the brain processes information, and especially to understand how thoughts and decisions are shaped by the collective activity of single brain cells.\n\nThe Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health And Human Development is cautioning parents and caregivers to be alert for an increased risk of SIDS during cold weather. SIDS, or sudden infant death syndrome, is the sudden and unexpected death of an infant under 1 year of age, which cannot be explained. As cold weather arrives, parents and caregivers often place extra blankets or clothes on infants to keep them warm. However over bundling may cause infants to dangerously overheat. Infants are sensitive to extremes in temperature and cannot regulate their body temperatures well. Studies have shown that multiple layers or heavy clothing, heavy blankets, and warm room temperatures increase SIDS risk. Infants who are in danger of overheating feel hot to the touch. Scientists say parents and caregivers should dress infants in light clothing for sleep and keep rooms at a temperature comfortable for adults. Other tips to reduce the risk of SIDS include: placing the infant on his or her back to sleep; placing infants to sleep on a firm, safety approved mattress; keeping toys, blankets, and other loose objects out of the crib, and never smoking around an infant.\n\nFor this NIH news update - I'm Craig Fritz\n\nBalintfy: News updates are compiled from information at  Later in the program, breast cancer, research on women's health and rare books and manuscripts. Coming up next family health history and type 2 diabetes.\n\n(BREAK FOR PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT)\n\nNational Diabetes Awareness Month\n\nBalintfy: During National Diabetes Awareness Month, the National Diabetes Education Program, or N-D-E-P, an initiative of the NIH and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is raising awareness about the importance of preventing or delaying type 2 diabetes.\n\nRodgers: NDEP is focusing on family health history and gestational diabetes as important risk factors for developing diabetes.\n\nBalintfy: Dr. Griffin Rodgers is the Director of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and a leader of the National Diabetes Education Program.\n\nRodgers: Many people with type 2 diabetes have one or more family members with the disease. NDEP is encouraging families to talk about their family's history of diabetes. Knowing your family health history is important because it provides people and their health care team with information about their risk for type 2 diabetes.\n\nBalintfy: Risk for type 2 diabetes is also higher for women who have been diagnosed with diabetes during pregnancy, called gestational diabetes. Dr. Rodgers says those women also need to understand their risk.\n\nRodgers: Unfortunately, too many women think that once the baby is born, they are no longer at risk for developing diabetes. That's not the case.\n\nBalintfy: Dr. Rodgers adds that for women who have had gestational diabetes their children are also at risk for future obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n\nRodgers: Therefore it's important to tell the child's doctor about your history of gestational diabetes and take steps now to work with the entire family to maintain a healthy lifestyle that includes being more physically active and maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nBalintfy: To find out if you are at risk for diabetes, and things you can do to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes, contact the National Diabetes Education Program. Visit the website  or call 1-888-693-NDEP; that's 1-888-693-6337.\n\n(TRANSITION MUSIC)\n\nBreast cancer awareness\n\nBalintfy: This year, there will be an estimated 207,000 new cases of breast cancer for women, and roughly 40,000 will die from the disease. But researchers emphasize that we are in a better position now to treat women and to advise them of their risk of recurrence and their overall survival of their disease.\n\nMcCaskill-Stevens: Today, we understand that breast cancer is no longer just one disease.\n\nBalintfy: Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens is a medical oncologist in the Division of Cancer Prevention at the National Cancer Institute.\n\nMcCaskill-Stevens: It is a disease now that is divided into many subtypes, and these subtypes have been defined by new technology that we have.\n\nBalintfy: Early detection is still key \u2013 when breast cancer starts, it is too small to feel and does not cause signs and symptoms. Dr. McCaskill-Stevens recommends women age 40 and older should have mammograms every 1 to 2 years.\n\nMcCaskill-Stevens: It's important that women discuss with their physicians their risk of developing breast cancer. If they are at higher risk of developing disease -- and this is a discussion that should be about mammography, as to whether they are higher enough risk that they should receive more frequent mammograms or they should be receiving another imaging modality.\n\nBalintfy: Risk factors for breast cancer include a personal or family history of breast cancer, certain breast changes, and being overweight or obese after menopause. The most important risk factor for breast cancer is age, and the risk is not the same for all women of a given age group. Dr. McCaskill-Stevens also points out there are disparities among races.\n\nMcCaskill-Stevens: In the disparities that have been observed between African-Americans and white women, one must also consider the fact of access and being vigilant about discussing this with your family members and with your physicians, and that when there are noted symptoms that may be suggestive of breast cancer, that they be addressed in an\u2014in a very expedient manner.\n\nBalintfy: She emphasizes that breast cancer awareness is a lifelong commitment.\n\nMcCaskill-Stevens: Breast cancer risk is not something that stands still. It increases with age, and so that just because you have determined what your risk status is, it is important that you continue to do so over time.\n\nBalintfy: A recent scientific symposium has highlighted some of the advances that have increased understanding of women's health, differences between females and males, and implications for gender-appropriate clinical care and personalized medicine.\n\nPinn: It was a celebration of science, it was a celebration of advancing.\n\nBalintfy: Dr. Vivian Pinn is the director of the Office of Research on Women's Health.\n\nPinn: But most of all, it was exciting to me that so many were willing to come from across the country to celebrate with us because they thought women's health research was important.\n\nGriffith: So, I'm an engineer, and we're trying to develop new tools to study women's health, particularly gynecology diseases that are under study, diseases like endometriosis.\n\nBalintfy: That's Dr. Linda Griffith; she's professor and chair of MIT's Biological and Mechanical Engineering Department. She points out that endometriosis, which is when tissues that usually grow inside the uterus instead grow on the outside, can't be diagnosed easily and doesn't have great therapies. Dr. Griffith, also the scientific keynote speaker, says of the symposium:\n\nGriffith: It covered everything from ways that women respond to drugs differently than men, to diseases that are specific for women, to issues with translation, to basic science\u2014it was a fantastic day.\n\nBalintfy: The symposium, which also celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Office of Research on Women's Health, gave an opportunity to look back. Former NIH Director Dr. Bernadine Healy, who launched the Women's Health Initiative, that was a $625-million effort to study the causes, prevention and cures of diseases that affect women at midlife and beyond, explains that research on women's health had to come at the right time.\n\nHealy: It would not have happened without, not just a team, but an army of people supporting it. And, you know, we were all privileged to come together at that magical moment and I'm just thrilled to be back here 20 years later, almost, and know that the many things that people said we couldn't do, we were able to do.\n\nNovello: When you come here and you see 20 years after, the women who created it, and now you see 20 years after the women that are going to continue it who realize this field is here forever and the one generation of the year 2020, and -40, and -60 will be thankful that there were some women in the 1980s, when it was not even important to mention it, that they thought about you as a generation to be able to shine with what they did in obscurity\u2026 And so when you come 20 years now, and not only do you learn of the studies that were not putting off at the forefront, then and now, you cannot introduce research at the NIH unless you give me the idea that you are going to benefit the other half of the United States as well, then you realize that we've come a long way.\n\nBalintfy: Current NIH institute directors who also attended the symposium, emphasize that the research continues to move forward.\n\nKatz: I'm director of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.\n\nBalintfy: That's Dr. Stephen Katz.\n\nKatz: And of course, another name for us is the National Institute on Women's Health. We have so many issues that correspond to women's health that, just to name a few, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, many of the autoimmune diseases that afflict women to a much greater extent than men. And then there are other diseases which used to affect men to a much greater extent, like gout, used to be almost unheard of in women, but now is seen in an increased proportion of women.\n\nBalintfy: Dr. Susan Shurin, Acting Director of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute also highlights current women's health priorities at her institute:\n\nShurin: Probably the most important ones right now are the differences in the ways that heart attacks manifest in women compared to men and the increasing incidents of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in women, which follows the increase in smoking after the Second World War. It turns out that COPD is as common now \u2013 is now more common, actually, in women as it in men, and it manifests a little bit differently. The good news is that if women are able to stop smoking, the lung disease doesn't seem to progress as much as it does in men. There may be actually more benefit to stopping smoking in women than there is in men.\n\nBalintfy: And Dr. Griffin Rodgers, who we heard at the beginning of the program, again emphasizes the importance of gestational diabetes awareness.\n\nRodgers: This is particularly important because it affects 5 percent of all pregnancies in this country. Women who develop gestational diabetes are at high risk of going on to develop diabetes themselves, and the infant that is born during that pregnancy, that infant is also of high risk.\n\nBalintfy: Dr. Rodgers adds that his institute, NIDDK is partnering with the Office of Research on Women's Health to increase awareness of gestational diabetes. Dr. Pinn adds that these kinds of efforts, and the symposium itself, help.\n\nPinn: I really think the way we promote women's health and women's health research is through this interdisciplinary approach, which means a collegial approach, working together.\n\nBalintfy: For more information on the symposium and research on women's health, visit the website orwh.od.nih.gov. Coming up next, the conclusion of our series on the History of Medicine.\n\n(BREAK FOR PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT)\n\nThe History of Medicine series \u2013 part 3 of 3\n\nBalintfy: We're wrapping up our series on the National Library of Medicine's History of Medicine Division today with Michael North. He's the Head of the Rare Books and Early Manuscripts Section. So let's start with a little perspective on the section.\n\nNorth: You're probably aware that the National Library of Medicine is the largest medical library in the world. And, in the Rare Books and Early Manuscripts Section in the History of Medicine Division, we have the largest rare medical book collection in the world. That includes over 60 thousand medical and scientific books dating before 1800.\n\nBalintfy: What would you say are some highlights of the Rare Books and Early Manuscripts Section?\n\nNorth: In our collection we have really most of the important high points in medical publishing over the last five hundred years including a copy of Vesalius's \"De Fabrica\" printed in Boswell in 1543 which is considered the first modern anatomical atlas. We have a copy of William Harvey's \"De Motu Cordis\" which was published in 1628. It was the first book to lay out the\u2014to prove the circulation of the blood through the body. And Edward Jenner's\u2014we have a copy of Edward Jenner's \"An Inquiry Into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vaccinae\" in which he proved that by vaccinated people with cow pox, it would cause immunity to small pox and basically has allowed us to eliminate small pox from the world today.\n\nWe also have a large collection of natural history which even includes things like astronomy. The further back you go in science and medicine, all the sciences and philosophy and that sort of thing were mixed together. The same people were really doing the same kinds of investigations and experiments and writing and that sort of thing. So, you know, you had physicians studying botany and astronomy because they thought that movements of the stars could cause or end epidemics and that sort of thing.\n\nBalintfy: Michael North, what's your favorite collection or project?\n\nNorth: Let's see. I guess one of my favorite projects is something called Turning the Pages where we've scanned important parts of important rare medical books and put them up on the web as a virtual book where people can turn the pages online, it's animated. We include exhibition text with the material to put the material in context.\n\nAnd so one of the most recent books that we put up is a Japanese manuscript by a famous physician named Hanaoka Seishu who was a surgeon in Japan in the late eighteenth, early nineteenth century and he invented a form of anesthesia in the 1820's before anesthesia was invented in the west. He was particularly interested in cancer and being able to perform surgical operations on cancer patients to remove tumors and that sort of thing. And we were lucky enough to have a beautifully illustrated manuscript of his in the collection. It features many of his patients who came from all over Japan in the early nineteenth century to receive treatment. So people can now go on our website and look at this manuscript, turn the pages, and read some text that one of our exhibition curators wrote that sort of explains what is going on and who Hanaoka Seishu was.\n\nBalintfy: Who is most likely to use the collections in the Rare Books and Early Manuscripts Section?\n\nNorth: Well primarily the collection is used by historians of medicine and this includes people who are professors at universities, graduate students, and undergraduates. We also have cultural historians, art historians, publishers, image researchers, genealogists. We also have people studying the history of the book and calligraphy, paleography and that sort of thing. But we also have clinicians and epidemiologists using the collection.\n\nBalintfy: Say I'm not a researcher, say I'm a high school or college student or just a member of the general public, visiting out of curiosity, what do you think out of these collections would be most interesting?\n\nNorth: Well, often people ask us what is the oldest item in the collection and it happens to be an Arabic manuscript that was written by Rhazes, who was one of the famous Islamic physicians of his time. He lived in the ninth century. He was one of the first people to write about things like alcohol and distillation and small pox inoculation and that sort of thing. He wrote a huge corpus that was circulated throughout the Middle East, considered very important and also influenced medieval European physicians.\n\nBalintfy: Speaking of medieval European physicians, in those days, medicine was kind of grotesque compared to what we know today. Is that something that you can see in these materials?\n\nNorth: Well, it's hard to say. Really, fortunately, or unfortunately a lot of these early manuscripts are not illustrated so you really have to be somebody who can read the text often to figure out what's going on in them. But -- and I will say that we look at some of these medieval and ancient texts, often their theories about the body and disease and that sort of thing, are so completely foreign to us that we would hardly believe that they are talking about the same animal. For instance, the humoral theory where they believed that the body needed to be kept in balance between the four humors: Blood, bile, black bile and phlegm. And Hippocrates and Galen back in the ancient world wrote a lot about these and they were the basis of their theories of disease and health. And they were carried through the Middle Ages and all the way up to really to almost modern times until the nineteenth century which is why bloodletting was taking place and purging and that sort of thing.\n\nBalintfy: And, these collections are all open to the public?\n\nNorth: Yes, that's correct. Really anyone can come in and use this material. We're open Monday through Friday from 8:30 to 5:00. All you have to do is get a library card. We do have a special reading room with increased security where we watch over people who are using the materials, but we still welcome anybody to come in and take a look at the things they are interested in. We do carry out interlibrary loan of reproductions of the materials. We've actually microfilmed a huge percentage of the collection. And I encourage people to visit our website where we have a huge number of images from the collection and exhibitions on various historical topics that hopefully sort of elucidate a lot of what's going on in the library.\n\nBalintfy: Is there any way to quantify how much this collection is worth? I guess it's basically priceless.\n\nNorth: That's right. Monetarily there is almost no way that this material could be replaced. Really I think a lot of its value is more cultural. And it is valued more as a collection as a group of things put together often rather than the individual items' value.\n\n(THEME MUSIC)\n\nBalintfy: Thank you Michael North.

{"text":"Eighth-century cosmic rays preserved in trees and more of the latest research news from Nature\n\nA rapid rise in radiocarbon around AD 775 measured in tree rings is attributed to an increase of cosmic-ray intensity. The specific cause of this cosmic-ray event remains to be determined, but this study suggests that neither a solar flare nor a local supernova is likely to have been responsible.\n\nRe-sequencing of diverse varieties of maize from around the world is reported by three studies published online this week in Nature Genetics. The studies identify millions of genetic variants that should be useful for maize geneticists and breeders to further improve crop yield.\n\nMaize is an important cereal crop, but its genome is very large\u2014about the size of the human genome\u2014and substantially more diverse than the human genome. It has been technically challenging to comprehensively characterize the enormous wealth of genomic diversity present in this crop.\n\nDoreen Ware and colleagues performed re-sequencing of 103 maize lines, including 60 improved maize lines, 23 maize landraces and 19 wild relatives of maize. They also generated sequence for a sister genus of maize, Tripsacum dactyloides (Eastern gamagrass). They identified 55 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, which is a large resource for the maize genetics and breeding community. Jeffrey Ross-Ibarra and colleagues analyzed this dataset to identify regions of the genome that were selected for during the initial phase of domestication, as well as subsequent improvement of maize landraces to modern maize. They identify a large number of genes that appear to have been selected for during the transformation of wild to modern maize.\n\nFinally, Jinsheng Lai and colleagues performed re-sequencing of 278 maize lines. They performed comprehensive characterization of sequence variation present in these diverse maize lines, and identified a number of genetic regions that display evidence of selection during maize domestication.\n\nPowerful microscopes capable of three-dimensional imaging and tracking of the cells in a developing fly embryo are described by two independent studies published online this week in Nature Methods.\n\nPhilipp Keller and colleagues and Lars Hufnagel and colleagues independently designed and built similar microscope systems that allow fast three-dimensional imaging of fluorescently labelled cells throughout an embryo\u2014up to several millimeters in size\u2014every 30 seconds or less. By illuminating the specimen with two independent and perpendicular sheets of light and imaging from two sides, they achieved sufficient speed and resolution to track fast-moving individual cells, as well as changes in their shape at a subcellular scale; the technique was able to image an entire fly embryo for up to 20 hours until the embryo hatched and the larvae crawled away.\n\nThese microscope systems acquire hundreds of megabytes of image data every second and should allow for the observation of small living organisms in their entirety at a previously inaccessible level of detail.\n\nNew targets that when inhibited in combination with the activation of p53 can lead to cancer cell death are reported this week in Nature Chemical Biology.\np53 is a tumor suppressor that regulates cellular response to various stresses and it is known that the activation of p53 can promote cell death. The activation of p53 in cancer cells often results in reversible growth arrest rather than death of the cells. However, the pathways that govern cellular response\u2014growth arrest versus death\u2014in response to p53 activation are not well understood.\n\nJoaquin Espinosa and colleagues perform a genome-wide screen to identify genes that modify response to the activation of p53 in cells that undergo growth arrest compared to those that die. They identify several pathways that were previously not known to impact a cell's response to p53, and demonstrate that inhibition of the protein kinases ATM and MET in combination with activation of p53 promotes cell death. As inhibitors for both of these kinases are available but were set aside as they were not effective alone, the authors recommend that these drugs could be revisited and tested in combination with agents such as Nutlin-3 that activate p53.\n\nActivity by organisms such as lichens, fungi and algae accounts for nearly half of the land-based conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into a chemical form that is useable by most plants, reports a study published online this week in Nature Geoscience. Because bio-available nitrogen often limits plant growth, this process could be crucial for carbon sequestration by plants.\n\nUlrich Poeschl and colleagues re-analysed published data on the spatial coverage of organisms that synthesize their own food from inorganic substances with the help of sunlight, such as lichens, fungi and algae. Based on their analysis of data on fluxes of carbon and nitrogen in a range of ecosystems, they estimate that these organisms contribute about 7% of the net primary production of the terrestrial vegetation, in addition to their role in the nitrogen cycle.\n\nThe role that a particular steroid receptor coactivator, SRC-1, plays in the progression of endometriosis is elucidated in a paper published online in Nature Medicine this week. The work suggests that this protein could be used as a molecular target for the therapy of this disease.\n\nEndometriosis is considered to be an estrogen-dependent inflammatory disease of the uterus. Previously, Bert W O'Malley and colleagues found lowered amounts of the full length SRC-1 protein in endometriotic tissue but how it contributes to disease progression remains unknown.\n\nThe authors now find that a previously unidentified truncated form of the protein, 70-kDa SRC-1, is highly elevated both in the endometriotic tissue of mice with surgically induced endometriosis and in endometriotic cells of the microenvironment of tissue samples from individuals with the disease. This increase is caused in response to signalling from the inflammatory mediator TNF-alpha.\n\nThe authors therefore propose a new pathogenic pathway, involving a shorter form of SRC-1, for the progression of endometriosis. The finding also suggests that the TNF-alpha therapy, etanercept, may be useful to treat this disease.\n\nActivity in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) of the human brain could be the signature of visual perception, according to a study published online this week in Nature Neuroscience. These results suggest that signals in the TPJ support conscious awareness.\n\nPrevious work suggested that the TPJ is critical for detecting salient or unexpected stimuli, and damage to this area can result in spatial neglect, a deficit in the control of attention.\n\nMichael Beauchamp and colleagues worked with patients who had electrodes implanted into their brains for surgical treatment of epilepsy. They stimulated an area in the early visual system of each person's brain with low intensity electrical pulses that sometimes evoked the perception of a flash of light and sometimes did not. They found that people only reported seeing a light on occasions when there was also a response in the TPJ. The authors found that disruption of signals in the TPJ decreased the detectability of a barely visible visual target, further linking this brain area to visual perception.\n\nA class of genetic regulators called microRNAs can directly influence the severity of inflammatory diseases reports a study published online this week in Nature Medicine. Moreover, an inflammatory response can be amplified by turning off microRNAs, pointing to novel ways to decrease damaging inflammatory responses by influencing genetic regulatory programs.\n\nIncreased amounts of the cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17) are found in several autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. This cytokine promotes inflammatory damage by influencing the development of circulating immune cells. Youcun Qian and colleagues found that IL-17 can also contribute to this damage by suppressing a specific microRNA called miR-23b in cells residing in tissues. IL-17 amounts were elevated in the kidney and joint of individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively, whereas the expression of miR-23b was decreased. The authors found a direct relationship between these two molecules in three mouse models of autoimmune disease\u2014lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis\u2014with IL-17 reducing the expression of miR-23b. Its overexpression, in turn, blocked autoimmune disease development in these mouse models.\n\nThe way in which the inflammatory activity of the cytokine IL-33 is controlled is explained in a paper in Nature Immunology this week. IL-33 plays an important role in inflammatory conditions of the lung, such as asthma and understanding how this pathway is regulated may provide a strategy to ease such inflammatory conditions.\n\nIL-33 mediates its effects exclusively through its receptor ST2L which led Yutong Zhao and colleagues to look at ways in which this interaction could be regulated. They identified an intracellular molecule called FBXL19 which binds directly to ST2L causing it to be degraded, thereby blunting the inflammatory action of IL-33. Loss of FBXL19 exacerbated the symptoms of lung inflammation whereas an overabundance of this molecule dampened inflammation. Because of the widespread expression of ST2L, the authors conclude that FBXL19 likely plays a generalized role in controlling the pro-inflammatory effects of IL-33.\n\nA rapid rise in radiocarbon around AD 775 measured in tree rings is attributed to an increase of cosmic-ray intensity in a Nature paper this week. Cosmic rays are thought to originate from a variety of sources, and the specific cause of this cosmic-ray event remains to be determined, but this study suggests that neither a solar flare nor a local supernova is likely to have been responsible.\n\nRises in the carbon-14 (14C) content of trees in the past 3,000 years have been detected in previous studies, but none have shown increases on the timescale of around one year. Achieving this resolution, Fusa Miyake and colleagues report radiocarbon measurements in annual rings of Japanese cedar trees that demonstrate a rapid increase in 14C content, around 12\u2030 (1.2%), from AD 774 to AD 775. These findings are consistent with data from North American and European trees and from Antarctic ice cores, indicating that elevated 14C resulted from an increase in cosmic-ray intensity.\n\nThe authors rule out solar flares as the cause because the 14C spike is around 20 times larger than expected from this solar activity. Likewise, the rapid increase in 14C is not consistent with a supernova explosion, and no such events have been recorded for this time.\n\nThe following list of places refers to the whereabouts of authors on the papers numbered in this release.

Dorie Hightower brings us this report.\n\nHightower: New findings introduce a core evolutionary list of molecular pieces needed to make a tooth.\n\nStreelman: This allows us to explore the molecular ancestry of teeth\u2014so basically, how teeth are made in different organisms and how this may have changed over evolutionary history.\n\nHightower: Dr. Todd Streelman of the Georgia Institute of Technology, explains that he and his colleagues found the network of genes in a very unusual fish\u2014Lake Malawi cichlids.\n\nStreelman: It turns out that these fish are really interesting because they have jaws in their throat around the first, or the most ancestral population of teeth; and then they have teeth associated with the first jaws to evolve, which are very similar to the jaws on the front of your face. So they have teeth in two places and we can ask how these teeth in different populations are made.\n\nHightower: Teeth are extremely ancient structures that arose in early vertebrates\u2014 animals with a backbone\u2014but interestingly predate jaws.\n\nStreelman: We think this provides a developmental context as well as a historical context. It's well-known that the first teeth probably occurred deep in the pharynx of jawless fishes about half a billion years ago. And what this means is that there's a really long evolutionary history of teeth in the fossil record and in the organismal record. So by studying a bunch of different organisms and how they actually make their teeth we can try to understand what's different and what's common about all teeth.\n\nHightower: Because humans replace their dentition\u2014or set of teeth only once, Dr. Streelman says that this discovery should provide useful information\u2014to coax diseased teeth back to health with biology rather than the traditional hand-held drill.\n\nStreelman: Many dental defects involve either the misshaping or the misplacement or complete loss of teeth at a certain stage. Some of the groups of organisms we studied replaced their dentition through their entire life. And so if we can understand how sets of genes are used to make replacement teeth or to make teeth of certain sizes and shapes we can better understand how to make biological implants that may function in the place of say, ceramic implants in dentistry.\n\nHightower: Streelman says that this study also shows the power of evolutionary models like cichlids in biomedical research. Rather than manipulating genes in a laboratory, the cichlids are nature's own experiment.\n\nStreelman: An evolutionary model is a little bit different than maybe a laboratory model. A laboratory model, like the mouse, has been very useful in studying dentitions because you can do all sorts of experimental things. You can rearrange genetic elements, you can turn genes on and off. And an evolutionary model really takes the view that evolution has done these things to the organisms and to their genomes. So evolutionary models express natural variations and we are often interested in studying natural variations because this of course is the type of variation that humans express.\n\nHightower: Streelman is part of a team of developmental biologists, paleontologists, and computational biologists\u2014all working together to uncover new approaches to dental treatment. For more information about this finding, go to  This is Dorie Hightower, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.\n\n(TRANSITION MUSIC)\n\nScientists Discover Key Factor in Controlling the Breakdown of Bone\n\nBalintfy: We think of teeth and bones as being hard and stable. But bones are actually very dynamic, constantly growing and breaking down.\n\nGermain: People think about them as relatively hard, static structures, but at the micro scale, at the small scale where biologists and, you know, doctors think about it, bone is undergoing remodeling at a fairly high rate.\n\nBalintfy: Dr. Ronald Germain, an immunologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, explains the process.\n\nGermain: You have a set of cells that build up bone that are called osteoblasts, and then you have these other cells that we've worked on that break down bone called osteoclasts, and it's the proper balance of the two that give you what appears to be stable bone structure.\n\nBalintfy: In people with bone-destructive disorders such as osteoporosis, however, osteoclast activity outpaces osteoblast activity, leading to a loss of bone density. Dr. Germain says osteoclasts come from a type of white blood cell.\n\nGermain: The way this works is with those white cells that are recruited from the blood after circulating in the bone matrix, because bone is not dead, it's live, and they get certain signals that cause them to attach to the surface, and if the right set of signals are there besides those attraction signals, then they actually aggregate, fuse together, and make big giant cell, which is the mature osteoclast that can begin to destroy the bone.\n\nBalintfy: While most current therapies for bone-degrading diseases target mature osteoclasts, Dr. Germain explains that a rheumatologist who treats people with bone diseases, Dr. Masaru Ishii from Osaka, Japan, became interested in understanding what signals control immature osteoclasts, precursor cells that might otherwise go back into the bloodstream. Dr. Ishii worked with Dr. Germain's lab to determine if a specific chemical mediator controlled immature osteoclast migration in live mice.\n\nGermain: And what we discovered is there's this lipid, this fatty molecule that's at high concentration in the blood, and when it interacts with a receptor, a receiving apparatus, a sensing apparatus on these precursor cells, it tells them to come back into the blood stream, don't hang out on the bone's surface, and don't make a mature osteoclast, and therefore, more of that signal decreases bone destruction.\n\nBalintfy: According to Drs. Germain and Ishii, these findings, combined with previous data, indicate that it may be possible to use combined therapies that target immature osteoclast migration and mature osteoclast function to treat and prevent certain bone disorders such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis.

Now, we wrap up our discussion with Dr. Henry Rodriguez, the director of the Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer programs at the NCI. We'll focus on how proteins can be biomarkers.\n\nDr. Rodriguez: Correct.\n\nBalintfy: And the National Cancer Institute is very involved in that. First, thanks again, and welcome back.\n\nDr. Rodriguez: Thank you very much.\n\nBalintfy: Let's talk about how the National Cancer Institute is addressing the promise and some of the challenges we've been talking about regards to proteomics for the early detection, diagnosis and treatment of cancer.\n\nDr. Rodriguez: Absolutely, so one of the things that the National Cancer Institute did is they held a series of workshops, and they absolutely recognize the promise that clinical proteomics can have for cancer. But at the same time, they also recognize that there's challenges and that the research community has to address and overcome. To that, what they did in late 2006, NCI had then launched the Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer Initiative.\n\nWhat the program is really doing, which is the reason I just think it's one of the best things that's out there and it's very unique, is that it brings together the best minds in proteomics to greatly improve the protein biomarker pipeline, and at the same time, it's doing this with a set of various tools, with the platforms, the various necessary reagents and the data for the field so that ultimately, proteomic biomarker discoveries can be translated into a clinic.\n\nBalintfy: Basically, meaning there's going to be standardization and all this research will focus the standards so that information can be used in the future for potential treatments and\u2014\n\nDr. Rodriguez: Exactly, and then the part that makes it very unique is that the products that we develop, the data that we generate, all this goes back to the public, so at the same time, they could actually look at what we're doing. Hopefully, our goal would be is that they would see the value in these metrics and start applying it within their own research laboratory.\n\nBalintfy: And this is being done basically through some different programs?\n\nDr. Rodriguez: Right, so the program itself actually has three major but well-integrated components to it. One of them they refer to as the Clinical Proteomic Technology Assessment for Cancer commonly referred to as the CPTAC Network. And there's another one we have where we look at individual investigators, and that's one we refer to as Advance Platforms and Computational Sciences. The third component is we're also developing a Proteomic Reagents and Resources Core.\n\nNow, the CPTACS, which is the network, this actually represents one of the most in-depth, multi-disciplinary networks that I'm aware of that's actually trying to optimize existing platforms, again, to reliably identify, quantify and compare proteins in complex biological mixtures.\n\nThe second component becomes, what if it turns out that these analytical tools that the network is looking at might not be the most robust to go from a research environment, ultimately into a clinical setting. So what we did with at NCI is that the second component specifically targets individual investigators.\n\nThe third one happens to become what we refer to as the Proteomic Reagents and Resources Core. And what resources we imply there is that every standard operating procedure we develop, every data set that we will develop, that becomes the resource, and the reagents are going to be the antibodies and other things that will go back to the community. So those are the three well-integrated program itself.\n\nBalintfy: What communities are involved in the NCI Clinical Proteomics Technologies for Cancer Initiative.\n\nDr. Rodriguez: So the initiative itself is referred to as the CPTC, the network of laboratories is what's referred to as the CPTAC. Now, when it comes to the community, I think this is one that's quite challenging, but at the same time, it's one of the most rewarding that I've been given the effort now to lead. It currently consists of scientists. Nearly, it looks at 50 federal, academic and private sector organizations.\n\nWhat makes it quite interesting is that the researchers funded through this program, they represent both seasoned senior investigators who are leading large centers. But at the same time, we also involve junior investigators that's involved in the individual projects.\n\nAt the heart of the program is the one that you just alluded to, which is the CPTAC, and that's the network of laboratories, and what they do is that they actually help govern the overall initiative along with the other members of the program, and that's how we ensure that what the individual investigators are doing, they're informed of what the network is doing. The network is also able to tap into the products and deliverables that's coming out of the individual investigators but also they take into consideration what would the community at large need to further advance their science.\n\nBalintfy: What do you think that is that the NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer Initiative is going to provide the community?\n\nDr. Rodriguez: So, kind of an easy way of looking at it is I actually would say that what the program is ultimately going to provide is the foundation for advancing protein science for personalized medicine. So how's it going to do that? Well, it's going to provide the necessary optimized tools, the various metrics, methodologies, reagents, data and the standards that's going to be needed to define the platform performance parameters and sources of variability at every step of the biomarker discovery and the verification pipeline.\n\nIn other words, kind of like this proteomics tool kit. You open it up, and here's all the things you're going to need to go into your laboratory and have assurance that all this is working correctly; and at the same time, developing collaboration with institutions and by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is a sister agent through the Department of Commerce out here in Maryland. We're also developing various resources and standards through them, because that is the federal arm of developing standards. And our goal is to provide these at very minimal cost to the greater community at large.\n\nThe main thing we really see out of it is that all this encompassing is going to dramatically improve the quality of biomarkers candidates that enter the clinic for validation, and we hope that's going to lay the foundation for the next generation of molecular diagnostic based tools, looking at proteins as the end product that you wish to measure.\n\nBalintfy: I think that kind of wraps up this particular episode and at this moment, we're kind of wrapping up a series. Is there, you know, maybe some final words or is there something that maybe I've missed that we should cover?\n\nDr. Rodriguez: I think the main thing is that while the genomics community has developed very wonderful science, I think the proteomic community is in its infancy, but the potential and the promise of understanding the proteins, their function, and can you use them for early diagnosis, is what you're going to see in the next years if the due diligence is done correctly, it will have a tremendous impact when it comes to cancer care at the patient level.\n\nBalintfy: Terrific.

{"text":"NASA astrobiologists have a type of microorganism in California that is doing something completely novel: it substitutes arsenic for phosphorus in its chemical makeup.\n\nCarbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur are the six basic building blocks of all known forms of life on Earth. Phosphorus is part of the chemical backbone of DNA and RNA, the structures that carry genetic instructions for life, and is considered an essential element for all living cells. Arsenic, which is chemically similar to phosphorus, is poisonous for most life on Earth. Arsenic disrupts metabolic pathways because chemically it behaves similarly to phosphate.\n\nIt's been known for a while that some microbes can metabolise arsenic, but what this organism is doing is building parts of itself out of arsenic, something no other known life forms can do. \"If something here on Earth can do something so unexpected,\" asks Felisa Wolfe-Simon, a NASA Astrobiology Research Fellow, \"What else can life do that we haven't seen yet?\"\n\nThis will change the way astrobiologists look for life on other planets, including where they look (arsenic-rich atmospheres were previously considered off-limits) and what the definition of life really is (right now, we only know that life exists the way it does on Earth, so finding out that life can exist very differently and using different chemicals will expand what we think of when we think of \"life\").

She successfully crossed a rabbit with a Duck Billed Platypus to produce the egg laying Easter Bunny that brightens children's Easters to this day. Dr Florentine is pictured here with the first successful egg laying rabbit, you will note its squat shape due to its Platypus genes. She was later able to achieve the traditional rabbit shape without losing the egg laying ability. For this work Dr Florentine was awarded the Nobel prize for Zoology. Dr Florentine is Ani's Paternal grandmother and she has allowed us to use these photographs from the family album.\n\nOur Science Correspondent Anitab has kindly let us publish another picture from her family album.

Master Li with his usual generosity packs the warhead with Cadbury's Cream Eggs which are ejected when the rocket reaches its apogee. This brings happiness to many but complaints from a few, but I suppose if I was hit by a Cadbury's Cream Egg coming down from 20,000 feet I would be a bit dischuffed\n\nLater she became so advanced that she built this one she called \"Boogie\" because it could play Boogie Woogie on her little piano.\n\nThis is one of her later Robots, named Tiny Tim. The reason for her Bunny Outfit is because she was on her way to a party at her friend Tinybunnywoman's gaff. Tinybunnywoman insists that her visitors dress up in Bunny Outfits.\n\nThis visit was to have a profound influence on the future course of Kahlila's life. Tinybunnywoman told her about an Englishman who was a rabbit enthusiast like herself. He had not only a garden full of rabbits but a House Rabbit named Charli as well. He had a pechant for ladies in Bunny Oufits. The most intriguing thing about him from Kahlila's point of view was that he was an expert Levitator.\n\nWhen she got home she searched in her father's Technical Library for any reference to Master Li. She found a Scientific Paper written by Sir Henry Bartlett-Pounder of the British Levitation Society in the form of a report on the Levitation Experiments carried out by Master Li of Royston Vasey in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England. She resolved that one day she would meet Master Li and find out more but in the meantime she would experiment herself on the lines indicated in the paper To be continued"}

Now, however, researchers have come up with a new way to put retired holiday firs to use: as sterilization materials for medical equipment on the nano-scale.\n\nNeedles from Pseudotsuga menziesii, or the Douglas fir, contain an extract that acts as a natural chemical-reducing agent and converts silver ions, which are commonly used as antimicrobials, to nanoscopic silver particles. In other words, the Christmas tree needles help make the silver particles really, really small.\n\nThe medical community still struggles to ensure that biomedical devices, prosthetics and sensors are fully sterilized before use. Despite all we know about sterilization and microbes, pathogens can still sneak onto equipment and cause problems for patients that come into contact with it. The tiny silver particles can be used to safely coat medical implants and surgical devices in order to prevent microbes from colonizing the surface.\n\nThe team, based in India, succeeded in generating those particles and coating metals and other material in the sterilizing solution.

In fact, many people just have another drink, following the old \"hair of the dog that bit you\" strategy.\n\nThey've put together a graphic that shows how to cure that pounding headache no matter where you are. In Germany, you eat pickled herring. In China, you drink strong green tea. In Poland, relief comes in a sour pickle, and in Mexico, it travels by way of shrimp. Hungover in Romania? Try some tripe soup. In the Netherlands, you just drink more beer.\n\nDoctors typically recommend water for hydration and ibuprofen to reduce inflammation. Taking B vitamins is also good, according to anesthesiologist Jason Burke, because they help the body metabolize alcohol and produce energy.\n\nBurke should know a thing or two about veisalgia, the medical term for hangover. At his Las Vegas clinic Hangover Heaven, Burke treats thousands of people suffering from the effects of drinking to excess with hydrating fluids and medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\"No two hangovers are the same,\" he said, adding that the unfavorable condition costs society billions of dollars-mostly from lost productivity and people taking sick days from work.\n\nAnd really, as we all unfortunately know, only time will soothe the hangover beast, no matter where you are.\n\nJanuary 2, 2013 5:13 pm\n\nThe worst of the New Year's hangovers are behind us, but take solace knowing that people have been celebrating\u2014 and paying for it the day after\u2014with booze for 10,000 years now. This ancient social lubricant has been a staple of cultic feasts and gatherings since the dawn of time, archaeological evidence suggests, meaning every time we sip a cold stout or toast with a glass of bubbly, we're taking part in a millennia-old tradition.\n\nArchaeologists, for example, recently found evidence of nearly 11,000 year-old beer brewing troughs at a cultic feasting site in Turkey, Discovery News reports.\n\nSome researchers suggest that beer arose 11,500 years ago and drove the cultivation of grains. Because grains require so much hard work to produce (collecting tiny, mostly inedible parts, separating grain from chaff, and grinding into flour), beer brewing would have been reserved for feasts with important cultural purposes.\n\nThose feasts \u2014 and alcohol-induced friendliness \u2014 may have enabled hunter-gatherers to bond with larger groups of people in newly emerging villages, fueling the rise of civilization. At work parties, beer may have motivated people to put a little elbow grease into bigger-scale projects such as building ancient monuments.\n\nIn other words, beer and other booze likely helped advance cultures and build monuments, in addition to giving citizens of the time a reason to celebrate. \"There must have been a real sense of anticipation within the community when you knew a big beer event was coming up,\" the archaeologists told Discovery.\n\nJanuary 2, 2013 10:59 am\n\nAs part of Google's ongoing Zeitgeist project, the company is mapping New Year's resolutions from people around the world.

{"text":"Zap of UV Light May Have Triggered Life\n\nHow guanine, one of the four building blocks of RNA, came to exist has long been a mystery. The answer, research finds, may be ultraviolet light.\n\nTHE GIST\n\n- UV light might have triggered Earth's chemistry into forming the building blocks for biology.\n\n- Early Earth had little atmosphere to block solar UV rays.\n\n- Research is ongoing to mimic day\/night cycles and to add minerals to see what else brews in an RNA stew.\n\nIn a quest to understand how life began on Earth, scientists have discovered that a blast of ultraviolet light may have been the spoon that stirred the simmering primordial soup.\n\nThe research demonstrates a more commonplace scenario for creating RNA -- believed to be an early coding system for life. And that opens a wider door for life's evolution not only on Earth, but possibly elsewhere in the solar system and beyond.\n\nResearchers at Georgia Tech and the University of Roma \"La Sapienza\" focused on the molecule formamide, the simplest structure containing the required four building blocks of life -- carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen.\n\nPrevious studies have already shown how heating formamide in a mineral stew creates most of the ingredients for ribonucleic acid, commonly known as RNA. RNA is thought to have served as an early operating system for life, later joined by the more robust deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, genetic coder.\n\nMissing from the formamide brew, however, has been guanine, one of RNA's four critical ingredients. (The others are adenine, cytosine and uracil.) One lightning rod for guanine's creation, scientists discovered, is ultraviolet light.\n\n\"A lot of things can happen when you put a photon into the mix,\" Georgia Tech physicist Thomas Orlando told Discovery News.\n\nToday, Earth's atmosphere blocks most UV rays from the sun, but in its early years the planet lacked ozone and other shielding chemicals in its skies.\n\nThe research demonstrates a scenario for creating RNA that would not require lots of heat or standing pools of liquid water. The finding could also mean conditions for life elsewhere in the solar system may not be as stringent.\n\n\"You don't have to have incredibly special conditions,\" Orlando said. \"A lot of people have prebiotic chemistry scenarios that are aqueous-based. In this way, water is important, but not as important as formamide. That's a big change.\"\n\nScientists are now working to mimic the day-night cycles of solar ultraviolet radiation and adding different minerals to see how that changes the resulting RNA brew.\n\n\"What we're looking for is the chemistry that gives us the building blocks for life,\" said Nicholas Hud, head of Georgia Tech's Center for Chemical Evolution. \"This is a very significant step.\""}

Now a team of researchers reports for the first time that in Tanzania our closest living relatives, chimpanzees, are using sticks and pieces of bark to dig for edible roots, tubers and bulbs.\n\nPublished the week of Nov. 12 in the online early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the study documents the use of digging tools among chimpanzees inhabiting the Ugalla region of western Tanzania. An arid woodland savanna, Ugalla is believed to be an environment similar to those exploited by hominids that eventually evolved into modern humans.\n\nJames Moore, a biological anthropologist at the University of California, San Diego, who has been coordinating research at the site since 1989 under the aegis of the Ugalla Primate Project, said the findings are important because they show that digging with sticks is not a uniquely human adaptation and also because they provide additional insights into the role a dietary shift may have played in hominid evolution.\n\nThe study is coauthored by Moore with Travis Pickering of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Carver College of Medicine have discovered the first two genes involved in moisture sensing (hygrosensation). The discovery also reveals a \"two-sensor\" hygrosensing system in fruit flies that may allow the flies to detect subtle changes in humidity -- an ability that is critical for the flies' survival. The results appear in the Nov. 8 issue of Nature.\n\nSubtle variations in humidity influence reproductive behavior and geographic distribution in a number of animals, including insects, reptiles and birds. Because of their small size, insects, in particular, require a finely tuned ability to detect moisture levels in their environment in order to survive. However, the mechanisms and molecules involved in moisture sensing have remained a mystery.\n\n\"Moisture sensing is a sensory modality, which up to this point no one has understood. This is the first study to identify genes that are involved,\" said Lei Liu, Ph.D., UI postdoctoral fellow in internal medicine and lead author of the study.\n\nLiu and his colleagues made their discovery by testing the idea that moisture sensing is a special form of mechanosensation -- the ability to detect physical forces like touch or movement. The scientists used various genetic techniques to study over 20 genes assumed to be involved in touch in fruit flies. Screening each gene mutation for its effect on the flies' ability to detect moisture, the scientists identified two genes that are mandatory for normal moisture sensing. Furthermore, they observed that one of the genes, \"nanchung,\" is involved in detecting dry air, while the other gene, \"water witch,\" is mandatory for detecting moist air.........\n\nEvolution in the Nanoworld\n\nNanometer scale organisation of molecular components on a copper surface, demonstrating sorting of two sizes of molecules through molecular self-selection. The spacing between molecular rows is about 1 nanometer (0.000 000 001 meter). The of the USA, the researchers from the research groups of Klaus Kern at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart (MPI) and of Mario Ruben at the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe GmbH (FZK) explain that this observation of molecular organization at surfaces may lead to further insight of how simple, inanimate molecules can build up biological entities of increasing structural and functional complexity, such as membranes, cells, leaves, trees, etc. \"The ability of molecules to selectively sort themselves in highly organized structures is a fundamental requirement for all molecular based systems, including biological organisms,\" explains Prof. Dr. Klaus Kern, director of the Nanoscale Science Department at the MPI.........\n\nBoronia hippopala\n\nThank you to Nuytsia@Tas on Flickr for another wonderful photograph (original | BPotD Flickr Group Pool). Much appreciated!\n\nThe Australian genus Boronia has recently been the subject of taxonomic scrutiny. Marco Duretto of the Tasmanian published a paper in 2003, \"Notes on Boronia (Rutaceae) in eastern and northern Australia\" (Muelleria 17:19-135), that described several new species, including Boronia hippopala or velvet boronia. It seems like the taxonomic investigation was well overdue; in Tasmania alone, the number of taxa leaped from six to fifteen (see: Some Giant Steps for Threatened Boronias pp. 18-20 PDF). Of these nine taxa, one seems to have been a range expansion of a taxon known from elsewhere in Australia, one was a re-recognition of a previously-described species that had since been lumped together with another species, and the remaining seven taxa had never previously been described.\n\nMembers of the citrus family, or Rutaceae, boronias have some typical qualities of the family: evergreen woody shrubs with fragrant flowers. Your chances of sampling the scent of velvet boronia (and mine) are quite limited though; other than the few plants in cultivation, Boronia hippopala grows in a small woodland and scrubland area of eastern Tasmania measuring no longer than 7km (4.3 miles) at its widest. This factsheet on Boronia hippopala (PDF) contains more detailed information about the species, including description, ecology and threats.\n\"Body impressions like this are wholly unheard of,\" said paleontologist Spencer Lucas, a curator at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science. Lucas will present the discovery on Tuesday, 30 October 2007, at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America in Denver.\n\nThe fossil imprints, while lacking any bones of the animals, actually contain rare information that bones cannot, said Lucas. Without the imprints of the webbed four-toed feet, for instance, it would be virtually impossible to say they were truly amphibians. The imprints also provide body proportions and important clues to the kind of outer skin the little beasts had. The skin is smooth, not armor plated as a number of would have expected, Lucas said.\n\nThe imprints were found in reddish brown, fine-grained sandstone rocks of the Mauch Chunk Formation in eastern Pennsylvania that correspond to what's known as the Visean Age, an early part of the Mississippian Epoch. That, in turn, is part of the Paleozoic Era that stretched from 542 million years ago to 251 million years ago, when the age of reptiles started. The Mauch Chunk is older and therefore located beneath the heavily mined coal beds of Pennsylvania.........\n\nTime spent in car drives up air pollution\nEventhough the average Los Angeles driver spends about six percent (1.5 hours) of his or her day on the road, that period of time accounts for 33 to 45 percent of total exposure to diesel and ultrafine particles (UFP), as per the study published this month in the journal Atmospheric Environment and available online. On freeways, diesel-fueled trucks are the source of the highest concentrations of harmful pollutants.\n\nIf you have otherwise healthy habits and dont smoke, driving to work is probably the most unhealthy part of your day, says Scott Fruin, D.Env., assistant professor of environmental health at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. Urban dwellers with long commutes are probably getting most of their UFP exposure while driving.\n\nHigh air exchange rates that occur when a vehicle is moving make roadways a major source of exposure. Ultrafine particles are of particular concern because, unlike larger particles, they can penetrate cell walls and disperse throughout the body, Fruin says. Particulate matter has been associated with cardiovascular disease, but the ultrafine fraction on roadways appears to be more toxic than larger sizes......... variant of the FOXP2 gene in our nearest relatives. And they have now revealed another interesting detail: at least one percent of the Neanderthals in Europe may have had red hair, as per a report by scientists working with Carles Lalueza-Fox at the University of Barcelona, Holger Rompler at the University of Leipzig and Michael Hofreiter at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig in the online edition of Science (Science Express, October 25, 2007).\n\nA fashion magazine recently asked what hair colours were in this year, prophesizing an exceptionally large number of red-haired men and women on the streets. In view of \"Gera number of's Next Top Model\" winner, Barbara, of the popular reality show of the same name, the magazine declared that red was the new blonde! In actual fact, only two percent of the world's population (and the German population) have naturally red hair - caused by a mutation in the gene mc1r. The resulting change in the protein it controls causes those who have this gene mutation to carry pheomelanin instead of the dark melanin in their skin, hair and eyes. This gives them much more sensitive, light coloured skin and, in a number of case, lots of freckles.........\n\nBiofuel commentaries in New Orleans\n\nOn Nov. 5 in New Orleans, CAST will present the Commentary, 'Biofuel Feedstocks: The Risk of Future Invasions,' prepared by Task Force Chair Joseph DiTomaso, University of California-Davis.\n\nCredit: ASA-CSSA-SSSA gathering, compiling, and communicating the latest science-based information on agricultural issues.\n\nAs part of the discussion session How Do We Plan to Meet the Demand, CAST will introduce its new Commentary, Convergence of Agriculture and Energy: II. Producing Cellulosic Biomass for Biofuels, prepared by a Task Force chaired by Dr. Steven Fales, Iowa State University, Ames. This new CAST Commentary covers several critical questions, including: What issues should be reviewed in a realistic appraisal of current and future feedstock supplies? What production methods should be used to maximize agronomic systems? What characteristics should distinguish crops developed specifically for production of biomass? What improvements in the feedstock supply system will most likely lead to enhanced conversion, and in turn, create revenue? And, What areas should be emphasized in educating the public on the comprehensive principles of biomass-to-ethanol production? The paper will be presented by Dr. Wally Wilhelm, USDAARS, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Task Force author.........\nEthanol blends are already available at some gas stations. However, their availability varies from state to state, depending on the volume of ethanol produced. Sources of biomass for biofuel production in each state also vary widely.\n\nTo see it everywhere, we have to make more of it on a regional basis, says Dr. Bill Rooney, professor of plant breeding and genetics, Soil & Crop Sciences Department, Texas A&M University. The best source for biofuel in a region is contingent on the environment, growing season, water and fertility availability, stress resistance, and processing and conversion techniques. In any location, there will be several species grown for biomass.\n\nApproximately 20 percent of grain sorghum is now used for ethanol production. Rooney is currently developing sorghum varieties specifically for bioenergy. He will discuss this topic on Wednesday, Nov. 7 during his talk, Sorghum Breeding for Bioenergy Traits, at the International Annual Meetings of the American Society of Agronomy (ASA), Crop Science Society of America (CSSA) and Soil Science Society of America (SSSA). He will speak at 2:30 pm during the symposium Breeding and Genomics of Crops for Bioenergy at the Ernest N.

If you visit that page, the word \"weed\" is used (Courtnay calls this photograph \"beautiful invader\"); indeed, this species is listed in the Global Invasive Species Database, with a comprehensive list of common names: dead man's fingers, green fleece, green sea fingers, oyster thief or Sputnik weed. Originally from Japan, it is now found in many temperate waters worldwide, its dispersal due to \"shellfish aquaculture, recreational boating, and transport on ship hulls\".\n\nThe common name of oyster thief is due to this alga's tendency to proliferate in shellfish beds, where it can smother the shellfish with its rapid growth and colonial expansion. Sputnik weed is, as you might guess, a fifty year old common name from eastern North America. The introduction of this species to eastern North American waters was first observed around the same time as the launch of the Soviet Union's satellites."}

For this week's roundup of interesting engineering technology news articles, be sure to check out Disney's video showing how their engineers celebrate Halloween and learn how one British company is changing the world of energy as we know it. Oh, and turns out Cinderella's glass slipper could indeed support her weight as she dances the night away with her prince charming!\n\nLast week, I blogged about Felix Baumgartner while the world watched in anticipation as he was all strapped into his capsule, ready to be the first man to essentially sky dive from space. By now, we all probably know that his first attempt was put on hold for a few days due to weather. Finally, on this past Sunday the 14th at 10:45am EDT, the world got to witness Austrian daredevil \"Fearless Felix\" jump from space, breaking the altitude and speed records set 50 years ago by Joe Kittinger, a retired Air Force colonel.\n\nEven though the spotlight was on Felix, he had nearly 300 people on his team including more than 70 engineers, scientists and physicians who have been working on this project for 5 years. Kudos to them for bringing this guy back home safe.\n\nI'll leave you with the actual numbers:\n\nHis maximum speed was 833.9 miles per hour (Mach 1.24), higher than the originally estimated 720 mph\n\nJumped from an altitude of 128,100 feet, landing in a desert about 4,000 feet above sea level, making his jump 23.5 miles\n\nA sketch of a gingerbread house designed to look like Jack Skellington house from Disney's A Nightmare Before Christmas (Photo courtesy Disney)\n\nWith Halloween fast approaching, I was curious to see what bright-minded engineers do in celebration of one of my favorite holidays \u2014 and I stumbled across this little gem!\n\nAround this time every year Haunted Mansion Holiday. You can find their creations displayed in the ballroom of the Haunted Mansion in the parks!\n\nDisney has put out a video highlighting some of the gingerbread creations \u2014 take a look:\n\nThe Telegraph\n\nAn Air Fuel Synthesis technical team member with a flask of AFS fuel Photo: Air Fuel Synthesis\n\nYes, you read that right \u2014 A British firm called Air Fuel Synthesis have created technology that will produce gasoline from just air and electricity. Experts have called this scientific breakthrough a potential \"game-changer\" and a savior to the world's energy crisis.\n\nOK, let's see if I can synthesize this for you in layman's terms\n\nUsing electricity, the engineers create pure carbon dioxide by electrolysing sodium carbonate. Then, they produce pure hydrogen by using the same method to shock water vapor that was captured with a dehumidifier.Next, they use the pure carbon dioxide and hydrogen to produce methanol which in turn passes through a gasoline fuel reactor, creating gasoline!\n\nThe company says they have produced 5 liters (don't worry, I've done the conversion for you: 1.32 gallons) of gas in less than 3 months, which can be used in any regular gas tank.\n\nThis specific technology was developed over the past two years as part of a project funded by a group of unnamed philanthropists who believe that the technology will be a lucrative way of creating renewable energy. Oh, and potentially change the world as we know it. No big deal.\n\nWho doesn't know and love the story of Cinderella, the glass slipper and her handsome prince? Last week, Design News challenged its readers to figure out what qualities the glass in Cinderella's slippers need to have in order for her to walk and dance comfortably, and hold her weight? Well, Antariksh Bothale (a BTech and MTech in Mechanical Engineering) figured it out.\n\nHere's the nitty gritty:\nBothale started by assuming Cinderella's weight could be applied evenly across her shoe and roughly estimated her foot size and overall foot area at A = 0.015m squared. If 50kgs (roughly 110lbs) of weight were to be applied equally across this area, he calculated that the compressive stress developed in the material would be:\n\nTurns out that's good news for Cinderella because Bothale concluded that the yield strength of ordinary glass for compressive stress is approximately 50MPa, which is three times more than what Cinderella's weight could produce. Although, he recommends using thermal toughened safety glass vs ordinary glass because of its yield strength of 200MPa.\n\nHowever, he couldn't stop there \u2014 Cinderella just doesn't sit around and look pretty \u2014 she dances the night away with her Prince Charming, which could lead to more compressive stress on the glass slipper.\n\nTo keep things simple, Bothale made a few assumptions of the height and diameter of the heel as well as her stepping angle. By plugging those numbers into his equation, he figured out that the maximum bending stress in the heel while twirling across the dance floor is dangerously close (but not over) to the critical stress level and making the slippers shatter!\n\nEven when the clock strikes midnight and Cinderella has to run to her pumpkin carriage in those glass heels, Bothale figured out that her stepping angle would remain in the \"safe limits\" because her dress would likely prevent her from making long strides, ensuring her shoes wouldn't shatter.\n\nWhat first began as tracking web traffic interruptions on a 36-hour delay for recording purposes quickly turned into something else \u2014 like reporting on breaking news. A few years ago, Brian Fitzpatrick (a Google Chicago engineer) and his team members began tracking the frequency and types of requests that Google gets to remove content from its products or turn over info about users. Thanks to its transparency report, we now know that online censorship comes from all sorts of places including governments and corporate organizations.\n\nA few examples from the report:\n\nGoogle denied a request from the Canadian Passport Office to remove a YouTube video of a Canadian doing something inappropriate to their passport and then flushing it down the toilet.\n\nFrom July to December 2011, Google received 6,321 requests for user data in criminal cases involving U.S. governmental agencies, which affected 12,243 user accounts.\n\nThe interesting engineering angle here? The amount of time it took Fitzpatrick and his team to reduce the 36-hour delay to just minutes: \"Originally Fitzpatrick's team was tracking Web traffic interruptions on a 36-hour delay. During the Arab Spring, Google's former senior vice president of engineering, Bill Coughran, asked for the lag to be reduced to less than five hours. Two days of engineering shrunk it to less than an hour and then Coughran said he wanted it at less than five minutes. That took more than a month, with Fitzpatrick's team ultimately hitting the two-minute mark.\"\n\nThat's some pretty impressive engineering, if I do say so myself!\n\nAnother reason reason why this transparency report is cool is because it gives the world the ability to find out (within a few short minutes) when a country brings down the Internet or restores access to YouTube. Still, some countries will block content without going through any legal channel or notifying Google"}

{"text":"April 15, 2013 meteorology, and in our Earth's habitability. This state of affairs should not be unexpected, given that we have only became aware of much of thisduring the last few decades. I lived roughly the first half of my life carrying only a vague notion of the global importance of the microbial world. But now we know, and the word needs to go out. A measure of microbial literacy is required for anyone to understand the workings of our living planet.\n\n(Top) Upper atmospheric oxygen concentration, as a percent of current levels, plotted against geological time. (bottom) Phylogenetic history of life on Earth, scaled to match the oxygen timeline. Note that the origin of the eukaryotes and the subsequent diversification of animals both correspond to periods of increasing atmospheric oxygen. Source.\n\nThrough the years, many influential writers have endeavored to convey the global influence of microbes to scientists and non-scientists alike. We can now add to these efforts a new contribution that speaks to scientists of all spheres, but especially to other biologists. It was recently published as a Perspective in PNAS, a most appropriate venue. Entitled Animals in a bacterial world, a new imperative for the life sciences, it is authored by 26 scientists whose names are bracketed by those of Margaret McFall-Ngai and Jennifer Wernergreen. It deals specifically with the role of microbes in the lives of animals. While interactions with plants and the inanimate environment are not included, this seems a fitting focus given the anthropocentric interest of most readers. The other stories are for another day, to include the viruses, the most numerous of all players and which interact with all other living things.\n\nMarch 11, 2013\n\nOn October 28, 2010, Elio posted this Talmudic Question: \"Richard Feynman, the famous physicist, said: It is very easy to answer many of these fundamental biological questions; you just look at the thing! To take him up on it, imagine a microscope that lets you observe single molecules in a living cell at one Angstr\u00f6m resolution. What's the first thing you would do with it?\" Thank you, Elio for allowing me to provide some thoughts on the matter from the perspective of a physical chemist\/chemical engineer.\n\nSuch a microscope could indeed help address some of the fundamental issues in biology today. I must say upfront that I am surprised that microbiologists would want to look at (small) molecules ('pure' chemistry), or at the chemical details of 'bigger things', as suggested by the very notion of using a 'Schaechter-Feynman supermicroscope'. This hypothetical instrument would have a resolution of 0.1nm with exposure times in the picosecond range (making it a bit akin to an infrared spectrophotometer) and would operate in Feynman's quantum mechanical world. It would look at the chemistry of biology, dissecting cells into their molecular components that are then chemically characterized individually. But let me explain this more\u2026\n\nWhat Should We Look At?\n\nFeynman suggested that 'seeing better' is 'better.' However, what we see often depends on what we are looking for. At such very high resolutions, we risk focusing on details so small that we lose context and perspective, like looking at the leaves of individual trees and losing sight of the surrounding forest. We will also miss the lakes, the meadows, and even the blazing sunset\u2014the reddish light scattering forward from the nucleating particles of the nano-fog, the beauty of which, Feynman insists, a mere poet may miss (1). Similarly, a narrowly-focused molecular researcher overlooks the relationship of the detail to the living whole (2,3). I would suggest observing at a slightly larger scale, say dimensions of 10 to 100 nm and durations of a millisecond, to see the 'metabolons', 'modules', 'hyperstructures', and the many functional protein complexes (signalsomes, stressosomes, transcriptomes, dividisomes, etc.) to find out if and how they exist as discrete physical objects. We might then see these large, transient biomacromolecular clusters appear and disappear, and see them interact at the subcellular level. We could take full advantage of the atomic resolution of this supermicroscope to visualize ionic currents of ATP, GTP, phosphates, K and Mg ions, bicarbonate, glutamate etc., tracking them from their origins to where they sink and disappear. Even the vectorial ionic currents generated in the cell envelope with their movements through and around the large 'omic' biomacromolecular clusters could be visualized as the cell grows. What would we see when a bacterial cell begins to die? Will the ionic currents 'die'? (4-6). So many events to explore with our supermicroscope!\n\nDecember 03, 2012\n\nI started teaching microbiology to medical students in 1958, at a time when biomedical science was in its full ascendancy. Grant money was there practically for the asking, jobs were plentiful, universities and their medical schools were frenetically building up their science base. Not entirely surprising, the general feeling of young Ph.D.'s such as myself in basic sciences departments was that we were doing the medical students a favor by stooping to teach them. Maybe I exaggerate, but not by much. We had a long ways to go.\n\nSeptember 29, 2008\n\nWhy is it so hard to make an HIV vaccine? The answer lies in the unusual relationship of this particular virus with its host.\n\nBy and large, viruses of humans and other animals interact with their hosts in one of two ways. After an initial period of rapid (often symptomatic) infection, some viruses (e.g., influenza) are cleared completely by the immune system. Others (e.g., many herpes viruses) establish a lifelong latent infection, only to reappear much later when conditions allow. In either case, the immune system effectively clears the virus from the host. Once established, the adaptive humoral response can prevent future infection with antigenically similar viruses. This is what makes vaccines work.\n\nAchilles Wounded in the Heel\nby Paris. Sculpture by Charles\nAlphonse Gumery, 1850. Gumery\nshows Achilles as nonchalantly\ninspecting his wound, even\nthough it will eventually kill him. Source.\n\nRelatively recently, we learned that some retroviruses, including HIV and its dozens of primate lentivirus relatives, have evolved to infect hosts other than their original ones. In the original hosts, the primary infection is usually fairly mild, but the virus is only partially cleared by the immune system. Later, virus replication and cell killing continue at the same pace for the life of the host, although at a lower level. Usually, this process has little or no effect on the host's lifespan, allowing the opportunity for transmission to na\u00efve animals. When the virus jumps to a new host (such as the recent transfer of HIV-1 from chimpanzees to humans and of SIVmac from monkeys called sooty mangabeys to rhesus macaques), the process of infection is essentially the same, but eventually something goes awry. Infection leads to the slow, progressive loss of the target CD4+ (helper) T cells, and thence the nearly inevitable immune collapse and death of the host.\n\nClearly, the benign relationship of primate retroviruses with their primary hosts is the product of a very long period of coevolution. In the process, the virus has evolved two features to avoid the immune response and therefore to make an effective vaccine highly elusive to produce. Both arms of the immune response, humoral (antibodies) and cellular are so affected.\n\nSeptember 15, 2008\n\nMy dear friend Linc Sonenshein introduced me to Bacillus subtilis forty years ago when he was a graduate student with Salvador Luria. The remarkable capacity of B. subtilis to transform itself into a spore has been the focus of my research ever since. Before too long, Sonenshein and I focused on 168 and related strains, the E. coli K12 of the B. subtilis world. We did so for the reason that, thanks to the pioneering work of John Spizizen (with some magic from Charley Yanofsky and Norm Giles sprinkled in), strain 168 exhibited the remarkable capacity to take up DNA from its environment and recombine the DNA into its chromosome. This discovery of genetic competence opened the way to traditional and, eventually molecular, genetics in B. subtilis and made the bacterium a premier model organism. At the same time, and what I did not realize until many years later, we also paid a price for using a strain that had been passaged many times in the laboratory.\n\nSeptember 01, 2008\n\nThis is in response to Mark Martin's prompt*; he is an interesting and eclectic character. Well, I was not inclined to write anything, but since this week has been spent on grant writing (for not very much money, this being the style in Canada) and today, being a sunny day, I decided to cut the grass but the handle kept on coming detached from the push mower which put me in a good mood for a rant (not a blog); I am also upset about the fact that Roger Federer lost again and I don't like to see bad things happen to my heroes. But to come back to Mark's prompt, why do microbes make so many small molecules?\n\nMay 08, 2008\n\nWe have invited a number of distinguished microbiologists to share some of their thoughts with us.\n\nThe Evolution of the Genetic Code\n\nAlthough the genetic code is well established, a very exciting unsolved problem is discovering how codons were related to amino acids in the evolution of protein synthesis. How did a tRNA and a tRNA synthetase first evolve, and what was their ancestral source? How were the genes for the first tRNA and tRNA synthetase duplicated and how was their specificity varied? Can we offer any explanation for why there are two classes of tRNA synthetases? Can one predict which tRNAs evolved from one another? Similarly, can we predict which tRNA synthetases evolved from an existing tRNA synthetase?\n\nA related series of exciting experiments would be to attempt to reproduce some evolutionary events and determine how many mutational changes it would take\u2500and where\u2500to evolve a tRNA synthetase with new specificity from an existing synthetase. Suppression studies many years ago showed that tRNAs may acquire new decoding specificity following single mutational changes, but synthetase suppressors were not recovered, as I recall.

{"text":"Claim to Fame First cave documented in Colorado, in 1843. Now it may be the site of the first hydrogen sulfide-dependent animals ever discovered on land, and a link to learning about life on Mars.\n\nVisit Peek into the cave's upper room as you ski by, but don't go inside. Sulphur Cave contains deadly concentrations of gas, so entry is life-threatening and prohibited.\n\nLast fall, a small team of scientists, veteran cave explorers and a photographer gathered near a small -- and stinky -- opening on Howelsen Hill, on the outskirts of Steamboat Springs, Colo. Giant ventilation pumps whirred, pulling toxic, rotten-egg-smelling hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide out of the narrow cave so that the members of the Sulphur Cave Expedition could work their way in. For the fourth time in two years, they braved the drippy acidic atmosphere that burns holes through T-shirts and turns pennies black inside pockets. Undaunted by the slime coating every crevice, the 50-degree chill and the dark cramped spaces, the explorers were in search of something special: Worms.\n\nSulphur Cave's dark acidic spring waters hold squirming clumps of blood-red worms unlike any that have ever been discovered on land before. The team first collected the worms during its initial expedition in 2007. After finding them again a year later, one of the team leaders, Norman Pace, a University of Colorado distinguished professor in molecular, cellular and developmental biology, began to suspect their biological significance. He'd previously studied the hydrogen sulfide-eating tubeworms that live along hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The worms in this cave appeared to be thriving in similarly harsh, acidic conditions.\n\nBut it wasn't the worms that first drew scientific attention to Sulphur Cave. Veteran caver Mike Frazier, visiting Steamboat Springs on a ski trip a few years ago, observed snottites hanging inside the narrow entrance -- soft colonies of microorganisms that bear a remarkable resemblance to the gooey nose drippings for which they are named. Snottites are so rare -- there are only four other known occurrences in the world -- that Frazier and his scientific buddies quickly obtained a smattering of university and museum grants and assembled the first Sulphur Cave Expedition.\n\nAs the expedition members slithered into Sulphur Cave again last fall, Fred Luiszer, a University of Colorado, Boulder, geologist and speleologist, lurked at the entrance to monitor gas concentrations. He measured hydrogen sulfide at 325 parts per million; the federal standard for maximum daily exposure is 10 parts per million. Carbon dioxide stood at 20.8 percent -- four times the level that will kill you. Team members donned respirators before venturing to the back of the cave.\n\nPhotographer Norman Thompson captured Sulphur Cave's beauty -- the intricate masses of biological life on the cave walls that resemble the folds of brain coral; lacy ceiling gypsum crystals that glitter like starbursts; small yellowish stalactites and stalagmites clinging to the walls and floor. Thompson also documented team members squeezing through dark claustrophobic spaces encrusted with biological goo: \"It looked like about 10 people had thrown up on them. And that's how they smelled, too.\"\n\nThe team collected more of the pencil-lead-thin worms, and a month later, DNA analysis confirmed their genetic uniqueness. Sulphur Cave's worms may be the first hydrogen-sulfide metabolizing organisms ever discovered on land, where they'll be much easier to study than 14,000 feet below the surface of the ocean. This tiny, often-overlooked cave gives scientists an easily accessible location to learn about the kind of environment, and possibly the organisms, that may exist on Mars or the moons of Jupiter.\n\n\"On other planets, those animals are probably going to be bacteria or bacteria-like, and they're probably going to be living in environments similar to this,\" Luiszer says. \"By studying those things here on Earth, it's going to be a lot easier for (scientists) to figure out where to look for life and what kind of equipment and instruments we'll need.\"\n\nTeam member Hazel Barton, costar of the IMAX film Journey Into Amazing Caves, took some of the light-sensitive worms back to her Northern Kentucky University lab for study. She's hoping to determine exactly how the worms, or possibly their bacteria, draw hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to live on. \"This is the only habitat for (these worms),\" she says. \"The next closest thing is diving two miles to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. This is a world-class site.\"\n\nAs a chemistry and geology student, this is immensely interesting! I was recently told by a professor that the biosphere is now thought to extend up to 10km into the the lithosphere - this article is awesome evidence. Thanks for covering biogeochemistry"}

Many other scientists in the region weren't so fortunate, losing years of research, either through storm damage or voluntary destruction.\n\nNot since the torrential floods from Tropical Storm Allison, which badly damaged the Texas Medical Center in 2001, has scientific research been disrupted on such a large scale. Doctors and researchers in the Crescent City became exiles overnight, indefinitely locked out of their labs and unable to see patients.\n\nThousands of laboratory animals -- many genetically engineered with human diseases like cancer and painstakingly bred and cared for -- perished along with vital tissue samples thawed in abandoned labs.\n\nImportant work on heart disease, cancer, AIDS and a host of other ailments may be lost forever to scientists at Tulane and Louisiana State universities' medical schools in New Orleans.\n\nLSU lost all of its 8,000 lab animals, including mice, rats, dogs and monkeys.

{"text":"Ebola-outbreak kills 5000 gorillas\nOver the last decade human outbreaks of the deadly Ebola virus in Africa have been repeatedly linked to gorilla and chimpanzee deaths in nearby forests. Hotly debated has been whether these wild ape deaths were isolated incidents or part of a massive die-off. New research published in the journal Science puts this debate to rest, providing strong evidence that Ebola killed at least 5,000 gorillas at a single site. The study also provides new hope for controlling the devastating impact of Ebola on wild gorilla and chimpanzee populations.\n\nShoulder ligament a linchpin in the evolution of flight\nBrown and Harvard scientists have learned that a single ligament at the shoulder joint stabilizes the wings of birds during flight.

Since then they have been confronted with cats and dogs on some islands of the Archipelago. For scientists, they are therefore a suitable model of study in order to discover if such generally tame animals are capable of adapting their behaviour and endocrine stress response to novel predation threats.\n\nHow does a zebrafish grow a new tail?\nIf a zebrafish loses a chunk of its tail fin, it'll grow back within a week. Like lizards, newts, and frogs, a zebrafish can replace surprisingly complex body parts. A tail fin, for example, has many different types of cells and is a very intricate structure. It is the fish version of an arm or leg.\n\nSquirrels place winning bet in unpredictable world\nIn an evolutionary game of tug-of-war, red squirrels have gained the upper hand over the cunning spruce trees, says new University of Alberta research that suggests the clever animals are staying one step ahead of its food source.\n\nResearchers discover new species of fish in Antarctic\nWhat's 34 centimeters (13.39 inches) long, likes the cold and has an interorbital pit with two openings?

Moreover, they found, animals whose muscles were full of the so-called IIX fibers were able to run farther and at higher work loads than normal mice could.\n\nHow fish species suffer as a result of warmer waters?\nOngoing global climate change causes changes in the species composition of marine ecosystems, especially in shallow coastal oceans. This applies also to fish populations. Previous studies demonstrating a link between global warming and declining fish stocks were based entirely on statistical data. However, in order to estimate future changes, it is essential to develop a deeper understanding of the effect of water temperature on the biology of organisms under question. A new investigation, just published in the scientific journal Science, reveals that a warming induced deficiency in oxygen uptake and supply to tissues is the key factor limiting the stock size of a fish species under heat stress.\n\nComplexity constrains evolution of human brain genes\nDespite the explosive growth in size and complexity of the human brain, the pace of evolutionary change among the thousands of genes expressed in brain tissue has actually slowed since the split, millions of years ago, between human and chimpanzee, an international research team reports in the December 26, 2006, issue of the journal, PLOS Biology.\n\nMit creates 3D scaffold for growing stem cells\nStem cells grew, multiplied and differentiated into brain cells on a new three-dimensional scaffold of tiny protein fragments designed to be more like a living body than any other cell culture system.\n\nBig-brained birds survive better in nature\nBirds with brains that are large in relation to their body size have a lower mortality rate than those with smaller brains, according to new research published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences today.\n\nWhy are lions not as big as elephants?\nCarnivores are some of the widest ranging terrestrial mammals for their size, and this affects their energy intake and needs.

In the area of wind and wildlife, our scientists are using near-infrared videography to monitor and research bat activity at wind turbines, as a side effect of the expansion of wind energy is increased bird and bat mortality at turbines. We also continue to focus on conventional sources of energy development, evidenced in our summary report of the science needs for conventional energy development for the Chukchi and Beaufort seas. In the area of unconventional gas, the USGS worked with the Department of Energy and provided information for their report on the needed reforms for unconventional gas production, and the USGS is working with the Environmental Protection Agency and DOE on a strategy to fill those research gaps.\n\nA submarine berg emerges from the advancing terminus of Yahtse Glacier. Iceberg calving is a key process in the global sea level budget.\n\nIn the area of climate change, the USGS completed theestablishment of the eight climate science centers across the country with universities and consortia in Alaska, Colorado, Massachusetts, Oregon, Hawaii, Oklahoma, North Carolina, and Arizona. We also completed a study measuring the amount of stored carbon in the ecosystems of the Great Plains. This study was the first regional report that applied a comprehensive methodology designed by the USGS in 2010.\n\nScientists hike up the Little Colorado River to assist in installing remote PIT tag readers to more efficiently keep track of native, endangered fish populations.\n\nWater continues to be a contentious issue in various parts of the country. In 2011, the USGS launched a geographic focus study on the Colorado River basin, part of the WaterSMART availability and land use assessment, a three-year study that will provide an inventory of water supply and demand. The effort includes assessing water needed to support ecosystems and will report significant competition over water resources and the factors causing the competition. Water information can also be sent to your email inbox or your phone, thanks to WaterAlert. This tool allows users to be notified daily of water levels at any of our 7,600 real-time streamgages across the country. Addressing the Nation's water resource challenges is a priority for the USGS, and in 2011 we formed an innovative partnership to do just that with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This partnership will provide a one-stop portal to integrated water information for stakeholders with forecasts showing where water for drinking, industry, and ecosystems will be available.\n\nJosh Latimore stands in front of Burney Falls.

GeoFORCE engages minority high school students in the earth sciences, the EDMAP encourages high school graduates of this program to continue to work with the USGS throughout their college careers, and RMSSN provides training in field observation, data entry, and scientific communication to diverse students.\n\nThis map shows the various reported levels of shaking around Oklahoma City after the November 5 M5.6 earthquake\n\n\n\nDuring the heavy flooding that occurred on the Mississippi River, Missouri River, and other major waterways, the USGS's Landsat satellites produced images of the affected areas to provide an overview of the situation. Landsat has often helped provide a big-picture perspective on natural hazards both domestic and foreign and ranging from tornados to tsunamis to wildfires. Landsat is a joint effort of both USGS and NASA. In addition to imagery of natural hazard events, Landsat provides valuable data for land use research and advances the Department of the Interior's important role in land remote sensing under the President's National Space Policy. Landsat images provide complete global coverage, they are available for free, and they span nearly 40 years of continuous earth observation. No other satellite imagery has that combination of attributes. To date, over 6 million scenes have been downloaded; over 2.6 million were downloaded in 2011.\n\nThese highlights are but a few of the USGS's significant accomplishments and activities in 2011.

The R\/V Muskie will be christened and commissioned on Wednesday, October 19 at the Sandusky Yacht Club in Ohio. The R\/V Kaho will be christened and commissioned in the spring of 2012 at the USGS Lake Ontario Biological Station in Oswego, New York.\n\nAugust 31, 2011 - The Honorable Anne Castle (Assistant Secretary for Water and Science, U.S. Department of the Interior) formally dedicating the Research Vessel Kaho to the USGS during a recent celebration the Great Lakes Shipyard, marking the completion of the $8.2 million project.\n\nDeputy Director Dr. Suzette Kimball will christen the R\/V Muskie by breaking a bottle of champagne across its bow and formally naming the vessel. Ms. Pamela Dei, a USGS mechanical engineer who's played a major role in the contracting and construction process for the vessels, will christen the R\/V Kaho.\n\nTwin Sisters\n\nThe two ships are sister ships, and will continue long-term research programs on populations of predator and prey fishes in lakes Erie and Ontario. The Muskie will be stationed in Lake Erie, and the Kaho will be stationed in Lake Ontario. Both ships are 70.8 ft. in length and have a draft (displacement) of five feet or less. This puts them at the smaller end of the GLSC fleet, which boasts two ships with greater than 100 ft. in length, and one with 75 ft. in length. However, the R\/VKaho and R\/V Muskie, with their much shallower draft, are able to do research closer to shore, making them ideal for the smaller lakes.\n\n\"The R\/V Muskie and the R\/V Kaho will provide safe and reliable platforms for scientists, and are equipped with state-of-the-art scientific instrumentation to improve our understanding of deep-water ecosystems and fishes in lakes Erie and Ontario,\" said Russell Strach, director of the GLSC.\n\nStrach noted that the new vessels will replace the oldest vessels in the fleet \u2013 those on lakes Erie and Ontario \u2013 and will have increased fuel efficiency, lower maintenance costs, and greater research capacities, especially because the boats they are replacing functioned on 1950s and 60s technologies.\n\nAdditional improvements in the two ships, such as increased bunk space and shower facilities, allow them to spend more time at sea, enhancing the research capabilities of the GLSC.\n\nCritical Research\n\nUSGS researchers deploy a beam trawl from the R\/V Kiyi\n\nResearchers at the GLSC are eager to use the large vessels to better assess and explore the health and population status of Great Lakes deep-water ecosystems.

Biodiversity, CO2 and the carbon-13 (\u03b413C) isotope (a proxy for photosynthesis) all appear so highly sensitive to supernovae in our galactic neighbourhood that the biosphere seems to contain a reflection of the sky.\"\n\n*sigh* That guy would be on his way to a huge landslide victory to become President of France if he'd kept his \"lifestyle\" under control (to put it mildly). If Hollande can win, DSK would've squooshed Sarkozy.\n\nIn its most recent report, the GAO recommends switching to coins, which could make $4.4 billion for the government over 30 years. But the report says the government benefit does not come from the fact that coins are more cost effective. Instead the benefit comes from something called \"seigniorage.\"\n\nSeigniorage is the profit the government makes from having money out in the economy. More money out there means more profit for the government.\n\nOver time, coins earn more seigniorage for the government, but only because we don't like using them.\n\n\"Lots of people when they take coins out of their pocket or purse at the end of the day put them in what we call a coin jar,\" says the GAO's Lorelei St. James, who oversaw the agency's most recent study.\n\nAs a result, the GAO estimates that if the government were to eliminate $1 bills and switch to coins, it would have to replace every two bills with three coins, because one of the coins would sit idle.\n\nSo more coins means more profit for the government. But where does that profit come from? It comes from us \u2014 the public.\n\nI decided not to include the bit where they talk about the fact that the senators proposing the switch to coins are from states where\u2026 coins or their raw materials are produced. Surprise!\n\nLarge denomination coins are less likely to sit idle than pennies. And people will get used to them. However if you want to consider seigniorage the most egregious is the issuance of coins and postage stamps in special presentation packs for collectors. They cost very little to print and you can charge more than the face value. Daylight robbery.\n\nOn the contrary. Back when we still had the guilder, it was a common hobby to collect 5 guilder coins in coin jars.\n\nDesiato on\nApril 25th, 2012 at 0:01:\n\nIsn't creating coins and stamps for collectors just like any other product with high margins?

How much less likely to vote? Who knows? Not the most compelling data if you ask me\u2026\n\nOneDelayed-choice entanglement swapping consists of the following steps. (I use the same names for the fictional experimenters as in the paper for convenience, but note that they represent acts of measurement, not literal people.)\n\nTwo independent sources (labeled I and II) produce pairs photons such that their polarization states are entangled. One photon from I goes to Alice, while one photon from II is sent to Bob. The second photon from each source goes to Victor. (I'm not sure why the third party is named \"Victor\".)\n\nAlice and Bob independently perform polarization measurements; no communication passes between them during the experiment\u2014they set the orientation of their polarization filters without knowing what the other is doing.\n\nAt some time after Alice and Bob perform their measurements, Victor makes a choice (the \"delayed choice\" in the name).

{"text":"Archive for the 'Sci & Tech' Category\n\nWith the recent nightmare scenario surrounding Sony's Playstation Network (PSN), a lot of people are concerned about online security. Sony have admitted that personal information, including dates of birth, mother's maiden names, addresses and credit card numbers are included in the data stolen by hackers. This is a major incident in the world of the web, one of the largest security breaches ever.\n\nIs the web safe? How can I protect myself from fraud and identity theft? Is there any way I can protect myself?\n\nThe web is by definition a public area. Celebrities especially seem to forget this when posting on Twitter or Facebook. The greatest strength of the web \u2013 that you can access all of it, from anywhere in the world, all the time \u2013 is the reason why security breaches like the one affecting the PSN are inevitable. The web is not inherently safe, but you can protect yourself to a certain extent if you follow the following guidelines:\n\nUse credit (not debit) cards\n\nUse different and strong passwords (a password manager helps)\n\nProtect your data\n\nUse up-to-date software\n\nIf you keep these things in mind when using the web, you will protect yourself from the majority of attacks, and minimise the impact an attack has if you do fall victim to one. The web is a wonderful resource, I love it and can't imagine living without it now, but common sense should prevail with these things, always remembering: the web is public, not private.\n\nI am currently watching an excellent series on the BBC called The Story of Science. The third episode, which I have just watched, is called 'How we got here'.\n\nIt of course raises all the red herrings and difficult questions surrounding geology and biology, but one observation from the presenter hit me squarely between the eyes.\n\nThe episode ended on a geological note, Dr Mosley talked about how violent Earth is, with the volcanic eruptions and earthquakes caused by continental drift, and the tsunamis that occur when those events happen underwater.\n\nHis point was that the development of life is not in spite of Earth being so violent, but is actually helped by it. Some catastrophic events do wipe out entire species, but most of the time the violence actually encourages life to flourish by giving it new opportunities. His best example was the Rift Valley in East Africa, which is home to hundreds of thousands of animals and birds.\n\nI found this a fascinating argument, that natural 'disasters' help and encourage life to flourish far more often than harming it. And it made me think \u2013 well that's exactly how God operates, bringing life out of death, even totally dead and arid places like the deserts of East Africa, transformed into lush savannah by the violent separating of two continents.\n\nIt should not surprise us that he created the world in such a way \u2013 that no matter how dreadful the catastrophe, life always survives, somehow, somewhere. Even at its most harsh and devastating, creation does exactly what it says on the tin.\n\nI have long disliked the central place that 'chance' has in modern scientific theories, particularly the 'random' mutations that drive evolution forward. As a Christian I don't like the idea of utter randomness, of chance being the determining factor in the development of life.\n\nI am also aware that as a concept it is lauded by many of the new atheists as the final nail in God's coffin: there is no need for God, there is no proof for God's existence in nature; everything is down to chance, and therefore there is no creator, and no ultimate purpose to life.\n\nA good friend pointed me recently to this article, by Paul Ewart. It is one of those articles that forced me to look at something from a slightly different angle, which is no bad thing.\n\nPaul Ewart argues that \u2013 maybe \u2013 chance is a necessary aspect of theology, because it helps us to understand the relationship between a sovereign creator and human agency (often called 'free will' \u2013 I'm not sure humans actually have free will, but that's another argument).\n\nPerhaps life is like a game of chess, with God as 'an infinitely wise grand master.' No matter what we do, which moves we make, God always wins, the outcome is always good, in the end: 'God adapts his actions in sustaining the world in existence to take account of whatever happens.'\n\nOf course, we would want to argue that God also knows which moves we are going to make, before we make them. We don't 'catch him out' with our wickedness. We mustn't take the chess game analogy too far; instead it is perhaps a helpful way for us to understand how the world appears sometimes (that there is no benevolent almighty God in ultimate control) with what the Bible insists is the case (the Lamb is on the throne).\n\nAccording to the report 57 per cent of those interviewed described the service an 'intrusion' while 24 per cent said that they believed it was 'a service for burglars'.

{"text":"Life and left-handed meteorites\n\nI wonder if Empress Gensho, who ruled Japan for nine years and died in 748, had something against left-handed people.\n\nIt was Gensho who decreed that kimono should be worn migi-mae (right side over the left at the front) rather than hidari-mae (left over right), as was the style until then. Now only the dead have hidari-mae kimono, so it's not done to wear one like that.\n\n(Once when I wore a yukata the wrong way, a Japanese colleague said to me, \"Are you dead?\" It took me a while before I understood what he was on about.)\n\nThe kimono custom comes to mind because I was reading this week about how the building blocks of life \u2014 amino acids \u2014 are predominantly \"left-handed.\" In the case of kimono-wearing, it was Empress Gensho who, long ago, caused the dominant form to be one particular side over the other. This was just chance; she might have decreed it the other way around. With amino acids, it seems to have been meteorites which fell to Earth billions of years ago that decreed it.\n\nChains of amino acids make up the proteins found in all forms of life on Earth, from plants to people. The funny thing about amino acids is that they come in two versions, a left and right form, just as hands come in a left and right form. Anything that is not identical to its mirror image in this way is called \"chiral.\"\n\nAlmost all living things have left-handed amino acids, known as L amino acids (some bacteria have right-handed, or D, amino acids). Change L-type for D-type, and life would grind to a halt.\n\nSo why do most amino acids come in the left-handed form?\n\nThe immediate answer is: because they arrived from outer space like that.\n\nThis week, Ronald Breslow, of Columbia University, New York, described his evidence for this idea. Amino acids can form spontaneously wherever you get the right chemicals. When this happens in space \u2014 say on asteroids \u2014 equal amounts of left- and right-handed forms are made.\n\nBut asteroids roam across great distances of interstellar space. As the rocks pass neutron stars, the light rays from the stars reach the amino acids, and that triggers the selective destruction of one form of amino acid. The stars emit circularly polarized light. This means that in one direction, the light is polarized to the right. Conversely, 180 degrees in the other direction, light rays are left-polarized.\n\nAs a meteor tumbles toward Earth, it is bathed in an excess of one of the two polarized rays. Breslow has confirmed in experiments that circularly polarized light selectively destroys one chiral form of amino acids over the other. The end result is that meteors landing on Earth have a 5 to 10 percent excess of L-type amino acids.\n\nEvidence of the left-handed bias has been found on the surfaces of meteorites that have crashed into Earth even within the last 100 years.\n\nBut a mere 5 to 10 percent bias doesn't explain why the vast majority of living things on Earth use L-type amino acids. So Breslow has gone on to simulate what happens after the dust settles following a meteor bombardment.\n\nImagine Earth 4 billion years ago. It's a rock covered in a warm soup of basic chemicals, including equal amounts of both types of amino acids \u2014 but without any life on it yet. Then in comes a meteor carrying a payload of extraterrestrial acids. What Breslow has found is that when the amino acids on the meteor mixed with those in the primordial soup, the cosmic amino acids directly transferred their chirality to the native Earthling amino acids.\n\nThis experiment is the first to demonstrate that \"handedness transfer\" \u2014 like a cosmic version of Empress Gensho's decree \u2014 occurs under conditions found on prelife Earth.\n\nThis means that there was a slight excess of left-handed amino acids.\n\nBreslow has also shown how left-handers came to dominate.\n\nIn warm conditions, such as those found in deserts, water will evaporate and leave the amino acids crystallized. As this happens, the left- and right-handed forms bind together, leaving behind increasing amounts of L-type amino acid in the remaining water.\n\nEventually, life got going, and the amino acid in excess became ubiquitous as it was used selectively by living organisms.\n\n\"Everything that is going on on Earth occurred because the meteorites happened to land here. But they are obviously landing in other places,\" said Breslow. \"If there is another planet that has the water and all of the things that are needed for life, you should be able to get the same process rolling.\"\n\nSome scientists have suggested that an intricately linked process leads from the predominance of L-type amino acids to the fact that we process language and motor control in the left hemisphere of the brain. This could explain why most of us are right-handed, why our heart is on the left side of the body \u2014 and even why the accelerator of a car is always on the right and the brake always on the left.\n\nAsymmetry, it seems, is something we find everywhere we look.\n\nBut what if, on that other planet, there was an excess of R-type amino acids?\n\nIf life took off there, it would lead to aliens built from R-type amino acids \u2014 mirror images of us, but unable to process our L-type amino acids"}

We'll discuss what we know about the teenage brain, and the inherent risks of scientific exploration. (Courtesy of National Geographic)\n\nSep 9, 2011 \u2014 Talk of the Nation will broadcast live from National Geographic headquarters in Washington, D.C. on September 20, 2011. If you're in town, please join us for a discussion on the teenage brain and a conversation with explorers.\n\nWe're taking the show back to National Geographic on September 20th, and will pick up on that theme: The limits and risks of exploration.\n\nFrom the deepest caves in the ocean to the highest snow-capped peaks, are there limits to how far an explorer will go? How does one balance safety and the pursuit of the unknown? What is worth the risk? To answer these questions, we've invited two National Geographic explorers for whom risk-taking is just a part of the job. Joining us for this conversation will be deep-sea cave diver Kenny Broad and high-altitude archaeologist Constanza Ceruti.\n\nWe'll also spend an hour talking about National Geographic magazine's October cover story on the teenage brain:\n\nTo many adults, teenagers are a mystery. It's difficult to understand why they act the way they do, why they take the risks they do. Scientists have tried for centuries to figure it out. Now some scientists think they have an explanation \u2014 evolution. Studies suggest that teenagers are highly adaptive \u2014 wired almost perfectly for the job of moving into adulthood from the safety of home to the complicated world they will inherit. David Dobbs, author of the cover story on the teenage brain in the October issue of National Geographic, will talk with scientists in the field \u2014 and listeners around the world \u2014 to discuss how the adolescent brain may be wired for risk.\n\nIn a final segment, Neal will also speak with Juan Jose Valdes, creator of a new map of Cuba, National Geographic's most comprehensive one since 1906.\n\nIf you would like to join us in the studio audience, please send an email to talk@npr.org with your name and the number of tickets you'd like to reserve. Please put \"tickets\" in the subject line. You can attend one or both hours, so please indicate your choice.\n\nYou must be seated at Grosvenor Auditorium by 1:45 pm on Tuesday at the National Geographic Society headquarters: 1600 M Street N.W., Washington, D.C.\n\nNational Geographic is located a few short blocks from the Farragut North Station Metro stop (Red line) and about a ten minute walk from the Farragut West Station Metro stop (Orange and Blue lines).\n\nTalk of the Nation is a live, two-hour program broadcast to more than 320 stations across the United States and overseas, with over three million listeners per week.

She received her Nobel prize for her discovery of nerve growth factor, much of the work on which she performed, in hiding, in the hills near Turin in Mussolini's Italy. She obtained the chicken eggs she needed for her research by begging them from farmers, under the pretext of needing them to feed her children (which she didn't have). In the years before her death, she remained active in many endeavors, including a foundation to mentor young people.\n\nIn honor of her passing, Scientific American is making this 1993 profile of her available for the next 30 days.\n\nJapanese researchers have scanned the brains of three volunteers as they slept to monitor activity changes, which they thought could be related to the content of their dreams.\n\nThey monitored the brain activity while these volunteers slept, and woke them up when t the activity patterns indicated that they were dreaming. Each time they woke, the participants were asked what they were dreaming about. From these accounts, the researchers picked out common themes, and created a list of pictures which represented the common categories (i.e. cars, computers etc.). Then, participants were asked to go back in the scanner, and look at the list of images.\n\nBy comparing the data from the first scan with the second, the researchers identified patterns in the electrical activity. The areas this activity was found in are three key brain areas that process visual information from our eyes.\n\nDr. Katamani, who led the study, said \"Using a database of picture-elicited brain activity and a pattern recognition algorithm, we can read out, or decode, what a person might be seeing from brain scans during dreaming\".\n\nNASA is underfunded. NASA is underfunded not only to do all the science that they want to do (explore other worlds in the Solar System - in complain that they only focus on Mars), but also to plan a manned mission on a timescale that would keep us pumped. Not only that, NASA has also been charged with monitoring Earth and doing all the things that you would consider practical (monitoring weather, climate change, etc.) for this planet.\n\nIf you want NASA to do all of the above, they need money. Is there something simple that you can do to get NASA more funding? Yes - vote. VOTE for the people who support science exploration. VOTE out of office the people who don't fund NASA. It's that simple."}

It is the first chlorophyll-d containing organism to be sequenced, and will provide new information about the genetic evolution of life on Earth."}

{"text":"An Eclectic Digest of Science, Art and Literature\n\nOctober 03, 2011\n\nAsk a Scientist\n\nby Meghan D. Rosen\n\nEach year, the Science Communication program at the University of California, Santa Cruz accepts 10 students and, for nine writing-intensive months, teaches them how to become better science journalists. This year, I am happy to say that I am one of the 10. My nine fellow classmates come from a wide variety of scientific backgrounds (from marine biology to mechanical engineering to neuroscience). We have a self-proclaimed 'fish guts scientist,' a potato pathologist, a reality TV star with survival skills (from the Discovery Channel's, 'The Colony'), a raptor surveyor (aka 'hawk lady'), and an agricultural writer who grew up on a dairy farm.\n\nIt's a diverse bunch of people, with a broad set of experiences, and the best part is: they all like to talk about science. I think I'm in heaven.\n\nOne of our recent assignments was to answer a classmate's question that was about (or loosely connected to) our field of study. The constraints: we couldn't use any jargon in the answer, it had to be clear to a non-scientist, and we had to do it in 200 words or less. Here are some of the question ideas we kicked around: Why does a golf ball have dimples? How does a submarine judge depth? Why do tarantulas migrate? How does the brain form memories?\n\nI liked the challenge \u2013 answer a could-be complicated question with clarity\u2013, and the idea of directly connecting scientists with people looking for answers to life's curiosities.\n\nSo, this month, I'm trying an experiment for the readers of 3QD. Do you have any burning science-based questions that you'd like answered? Do you want to know how something works? Is there anything that you wish was just explained more clearly? If so, leave a question in the comments. I'll solicit answers from my classmates, and get back to you next month. To help us get us started, I've included my own question and answer below (and yes, I stuck to the word limit \u2013I even had two words to spare!).\n\nThe idea behind breast cancer screening is simple: the sooner you find a lump, the sooner you can fight it. Until two years ago, the standard for care was frequent screenings and aggressive treatment. We were constantly on guard (yearly mammograms) and ever ready to wage surgical war (lump or breast removal). Intuitively, it made sense \u2013 root out the cancerous seed before it sprouts. Early detection should save lives, right? Not necessarily.\n\nIn 2009, an independent panel of experts appointed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that mammograms didn't actually cut the breast cancer death rate by much: only about 15 percent. But we were screening more women than ever. So why were so many people still dying?\n\nThe problem isn't detection: mammograms are pretty good at pinpointing the location of an abnormal cell cluster in the breast. But not all abnormal cells are cancerous, and mammograms can't tell the harmless ones from the dangerous ones. In other words, a lump is not a lump is not a lump.\n\nToday, doctors are divided. Some think excessive screening forces thousands of women to undergo unnecessary surgeries. Others think one life saved is worth the cost.\n\nAnswer this: Why are there more horses asses than there are horses?

The wikiquote article says that fellow physicist de Broglie did report that Einstein once said to him \"that all physical theories, their mathematical expressions apart ought to lend themselves to so simple a description 'that even a child could understand them.'\" But I think that \"mathematical expressions apart\" bit is important, since a lot of theories in the natural sciences consist mostly of mathematical relationships. Compare with Feynman's answer to a question about \"why\" a particular physical phenomenon (magnetism) works the way it does...\n\nWhy does eating spicy food make my scalp itchy? And while we're at it, what does it really mean to feel itchy (as opposed to feeling dull pain)? What's the science behind this, and how do anti-itch creams (and pills?) work.\n\n\"The usual account of flight based on differential air pressure on the two differently-shaped sides of the wing seems to break down when an airplane flies upside down.\"\n\nThe theory of lift based on differential air pressure above and below the wing is incorrect. It is Newton's third law that accounts for winged lift; basically the air gets deflected down when the wing is in motion (or in a wind tunnel the wing is stationary and the air is in motion) and there is an equal and opposite force pushing the wing up. The more that air (or any fluid) gets turned, the greater the lift on the object turning the fluid. This is why airplanes can fly upside down, if necessary.\n\n\"How does reflection of light by a mirror work?\"\n\nI was truly surprised to recently learn that light waves\/photons get reflected back by a mirror at every conceivable angle, all of which cancel themselves out by interference except for the case where the incident angle exactly matches the reflected angle.\n\nMy own question, what are the scientific arguments against us being Boltzmann brains in an anthropic universe (a notion rather appealing from a Vedantic\/Buddhist POV)?\n\nPosted by: Sam | Oct 14, 2011 6:20:15 PM\n\nIve been powering things on water for some time now.

Chemical analysis of their bones suggested they ate little or no vegetables.\n\nThis perceived reliance on meat had been put forward by some as one of the reasons these humans become extinct as large animals such as mammoths declined due to an Ice Age. \u2026\n\nGoal: Create a device and software to show me, preferably on a web page I can check from any location, a radar image of anything flying over my house. I want to see and record the size, speed and altitude of \u2026 birds, bats, jets, airplanes, meteors, UFOs, whatever I can see.\n\nRadio waves travel at the speed of light, roughly 1,000 feet per microsecond; so if the radar set has a good high-speed clock, it can measure the distance of the airplane very accurately. Using special signal processing equipment, the radar set can also measure the Doppler shift very accurately and determine the speed of the airplane.\n\nThe radar antenna sends out a short, high-power pulse of radio waves at a known frequency. When the waves hit an object, they echo off of it and the speed of the object Doppler-shifts the echo. The same antenna is used to receive the much-weaker signals that return.\n\n3. Hacking the Hot Wheels Radar Gun, by Ed Paradis:\n\nThe Hot Wheels Radar Gun is a real radar gun currently (Feb 2007) available from Walmart and other retailers for about $30 (USD). It is a real radar gun, operating at 10.525 GHz capable of clocking cars, people, pets, and toys. \u2026\n\nThe module constantly transmits 10.525GHz when supplied power. The module then receives the reflected signal and mixes it with the transmit oscillator. The result is a sinusoid with a frequency equal to the diffrence in frequency of the transmitted and received signal. (Also the sum of the two frequencies is present, but the 21.050 GHz signal is filtered or otherwise lost in the module.)\n\nIf the tranmitted signal is bounced off something that is moving, then you can find the speed of the object by measuring the frequency of the output. Thats how the radar gun works in the first place. Read up on \"Doppler Radar\" to learn more. \u2026\n\nI already don't fly because I don't want to get irradiated or groped. If they move those cancer causing scanners into shopping malls to reduce our population, I sincerely hope that people freak out en mass and put a stop to it.\n\nBecause I am aware of this danger, I will never submit toairport scanners, even if I have to have a pat-down or cancel my flight plans. They call it \"Back-Scatter\", but it is really full-body, penetrating x-rays. Radiation accumulates in the body during one's lifetime and when it reaches a certain level, cancer is nearly certain. \u2026 Officials must naturally defend compulsory passenger X-rays as harmless. But they are signing no guarantees because ionizing radiation in the X-ray spectrum damages and mutates both chromosomal DNA and structural proteins in human cells. If this damage is not repaired, it can lead to cancer. New research shows that even very low doses of X-ray can delay or prevent cellular repair of damaged DNA, raising questions about the safety of routine medical X-rays. Unborn babies can become grotesquely disfigured if their mothers are irradiated during pregnancy. Heavily X- rayed persons of childbearing age can sustain chromosomal damage, endangering offspring. Radiation damage is cumulative and each successive dose builds upon the cellular mutation caused by the last. It can take years for radiation damage to manifest pathology.\nA leading U.S. expert on the biological effects of X-radiation is Dr. John Gofman, Professor Emeritus of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Gofman?s exhaustive research leads him to conclude that there is NO SAFE DOSE-LEVEL of ionizing radiation. His studies indicate that radiation from medical diagnostics and treatment is a causal co-factor in 50 percent of America?s cancers and 60 percent of our ischemic (blood flow blockage) heart disease. He stresses that the frequency with which Americans are medically X-rayed ?makes for a significant radiological impact.?\nThis highly credentialed nuclear physicist states: ?The fact, that X-ray doses are so seldom measured, reflects the false assumption that doses do not matter?[but] they do matter enormously. And each bit of additional dose matters, because any X-ray photon may be the one which sets in motion the high-speed, high energy electron which causes a carcinogenic or atherogenic[smooth muscle] mutation.\n\n that Furthermore, the Obama Justice Department and the European Commission both decided this year that net-neutrality regulation was unnecessary and might deter investment in next-generation Internet technology and infrastructure.\n\nAnaly \"data driven\" in its pursuit of mandates\u2014i.e., listening to the needs of the market. \u2026\n\nOn this winter solstice, we will witness jaw-dropping interventionist chutzpah as the FCC bypasses branches of our government in the dogged pursuit of needless and harmful regulation. The darkest day of the year may end up marking the beginning of a long winter's night for Internet freedom.\n\nMr. McDowell is a Republican commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nUnfortunately the forces of big money and monopolization own the FCC along with most of the rest of our government. Basically we are looking at a rather rapid national decline across a wide spectrum of economic, environmental, and quality of life conditions over the next 20-30 years. \u2026 Really other than a major throwing out the bums in Congress and replacing them with liberal populists who won't shy away from standing up to big business we should probably just learn Chinese.\n\nA proposal establishing rules on net neutrality will be voted on by the Federal Communications Commission on Dec. 21. At issue are pay to play rules giving Internet service providers the power to charge higher prices for more bandwidth. The FCC net neutrality vote seeks a middle ground that prevents outright blocking of content but recognizes the need to manage data-hogging video and peer-to-peer traffic.Currently the FCC has no authority to regulate the Internet. The net neutrality proposal will be used to present Internet regulation legislation to Congress. An explosion in video and P2P traffic, along with the proliferation of smartphones and networked tablet devices, has put a strain on available bandwidth. ISPs such as Comcast and Verizon support a pay-to-play system that allows them to control congestion by charging customers more for a so called \"Internet fast lane.\" With bandwidth demand exploding, ISP have already started charging content providers and throttling P2P traffic. The content providers say such a two-tiered Internet is unfair and should be illegal.Giant ISPs have already been planning how to exploit the FCC proposal. DailyTech reports that a presentation by suppliers to AT&T and Verizon was leaked outlining a two-tiered Internet. The strategy includes charging mobile data customers extra monthly fees per web page accessed and per MB consumed, plus YouTube, Facebook and Skype access fees. The presentation also recommends that ISPs create their own social network and video sites and offer their customers free access for choosing those instead."}

{"text":"Prairie Dog Vault\n\nscience matters\n\nToo Much Brawn\n\nOur technology gets stronger but we get dumber\n\nby David Suzuki with Faisal Moola\n\nMany people say George Wald was the greatest lecturer in Harvard's history. He was certainly the best I've heard. Wald won a Nobel Prize in 1967 for his work on the biochemical basis of colour vision. He and I became friends in the 1970s because we shared a common concern about the misapplication of science, especially during the war in Vietnam.\n\nGeorge once captivated me with a story he told:\n\nFor close to 150 million years, dinosaurs dominated the planet and they were impressive. They were huge animals, armed with weapons like spikes on their tails, giant claws and razor-sharp teeth. They were covered with armour plates. They seemed invincible, and when they roamed the Earth, other creatures fled in terror.\n\nBut they had a fatal flaw: a tiny brain in relation to their body size. Despite their impressive traits, they disappeared \u2014 victims, in part, of their low brain-to-brawn ratio.\n\nAbout 64 million years after the dinosaurs went extinct, a beautiful animal appeared on the plains of Africa. This animal stood upright and walked on two legs, and its skin was free of fur. Unlike the plentiful wildebeest, this animal was rare. It wasn't as big as a hippo. It wasn't even as fast as an elephant. It wasn't as strong as a chimpanzee and it couldn't see like an eagle, smell like a dog or hear like a gazelle.\n\nBut those first beautiful humans were endowed with the highest brain-to-brawn ratio ever achieved, and in only 150,000 years, they had spread to every continent on Earth. Humans eventually outnumbered other mammals on the planet. Their high brain-to-brawn ratio served them well as they learned to domesticate plants and animals, and to live in environments as varied as Arctic tundra, deserts, coral atolls, mountain slopes, wetlands and forests of every kind.\n\nBut then they invented guns and cannons and their brain-to-brawn ratio fell. They got into cars, tanks and planes, and dropped napalm and nuclear bombs. And with each innovation, the brain-to-brawn ratio sank toward that of the dinosaurs.\n\nI love George's story because it encapsulates much of our dilemma. The human brain was the critical factor that more than compensated for our lack of physical and sensory abilities. We had a vast memory, we were observant and curious, and we were creative. In the past, our innovations such as the needle, bow and arrow, and pottery had huge repercussions but took centuries to evolve into the culture.\n\nAgriculture was the big shift that released us from being nomadic hunter-gatherers to farmers and village dwellers. Then the Industrial Revolution heralded a massive change. In only two centuries, people were able to harness the cheap, portable energy of fossil fuels to create machines of incredible power. In the movie Avatar, the giant robots have no heads, a symbol of what we have become as a species. We have acquired vast technological power but far too little of the brainpower or wisdom needed to use that power well.\n\nConsider this simple example. When New Zealand fishers discovered a fish called orange roughy in deep-sea waters, they thought they had hit a bonanza. Technology to fish the deep sea \u2014 radar, sonar, GPS, freezers, giant nets \u2014 enabled them to exploit the abundant fish in massive numbers. Despite the fact that these were a new target species about which virtually nothing was known, the animals were taken in vast quantities. It's called \"harvesting\" but it was really a \"mining\" operation. Only years later did we learn these fish live more than a hundred years and grow and mature far more slowly than inshore species.\n\nWhen was the last time you ate orange roughy? They have been nearly wiped out all around the globe because our technology was too powerful in relation to our knowledge. We didn't consider our limitations, which should have caused us to be far more cautious and conservative. The technology meant that brain-to-brawn sank toward a level closer to that of the dinosaurs.\n\nTechnology can provide great benefits, but unless we learn to use our heads in applying our technologies, we will also go the way of the dinosaurs."}
{"text":"Q&A: 'Science' Journal Official Talks Arsenic-Based Life\n\nJeremy Hsu\n\nDate: 09 December 2010 Time: 10:27 AM ET\n\nA recent announcement of the discovery of arsenic-based life\non Earth was preceded by intense media speculation about possible implications\nfor the search for extraterrestrial life. Now the journal Science is looking to\nkeep the discussion grounded in a more Earthly reality.\n\nThe controversy concerns the bacterium\nGFAJ-1 that was discovered in a California lake. Not only can the bacteria\nthrive in high levels of arsenic, but it can also use the poisonous\nsubstance as a substitute for the usual phosphorus in its DNA, according to\nthe study detailed in the Dec. 2 issue of the journal Science.\n\nThat finding raised eyebrows, because phosphorus is\nconsidered one of six key ingredients for life on Earth to survive. If the\nstudy holds up, it would imply that \"shadow\"\norganisms exist on Earth with a different evolutionary origin and history\nthan \"normal\" life.\n\nMany skeptical scientists not involved with the study have raised\nquestions about its methods and findings. That represents a normal part of\nhow the scientific community scrutinizes new findings, according to Ginger\nPinholster, director of the office of public programs at the American\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), which publishes the journal\nScience.\n\nWhat may not have gone so well is the wild speculation that\nsurrounded a NASA press release that came out before the study on Monday, Nov.\n29. The release stated: \"NASA will hold a news conference at 2 p.m. EST on\nThursday, Dec. 2, to discuss an astrobiology finding that will impact the\nsearch for evidence of extraterrestrial life.\"\n\nPinholster answered questions from LiveScience about how\nAAAS might have coordinated with NASA to head off early speculation, and how\nthe study's authors plan to respond to scientific criticism of their work.\n\nLiveScience: Can you\ntalk about the use of the word \"extraterrestrial\" in the initial NASA\npress release, and how the Science team might have worked with NASA to better\nhandle that in retrospect? [A NASA spokesperson said that the extraterrestrials\n\"statement was accurate\" and did not hype the discovery, in response\nto a query from Ivan Oransky, author of the blog Embargo\nWatch.]\n\nPinholster: The\nresearch article by Wolfe-Simon was distributed by the Science communications team in the normal fashion: We prepared\na lay-language summary of the research article, which was included in the Science Press Package along with\nother papers forthcoming in Science\nor via the ScienceExpress\nwebsite. As always, the \"SciPak\" team's mandate was to\naccurately convey the research as it was accepted by peer reviewers.\n\nSo, for example, the Sciencepress summary didn't make any mention\nof possible implications for the search for extraterrestrial\nlife, because there was no such reference in the paper itself. Sciencedid not organize any\nadditional promotional events related to the publication of this research.\n\nThe NASA public affairs office sent us a review copy of\ntheir media advisory, which was posted on the Monday prior to the Thursday\nrelease time. But it appears that during the short holiday week [of\nThanksgiving], staff didn't flag the \"ET\" reference. In hindsight, we\nshould have alerted NASA that this reference, not included in the paper, would\nbe likely to trigger pre-embargo speculation. [An embargo is used by science\njournals to keep certain research articles under wraps until a certain date.]\n\nLiveScience: Aside\nfrom the pre-release speculation and the intense media coverage, do you think\nthat the scientific debate about the paper has been more or less than normal?\n\nPinholster: High-visibility\npapers or any particularly surprising findings will tend to stimulate more\nintense scholarly debate. So this isn't uncommon, and in fact it's a necessary\npart of the process of discovery. In this case, Science had\npublished journalist Elizabeth Pennisi's excellent\noverview of the issues along with the Wolfe-Simon paper. The news article\nprovided an in-depth review of the work as well as a range of scientific\ninterpretations of it. The pre-embargo Internet speculation regarding NASA's\nannouncement definitely seemed to intensify post-publication\nresponses to the research.\n\nLiveScience: Do you\nhave any particular policies about how authors of Science papers should respond\nto criticisms by other scientists in media stories?\n\nPinholster: Science\nand its nonprofit publisher, AAAS, seek to communicate science broadly. We\nencourage all Science authors to respond promptly to media queries. We're\ndelighted that Dr. Wolfe-Simon is now preparing a list of \"frequently\nasked questions.\" We'll also look forward to her team's response to any\ninput formally submitted to the journal.\n\nLiveScience: Is this\nincident going to change anything about how AAAS handles future press releases\nand sensitive embargoed research?\n\nPinholster: The\nScience Press Package team reviews all embargo episodes to identify lessons\nthat help us continue to improve our performance and service to journalists.\nWe'll take a closer look at any pre-embargo media advisories submitted to us\nfor review. I'll probably also be doing follow-up with key\nreporter-advisors in the coming months to get their feedback as well."}

The deep-sea shrimp Parapandalus has bioluminescence capabilities and actually hurls a glowing cloud of organic matter to confuse a potential predator. Found off the coast of the Bahamas, scientists found this shrimp along with a bunch of other glowing critters at depths around 3,280 feet.\n\nFrom unreal-looking glowing creatures to unreal worlds. Ever wonder how filmmakers create those awesome alien worlds? Well before the days of CGI, these film artists used a variety of methods to take us to new, exciting worlds. This video shows how a fish tank, salt water and various food dyes are used to create these alien worlds. These techniques were used in some memorable flicks like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, and Poltergeist.\n\nRelease the Kraken! Or at least the Humboldt Squid. Scientists are studying why the giant squid and wondering why they are leaving their normal home in the Sea of Cortez in between Baja California and the mainland of Mexico causing issues with the local fisheries who depend on the squid for their livelihood. Scientists haven't seen these mysterious beasts alive and at the immense Kraken-like size but they have seen carcasses washed up on shore (such as the 8-foot-long, 400-pound baby giant squid in Monterey Bay a few years back.

The premise is simple, players save endangered animals and the more animals you save, the better you do. The gameplay is highly social and interactive encouraging players to want to come back, to take care of their animals, get more points, and of course brag to their friends.\n\nThe Crown of Thorns Starfish is a devastating, living bulldozer on reefs. In their search for food, the COTS can wipe out 40-90% of corals on the reefs where they are found causing more devastation and damage than bleaching. Scientiests at James Cook University have come across a harmless protein mixture that is used to grow bacteria in the laboratory. They have found that using this mixture can effectively destroy the COTS in as little as 24 hours. They believe that if they can show it is safe for other types of sea life, they could use their discovery to try to control outbreaks, if only to protect sites that are important for the tourism industry.\n\nWhen fishing, you can pretty much expect the unexpected, but when strange things happen, it is still pretty startling. Now if you followed that last sentence, you might actually enjoy this video. As these saltwater fishermen were out filming for a TV show, one angler is reeling in a pretty big catch when suddenly the 40 lb. baracuda they were attempting to land, leaps out of the water and into the fishing boat. Now any huge fish flopping in a boat is pretty crazy and scary but add this streamlined demon with a mouthful of razor-like teeth and I'd be a bit freaked out"}

{"text":"In 1956, what is now called Silicon Valley was called the Valley of the Heart's Delight. Its rolling hills were covered with farms and orchards. To become Silicon Valley it needed four ingredients: the first, brilliant scientists.\n\nCollecting Scientific Talent\n\nWilliam Shockley was certainly brilliant, says Leslie Berlin, a historian and archivist at Stanford University.\n\n\"People tend to collectively agree,\" she says, that \"[Shockley] was one of the smartest people to walk about this valley for quite a long time.\"\n\nIn 1956, Shockley won the Nobel Prize for co-inventing the transistor. His next dream was to make transistors out of silicon; he decided to set up his lab in Mountain View \u2014 near Palo Alto \u2014 largely for personal reasons.\n\n\"He'd grown up in Palo Alto,\" Berlin says. Most importantly, she says, \"his mother was still living in Palo Alto.\"\n\nOf course, it helped that nearby Stanford University was also doing federally funded electronics research. Shockley was a magnet who drew more brilliant scientists to the valley. Among them was Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel and the man who would come up with Moore's Law \u2014 the observation that the number of transistors on a chip doubles about every two years.\n\nWe imagine the ocean as having high tides and low tides, water that comes in and out in waves. Beyond that, how does water actually move around the world?

Why? The light you presently enjoy travels from distant stars and galaxies takes hundreds, thousands and sometimes millions of years to reach us.Marlon Brando born on April 3, 1924\n 04 Apr 2012 07:20:52 +0000Elizabeth Karlsson\n\nMarlon Brando, Jr. (April 3, 1924 \u2013 July 1, 2004) was an American movie star and political activist. \"Unchallenged as the most important actor in modern American Cinema\" according to the St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture, Brando was one of only three professional actors, along with Charlie Chaplin and Marilyn Monroe, named by Time magazine as one of its 100 Persons of the Century in 1999.\n\nBrando had a significant impact on film acting, and was the foremost example of the \"method\" acting style. While he became notorious for his \"mumbling\" diction and exuding a raw animal magnetism, his mercurial performances were nonetheless highly regarded, and he is widely considered as one of the greatest and most influential actors of the 20th century. Director Martin Scorsese said of him, \"He is the marker. There's 'before Brando' and 'after Brando'.\" Actor Jack Nicholson once said, \"When Marlon dies, everybody moves up one.\" He was ranked by the American Film Institute as the fourth greatest screen legend among male movie stars.\n\nAn enduring cultural icon, Brando became a box office star during the 1950s, during which time he racked up five Oscar nominations as Best Actor, along with three consecutive wins of the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. He initially gained popularity for recreating the role as Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), a Tennessee Williams play that had established him as a Broadway star during its 1947-49 stage run; and for his Academy Award-winning performance as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront (1954), as well as for his iconic portrayal of the rebel motorcycle gang leader Johnny Strabler in The Wild One (1953), which is considered to be one of the most famous images in pop culture. Brando was also nominated for the Oscar for playing Emiliano Zapata in Viva Zapata! (1952); Mark Antony inJoseph L. Mankiewicz's 1953 film adaptation of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar; and as Air Force Major Lloyd Gruver in Sayonara (1957), Joshua Logan's adaption of James Michener's 1954 novel.\n\nHe won his second Academy Award for playing Vito Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972), a role critics consider among his greatest.\n\nHe finished out the decade of the 1970s with his highly controversial performance as Colonel Walter Kurtz in another Coppola film, Apocalypse Now (1979).\n\nHow do you remake an automotive icon? If you're West Coast Customs, it starts with some oversized dubs and copious quantities of neon lighting. If you're the Microsoft skunkworks development team, it means incorporating the company's entire suite of mobile and gaming services into one of Motown's greatest pony cars.\n\nDespite what you see above, this isn't a 1967 Ford Mustang. The fastback body is a replica produced by Dynacorn, but underneath are the modern components of a 2012 Mustang chassis. But like momma always said, it's what's on the inside that counts, and that's where the West Coast Customs crew and their compatriots at Microsoft went wild.\n\nOn March 21, 2006, Jack Dorsey tweeted the first ever tweet on Twitter.\n\nThe sheer fact that you can understand that sentence shows you how far Twitter has gone since then. It has become the de facto short message system of the internet and the favorite social networking service of celebrities all around the world.\n\nAnd, with over 500 million users, it is the largest one-to-many open communication platform on the web.\n\nHowever, the service's beginnings were modest. The service started out as an off-hand project from the creators of podcasting company Odeo, and though it immediately showed potential, it was plagued by frequent downtime in its first couple of years.\n\nStability problems seem to be a thing of the past now, and Twitter handles and hashtags have become a part of popular culture \u2013 they are regularly seen on TV and movie trailers. Ask a celebrity how you can reach them, and the most likely answer will be their Twitter nickname.\n\nWhen it comes to business plans, in the last 12 months Twitter has been somewhat eclipsed with Facebook's IPO. The questions about Twitter still remain the same as on its last birthday: Will it go public, will it be acquired by a giant such as Google, Apple or Microsoft, or will it simply keep growing?"}

{"text":"(Phys.org) \u2014(Phys.org) \u2014 Because humans have a history of disrupting marine environments when they move into an area, mainly due to overfishing, few places in the oceans of the Earth remain as they were before people arrived. And because of that, it's been difficult for biologists to observe some species of fish in their so-called natural environment. The aptly named giant bumphead parrotfish is just one such example. It's the largest species of parrotfish in the world and one of the largest of all reef dwellers. At one time it was also very common. But like many other species of fish, its numbers have dwindled to the point where it's now on the endangered list and over time has learned to fear the presence of human beings. And it's likely for these two reasons that until now, no one had seen, or at least documented, an important ritual performed by the males of the species; head butting one another.

This could be developed to diagnose cancer, cardiac disease, sepsis and other diseases in minutes. Smaller, cheaper, faster are all great advances.

Daylight still shines through but a reflective prism directs angled sunlight onto solar cells. Each one square metre window can generate 120W of power. If the East and West facades also received such cells they could together potentially generate 2 Megawatts of solar power while reducing cooling costs. That makes sense: let light through and capture the solar energy as well. More at DiscoveryNews.\n\nFLAME KILLER: Water douses fires, but an electric field can rapidly suppress flames. Scientists at Harvard University connected a powerful 600-watt electrical amplifier to a probe and repeatedly shot beams of electricity at an open flame more than a foot high.

They believe that in future firefighters could carry such a device as a backpack, or that electric fields could be used in sprinkler systems to create paths through the flames.

{"text":"News for Nerds - The Sinkhole Edition\n\nWelcome back to News for Nerds! This week we'll show you how coffee shops boost productivity, how German scientists have created something called 'air-writing,' and, of course, we've got robots! But first, here are your headlines.\n\n* * * * *\n\nDid you hear the tragic story about the guy in Tampa who disappeared into a 100-foot-wide sinkhole last week?\n\nHis brother heard a loud crash coming from the bedroom, followed by cries for help. When he rushed in to investigate, there was nothing there -- the entire room, all of the furniture, and even the 36 year-old man that was lying in bed, had all collapsed into a giant sinkhole.\n\nSays a spokesman from the Hillsborough sheriff's office, \"Florida is famous for bugs, alligators, pythons, hurricanes, and now sinkholes. I think our salvation is that for most of the time, our weather is picture-perfect.\"\n\nBut hold on just a minute, because that weather is also part of the problem. Officials say that February marks the start of 'sinkhole season' in high-risk parts of the country. That's because, in places like Florida, this is the driest time of year, but also the start of rainy season. Over time, acidic rain can eat away the limestone and natural caverns that lie under the ground.\n\n- from NBC News, CNN, The Tampa Bay Times, and The Blaze\n\n* * * * *\n\nHave you ever noticed that when you cook something pungent in your house, after a while you don't notice the smell anymore? Then you walk outside for a few minutes, and when you come back, Pow!, the smell is back?\n\nI got to wondering about that phenomenon this week, so I did a little research. Turns out, this is a result of something called 'Olfactory Adaptation,' or 'Odor Fatigue.' Your body becomes oblivious to a certain stimulus -- in this case, smell -- so that it's still able to respond to any new stimulus that comes along. Pretty clever, huh?\n\nThis doesn't just happen with smells, in fact. Our bodies are constantly going through sensory fatigue of one kind or another. For instance, it takes only a few minutes after getting dressed in the morning to stop noticing the sensation of your clothes pressed up against your skin. If you leave the radio on in the background all day, at some point you may stop hearing it.\n\nSmell is a bit more obvious though, because, like taste, it is matter-based. Other sensations, like seeing and hearing, are energy-based, meaning that they rely on energy and not mass to trigger them. Once a molecule has triggered a response in your nose, it must be disposed of, which takes time.\n\nGerman scientists have come up with a glove-like wristband that recognizes handwriting movements as you write in the air with your finger, and transmits them into typed letters. Because thumb-texting can be so tedious.\n\nThere's a website called Coffitivity which provides you with a looping 10-minute recording of ambient noise from a coffee shop. The idea is that background noise boosts creativity. You be the judge."}

What else would explain Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's recent statement that the 'United States government is inducing cancer in South American leaders'? We decided to take up the issue seriously. Can cancer really be infused?\n\nNo.\n\nIs it possible to increase anybody's chances of developing the disease?\n\nYes.\n\nRadiation is the most effective option. And here is an interesting corollary. According to a recent report, oncologists can now implant radiation-emitting devices, the size of a seed, into patients to combat existing cancers. These devices can help control cancer-causing biological agents such as helicobacter pylori which contributes to the development of gastric cancer, and human papillomaviruses, which causes cervical, anal, and a few other forms of cancer.\n\nBeware! Faceless and brainless fish found\n\nA rare species of \"faceless and brainless\" fish is the last unusual find made by a group of marine scientists from the United Kingdom (UK). According to a report in The Scotsman newspaper, this elusive fish is a modern representative of animals that evolved a backbone. With a nerve cord down its back, it has no 'specific' brain, face or skeleton. Interestingly, the species is harvested commercially in Asia to use as food for pets.\n\nWater conservation by cars\n\n'Green' efforts by multi national corporations got a whole lot better. Automobile giant Ford recently announced its efforts to reduce water consumption by its global manufacturing operation by 30 per cent per vehicle by 2015. Now, do not be dismissive. You think it is bizarre for a car giant to make such claims?\n\nWhy not reduce the amount of steel or plastic, other raw materials posing potential environment hazards? Sue Cischke, Ford's group Vice President for sustainability, environment and safety engineering has the answers. \"We recorded a 10.5 billion gallon reduction in water consumption in our plants between 2000 and 2010. This is equivalent to the amount of water consumed by 105,000 American homes every year.\"\n\nAnyone listening back home?\n\nAttention Spiderman fans. GM silkworms are here to stay\n\nNow who could have imagined using spider genes to toughen up ordinary silkworms? Well, Dr Don Jarvis of Wyoming University in the United States and his team did. The result? Creation of a new type of Genetically Modified (GM) silkworm capable of spinning silk as strong as steel. Spiders' genes were injected into the worm embryos allowing them to spin 'hybrid' silk that is made of 95 per cent silkworm protein and 5 per cent spider protein.\n\nBurning toilet paper can be fatal. ask rotem singer why.\n\nPoor Rotem Singer. He could have never imagined his save-the-environment-effort could ravage more than 56,000 acres of forests across Chile. Here is what happened. 23-year-old Israeli tourist Rotem inadvertently started the Torres del Paine fire in an attempt to reduce the environmental impact of a trip to the bathroom. He lit some toilet paper that led to the mammoth fire. Rotem has now been arrested."}

{"text":"Scary Movie\n\nStrange Days explores the frightening edges of earth science.\n\nA mystery: Lake Chad, in Central Africa, is drying up. Dust\nclouds rise from the center of the continent and are blown\nacross the Atlantic. In Trinidad, 5,100 miles away, asthma\nrates among children skyrocket, and in the coastal waters\nsurrounding the Caribbean island nation, brilliant coral sea\nfans are becoming ratty and faded. How are these disturbing\nincidents connected?\n\nAnother mystery: The Lamar River, in Yellowstone National\nPark, silts up, changes its course; it becomes a \"river in\nchaos.\" Its banks, once covered with stabilizing trees, are\nnow barren. Core samples taken elsewhere in the Park reveal\nthat nowhere are there aspen trees less than 80 years\nold. It's as if the aspens stopped sprouting in\n1930\u2014almost exactly when the last native wolf was killed.\nCould it be that the elimination of wolves from an area could\ndestroy a river?\n\nAnd how could it be that the biggest herd of caribou in\nAlaska is dying off even as food seems to become more\nplentiful in their warming arctic valley? And what does it\nmean that Formosan termites are causing houses in New Orleans\nto crumble?\n\nThese are just a handful of the mysteries\u2014there are\ndozens\u2014explored in National Geographic's Strange Days on\nPlanet Earth, a four-part series produced by the Cannery\nRow-based Sea Studios Foundation, which premieres nationwide\non PBS-TV next Wednesday, April 20.\n\nStrange Days is a nature film, a science film, a\nfilm about environmental issues. But it feels, at times, more\nlike a mystery movie, at times like a science fiction\nwhodunit. The mystery it probes is huge: How does the earth\nwork, and what is causing all of these inexplicable crises?\nThere are suspected culprits\u2014did global warming do it? There\nare brilliant sleuths\u2014a small army of determined scientists.\nAnd like many a good mystery movie, there is a threat at its\ncore\u2014in this case, the threat of ecological catastrophe.\n\nNo matter how familiar a viewer is with the scary\nenvironmental news of our day, Strange Days will likely\nprovoke a hair-raising response. Fact is, the earth scientists\nwho study this stuff have been working hard over the past few\nyears, and they have made some frightening discoveries. They\nall agree\u2014and there is a scientific consensus here\u2014that we are\nliving in a period of rapid planetary change unlike anything\nhumans have seen before.\n\nGlobal trade, global travel and massive international\ntechnological expansion have dramatically accelerated the\nchanges being wrought upon the world. And that is not entirely\na good thing.\n\nStrange Days reports the recent findings of a\nfar-flung band of researchers working in a variety of\ndisciplines all over the planet. These are geologists and\nbiologists of various stripes, as well as sociologists and\neconomists, and they are looking at global-scale phenomena as\nwell as small-scale, one-time events. The one thing they all\nare finding is that whatever is happening is happening\nalarmingly fast.\n\nClearly, all of this could have made for some painfully\ndepressing television. Instead, the makers of this show have\nturned it into an edge-of-your-seat life-or-death\nadventure.\n\nWhile Strange Days seeks to explore the forces that\nchange the climate of continents, destroy forests in a\nprotected wilderness, make children sick and drive species to\nextinction\u2014subjects that have been explored in many a\nfinger-wagging enviro-documentarty\u2014this feels and looks more\nlike a prime-time mini-series.\n\nMark Shelley, president of Sea Studios and one of the\nseries' four executive producers, says the members of his team\nset out to overcome what he calls \"eco-fatigue.\" They wanted\nto avoid the preaching and the talking heads, as well as the\nafter-school special look. It was their hope, he says, that\nwhen people tuned in, they wouldn't know how to pigeonhole\nwhat they were watching.\n\n\"The fact is, the public is a little turned off by the\nenvironment,\" Shelley says. \"We decided to be very direct\nabout avoiding the pitfalls of the genre. The science itself,\nwe all thought, was really, really interesting. The challenge\nwas to look at the subject matter in a new way. We knew we\nwanted to make a difference. So the large battle was\nattracting an audience.\"\n\nShelley's team came up with a motto, which they circulated\nto everyone involved in the enterprise: \"Think David Lynch,\nnot David Attenborough.\" The decision to look for inspiration\nfrom the disturbing and visually stunning Twin Peaks instead\nof BBC's lofty and grave Life on Earth affected not only the\nway Strange Days tells its story, but also the way the\nshow looks.\n\nThe edgy aesthetic makes itself felt immediately in episode\none, \"The Invaders.\" A car winds its way along a suburban road\nand pulls into a cul-de-sac. As it parks, there is no\nwelcoming narrator. Instead, disembodied voices lifted from\nthe film tease the drama to come. The program's host, Edward\nNorton\u2014star of Primal Fear, Fight Club and other hip Hollywood\nfare\u2014steps out of the door and into the street with a lawn\nchair, sets it up and sits down to face the camera.\n\n\"Alien species are invading every continent,\" he says.\n\"They have enormous power. They are spreading\ndiseases\u2026leveling buildings.\" The camera jumps from shot to\nshot as he speaks. This is not unpleasant or unfamiliar to\nanyone who has seen a film by, say, Wim Wenders or Baz\nLuhrmann, or watched MTV, for that matter. But it doesn't look\nmuch like a documentary.\n\nThroughout, the filmmakers pull out the stops. Slow-mo and\nfast-mo scenes rub up against one another. Start-and-stop\nsequences build tension. Split screens (borrowed from the\nKiefer Sutherland TV series 24) present poetic\njuxtapositions\u2014a leaping monkey above a leaping frog, a\nmeandering band of elk and a meandering stream. The gorgeous\nanimated footage, a staple of the nature doc, is elevated here\nto a glossier, more effective device.\n\nListening to Shelley, it's clear that this was not all\nsimply a matter of pandering to jaded contemporary audiences.\nHe clearly believes the subject matter itself demanded a kind\nof re-invention of the nature documentary.\n\nThirty years ago, he says, Americans responded strongly to\nthe message that they heard on the first Earth Day (the show's\nbroadcast is timed to coincide with this year's annual event).\nBack then, environmental problems were a lot simpler.\n\n\"Now the problems are more insidious. Climate change,\ninvasive species, vanishing predators, low-level toxins in the\nwater\u2014these are more complex ideas. And the storytelling we\nbrought in is our response to that. These are much harder\nproblems to get across as urgent issues that demand our\nattention and our response.\"\n\nThat, ultimately, is the goal that motivates Shelley and\nhis Sea Studios team\u2014not just to make a great show, and not\neven just to raise awareness about the complex threats to the\nenvironment, but \"to deliver you to opportunities to get\ninvolved.\"\n\nTo accomplish this end, Sea Studios created a partnership\nwith National Geographic, the National Science Foundation, and\nVulcan Productions, the Seattle outfit run by the Microsoft\nbillionaire Paul Allen. Together, they have fashioned a vastly\nambitious multimedia juggernaut that is much more than just a\nTV show. (Full disclosure: Bradley Zeve, founder and CEO of\nthe Weekly, is chair of the board of the nonprofit Sea Studios\nFoundation.)\n\nDavid Elisco, the lead writer and series producer of\nStrange Days on Planet Earth, says an academic tract\nbrought the main idea of the program into focus for him.\n\nThe Globalization of Ecological Thought, by Harold\nO'Malley, describes the emergence of a new way to look at the\nenvironment. It depicts an interdisciplinary approach, one in\nwhich, for the first time, researchers from all over the world\nand from various fields within the natural sciences share\ninformation.\n\n\"It was shocking to me that scientists don't talk to each\nother,\" says Elisco, who has a BA in film from Penn State.\n\"This book chronicles what happened when they did, and began\nto see connections in things they hadn't seen before. And I\nrealized: This is a great story. What were they seeing?\"\n\nElisco says the first story line began to appear during a\nconversation with a retired earth sciences professor. He says\nRichard Butler of Duke University inspired him to see the\nnarrative that would become \"The One Degree Factor,\" a\npowerful episode on global climate change.\n\n\"He just started to spin a story,\" Elisco recalls. It was a\ntale of forests creeping northward, of Pacific zooplankton\npopulations plummeting, of dust storms in Chad and asthma in\nthe Caribbean. These stories were all the result of scientists\nworldwide talking and discovering that \"their work was\ninterconnected,\" Elisco says.\n\n\"I realized, these people are on the front lines of a new\ndiscipline. They are some of the greatest science minds and\ntalents studying the natural world, and they were confronting\na big, mysterious question.\"\n\nHaving decided to tell this story born of scientific\ncollaboration, the Sea Studios team set to work in their own\nhighly collaborative manner. Most filmmaking is a team sport.\nAt Sea Studios, it involves a very big team and an unusual\ndegree of cooperation.\n\nIn 2002, the same team had worked with National Geographic\nto produce The Shape of Life, an award-winning series about\nbreakthroughs in the study of evolutionary biology. Strange\nDays, which was initially called The Living\nMachine, picked up where that series had left off.\n\nThe Sea Studios team includes a \"science unit\" headed by\nNancy Burnett, one of the founders of the Monterey Bay\nAquarium; Chuck Baxter, a retired Stanford marine biologist\nwho was both Burnett's and Shelley's teacher in the 1970s; and\nTierney Thys, a scientist who specializes in biometrics.\n\nThe scientists and the filmmakers met for months and\nbrainstormed, ultimately compiling a remarkably detailed\nframework for the video shooting, which was still a ways\noff.\n\nIn Elisco's office at Sea Studios, perched just above the\nbreakers on Cannery Row, bookshelves are filled with white\nbinders that he calls \"roadmaps.\" Each of these binders\ncontains the raw materials for a one-hour show: scientific\nthemes, the names of scientists who would be able to address\nthese issues, narrative techniques and specific ideas for the\nshow's sequences. The Sea Sudios team even \"storyboarded,\" a\nscripting device that directors of feature films use, where\nscenes are drawn out, comic-book style.\n\n\"This is not the way documentaries are usually made,\"\nElisco concedes. In fact, it is typical in documentaries for\nthe filmmaker to begin the process by gathering footage. Sea\nStudios had four shows sketched out from beginning to end\nbefore they even hired the producers who would go out in the\nfield and shoot.\n\nSea Studios then entered into a unique process of\ncollaboration with each of the separate shows' producers. (As\nis typical in television, each program is shot, directed and\nedited by a different producer.) Each was given the \"roadmap\"\nas well as a \"style guide,\" which described in detail the\ndistinct look and feel of the series. Each packet included a\nclip reel of scenes from the feature films that the Sea\nStudios team intended to borrow techniques from.\n\n\"This takes nothing away from the contribution of the\nproducers themselves,\" Elisco says. \"We expected the producers\nto bring a lot of value to the enterprise. These guys have to\nget it off the page and onto film. They have to figure out how\nto get into Chad, for instance, where's there's a civil war\ngoing on. And they have their own ideas, which we were eager\nto hear. And we knew that as soon as they went into the field,\nwe were going to get a lot of surprises.\"\n\nBefore they even began talking to the producers, Elisco and\nShelley brought in their partners at National Geographic and\nVulcan Productions. In addition to providing enough money for\nthe project to allow Sea Studios to \"swing for the fences,\"\nElisco says, each brought a considerable amount of creative\ncapital to the table.\n\nFrom their work together on The Shape of Life, they already\nhad a relationship with National Geographic, the world's\npremier outlet for science and nature programming. For\nStrange Days, they once again worked with Keenan Smart,\nhead of National Geographic's natural history unit.\n\nSmart immediately signed off on the decision to take the\nseries in a direction not seen in nature documentaries.\n\n\"Historically, it's been very, very difficult to create a\nprogram on the environment,\" he says. \"In the business, it's\nseen as an area of programming that can stifle viewers'\ninterest.\"\n\nThe collaboration involved a significant amount of\n\"to-and-fro\" between Monterey and National Geographic's\nheadquarters, Smart says, beginning with a review of the\nroadmaps and ending with a rigorous peer review in which every\nscientific claim in the series was vetted by three independent\nscientists.\n\n\"This show has brought the traditional standards of\nNational Geographic's television programming\u2014including quality\nscientific content and great photography\u2014to issues that were\nregarded as too difficult to crack in a way that would grab\npeople's attention,\" Smart says.\n\n\"There's no doubt in my mind that in the evolution of film\nabout the environment, on subjects like climate change, this\nis the benchmark. I don't think any production company or\nbroadcaster anywhere has produced anything like this.\"\n\nSmart's high praise for the project is shared by others in\nthe world of nature documentaries. Strange Days on Planet\nEarth won Best Series awards at the International Wildlife\nFilm Festival, in Missoula, Montana, and at Wildscreen, in\nBristol, England, where it was the first American film to\nreceive that honor.\n\nFor Smart, the success of the project will not be measured\nsolely in awards or viewership. Like his partners at Sea\nStudios, Smart hopes that the series will have an effect\u2014not\nonly on the way people see the world, but on what they do\nafter the show is over.\n\n\"This is a story about the plight of the living system that\nwe all need to survive,\" he says. \"We are looking here at\nevidence that is incontrovertible. This program tells stories\nof people whose very lives, the foundation of their existence,\nis threatened, in a way that it could be for all of us. It's a\ntimely and essential contribution to a debate that has the\npotential to affect all of us on the planet.\"\n\nThere is an arresting moment in the Strange Days\nepisode called \"The One Degree Factor\" which illustrates some\nstartling problems created by global climate change. It's the\nkind of thing that makes you say \"Huh?\" and then \"Wow!\" It\noccurs when an atmospheric scientist named Jim Hurrell is\npuzzling over the strange case of the African dust caused\nasthma outbreak among the children of Trinidad.\n\nHurrell, studying computerized global weather models,\ndemonstrates how temperature changes in the Indian Ocean have\ncaused prevailing westward winds thousands of miles away, in\nthe Atlantic Ocean, to accelerate.\n\nIt's complicated, for sure, but Hurrell uses animated maps\n(so cool they make the fanciest evening-news weather map look\nalmost clunky) to show how increased storms in South Asia\u2014an\neffect of global climate change\u2014have created wind currents\nthat are affecting something called the \"Atlantic\noscillation,\" a competing pair of high and low pressure\nsystems. These \"new\" prevailing winds appear to be responsible\nfor carrying dust all the way across the Atlantic. In five\nminutes, he seems to prove this bizarre occurrence beyond a\ndoubt.\n\n\"The One Degree Factor\" makes no claims about whether the\ndrought that has dried up the once-enormous Lake Chad in less\nthan 20 years is a symptom of global warming\u2014the jury is still\nout on that one. And the political debate about whether global\nwarming is real, or whether it is caused by human technology,\nis ignored. That debate is not about science, it's about\npolitics, and, thankfully, outside the frame of the\nseries.\n\nMore broadly, the fact that human activies are wreaking\nhavoc on the earth's ecosystems, about which there is no\nquestion among a vast majority of scientists, is taken as a\ngiven.\n\nThe real questions considered in Strange Days are\nthese: what is going to happen as a result of global warming,\npollution, species depletion, etc? And more importantly, how\ncan this scourge on the planet be stopped?\n\nUltimately, this television series is intended as a tool to\nencourage and enable its viewers to become part of the\nsolution to this huge predicament.\n\nPaul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, the fourth-richest\nman in the world, and head of Vulcan Inc., calls it \"moving\nthe needle.\" Early in their collaboration with Sea Studios,\nVulcan made it clear that that would have to be the goal of\nthe effort.\n\nMark Shelley says he was a bit flummoxed when he first\nheard the notion.\n\n\"Paul Allen's charge to us was: 'We have to move the\nneedle.' Just that one sentence, but it was powerful. He\nwanted to see measurable results.\n\n\"At first we thought, 'What needle? Move it how far? Whose\nneedle?' but we embraced it, and it became like a mantra for\nus.\"\n\nThe idea, as explained by Richard Hutton, vice president of\nmedia development at Vulcan and an executive producer of\nStrange Days, is simple and profound: \"We want\nsomething to happen as a result of the project that can change\npeople's lives.\"\n\nHutton, a veteran television producer who counts among his\ncredits the remarkable 2000 PBS series Evolution, knows from\nexperience that a television program can extend its influence\nway beyond the few weeks that it is on the air. The Evolution\nseries was part of a package that included, among other\nthings, teaching tools for middle school science teachers. He\npoints out that it is in such wide circulation, five years\nafter the series aired, that the Evolution Web site is flooded\nby kids every March and April, when the subject is generally\ntaught. (In fact, if you \"Google\" the word \"evolution\" right\nnow, the series' Web site is the first thing that comes\nup.)\n\n\"To me,\" Hutton says, \"it's not really all that satisfying\nto make a TV show, get it on the air, and have people say,\n'that's nice.' That doesn't really do it for me.\"\n\nVulcan's initial contribution to the creative effort drove\nthe filmmakers to use rigorous science to help determine the\nshow's impact. They conducted brainstorming sessions on\nCannery Row in which they used sociological data to discuss\nthings like the ways audiences create meaning from images and\nnarratives\u2014butcher-paper charts from these sessions still hang\non the walls in Sea Studios' conference room.\n\nAnd they insisted that the program should not turn into a\ndowner, as the subject matter might have allowed it to\nbecome.\n\nAlisco says he welcomed the advice.\n\n\"Our mission at the [Sea Studios] Foundation has actually\nexpanded,\" he says, \"from simply building awareness and\nunderstanding, to inspiring action.

{"text":"Saturday, January 29, 2011\n\nA new study on meditation confirms what several previous studies have shown ~ that the practice actually results in physical changes to the brain. The researchers report that those who meditated for about 30 minutes a day for eight weeks had measurable changes in gray-matter density in parts of the brain associated with memory, sense of self, empathy and stress.\n\nMany people like myself who have meditated to some extent over the years and who've followed the scientific research have heard these reports before. Now, it seems, the findings are at last moving even farther into the realm of mainstream medicine.\n\nAccording to the New York Times:Previous studies have also shown that there are structural differences between the brains of meditators and those who don't meditate, although this new study is the first to document changes in gray matter over time through meditation.\n\nBritta H\u00f6lzel, psychologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School and the study's lead author, said participants practiced mindfulness meditation, a form of meditation that was introduced in the United States in the late 1970s.\n\nMonday, January 24, 2011\n\nString theory likely holds the secret to the magnitude of our universe ~ which is probably actually a \"multiverse,\" according to physicist Brian Greene.\n\n\"You almost can't avoid having some version of the multiverse in your studies if you push deeply enough in the mathematical descriptions of the physical universe,\" Greene tells NPR. \"There are many of us thinking of one version of parallel universe theory or another. If it's all a lot of nonsense, then it's a lot of wasted effort going into this far out idea. But if this idea is correct, it is a fantastic upheaval in our understanding.\"\n\nGreene believes the key to understanding these multiverses comes from string theory, the area of physics he's studied for the past 25 years.\n\nAccording to NPR:\n\nIn a nutshell, string theory attempts to reconcile a mathematical conflict between two already accepted ideas in physics: quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity.\n\n\"Einstein's theory of relativity does a fantastic job for explaining big things,\" Greene says. \"Quantum mechanics is fantastic for the other end of the spectrum ~ for small things. The big problem is that each theory is great for each realm, but when they confront each other, they are ferocious antagonists and the mathematics falls apart.\"\n\nString theory smoothes out the mathematical inconsistencies that currently exist between quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity. It posits that the entire universe can be explained in terms of really, really small strings that vibrate in 10 or 11 dimensions ~ meaning dimensions we can't see. If it exists, it could explain literally everything in the universe ~ from subatomic particles to the laws of speed and gravity.\n\nGreene, the author of The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos, tackles the existence of multiple universes in his latest book The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Law of the Cosmos.\n\nFriday, January 7, 2011\n\nEarth's magnetic north pole is continuing to shift toward Siberia, a situation of concern to those who link a \"Pole Shift\" with End Times. In its most dramatic form, a shift would result in reversal of the north and south magnetic poles ~ something that happens about every 250,000 years ~ with resulting cataclysmic havoc.\n\nThe situation was highlighted this week when two large airports in Florida renumbered runways to reflect new compass readings to match the new pole location.\n\nEarth's magnetic poles are governed by forces deep inside the planet. According to space.com:\n\nAn inner core of solid iron is surrounded by an outer core of molten iron. They rotate at different rates, and the interaction between the regions creates what scientists call a \"hydromagnetic dynamo.\" It's something like an electric motor, and it generates a magnetic field akin to a giant bar magnet. The process is not completely understood.\n\nIn the past 15 million years, there have been four reversals every 1 million years, or about one shift each 250,000 years, says Brad Clement of Florida International University, who has lead a recent study on pole reversals. The last one, however, was 790,000 years ago. That might suggest we're overdue for a big change.\n\nNot necessarily so, Clement says. The flips are not periodic, meaning they don't adhere to a schedule of even intervals. Yet the intensity of the magnetic field has been dropping for the last 2,000 years, and \"it has dropped significantly\" during the past two decades, Clement said.\n\nSome scientists speculate a reversal is underway. Clement said that's like forecasting that the bottom will drop out of the stock market because it's gone down the past few days. \"We just don't know,\" he said"}

{"text":"Monday, November 24, 2008\n\nAccording to a recent article in the New York Times, advances in DNA sequencing and genetic engineering techniques are leading to cautious optimism among scientists that someday it may be possible to bring extinct animals back to life. But it will not be easy. DNA undergoes decay after death, falling apart into little pieces within about 60,000 years. Determining the correct sequence of an extinct species' DNA requires special DNA sequencers that can analyze the tiny pieces and then calculate how they were aligned in the original intact molecule.\n\nThe second step would be to actually reconstruct the deciphered DNA code back into intact DNA once again. One way would be to \"reverse engineer\" the DNA of a close living relative species until it is similar to the known sequence of the extinct species. So far this has not been possible because of the sheer numbers of base pairs (perhaps half a million) that would need to be modified. But researchers are hopeful that techniques will be available soon to modify up to 50,000 sites at a time. The extinct species' DNA would then be inserted into an egg of the living relative and incubated in that relative until birth.\n\nHow would your students react if it were to be announced one day that an extinct human such as a Neanderthal had been reverse engineered and then born to a modern human or a primate mother?!\n\nThursday, November 20, 2008\n\nAccording to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, daily doses of the popular herbal antioxidant Ginkgo biloba neither prevent nor delay the onset of dementia (cognitive impairment). The most common type of dementia is Alzheimer's disease.\n\nHerbal extracts of Ginkgo remain popular as a memory enhancer, even though previous scientific evidence showed that Ginkgo just doesn't enhance memory. So don't expect this latest finding regarding dementia to put much of a dent in Ginkgo's annual sales of over $200 million. Good marketing apparently trumps good science.\n\nThursday, November 13, 2008\n\nAccording to an Associated Press article that appeared in many major newspapers and news services yesterday, a 56-year-old woman gave birth last month to triplets. The event was noteworthy because the three baby girls were actually her biological granddaughters.\n\nApparently a young couple could not conceive because the woman had had a hysterectomy. So they used in vitro fertilization (IVF) to produce their embryos, which were then implanted into the young woman's 56-year-old mother.\n\nMy class took quite an interest in the many and varied reproductive possibilities raised by modern IVF techniques. They understood the obvious benefit, which is to enable some infertile couples to have children of their own. They also quickly grasped that it could also be used (in combination with preimplantation genetic diagnosis) to choose a child's sex, to avoid having a child with certain genetic disorders, or even to cure an older sibling of a genetic disorder (See the Current Issue in Human Biology 5th ed., pp. 396-397). But they didn't come up with this scenario!\n\nTuesday, November 11, 2008\n\nGolden rice was once heralded as a cure for vitamin A deficiency, which kills or blinds children in poorer countries worldwide. But twelve years after its development golden rice is still not being produced and distributed. The primary reason is categorical opposition to all genetically engineered (GE) foods by organizations such as Greenpeace. Greenpeace argues that although golden rice might indeed benefit vitamin-deficient children, acceptance of golden rice would open the door to other GE crops that Greenpeace vehemently opposes.\n\nIn the face of intense, well-organized opposition, government regulatory agencies have been reluctant to approve GE crops, including golden rice. The company holding the patent on golden rice eventually gave up, saying there was no money in it. It's still being studied in a few labs by humanitarian organizations such as World Food Day, but don't expect to see it on grocery shelves any time soon. That's too bad, for golden rice really is a product that could help people in need, as opposed to just helping food producers and manufacturers.\n\nSunday, November 2, 2008\n\nFinally, someone has decided to make it easy for consumers to pick the healthiest packaged foods! A coalition of some of the biggest food companies has teamed up with scientists and the federal government to develop and promote a simple front-of-package logo called \"Smart Choices\" to indicate that a food meets certain nutritional standards. The standards include limited quantities of total and saturated fats, cholesterol, added sugars and salt, as well as minimum quantities of nutrients for good health, such as calcium, potassium, fiber, and certain vitamins. And like the \"Heart Healthy\" program originally developed by the American Heart Association, the new program is based on good scientific evidence.\n\nOnce consumers understand what the logo means and accept its underlying health assumptions, they can simply look for the logo on the front of the package. \"Pattern recognizers\" such as myself (who can't find their favorite products in the grocery store if the manufacturer changes the packaging!) will appreciate the help in picking healthful foods. The logo is a green check mark in a square along with the words, \"Smart Choices Program\". For a complete listing of the nutritional requirements to earn the Smart Choices label, visit the Smart Choices website. The logo should begin appearing on products in stores by the middle of next year."}

Rochford, Superintendent of Schools for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. \"With the availability of virtual lab experiences and other Internet instructional tools, students can arrive at the same learning.\"\n\nThe Archdiocese of Philadelphia's policy is modeled after the Pennsylvania Students Rights Option, a law established in 1992, which enables public and non-public students from grades K-12 who do not want to harm animals as part of their coursework to use an alternative instead.\n\n\"The Archdiocese's student choice policy can serve as a model for other schools in the state of Pennsylvania, in addition to other dioceses across the U.S,\" said Laura Ducceschi, Director of Animalearn, a project of the American Anti-Vivisection Society.\n\nTens of thousands of cats, frogs, and other animals are killed annually, specifically for dissection and other educational purposes, despite available alternatives and studies showing that students learn as well or better by using virtual dissection and other humane alternatives, according to Animalearn.\n\nAnimalearn's website offers a searchable database of over 450 alternatives to dissection, downloadable software, and other humane science tools.

Ostrander of the National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda.\n\n\"We think this approach will help pinpoint multiple genes involved in complex human conditions, such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes and obesity,\" Ostrander, chief of the cancer genetics branch, said in a statement.\n\nThe findings apply to purebred dogs: \"We don't know enough about the genetics of mutts,\" commented co-author K. Gordon Lark, a biology professor at the University of Utah.\n\nDogs are descended from wolves and, like wolves, short-haired dogs such as beagles had only the ancestral forms of the three genes, none with variations.\n\nDogs like President Obama's Portuguese Water Dog have variations in all three genes, producing animals with curly hair plus a \"mustache\" and large eyebrows."}

These compounds of oxygen and other elements are known as \"oxides\" and the process of combination is called \"oxidation,\" or more commonly known as burning. We see examples of oxidation every day in the burning of fuel, but this is not very active when one considers the fact that the air is only one-fifth oxygen, the rest being mainly nitrogen and a small percentage of other gases.\n\nNothing else is of such supreme interest as the gripping and vital story of \"Life\u2014 The World's Greatest Mystery.\" Here is the second installment of the dramatic history of man's rise from a mass of floating jelly to the human being he now is. In a most striking manner a famous authority details the amazing facts about the molding of the human face.\n\nWhat They Talked About: LAST month, Dr. William K. Gregory, world-famous scientist of the American Museum of Natural History, told Michel Mok, staff writer, how the earth and life originated. About two billion years ago the earth was torn out of the sun by the passing of another star. Slowly it condensed and cooled down. A billion years later, chemical forces created tiny bits of living jelly in the primeval puddles.\n\nEXPLORERS, working in one of the strangest realms of science, are unearthing curious, dramatic facts. The way autos run, the way seeds sprout, the way eggs hatch, the way radios function, and even the way we feel when we get up in the morning, the latest tests have shown, are affected by flowing, invisible charges of electric power. Recently, experiments in the laboratories of many lands have added to our knowledge of the magical work of electricity in the air.\n\nFOOD from the test tube, strange acids that conquer disease, complex chemicals that make up the vital ingredients of human flesh and blood\u2014these are recent creations of pioneers in a fascinating, unexplored realm of chemistry, far afield from the normal and conventional affairs of workaday laboratories.\n\nLike seekers of another age, hunting an \"elixir of life,\" these modern alchemists are brewing odorous broths from tons of fish and bales of vegetables in order to extract and study the raw materials of living things. With their new-found knowledge, they are succeeding in putting together extraordinary substances that only nature knew how to produce before. Nearer and nearer they are coming every day to penetrating the age-old mystery of life.\n\nBECAUSE they enter into a wide variety of reactions, acids form an interesting and important group of chemicals. By preparing them in small quantities, the home experimenter can learn a great deal about chemistry and its many mysterious reactions and valuable processes.\n\nDISCOVERY of \"odic rays\" of high penetration produced simply by the electric current drawn from an ordinary light socket, and yet with the curative and medicinal value of X-rays, is claimed by Dr. Edgar L. Hollingshead, of Pasadena, Calif.\n\nWith simple, inexpensive apparatus he is reported to have passed rays through 11-1\/2 inches of lead and 4-1\/2 inches of steel, at such strength as to sear dental X-ray films encased in tinfoil.\n\nDO YOU like to dabble with chemicals? It was a hobby with Thomas A. Edison during his youth and formed the basis of an education that later brought thousands of new inventions into the world. Far from being a \"dry\" science, chemistry can be very amusing and entertaining. How many people would believe that you could pour a little drinking water into a china bowl and cause it to burst forth with flames several feet high\u2014without the use of matches?\n\nSYSTEMATIC investment by America in European scientists of proved ability now being driven out of their own countries by racial prejudices or by other features of the vast social disturbances abroad is urged by American scientific leaders.\n\nJust now a large number of highly skilled and able scientists among German Jews are losing their positions in that country and are being forced to emigrate, as happened recently to Professor Einstein. In Russia and some other European countries emigrations of scientific men are being forced by other prejudices or by poverty. Why not endow in perpetuity five thousand of the ablest scientific men of the world with $200,000 each? It would be the most profitable investment ever made, it is argued."}

{"text":"Yes, there are some links to Higgs boson-related articles in this blog post. And we're also going to Lindau, Germany for the 62nd Lindau Meeting. But there's more: the largest meteorite crater has been found, science behind record-breaking heat, bears behave differently when hunters are on their trail\u2026\n\nLet's go!\n\nTwo pieces from Douglas Main, science writer, for OurAmazingPlanet featured here. In an article picked up by the Knight Science Journalism Tracker, Douglas writes about the discovery of possibly the oldest and largest meteorite crater on Earth. In another article, he dives into the science behind the unusually hot temperatures across the US. currently measures about 62 miles (100 kilometers) from one side to another. But before it eroded, it was likely more than 310 miles (500 km) wide, which would make it the biggest on Earth, Garde told OurAmazingPlanet.\n\nHeat is beating records around the country: the first five months of 2012 have been the hottest on record in the contiguous United States. And that's not including June, when 164 all-time high temperature records were tied or broken around the country, according to government records. That's unusual, since the most intense heat usually comes in July and August for much of the country, said Jake Crouch, a climate scientist with National Climatic Data Center. For example, only 47 all-time high records were tied or broken in June of last year.\n\nRachel Nuwer, freelance journalist, has a fascinating post in The New York Times' Green blog about bear psychology, if you will. More specifically, Rachel writes about a research carried out in Sweden which speculates that bears alter their behaviour when they know humans are on their trail. I do tend to agree with this comment left on the blog post: \"This is not in any way to demean the science that is the basis for this article but just how stupid do we think these animals are?\"\n\nAlpha predators like bears, wolves and mountain lions are used to calling the shots in nature. But when humans arrive with guns and hounds, this hierarchy is displaced in more ways than one. Obviously, hunting costs animal lives, but some researchers also speculate that a hunter's presence reverberates in other ways, too, changing the behavior of these large carnivorous quarry. In other words, predators know they're being hunted.\n\nAn interesting blog post by science blogger, Kyle Hill, at the James Randi Educational Foundation blog, in which Kyle argues that skeptics should wash off the \"cynic\" moniker to be even more effective against the likes of pseudoscience.Donna Belder, science blogger, asks how come kangaroos are able to jump around all day, while other animals prefer to walk or run. On Scitable's Student Voices blog.\n\nUntil a recent zoology class, I had never really given much thought as to why different animals move the way they do. For instance, what is it that makes some animals amazing runners over long distances? Why are some fantastic sprinters but wear themselves out after a short time in action? The question that really got my attention, though, was this one: what on earth could make kangaroos abandon running altogether and start mimicking pogo sticks? Kangaroos (genus Macropus) are famous for being ridiculously good at jumping, and they do it so effortlessly that you have to wonder what their secret is. Try jumping around hurriedly for a bit and you'll soon find you suck at it (yeah, I've tried). Not only will you get tired after about 5 minutes, but the fact that you don't have a tail to balance yourself means that you will probably face-plant before the 5 minutes are even up. Jumping just doesn't work for us, or most other animals for that matter. So what is the big secret?\n\nThe 62nd Lindau Meeting is currently underway and a team of bloggers currently at Lindau, has been busy blogging the meeting away. Here are two great posts by Kelly Oakes and Alexander Bastidas Fry:\n\n\"By their very nature, those discoveries that most change the way we think about nature cannot be anticipated.\" This was Douglas Osheroff's claim at the start of his lecture on Wednesday morning, where he promised to tell the young researchers at Lindau \"how advances in science are made\". In his talk Osheroff offered five things that scientists should keep in mind if they want make a discovery. One example that Osheroff used to illustrate these points was the discovery of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson. It earned them the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978, and provided evidence for an expanding universe that started with a big bang.\n\nTomorrow physicists working at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will make an announcement and while we don't know exactly what the will announce there is good reason to speculate it will be the discovery of the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson is a particle which mediates the interaction of all matter with the Higgs field which in turn gives all particles mass. The Higgs is the origin of mass in the standard model of physics.\n\nSpeaking of the Higgs boson, the news of its possible discovery on Wednesday did not leave the young science writers unmoved. Charles Ebikeme, blogging at Australian Science, summarises the news while Natalie Wolchover, writing at Life's Little Mysteries, attempts to explain what the elusive Higgs is all about with a twist:\n\nWhen Peter Higgs steps out onto the tarmac at an airport near the franco-swiss border, it will probably be with equal parts trepidation and elation. CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, and the world's leading laboratory for particle physics, is to hold a scientific seminar on July 4th, with Peter Higgs in attendance, to deliver the latest update in the search for the Higgs boson \u2014 the famed \"God Particle\".\n\nPhysicists at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) say they've discovered a new \"Higgs-like\" particle: a bundle of energy that has most of the trappings of the long-sought Higgs boson. They're not naming the newcomer outright, because there are subtle indications that the particle may not, in fact, be the plain old Higgs itself, but rather a close doppelganger. Don't let that disappoint you. To the contrary, Harvey Newman, a high-energy physicist at the California Institute of Technology and a member of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment (one of two LHC experiments that discovered the new particle), said finding a more exotic variety of Higgs boson is actually \"one of the most exciting things that can happen.\" Here's why.\n\nBefore you go reading all those wonderful stories above, here's something you can do for The SA Incubator and the young and early-career science writers.

{"text":"Better living: kangaroo bacteria, and machine-gun-enhanced SUVs\n\nPEOPLE ALWAYS ask me: How come the newspaper prints so much bad news? How come the front page always has negative headlines like: \"Freak Espresso Machine Explosion Destroys Crowded Starbucks?\" Why don't we print stories with a positive slant, like: \"Destroyed Starbucks Was Popular Gathering Place for Lawyers?\"\n\nWell, OK, then. You want good news? We got yer good news right here, starting with this:\n\nExciting Advance in Livestock Flatulence\n\nAs you know if you have ever stood outdoors in the Midwest, cows give off methane gas. We don't know why. Maybe they're bored. Maybe they're trying to spoil humanity's appetite for hamburgers. All we know is, scientists believe that methane gas is a major factor in global warming.\n\nFor the record, I have a friend named Doris who argues, on good authority, that the biggest single cause of global warming is menopause. Also, I recently received a letter from a reader named Ron Houtsma who theorizes that global warming may be related to the alarming increase in the number of pizza ovens, especially in New Jersey.\n\nBut methane is surely a factor, and cows produce a lot of it. That's why we should all be very excited about the recent scientific discovery concerning -- I am not making this up -- kangaroo flatulence. According to news articles sent in by many alert readers, scientists in Australia have found that even though kangaroos eat the same grasses as cows, they (the kangaroos, not the scientists) produce no methane.\n\nThe question that springs to mind, of course, is: How did the scientists conduct this research? It cannot be easy to collect emission samples from a non-domesticated animal that can travel 40 miles per hour, leap 30 feet at a single bound and punch. I'm guessing the task of gathering kangaroo gas samples fell to some rookie scientist. (\"OK, Sedgwick: Here's a jar, a helmet and a pogo stick. Now get out there and win one for the planet!\")\n\nSo anyway, now the Australian scientists are trying to figure out how the kangaroos manage to be methane-free. They think the answer may one of the 40 types of bacteria they have identified in the kangaroo's stomach. I don't even want to think about how they collected those samples. (\"OK, Sedgwick: Here's a jar, a rope and a snorkel.\")\n\nThe scientists plan to isolate the anti-methane bacterium in the kangaroo's stomach, then see what happens when they put this same bacterium into the stomachs of cows. Speaking as a layperson concerned about the future of my planet (Earth), I just want to say to these scientists, in humble gratitude: Are you insane?? What if the bacterium causes the cows to develop other kangaroo characteristics? And what if these modified cows escape from Australia? It would be like the killer bees, only much worse: \"Wisconsin -- Weary National Guard troops continued to battle a rampaging herd of bacteria-enhanced Australian kangaroo cows that have been bounding around this heartland state, soaring over fences with moos of derision and punching their way into grain silos. 'The worst thing,' said one guardsman, 'is when they get airborne, and suddenly you're facing a hailstorm of incoming meadow muffins. Although I have to say they don't smell as bad as the local cow.' \"\n\nSo there is a certain risk involved in the Australian scientists' research. But however it works out, I think we can all agree on one thing: \"The Moos of Derision\" would be a good name for a rock band.\n\nAnd speaking of good, our next piece of good news, which was sent in by about 19 billion alert readers, concerns a Butler, Pa., company that is making a:\n\nMachine-Gun-Equipped SUV\n\nYes! According to an Associated Press article by Charles Sheehan, a company called Ibis Tek is modifying Chevrolet Subdivisions and other big-momma sport utility vehicles to accept machine guns, which are fired with a joystick inside the car. These are mostly sold to foreigners; to have one in the United States, you need a permit from the federal government, which requires you to have a good reason. Fortunately, I do: I drive in Miami.\n\nI am tired of having nothing but a puny horn to alert the 258-year-old driver in the Oldsmobile ahead of me that the green arrow pointing left means you can turn left now ... c'mon please turn ... turn left please c'mon c'mon hurry up it's gonna change oh nooooo. I think the federal government would have to agree that this is a situation where a friendly warning burst of several thousand .50-caliber rounds would be a big help to traffic flow.\n\nThe Ibis Tek people also offer an option for a grenade launcher, but I think that would be overkill, don't you? Unless those cows show up."}
{"text":"You are here\n\nArticles\n\nThe beginning of this decade, century, and millennium, kicked off with an event that was horrifying when it was approaching but laughable in hindsight. Y2K, or \"Year 2000,\" was the name given to a predicted global software malfunction. Experts predicted that computers would cease to function properly at the turn of the millennium because of programming limitations. At the time, most computers stored only the last two digits of calendar years. For example, 1940 was '40' and 1999 was '99.' Programmers were unsure whether computers would be \"smart\" enough to make the transition from \"99\" to \"00.\" The idea that a problem would arise due to this limitation was put forth as early as 1984.\n\nMathematics is tied with nature. The golden ratio appears in snail shells and leaves, and the Fibonacci spiral in pine cones and romanesco broccoli. Fractals appear as blood vessels, fern leaves, and snowflakes.\n\nCooking is a pastime for many, but what is supposed to be a new, exciting experience often ends in disaster. But have no fear--what once required a perfected-through-generations approach can now be explained by chemistry. Basting the perfectly browned duck and keeping your bushel of bananas the perfect shade of banana yellow are both linked to chemistry.

{"text":"Mine Safety and \u2026 Mating Elephants?\n\nRichard Hammond Finds New Use for Professors' Mine Safety Invention\n\nLEXINGTON, Va., Jan. 8, 2013 -- It's a pretty safe bet that when Col. Jay Sullivan and Col. Jim Squire were designing a device to help rescue trapped miners, they never once thought about an elephant.\n\nBut in early June 2012, the two VMI professors found themselves surrounded by pachyderms in sub-Saharan Africa, in a BBC production, Richard Hammond's Miracles of Nature, starring daredevil broadcast journalist Hammond, of Top Gear fame. The purpose of their journey was to demonstrate how their extremely low frequency seismic detector, or ELF-SD, could be used to replicate the way elephants communicate with one another over long distances.\n\nWhat Sullivan, a professor of mechanical engineering, calls \"the trip of a lifetime\" began in February, when a researcher got in touch with the VMI duo to ask about the animal communication possibilities of the ELF-SD.\n\n\"The idea was to take a look at all sorts of cool animal abilities,\" said Squire, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at VMI.\n\nSquire and Sullivan had been inspired to create the ELF-SD after the Sago Mine disaster killed 12 coal miners in West Virginia in 2006. The two professors, along with then-Cadet Will Flathers '08, sought to create a device that could send signals through solid rock, so people trapped hundreds of feet underground would have a way to communicate their whereabouts to the surface. The device was patented in 2010, and is now awaiting federal approval before commercial production can begin.\n\nWhen Squire and Sullivan first heard from the show's producers, they were surprised, to say the least.\n\n\"We had no idea who Richard Hammond was because we don't watch enough television, I guess, but he's a big deal,\" said Sullivan. \"If you ask the cadets, they all know who is because they all watch his show [Top Gear].\"\n\nSullivan continued, \"We were thinking about miners, and all of a sudden somebody started talking about the seismic communication aspect of [the ELF-SD].\" Squire explained that the TV show's staff had found out about the ELF through a Web search on seismic signaling.\n\nAt first, Squire and Sullivan were asked to travel to Rosamond, Calif., to demonstrate the ELF-SD's usefulness in the staged explosion of an abandoned gold mine. They made the trip over Easter weekend, and despite several setbacks, including the device itself being broken in transit and Squire's laptop computer getting \"fried\" by the X-ray machine at the airport, they were able to demonstrate the ELF-SD's ability to send signals through several hundred feet of rock.\n\nSquire and Sullivan returned to Virginia after the gold mine episode was filmed, thinking that they had done their part for Hammond's show. Two weeks later, they were invited to travel with Hammond and his team to Botswana, where they were to demonstrate that the ELF-SD could also be used to mimic the ultra low frequency waves that elephants use to communicate with one another. Elephants produce such waves in their vocalizations, and scientists believe that those waves can then be transmitted through the ground.\n\nThe weeks between receiving the invitation in April and departure in early June were spent packaging the ELF-SD for trans-Atlantic shipping and finding a company capable of shipping it. In the end, the producers of the show paid approximately $3,000 in shipping fees for the 140-pound device \u2013 and for a brief moment upon the device's arrival in South Africa, it looked like they might have to pay more.\n\nSullivan explained that the ELF-SD got hung up in customs, with South African officials demanding payment of a fee before it could be released. \"You get the feeling that you're not in Kansas anymore,\" said Sullivan.\n\nFor a moment, Sullivan and Squire didn't know what would happen, but then a \"fixer\" \u2013 an employee of the wildlife filming company Afriscreen Films \u2013 simply demanded that the ELF-SD be freed, and the officials relented immediately.\n\n\"The fixers were rugged individuals,\" said Sullivan. \"They're very smart people. They know how to get stuff done. They have to be.\"\n\nWhen Squire and Sullivan joined the ELF-SD in Botswana, after a journey that included a 14 \u00bd-hour flight from New York City to Johannesburg, they found a luxurious camp in the heart of the African bush \u2013 one that had already gained fame as a favorite getaway of Princes William and Harry of Great Britain.\n\nCamp Meno a Kwena, which translates into \"Teeth of the Crocodile,\" boasted tents that were a far cry from those Americans might remember from summer camp \u2013 these had real beds with linens, rugs on the floor, and even shaving stands, used each morning after an African servant supplied hot water. Visitors took showers outdoors, after servants had filled 10-gallon bags with hot water. Solar lights provided illumination.\n\n\"It really looked like something out of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,'\" said Squire of the camp. He added that the noise of animals, such as elephants, hippos, and zebras coming to drink in the nearby Boteti River, was a constant backdrop.\n\n\"It felt very much like an 1890s safari adventure,\" added Sullivan. He recalls an abundance of delicious food, plus French press coffee. There were even a few phone calls home, thanks to the iPhones carried by the British film crew.\n\nWorking in the field meant spending several hours setting up the ELF-SD and then waiting for elephants to show up. The episode of Miracles of Nature featuring the ELF-SD, which is now available on YouTube, shows a herd of bull elephants doing a rather abrupt U-turn in the device's direction when the ELF-SD was turned on and set to the frequency of a female elephant. Squire and Sullivan, though, bring a scientist's skepticism to the behavior observed.\n\n\"It certainly seemed like they did [respond to the ELF-SD's] signals,\" said Squire. \"But the jury's still out for me. It did seem like it was happening more often than chance would dictate.\"\n\nFor his part, Sullivan said he'd like to see a more controlled experiment. \"[The elephants] responded to it,\" he said. \"The question in my mind is, 'Was it solely through the ground that they were feeling this?'\" There's always the possibility that they were hearing the ELF-SD's frequencies as well as feeling them, he explained.\n\nWith their moment of televised fame behind them, the two professors and co-inventors have turned their attention to another one of their inventions: a robot designed to remove ticks from people's yards and thereby stem the spread of Lyme disease. The \"tick rover,\" which was patented in 2006, is scheduled to be tested this spring at Old Dominion University, said Squire.\n\n\"We have ideas,\" said Sullivan, referring to himself and Squire. \"We always have ideas. \u2026We've had a great association working with each other on different things. On a number of occasions, we've done work where we didn't have any realistic expectation of being successful but we rallied and were able to fix things. \u2026 We've had a really good run here, knock on wood.\""}
{"text":"Scientists have discovered what might be one of the only creatures to use photosynthesis like a plant. Called the pea aphid, this tiny insect seems to turn sunlight into energy for daily use.\n\nWhile most animals rely on energy from food to obtain adenoise triphosphate, studies have suggested that the pea aphid traps sunlight within its body to generate ATP. This complex is the cellular energy that enables the body to perform biochemical processes.\n\nAphids are already recognized as different from most animals in that they produce their own carotenoids- pigments that are generated by plants, microorganisms and fungi. Though the ability was originally attributed to a gene swap between the bugs and fungi, new information implies that the substance is related to the aphid's photosynthetic abilities.\n\nCarotenoids are one of the primary factors in an aphid's color. Recent research has found that the aphids' color, and carotenoid production, changes depending on environmental factors. Colder temperatures result in greener aphids with high levels of carotenoids, optimal conditions bred orange aphids with medium levels of carotenoids, and oppressive, limited environments bred white, pigment-less aphids.\n\nA test of ATP levels in each color of aphid showed that the green ones produced more than the white, while the orange produced more when exposed to sunlight than when kept in the dark. A detailed report was published in the Scientific Reports journal just this month.\n\nIf you are looking for an impromptu activity to do with your friends, partner or children, tonight is an especially perfect night to embark on a camping trip.

Here, the Washington Post's Marc Kaufman explains why the project is considered \"the mission of the decade.\"\n\nAnother video reflects just how monumental the landing was, as the NASA staff erupts in celebration:\n\nSunscreens and other sun-related products are considered some of the most important in skin care. A recent study has discovered a natural, less oily substance that possesses similar qualities: the strawberry.\n\nThe research team, comprised of both Italian and Spanish scientists, tested the effect of strawberry extract on human cell structures in concentrations of 0.05, 0.25 and 0.5 milligrams per milliliter. The study's results proved that the anthocyanins, which are responsible for the red coloring in strawberries and other plants, protect the skin from UVA rays and reduce long-term skin damage from the sun.\n\n\"We have verified the protecting effect of strawberry extract against damage to skin cells caused by UVA rays,\" said Maurizio Battino of the Universita Politecnia delle Marche.\n\n\"These aspects are of great importance as they provide protection for cell lines subject to conditions that can provoke cancer and other skin-related inflammatory and degenerative illnesses.\"\n\nThough the findings are undoubtedly significant, their everyday practicality is still under debate.\n\n\"These compounds have important anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-tumor properties. At of by ingesting the fruit itself.\"\n\nGreen, environmentally friendly technology is all the rage as global warming concerns heighten and people begin taking responsibility for the health of our home planet.\n\nOne of the most popular topics in the sector today is alternative energy; the possibilities, potentials, hardships and numerous advantages. Some progress has even been made, with experts exploring the options of wind power, water power, and of course, solar energy. One of the popular approaches to harnessing the sun's energy is through the use of solar panels.\n\nIn an article discussing new science discoveries, WebEcoist.com presents the two main downsides of solar panels, as well as some new, innovative solutions:\n\nSolar panels are typically inflexible and brittle, limiting the versatility of their application. But what if you could just spray solar cells onto any surface and collect energy from the sun? The technology is currently being produced at the University of Texas, where researchers are using nanoparticle \"inks\" full of tiny photovoltaics made from copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS). These particles are 10,000 times thinner than a strand of human hair. Currently, the photovoltaic ink only converts 1% of the sunlight that reaches it into electricity, but the researchers expect to increase the production and have the technology on the market within three to five years.\n\nFor homeowners that can afford them, the biggest reason not to install rooftop solar panels is often aesthetics: they're just plain ugly. But, unobtrusive solar panels that blend in nearly effortlessly with the architecture of a home are now within reach. Dow Solar recently announced a new generation of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) roof shingles, and SRS Energy has created powerful solar panels that look just like standard clay roof tiles."}

The photographs are very probably the best ever taken of the moon's green flash.\n\nMany a beach vacation cocktail hour is spent gazing at the sunset in hopes of catching the elusive green flash that occurs just before the last bit of sun disappears below the horizon. Now, a photographer at the European Southern Observatory has caught the green flash from the moon.\n\nThe series of images was made by Gerhard H\u00fcdepohl, a photo ambassador at the observatory in Chile's Atacama Desert. An image advisory describes them \"as very probably the best ever taken of the moon's green flash.\"\n\nThe effect is due to how the Earth's atmosphere bends, or refracts, light, an effect that is greater in the lower, denser layers of the atmosphere.\n\nESO explains:\n\n\"Shorter wavelengths of light are bent more than longer wavelengths, so that the green light from the Sun or moon appears to be coming from a slightly higher position than the orange and red light, from the point of view of an observer. When the conditions are just right, with an additional mirage effect due to the temperature gradient in the atmosphere, the elusive green flash is briefly visible at the upper edge of the solar or lunar disc when it is close to the horizon.\"\n\nFor more details on the physics and history of the green flash, check out this explanation on the Hyperphysics website and then schedule a beach vacation, relax and look for it yourselfReconstruction of a red apple with a green leaf in three dimensions using surface plasmon holograms\n\nBy John Roach, Contributing Writer, NBC News\n\nA new technique to produce full-color holograms that stay the same when viewed from any angle could usher in a day when we plop down on the couch and watch 3-D TV without optical illusions.\n\nCurrent methods for creating 3-D images are based on producing a separate image for the left and right eyes. \"Inside the brain we reconstruct the 3-D, so it is sort of an illusion,\" optical physicist Satoshi Kawata of Osaka University of Japan explains in a video made available to reporters.\n\nHe and colleagues instead made 3-D color holograms that can be viewed with the naked eye and don't change color no matter what angle they are viewed from. They did this by harnessing so-called surface plasmons, which Kawata describes as \"the collective electron oscillations traveling on a very thin metal film.\"\n\nThe researchers coat the metal film onto a light sensitive material called photoresist that contains a hologram made with red, green, and blue lasers. The photoresist hologram rests on a thin glass plate. A corrugated layer of silver is laid on top of the photoresist to help guide the holograph's light waves.\n\nThe surface plasmons in the metal film are excited using white light. The angle of the incoming light determines which plasmons are excited and diffracted by the hologram, reconstructing the light waves reaching the viewers eyes so that the 3-D image appears.\n\n\"No one has thought to use plasmons for display applications, so it was fun for me,\" Kawata told Wired Science. \"I just wanted to demonstrate that this could be done. But I hope people would be interested in thinking seriously to use this technology for larger-scale 3-D display.\"\n\nBefore it goes big time, however, the technology needs to be scaled up \u2014 the current images are a few centimeters across. In addition, the images are static, not moving picture such as film or TV.\n\nA paper describing the research appears in the April 8 issue of Science collection of images of Ireland positioned in the shape of a clover include visible (left), infrared (center) and microwave (right). They were captured from the AIRS instrument onboard NASA's Aqua satellite on March 3, and revealed a land surface temperature near 50 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nIn a St. Patrick's Day special, NASA has released a three leaf clover view of Ireland taken by an instrument on its Aqua satellite that sees in near-infrared\/visible, infrared, and microwave light.\n\nThe Atmospheric Infrared Sounder measures the temperatures of land, sea, and air to provide a better understanding of what is happening in those environments, the space agency says.\n\nOn March 3, when this trio of images was made, temperatures near the surface of the Emerald Isle were \"near normal\" for this time of year. In March, the Ireland's average daytime high is 49 degrees F and nighttime lows are 38 degrees F.\n\nNASA's Aqua satellite circles Earth pole-to-pole 15 times a day in a sun-synchronous orbit to provide data and images to researchers in the Earth, ocean, and atmospheric sciences.\n\nCloud top temperatures, for example, provide clues to scientists about the power of the thunderstorms. The colder the clouds are, the higher they are, and the more powerful the thunderstorms, NASA says. When AIRS measures cloud temperatures as cold as or colder than minus 63 degrees F, that indicates high cloud tops, strong convection and the likelihood of powerful thunderstorms.\n\nFor more information on what the three-leaf clover image of Ireland reveals, check out this press release from NASA.The distant galaxy NGC 157 boasts a central sweep of stars resembling a giant \"S\", reminiscent of Superman's symbol.

And the shepherd moon Prometheus is barely visible as a bump in the rings, just to the right of Dione.\n\nIn the image above, Rhea takes center stage, though Saturn's rings and three other moons make a cameo appearance. Below Rhea, just above the rings, is Dione. The moon Tethys is the larger circle in the lower right, while Epimetheus is the smaller dot to the right of Rhea and Dione. If you look closely, Prometheus is barely distinguishable as a speck embedded in the rings to the right of Dione.\n\nOther images from the flyby show Rhea's cratered and fractured surface up close, which will allow scientists studying the images to understand just how often meteoroids bombard Rhea:\n\nThe Cassini orbiter's wide-angle camera took this image of Rhea as it flew past at a distance of about 120 miles (200 kilometers) from the Saturnian moon's surface.\n\nIn addition, NASA noted in an image advisory, scientists using fields and particles instruments are looking through their data to see if they gleaned any more information about Rhea's thin oxygen-and-carbon-dioxide atmosphere and the interaction between Rhea and the particles within Saturn's magnetosphere.\n\nThe scientific value of the data aside, the Planetary Society's Emily Lakdawalla, says the raw images left her \"drooling.\" For more views of the icy moon, check out her post here"}

{"text":"Creating Life Out of Plasma\n\nIt has long been assumed that life is only a function of combining chemical elements - but what if some of the characteristics of life can arise in other contexts? Researchers have found just that in plasma, suggesting two things. First, the complexity and organization required for life may appear more readily than assumed, and second that life may not have to be based solely on chemicals.\n\nMost biologists think living cells arose out of a complex and lengthy evolution of chemicals that took millions of years, beginning with simple molecules through amino acids, primitive proteins and finally forming an organized structure. But if Mircea Sanduloviciu and his colleagues at Cuza University in Romania are right, the theory may have to be completely revised. They say cell-like self-organization can occur in a few microseconds.\n\nBut perhaps the most intriguing implications of Sanduloviciu's work are for life on other planets. \"The cell-like spheres we describe could be at the origin of other forms of life we have not yet considered,\" he says. Which means our search for extraterrestrial life may need a drastic re-think. There could be life out there, but not as we know it.\n\nThis is one area where research on the origins of life really hasn't been conducted - and why would it? Who would think to look for this sort of thing in plasma? It just goes to show you how really basic research can provide the most amazing and unexpected information on topics you would never expect to hit upon."}
{"text":"Friday, October 2, 2009\n\nHenrietta Lacks\n\nOn October 4, 1951, an African-American woman named Henrietta Lacks died of cervical cancer.\n\nSamples of her cervical cancer cells were extracted by Dr. George Otto Gey. To his amazement and horror, Henrietta Lacks's cervical cells multiplied readily and rapidly, faster than anything ever seen. They quickly latched to the sides of test tubes and consumed the medium around them, growing thicker and thicker all the while. He wondered when the cells would stop growing.\n\nThey didn't.\n\nSoon Gey had to transfer the growing mass of cells to another test tube, and then a petri dish, and then more petri dishes. Henrietta's cells were, and still are, some of the strongest cells known to science, reproducing an entire generation every 24 hours. \"If allowed to grow uninhibited,\" researcher Howard Jones said in 1971, \"[Henrietta's cells] would have taken over the world by this time.\"\n\nScientists saw this horror-film aspect as a boon - since the cells kept replicating like mad, they now had an unlimited supply of a single isolated cell source, and could thus ramp up their efforts to cure mankind's ills using the cells as test cultures. And in 1952, they did just that. Henrietta's cells (now called \"HeLa\" cells) were directly responsible for Jonas Salk's Polio vaccine.\n\nBut then things got weirder.\n\nBy 1974 people were starting to realize that HeLa had infiltrated the world's stock of cell cultures and ruined everything it came in contact with. Millions of dollars of research were wasted and for many scientists, at least two decades of work were down the drain. According to Rebecca Skloot in Johns Hopkins Magazine:\n\nThe truth was, Henrietta's cells had traveled through the air, on hands, or the tips of pipettes, overpowering any cell cultures they encountered. And researchers had no idea. There was no way to know which cells were growing in the petri dish. And there was no universally accepted test for a cell culture's identity.\n\nWalter Nelson-Rees dedicated his life to trying to control the spread of HeLa, but towards the end of his life he admitted that effort was a failure, and that the HeLa cells are \"out there somewhere dancing\" and will live forever. The problem of HeLa cell contamination continues to grow today.\n\nStranger still, Nelson-Rees discovered that the HeLa cell line had several marker chromosomes not found in the normal complement of human chromosomes. Which begs the question, what IS this stuff, really?\n\nDue to their ability to replicate indefinitely, and their non-human number of chromosomes, Dr. Leigh Van Valen has proposed HeLa be classified as an entirely new species, Helacyton gartleri. This controversial idea has not currently been embraced by the scientific community"}
{"text":"[In] common table salt, or NaCl[,] one of the elements is a metal, and the other is a poisonous gas.\n\nKarl F. Kuhn, Basic Physics: A Self-Teaching Guide\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nThat is a simple example of why it's important to have at least a basic understanding of chemical compositions, if not simply the scientific literacy and common sense to research them when it matters \u2014\n\nFor example, prior to using the word \"chemicals\" as if they're all equally poisonous, and not the constituents of everything in our reality,\n\nAnd, prior to touting \"Natural\" and Organic products without understanding that a \"natural\" formula may be no better than an artificially-created one,\n\nAnd, prior to eschewing all types of a compound (for example, sulphates in hair products) without really grasping that [sulphate] compounds are different from one-another, and that if one type is hazardous to your health, it does not mean that all types are. [I actually don't know whether all sulphate-based additions are or not, but it's important to research.]\n\nOrganic compounds of unexpected complexity exist throughout the universe, Prof. Sun Kwok and Dr. Yong Zhang of the University of Hong Kong have discovered, suggesting that complex organic compounds can be synthesized in space even when no life forms are present.\n\nThe organic substance they found contains a mixture of aromatic (ring-like) and aliphatic (chain-like) components that are so complex, their chemical structures resemble those of coal and petroleum. Since coal and oil are remnants of ancient life, this type of organic matter was thought to arise only from living organisms.\n\nProfessor Lee Cronin, Gardiner Chair of Chemistry in the College of Science and Engineering, and his team have demonstrated a new way of making inorganic-chemical-cells or iCHELLS.\n\nProf Cronin said: \"All life on earth is based on organic biology (i.e. carbon in the form of amino acids, nucleotides, and sugars etc) but the inorganic world is considered to be inanimate.\n\n\"What we are trying do is create self-replicating, evolving inorganic cells that would essentially be alive. You could call it inorganic biology.\"\n\n\u2026\n\n\"Bacteria are essentially single-cell micro-organisms made from organic chemicals, so why can't we make micro-organisms from inorganic chemicals and allow them to evolve?\n\n\"If successful this would give us some incredible insights into evolution and show that it's not just a biological process. It would also mean that we would have proven that non carbon-based life could exist and totally redefine our ideas of design.\"\n\nThese home-made aliens might be able to provide us with tangible evidence that our idea of \"being\" should be reconstructed, from the paper-doll view we have of \"things\" as isolated forms, to a systemic fluidity.\n\nOr so it seems! So I am back from Cancun, but as I was packing up to leave last Saturday I was having a problem with my eyeliner. It would not sharpen and kept breaking. I got frustrated as anyone would at 3am and just grabbed an eyeliner I used to use. I knew it was only about 4 months old and\u2026\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nI also use organic products, especially liner, but it's probably more from caution\/belief than evidence\u2026 whatever one experiences from a subjective point of view, even\/especially in a case of \"self-study\" like this one, might not be entirely reliable. If you pursue this question, it would be great to see some exploration done in a scientific, methodical way. Is it correlation or causation? Is it to do with organic ingredients, or simply a \"natural\" chemistry (fruit, etc. as opposed to man-made). Is it perhaps an allergic reaction particular to you? How would test groups respond?\n\nIf anyone knows of controlled studies about this, it would also be helpful.\n\nFor a time it was believed that the substances which are associated with living things were so marvelous that they could not be made by hand, from inorganic materials. This is not at all true \u2014 they are just the same as the substances made in inorganic chemistry, but more complicated arrangements of atoms are involved.\n\nRichard Feynman, Six Easy Pieces, Ch. 3: The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, 49\n\nA new study from Cornell University graduate student Jenny Wan-chen Lee [pdf] either shows that the label \"organic\" creates some sort of placebo effect in which people are convinced they're eating healthier, or that people can be really stupid. Maybe it's a little of both? In her study, 144 volunteers were asked to compare \"organic\" and \"regular\" samples of yogurt, cookies and potato chips, rating them on taste, estimated fat content and estimated calorie content. However, all of the samples were in fact \"organic.\" Take a wild guess what happened.\n\nVolunteers almost unanimously preferred the taste of the perceived \"organic\" samples, which they believed to be more nutritious and worth more money. And these perceptions were consistent across all the samples.\n\nSo far, every re-post of this has been comment-less, or along the lines of \"ORGANIC IS DUMB\", or has only addressed this particular aspect of organic foods (unhealthy foods with a green label) while making the argument that it applies to all organic foods. So much fallacy up in here.\n\nYes, maybe they could have used a more fitting word to begin with. But \"organic\", in this context, does mean \"healthy-naturally-grown-without-pesticides-or-chemical-stimulants foods\", so the biochemistry textbook definition is irrelevant.\n\nOnly nicolenaddy has mentioned health as it applies to the wider subject:\n\n\"\u2026Eating fresh and local food is good. \u2026 But the top consumer nation in the world allowing their food industry to serve them food covered in poison, the WORST. Until the 20th century food was all grown organically. Big business and capitalism changed the industry. \u2026\"\n\nThe point of eating organic or using organic body-related products is not about feeling virtuous, not about taste (though I have to say, there are some foods that taste like shit when conventional, like strawberries and apples) and not as much about the environment as it is about an individual's health. At least, that's the hope.\n\nSo no, \"organic\" mac & cheese, sodas, chips, whatever\u2026 are not any better for you than regular. But let's not stretch the \"organic labels suck & people are stupid, lololol\" argument beyond the organic-coke context (which is what's happening).\n\nI would rather not have my produce covered in pesticides (you can't just \"wash it off\" \u2014 produce has pores, that shit sinks in) and even though the neighboring farmer's sprays might land on the organic crops, at least it's a little bit less than direct sprays.\n\nLikewise, there's some commentary on body products:\n\n\"They do this for shampoo. People pay out the ass for expensive, organic shampoo but its really just normal shampoo in a green bottle plus $10.\"\n\nThere's some truth to the above, but there is a difference between buying natural products for the body as opposed to regular brands. Human skin absorbs whatever goes on it quickly, even faster than through digestion. For that reason, it's a healthier option to choose brands that don't litter their products with chemicals known to be associated with various ailments. That doesn't mean to trust all green labels and spit out cash for organic \u2014 just know your ingredients:\n\nNow, all that being addressed, there is a lot of BS that goes on: non-organics being mislabeled, hopelessly high prices, crop maintenance issues, cognitive biases, misnomers, & the fact that the American FDA approves just about anything.\n\nIt's difficult, but awareness is necessary. It may not be the case now, but it would be great if everyone had the ability to choose inputs which are more agreeable with human body-systems. It's something to work towards.\n\nNow if anyone (especially the resident MDs) cares to offer counterpoints, please do.\n\nfreshphotons: The transparent shells of tiny Cypridina hilgendorfii, found in the coastal waters and sands of Japan, hold a creature that emits a luminous blue substance when disturbed.

To get a handle on what makes the organisms thrive, Duke University researchers trekked far and wide to collect a few centimeters of dirt from 98 locations across North and South America, then analyzed each sample for genetic variation. To their surprise, the strongest predictor of high diversity was neutral pH. The acidic soil of the Peruvian Amazon, for example, harbored one half to one third as many species as did the neutral dirt of the arid American Southwest. \"There are a lot of variables that didn't turn out to be very important,\" says co-author Robert Jackson, who adds that a more exhaustive search of different habitats might turn up other stimulators of diversity, such as carbon abundance.

He started out thinking, as most physicists do, that time is subjective and illusory. According to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, time is just another dimension in space, traversable in either direction, and our human perception of moments passing steadily and sequentially is all in our heads.\n\nOver time, though, Smolin became convinced not only that time was real, but that this notion could be the key to understanding the laws of nature.\n\n\"If laws are outside of time, then they're inexplicable,\" he said. \"If law just simply is, there's no explanation.

They say the ability to fully dispose of waste will discourage recycling and the development of renewable products, and the gasification will still result in toxic substances like dioxins.

CO2 emissions from energy consumption for the January-March period fell to 1.34 billion metric tons, down 8 percent from a year ago. While the depressed economy and rising renewable energy generation have contributed to emissions reductions in the past few years, the early 2012 low-point is due mainly to a combination of three factors: the relatively warm winter, reduced gasoline demand, and the continued decline in coal-fired electricity.

Bear activity in Aspen, Colo., alone was up 668 percent in August compared to last year, according to the Aspen Times. The animals are so hungry that they are overcoming their natural fear of humans. \"My God, they're everywhere,\" San Miguel County, Colo., Sheriff Bill Masters told the New York Times. \"A lot of them just don't seem to care anymore. They're just wandering around.\"\n\nBears have been the most aggressive food-seekers, even sneaking into people's homes and businesses, but elk and mule deer are also dining whole-heartedly on farmers' corn and alfalfa fields, which are already suffering from the drought. The situation is creating risks for humans, but it is also an indication of how bad things are for wildlife this year. \"It's kind of an emergency,\" Utah state wildlife biologist Lowell Marthe told the New York Times. \"If there's not enough food on those winter ranges, we're looking at potential for heavy die-offs in our deer.\" Read more here.\n\nWhy Doesn't Your City Have Curbside Composting?\n\nNearly 100 cities now have curbside composting. While short of the full-service composting in places like San Francisco, 24 states have also passed laws banning yard waste from landfills. Keeping food scraps, leaves, tree limbs, and grass clippings out of the municipal waste facilities preserves limited space, and it saves money. Why don't more cities and states make it easier for us to compost? The answer: Big Trash.

Framing this situation as a matter of consumer sovereignty\u2013where the customer is always right\u2013is misleading. Consumption patterns are powerfully shaped by forces other than preformed individual preferences\u2013forces such as advertising, cultural norms, social pressures, and psychological associations.\n\nConsumerism is not, and should not be confused with, consumption that satisfies essential human needs. Consumerism is the faith that meaning, identity, and significance can be found in material, commodity consumption, which in turn requires money. But since meaning and self-realization cannot be found there, nor basic psychological needs so met, consumers remain unfilled and are driven ever on to seek more possessions, which requires still more money, all of which is well understood by marketers.

According to a new UCLA\/University Paris (France) study, companies need not fear being hampered down by adopting green practices and standards. Workers in companies that do so are found to be 16 percent more productive than the average. The increased worker motivation stems from their appreciation for their workplace. This conclusion was obtains through a series of employee surveys at various companies. They found that green companies also had more advanced employee training than other companies, as well as greater interaction between coworkers.

Food is becoming a looming social issue, thanks to increasing food prices worldwide. More and more people are living in a state of food insecurity, and climate change is putting additional pressures on the food system. It's part of the cultural, and pop cultural, zeitgeist, and it's only going to get bigger from here. Awareness of food politics equates not just to a greater understanding of and connection to the food system, but having the tools to work on fixing the system.\n\nFarmers point out that when food is grown on responsibly-managed soil, the soil should contain more nutrients for plants to uptake, which equates to more nutritional value in the resulting crop. The organic label is rather freewheeling when it comes to soil management, and that means that some organic produce may be produced on soil in conditions similar to that used for conventional agriculture, ergo one would expect it to be comparable nutritionally. What would be more interesting to see is a comparison study looking at conventional, industrial organic, and small-scale permaculture farming methods. Read more here.\n\nA simple, useful guide to communicating climate change\n\nThere seems to be a subtle shift underway in the cultural valence of climate change. If the pendulum swung toward hyper-polarization and looney-tunery in 2009-2011, it seems to have reached its apogee and begun swinging back. It's not just that a few politicians, including Obama, are daring to say the word, but that the public seems to have grown impatient with the squabbling and delay. A recent survey from Yale [PDF] found that \"a large majority of registered voters (88%) support action to reduce global warming, even if it has economic costs.\" Big Democratic donors are pressuring Obama to do more. There are even Republicans sticking up their heads here and there.\n\nWhatever the reason, I've started hearing more buzz about politicians, local leaders, and businesspeople who want to speak out on climate. But if climate is going to re-enter the public conversation, it needs to be done in a smart way. And let's face it, most politicians and local leaders don't have a lot of great climate rhetoric at their fingertips. They could use help.

The restrictions, which are based on the presumed presence of winter flounder and other marine life that could be harmed by dredging, left towns and the county-run dredge program struggling to squeeze projects into tight schedules further narrowed by weather and other considerations. Under the regulations, dredging was strictly prohibited in many locations for almost half of the year. Now, based on recommendations released by the state and the dredge working group, town officials know how to seek waivers from the restrictions.\n\nBesides making harbors and salt ponds accessible to boat traffic, dredging can improve the flushing of excess nutrients from local bays and harbors. And dredged material can be used to nourish local beaches.

A deep freeze in April killed buds that had formed on fruit trees during a rare summer-like stretch in March.\n\nGrowers reported huge losses from parts of New York to Minnesota. Michigan was hit especially hard, losing up to 90 percent of its crop, according to the AP. John Howcroft, of Perry Hill Orchards in Acushnet, seemed to be in agreement with these reports. He said the blossoms of some of his fruit came two weeks earlier than usual. As a result, some of his variety of apples bloomed in late August, rather than mid-September.

In the first lawsuit, the environmental groups challenged the EPA's approval of 13 limits, or \"total maximum daily loads,\" that determine how much nitrogen may enter water bodies on the Cape and Nantucket. They argued in the second lawsuit, which they amended Monday, that the agency failed to require an annual update of a regional plan to manage the Cape's wastewater that was first written more than 30 years ago.\n\nIn its motion to dismiss the second suit, the EPA argued that it is an attempt to rewrite parts of the Clean Water Act to create additional powers and responsibilities for the agency. The EPA is not mandated to provide annual approvals of the wastewater management plan, according to the motion. The EPA argued the environmental groups' grievance should be with the state or the Cape Cod Commission. The lawsuits have become a focal point in the ongoing debate over what to do about damaging levels of nutrients traveling into bays and ponds from septic systems and other sources. Excess nitrogen or phosphorous can cause algae blooms, fish kills and degrade water quality.

Barcodes originally were scanned by special optical scanners called barcode readers; later, scanners and interpretive software became available on devices including desktop printers and smartphones.\n\nThe first use of barcodes was to label railroad cars, but they were not commercially successful until they were used to automate supermarket checkout systems, a task for which they have become almost universal.

{"text":"NASA found an Alien living on \u2026Earth! The much awaited NASA press conference is over and the much excited news it out. NASA astrobiologists proudly announced that researchers have discovered microbes that are able to live on arsenic as a replacement of phosphorus. Phosphorus is the element considered to be the essential backbone for all life on earth.\n\nArsenic Fans\n\nThe microbes were scraped from the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park (California, USA) and then were moved inside a laboratory with all the lake mud. Scientists were astonished to find out that the microbes were using the poisonous arsenic as a replacement of phosphorus.\n\nArsenic is poisonous to nearly all forms of life on earth. Even small amounts of the poison become embedded in living tissue, causing liver failure and ultimately death \u2014 in nearly everything but these bacteria. This fact make the discovery so unique and important, even if thousands of people were disappointed by the conference.\n\nLiving on an arsenic-diet makes this microbe so special, so extra terrestrial and gives the \"life as we know it\" a different meaning.

Longrich\n\nRelated Stories\n\nTerminator lenses The latest steps in the development of a computerised contact lens that could be used for navigation, health monitoring or even to sneak access to information, has been unveiled by US researchers.\n\nParviz along with an international team of engineers has constructed a contact lens embedded with a tiny LED that can light up when a wireless signal is sent to it.\n\nHe collaborated on the device with UW ophthalmologist Tueng Shen and researchers from Aalto University in Finland led by optoelectronics professor Dr Markku Sopanen.\n\nParviz's group specialises in incorporating miniaturised devices into unconventional materials and has been working on functional contact lenses for a while, he says.\n\n\"If we can make very small devices of various sorts, if we have the ability to put them into different materials, what can I do with this contact lens that I stare at every morning?\"\n\nThe engineers took an extremely small custom-designed LED made with sapphire and embedded it in the centre of a plastic contact lens.\n\nThey also embedded a circular antenna around the inside lip of the lens. A miniature integrated circuit connects the antenna and the blue LED. Using remote radio frequency transmission, the group was able to control a single pixel.\n\nWith this setup, a human eye still wouldn't be able to distinguish that pixel due to the minimum focal distance required to see anything\n\nRegular readers know I am no fan of Republican Presidential candidate Rick Perry. The reasons for this are legion, including his stance on evolution and global warming.\n\nNow there's evidence it's even worse than I thought: The Guardian is reporting that Governor Rick Perry's administration in Texas is actively suppressing science. A report about the environmental impact of global warming on Texas was apparently edited by officials, \"\u2026 deleting references to climate change, sea-level rise and wetlands destruction.\"\n\nThis action smacks of scientific suppression and censorship. And before you accuse me of overreacting, the scientists involved in writing the report felt this editing was so bad that the original authors of the report asked for their names to be removed from the final version. Yegads.\n\nLooking it all over, the charges that science is being suppressed hold up pretty well. John Anderson is a researcher at Rice University, and author of a chapter of the report heavily redacted by the agency in question, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). His opinion is clear:\n\nThat state of denial percolated down to the leadership of the [TCEQ]. The agency chief, who was appointed by Perry, is known to doubt the science of climate change. \"The current chair of the commission, Bryan Shaw, commonly talks about how human-induced climate change is a hoax,\" said Anderson.\n\nTerrific. I'm not terribly surprised by this; after all, Perry nominated creationists to head up the Texas State Board of Education not just once, but three times. Putting a climate change denier in charge of an environmental commission is par for his course.\n\nWhen Bush was President, science suppression was rampant when it disagreed with political ideology (which was very, very common). If Perry is elected, we can expect more of the same. I'm very glad to see Perry sinking in the polls right now, but as far as science goes, the other options aren't much better.\n\nAs I've said before, if you're a Republican and you support science, you need to make your voice heard. It's now long-since become de rigeur for GOP candidates to deny all manners of science if they want to get elected. It may not be too late. Speak up\u2026 or forever be denied your peace.\n\nMore Coulter Stupidity on Evolution\n\nby Ed Brayton\n\nNot content to show her complete ignorance of evolutionary biology once, Ann Coulter doubles down with yet another screed that would get her flunked by a competent high school science teacher. She begins with this unintentionally amusing statement:\n\nMore people know the precepts of kabala than know the basic elements of Darwinism.\n\nAnd then she proves it by displaying her own ignorance of the subject.\n\nDarwin's theory was that a process of random mutation, sex and death, allowing the \"fittest\" to survive and reproduce, and the less fit to die without reproducing, would, over the course of billions of years, produce millions of species out of inert, primordial goo.The vast majority of mutations are deleterious to the organism, so if the mutations were really random, then for every mutation that was desirable, there ought to be a staggering number that are undesirable.\n\nActually, most mutations are neutral. Coulter, and all of us, have hundreds of mutations in our DNA at the very least, and the overwhelming majority of the time they affect us hardly at all. In some cases, they cause serious disease. And in other cases they can aid in survival. This is not even remotely controversial. We see it happen in both the lab and the wild literally every day.\n\nIf we sequence a genome and compare it to earlier versions of the same genome, we can identify the specific mutations. Richard Lenski has done exactly that with a population of bacteria, which are particularly useful for such experiments because they reproduce so quickly. Not only can we see the specific mutations and their effects, we can watch a particular trait evolve over time as new mutations pile up on top of the old ones and create new pathways and new molecular structures.\n\nWe also ought to find a colossal number of transitional organisms in the fossil record \u2013 for example, a squirrel on its way to becoming a bat, or a bear becoming a whale. (Those are actual Darwinian claims.)But that's not what the fossil record shows. We don't have fossils for any intermediate creatures in the process of evolving into something better. This is why the late Stephen Jay Gould of Harvard referred to the absence of transitional fossils as the \"trade secret\" of paleontology. (Lots of real scientific theories have \"secrets.\")\n\nAh, another dishonest quote mine. This one irritated Gould himself, who addressed the question head on when he wrote:\n\nSince we proposed punctuated equilibria to explain trends, it is infuriating to be quoted again and again by creationists \u2014 whether though design or stupidity, I do not know \u2014 as admitting that the fossil record includes no transitional forms. Transitional forms are generally lacking at the species level, but they are abundant between larger groups. The punctuations occur at the level of species; directional trends (on the staircase model) are rife at the higher level of transitions within major groups.\n\nAnd indeed they are. In fact, Gould himself wrote a good deal about one of the transitions that Coulter questions, the evolution of whales from land mammals (not from bears but from Artiodactyls). Paleontologists have now found numerous transitional forms from land mammals to modern whales and they form a fairly complete series. Gould wrote in 1994:\n\n\"If you had given me a blank piece of paper and a blank check, I could not have drawn you a theoretical intermediate any better or more convincing than Ambulocetus. Those dogmatists who by verbal trickery can make white black, and black white, will never be convinced of anything, but Ambulocetus is the very animal that they proclaimed impossible in theory.\"\n\nCoulter continues:\n\nIf you get your news from the American news media, it will come as a surprise to learn that when Darwin first published \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859, his most virulent opponents were not fundamentalist Christians, but paleontologists.\n\nAnother lie. It's certainly true that there were scientific critics of Darwin's theory, but the primary opposition came from the church. Thus, the famous debate between Huxley and Bishop Wilberforce. What Coulter conveniently leaves out is that Darwin's theory gained very rapid acceptance among scientists quite quickly because it explained such a wide range of data extremely well. And that continues to this day. Coulter doesn't know any of this because she is as ignorant of the scientific literature on evolution as I am of auto mechanics. Unlike her, however, I don't go around declaring that all auto mechanics don't know a thing about how to fix a car or that the internal combustion engine couldn't possibly work.\n\nBut things have only gotten worse for Darwin.Thirty years ago (before it was illegal to question Darwinism), Dr. David Raup, a geologist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, said that despite the vast expansion of the fossil record: \"The situation hasn't changed much.\"\n\nTo the contrary, fossil discoveries since Darwin's time have forced paleontologists to take back evidence of evolution. \"Some of the classic cases of Darwinian change in the fossil record,\" Raup said, \"such as the evolution of the horse in North America, have had to be discarded or modified as a result of more detailed information.\"\n\nAnother dishonest quote mine. What a shock that new evidence would alter explanations. This is, of course, one of the great strengths of science \u2014 and one of the great weaknesses of religion. More detailed information should modify our explanations, and in science they do.\n\nThe rest is more of the same, rote regurgitation of long-discredited creationist arguments. Ironically, the very man she quoted in her last ignorant diatribe on the subject, Michael Behe, accepts common descent and agrees that the fossil record clearly supports it. He just gives God a divine assist at the molecular level."}

Because bacteria have that cute little habit of reproducing all the freaking time the information is never lost. Furthermore, seeing as people cannot exactly hack into a microorganism the way they do your home computer whatever private information your storing is safe. - might look like this?\n\nSo that \"personal\" video you made that you never want anyone but yourself to see will have an E.Coli bodyguard to give food poisoning to anyone trying to steal it.

{"text":"Searching for life\nThe article on the search for life elsewhere in the solar system (\"C'est la\nVie,\" SN: 11\/1\/97, p. 284) cites three essentials for life's advent: organic\ncompounds, liquid water, and a source of energy. It fails to mention other elements, such\nas phosphorus.\n\nPhosphate, which is made up of oxygen and phosphorus, is\nneeded for making adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a molecule that conveys the chemical\nenergy whose flow keeps us (and all other organisms) alive.\n\nNo substitute for ATP is known to exist or thought to be\npossible. Thus, it seems surprising that the search for signs of extraterrestrial life\napparently has not yet looked for telltale traces of phosphorus in planetary rocks or\nmeteorites.\n\nAccording to David J. Des Marais of NASA, the essentials\nfor life are basically liquid water, energy, and nutrients. \"Nutrients\" means\nall of the elements, phosphorus included, needed to construct cellular life. That's a bit\ndifferent from what one looks for in extraterrestrial samples as evidence of life. That\nsearch includes morphological evidence (individual fossil cells or features built by\nmicrobial communities), chemical evidence (certain classes of organic compounds being the\nmost diagnostic), mineralogical evidence (including apatite, a phosphorus mineral), and\nstable isotopic evidence. The mere presence of phosphorus is not evidence of life. -- R.\nCowen\n\nAncient toupee?\nBefore applying a skin graft, surgeons often pass it through a device that scores the\ngraft in a regular pattern, creating a mesh.

The new data leads to the conclusion that the oldest stars are actually 11 to 13 billion years old, rather than 16 to 18 billion years old, as had been thought.\n\nPASADENA, California \u2014 The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) will play three key roles in the National Partnership for Advanced Computational Infrastructure (NPACI) in the areas of management, resource deployment, and technology and application initiatives.

{"text":"1. \"Beam Me Up, Scotty\"\nTeleportation is such an old desire of mankind that we can find mentions of it as far back as the New Testament. Luckily, with the help of science, we should soon be able to enjoy God's favorite mode of transportation as well, or at least your atoms will.\n\nDuring 2009 scientists from the University of Maryland's Joint Quantum Institute successfully copied an atom to a remote location almost a meter away. Although this may not sound terribly impressive it's a major breakthrough in quantum physics and will soon allow for the teleportation of complex molecules and viruses. Just imagine how great the future will be when teleporting a common cold right inside someone's lungs will be a common practical joke.\n\nHowever, the most important implication of this experiment is not teleporting molecules of beer inside your mouth. By replacing physical wires with teleporting atoms, scientists hope to create a computer so powerful that it will break all secret codes ever created, while still running the latest GTA game. Better known as quantum computing, this new way of transmitting data via teleportation is expected to revolutionize everything we ever knew about computers. It will also make your custom-made $5,000 gaming PC obsolete.\n2. Electric Microbes\nTeleporting supercomputers sounds awesome, but the biggest problem will be generating enough cheap electricity to keep them running. Then again, scientists might have just found the solution to the whole energy crisis by turning to microbes for inspiration. It seems science is really fond of microscopic organisms that could kill us.\n\nUsing bacteria, researchers at the University of Massachusetts created a microcell that can generate electricity by decomposing organic matter. In the first stage, the artificial bacteria will be used to generate electricity in difficult environments such as the bottom of the ocean. We're not sure who exactly needs electricity underwater, but we hope the next step is developing microcells to be used in cars and other electric devices.\n\nThis discovery could very well mean that in the near future we'll be farming our electricity from tanks of sludge. While it sounds highly unappetizing, this practice will be dirt cheap, renewable and won't damage the environment. As long as the bacteria don't mutate and start decomposing our tissue, this whole deal sounds incredibly awesome.\n\n3. Telepathy\nSo far we have supercomputers and electricity farms, but why not control these technologies without lifting a finger? Soon enough you'll be able to lounge on the couch and let your brain do the heavy lifting thanks to the latest discoveries in brain reading and thought transmission.\n\nAt the University of Utah, scientists implanted a series of microelectrodes right under the skull, thus allowing paralyzed people to control computers and prosthetic limbs. If this sounds familiar you're probably remembering \"Robocop,\" where electrodes implanted under the skull transform people into cyborgs. While we don't want to sound unreasonable, we can only conclude that Utah will soon build an unstoppable cyborg army and conquer the rest of the U.S.\n\nIn order to prepare for the imminent civil war, the University of Wisconsin developed an external telepathy cap. This device literally reads your mind, allowing users to communicate simply by thinking of a letter. Of course, the first usage of the brilliant invention was to send a tweet. One can only hope that once scientists take the invention away from text-addicted teenagers it'll be used to kick-start an unprecedented age of communication. Then again, it will probably just be used to connect your brain to Foursquare so everyone can know exactly how you feel about the new Starbucks latte. 4. Nanorobotic Slaves\nWhile waiting to telepathically connect with robots, why not become the host for some tiny machines that will cure you of all disease, improve your organs and make you lose weight? Nanorobotics has been an established field for quite some time, with many innovations that sound more like magic than reality. The main problem with the technology was mass-producing the microscopic innovations. We said \"was\" because now we have the solution: a nanorobot assembly line.\n\nIt's like an old-school factory, except every worker is created entirely out of DNA and works based on chemical orders to assemble compounds that we can barely see. Right now the robots can assemble gold particles into eight different products, but soon the process will be used to produce more complex results, including other nanorobots.\n\nJust like the first Ford factory, this invention will usher an industrial revolution, allowing us to produce new technology on a scale previously unimaginable. However, this time around we won't need child labor and horribly unsafe work conditions. It's really a win-win scenario.\n\n5. Power Plants Inside Your Body\nUnfortunately, before we can pump our body full of tiny robots we need to find a way to power them. The solution comes from France where scientists have recently created a glucose biofuel cell.\n\nBy decomposing chemicals inside your body these tiny power plants will create electricity for any type of implants imaginable. The cells were already successfully tested on mice and they were powerful enough to power a pacemaker, thus finally solving France's problem of heart attacks in mice.\n\nThe next step on the agenda is implementing the cell in human bodies where it could power artificial organs or nanorobots cruising through our bloodstream. While there aren't high hopes that you'll be able to recharge your phone by touching it, the technology will make cyborgs even more feasible. We understand that Utah is highly interested.\n\n6. Robotic Swarms While we fully agree that robots are awesome, we do worry about the day when they will finally become sentient and organize in packs so they can hunt us. In order to avoid such a horrible disaster, scientists are keeping one step ahead of the robot revolution -- by making sure to create intelligent robot swarms themselves.\n\nFesto, a company that specializes in creating smart robots, recently unveiled AquaJelly, a swam of robots inspired by jellyfish. These intelligent machines can swim together and coordinate their movements through radio and LED signals. Since making underwater robots that can communicate with creepy, glowing lasers is not scary enough, the same company created an airborne robot.\n\nSignificantly larger, AirJelly uses helium in order to gently swim through the air and silently sneak up on you. Now all we need is for the two swarms to collaborate and we're completely screwed.\n\n7. Planet of the Dogs\nSince we're on the topic of communication, how often have you looked at your dog at 4:23 a.m. wondering why that was the perfect time for barking? Science is here to help you answer exactly that question, with the aid of the latest dog-emotion reader.\n\nWhile not the first of its kind this new Japanese pet translator is spectacular in the way it analyzes the acoustic details of barks in order to deliver accurate interpretations. Not only will you be able to know when your dog is sad, happy or excited to see a squirrel, but the device will ask you to play with the dog and feed it. It sounds like pets have finally found an easy way to train their masters.\n\nAccording to psychologist Vanessa Woods, this is just one in a series of developments that allow dogs to communicate more easily with humans than any other animal. She predicts that if this trend continues, dogs will eventually evolve to a stage where direct communication with humans will become possible. Sadly, this kind of evolution takes centuries, so we probably won't be around to witness the first talking dog. 8. Meat Farms\nThe future looks like a great place to be a farmer, as long as you're willing to farm electricity or meat. Currently being developed by Dutch researchers, pork and beef muscle grown entirely inside a laboratory sounds like a very possible development.\n\nWhile growing your own sausage from pig stem cells might sound like the plot of a crappy horror movie, it's actually not all that bad. Considering the amount of energy, water and food necessary to raise animals, as well as all the pollution they cause, growing meat in a lab makes economic sense. Of course, many people will probably scream that artificial meat means we're messing with nature, but we've been doing that for years, ever since we introduced growth hormones in our cows. Besides, the artificial meat might finally get PETA to stop protesting for a few minutes.\n\nHowever, don't get your hopes too high. Right now the meat farm is nothing more than a university lab with some tiny muscle tissue developing in a highly controlled environment. Researchers have mostly focused on generating fat and bone, although they hope to be just as successful with edible muscle. In the meantime we can all enjoy some artificial pig fat.\n\n9. Force Fields\nWhile we're still a ways away from crying \"Force fields up!\" as an alien ships attacks the Enterprise, the laser developed by Boeing is a pretty close approximation. The ominously named MATRIX is a highly concentrated laser beam that can automatically detect and shoot down anything that flies in its range, be it a plane or a rocket.\n\nCreated at the request of the U.S. Air Force, this laser is just one of a series of new weapons being developed by Boeing. The company also created a laser that can be mounted on an airplane and a laser\/machine-gun combo, for those times when a death ray just isn't enough to kill anything what's bothering you.\n\nWhat is truly remarkable about the laser is that it's light enough to be carried by a few soldiers and will probably become even smaller over the next few years. Also, the whole machine is silent and invisible, so while it's not a traditional \"force field,\" it will stop anything that flies toward you in exactly the same way. We look forward to Boeing creating a personal version which we could install in our cubicle so no one can ever annoy us again.\n\n10. Adamantium\nIn case you have no clue what adamantium is you need to read up on the Marvel universe. This is the Holy Grail of all metal, a light alloy that can withstand impossible pressure and will always stay sharp. It's the stuff that Wolverine's claws are made of, and until recently it was considered impossible to make in real life.\n\nModumetal, a U.S.-based company, used nanolaminating, an electro-chemical process that re-arranges atoms, in order to create a compound they named, very originally, modumetal. Besides having the least innovative name for a product, modumetal is predicted to revolutionize the way we use metals. Since nanolaminating changes the exterior structure of metals it will make them stronger, corrosion-free and practically indestructible.\n\nThe company has already won numerous awards for bringing wolverine claws a little closer, and modumetal will soon be used in armor of all sorts as well as replacing bridges and other public metal structures. Considering this material will probably reduce government costs for repairing infrastructure by a couple of million dollars, we're sold.\n\nTuesday 15 June\n\nWe are living in the time in which all technologies known and unknown are uttered, spun, and utilized. This is creation. The Allidile Report message, a physics paper written over the past 10 years, goes to great lengths to expose the truth about nano technology and our involvment with it. This physics report tells all, names \/names, and reveals what the end looks like, and it looks just like this. Look around you, observe these telling events and their connection to our light \/ carbon atom chain reaction universal spin. It is time to wake up, to wake up, to wake up!"}

Dubbed LUCA, the massive organism was actually a network of cells. But they worked as one to survive on this turbulent planet, the New Scientist reports.\n\nUnable to make the exact proteins they needed, these cells swapped them instead\u2014effectively creating a massive gene pool that survived together. Around the time oxygen appeared in the atmosphere\u20142.9 billion years ago, if you're counting\u2014they split into single-celled bacteria, archaea, and complex cells called eukaryotes that eventually led to plants and animals.

{"text":"Jun\n\n24\n\nA few developments in health this week, all pioneered by Canadians researchers and scientists:\n\n\"Heart disease now kills more women than men\"\n\nFor the first time, more Canadian women than men are dying of cardiovascular disease. While the difference is slim \u2013 50.5 per cent of heart attack, stroke and heart failure deaths are in women and 49.5 per cent are in men \u2013 it still represents a seismic shift, according to one of the country's leading researchers. \u2014 for more, read the public health reporter Andre Picard's column in the Globe and Mail today.\n\nThere are hiding places \u2014 HIV reservoirs \u2014 where small numbers of virus lay low, ready to launch an attack. Until now, scientists didn't know where these safe havens were located, but the possibilities included the brain or the kidneys. In a paper published in the journal Nature Medicine, the University of Montreal's Rafick-Pierre Sekaly and colleagues report that HIV finds refuge in a type of long-lived immune system cell. They are now looking at ways to destroy them without crippling the immune system. One day, the work could lead to a cure, said Sekaly, one of Canada's top AIDS researchers. \u2014 for more, read this Canadian Press article.\n\n\"Researchers work to erase women's hormone-replacement fear\"\n\nA research team led by Ottawa scientists is creating and testing synthetic hormones to take the fear out of hormone-replacement therapy for menopausal women. Wright and the research team, led by Tony Durst at the University of Ottawa, have just received a $267,000 research grant from the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation. It could lead to the creation of a blockbuster new drug. \u2014 for more, read this article printed in the Ottawa Citizen.\n\n\"Few extra pounds may protect Canadians from early death\"\n\nCanadians who are slightly overweight live longer than people of normal weight, according to a new study that confirms similar findings from the U.S. \"It may be that a few extra pounds actually protect older people as their health declines, but that doesn't mean that people in the normal weight range should try to put on a few pounds,\" Mark Kaplan, a co-author of the study and a professor of Community Health at Portland State University, said in a release Tuesday. \u2014 for more, read this CBC article\n\nMay\n\n04\n\nAfter being out of town unexpectedly for most of last week, I've just been catching up on all the news about the swine flu. The number of cases in Canada \u2014 and worldwide \u2014 seems to change hourly, but latest reports count off:\n\n1,025 flu infections in 20 countries\n\n25 confirmed deaths in Mexico\n\nmore than 100 cases in Canada\n\nNot yet a pandemic \u2014 defined by the World Health Organization as \"human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region, plus community-level outbreaks in at least one other country in a different WHO region\" \u2014 but pretty close. (At phase 5, a pandemic is considered imminent.)\n\nThe big news over the weekend was that more than 2,000 pigs at an Alberta farm had to be quarantined after the Canadian Food Inspection Agency confirmed that a farm-worker infected the animals with the flu.\n\nApr\n\n06\n\nThey say art mimics reality \u2014 or do I have that reversed? Either way, reading about a new development in brain research this morning in the New York Times, I had an odd moment of reality colliding with the surreal world of one of my favourite movies:\n\nSuppose scientists could erase certain memories by tinkering with a single substance in the brain. Could make you forget a chronic fear, a traumatic loss, even a bad habit.\n\nResearchers in Brooklyn have recently accomplished comparable feats, with a single dose of an experimental drug delivered to areas of the brain critical for holding specific types of memory, like emotional associations, spatial knowledge or motor skills.\n\nThe drug blocks the activity of a substance that the brain apparently needs to retain much of its learned information. And if enhanced, the substance could help ward off dementias and other memory problems.\n\nSo far, the research has been done only on animals. But scientists say this memory system is likely to work almost identically in people.\n\nIt's almost as if the researchers set out to turn the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind into real life. In the movie, the lead character, Joel (played by Jim Carrey), undergoes a radical procedure after a break-up to erase his memories of his girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winset). Watch the trailer:"}

{"text":"Plasma Arc gasification (see video) is the process of breaking down matter at the atomic level by exposing it to high temperatures. Gasification isn't combustion or incineration. Those processes result in unpleasant, toxic byproducts. Gasification (click here for large illustration) uses extreme heat, in the form of plasma arcs, to reduce matter to its basic elements. Waste disposal startups in the United States and Japan took notice of a plasma arc technology developed by NASA that produced an arc at temperatures exceeding those on the sun's surface. The resulting byproducts include hydrogen, ethanol, and a slag useful for road construction. In addition to handling current solid waste, landfills can be mined for energy.\n\nLamp Becomes Robotic Desktop Assistant (Video)\n\n\"This is a new form factor for a computer,\" says the inventor of a robotic desk lamp in Inhabitat. \"Most computers that we know of today are prison cells for pixels -- this robotic interface releases the pixels from the screen.\" And the LuminAR is smart, put a can of Coke under its watchful eye and it will pull up the Coca-Cola webpage. And this doesn't work only with Coke cans -- LuminAR recognizes a lot of things.\n\nHackers After Your Brain Next?\n\nJust when you thought it was safe to use your computer, hackers have figured out how to attack everyday items. Your printer, your cellphone -- even the blender in your kitchen -- can be hacked and used against you, according to FoxNews.com. And in the not-too-distant future, as the medical field makes advances with machine-to-human interfaces, even your own body and brain could be at risk.\n\nIndian Grass: A Weapon Against Antibiotic Resistance\n\nAccording to research from Michigan Technological University, antibiotics, like many pharmaceuticals, pass through the digestive tract of people or animals largely unchanged. The resulting drug-laden waste from farms and feedlots (or for that matter, apartments and subdivisions) may be treated, but conventional treatment methods don't break down excreted antibiotics. The concentrations are small, but by releasing antibiotics indiscriminately into the environment, scientists fear we are encouraging antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria and making it harder to treat deadly infectious diseases, such as drug-resistant tuberculosis. An undergraduate biological sciences student and her professor at Michigan Technological University have conducted a successful study using vetiver grass, a vigorous and noninvasive plant native to India, to clear antibiotics from water.\n\nThe Future of Cloud Computing\n\nBy 2020, says the Pew Research Center, most people won't do their work with software running on a general-purpose PC. Instead, they will work in Internet-based applications such as Google Docs, and in applications run from smartphones"}

The discovery has been published in the prestigious international journal Nature.\n\nA major puzzle for neurobiologists is how the brain can modify one microscopic connection, or synapse, at a time in a brain cell and not affect the thousands of other connections nearby. Plasticity, the ability of the brain to precisely rearrange the connections between its nerve cells, is the framework for learning and forming memories.Researchers have revealed the complete mitochondrial genome of one of the world's most celebrated mummies, known as the Tyrolean Iceman or \u00d6tzi. The sequence represents the oldest complete DNA sequence of modern humans' mitochondria, according to the report published online on October 30th in Current Biology, a Cell Press publicationA new discovery by London biologists may yield new ways of handling the problem of transplant rejection. In a research article published in the November 2008 print issue of The FASEB Journal ( the scientists confirm the two-way transfer of a molecule (called \"MHC\") that instructs the immune system to tell \"self\" from \"non-self.\" By disrupting the transfer of this molecule, newly transplanted organs should become \"invisible\" to the host's immune system. Such an advance would be considered a major medical breakthrough because current methods of preventing organ rejection involve weakening the host's immune system, which can lead to life-threatening infections.\n\nNext week marks a pivotal moment for Eastern Pacific tuna. The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), the international body charged with the conservation and management of tuna and associated species in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, will meet in San Diego from Nov. 2-7 to consider conservation measures for vulnerable tuna populations. Whether this 16-nation Commission will act to protect declining tuna stocks, or once again demonstrate their impotence to do so, remains to be seen.

Research has suggested that false memory may be a result of having too many other things to remember or perhaps if too much time has passed. However, previous studies have indicated that a specific type of false memory known as \"boundary extension\" occurs for different reasons. Boundary extension is a mistake that we often make when recalling a view of a scene\u2014we will insist that the boundaries of an image stretched out farther than what we actually saw. Although this error is very common and occurs in people of all ages (from young children to the elderly), few studies have been done examining how quickly boundary extension occurs. That is, it was unknown how long a scene needs to be interrupted before the viewer experiences boundary extension and is convinced they saw more than they actually did.\n\nPsychologist Daniel Niesta holding one of the images used in the study. Participants were asked questions including: \"Imagine that you are going on a date with this person and have $100 in your wallet. How much money would you be willing to spend on your date?\" A groundbreaking study by two University of Rochester psychologists to be published online Oct. 28 by the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology adds color\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014to the age-old question of what attracts men to women.\n\nA novel cell division mechanism has been discovered in a microorganism that thrives in hot acid. The finding may also result in insights into key processes in human cells, and in a better understanding of the main evolutionary lineages of life on Earth. The study is published today in the online version the American National Academy of Sciences, PNAS.\n\nIt is known for a long time that the plant hormone auxin is transmitted from the top to the bottom of a plant, and that the local concentration of auxin is important for the growth direction of stems, the growth of roots, the sprouting of shoots. To name a few things; auxin is also relevant to, for instance, the ripening of fruit, the clinging of climbers and a series of other processes. Thousands of researchers try to understand the different roles of auxin.\n\nHumans have an innate defence system against deadly bacteria. However, how the step from gene to anti-bacterial effect occurs in the body is not yet known. To date, B. Pseudomallei, a bacterium suitable for bioweapons, had managed to elude medics. It can remain hidden in the human body for many years without being detected by the immune system. The bacteria can suddenly become activated and spread throughout the body, resulting in the patient dying from blood poisoning. AMC physician Joost Wiersinga and the Laboratory for Experimental Internal Medicine discovered which gene-protein combination renders the lethal bacteria B. pseudomallei harmless.\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania School of Medicine researchers have discovered how the expression of the Sonic hedgehog gene is regulated during brain development and how mutations that alter this process cause brain malformations. The results appear online this month in Nature Genetics.\n\nThe study found that species turnover in amphibians more closely follows changes in the environment when compared to birds. Biologists have long suspected that amphibians, whose moist permeable skins make them susceptible to slight changes in the environment, might be good bellwethers for impending alterations in biodiversity during rapid climate change.\n\nA tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) in Yellowstone. Frogs and salamanders, those amphibious bellwethers of environmental danger, are being killed in Yellowstone National Park. The predator, Stanford researchers say, is global warming.\n\nThe first known case of someone born without the ability to recognise voices has been reported in a paper by UCL (University College London) researchers, in a study of a rare condition known as phonagnosia. The UCL team are calling for other people to come forward if they think they have also grown up with the condition.A University of Alberta researcher has found a possible treatment for the E.coli strain that killed seven people in Walkerton, Ontario, in 2000 and has just been linked to more than 200 illnesses in North Bay, Ontario.\n\nIn the first study ever to genetically link the immune system to normal behavior, scientists at Rockefeller and Columbia universities show that mast cells, known as the pharmacologic bombshells of the immune system, directly influence how mice respond to stressful situations. The work, to appear this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and to be highlighted in Science, chips away at the increasingly stale idea that the two most complex systems in the body have entirely separate modes of operation.\n\nResearchers from the John Innes Centre in Norwich, Great Britain, in collaboration with other European centres participating to the FLORA project, have obtained genetically modified tomatoes rich in anthocyanins, a category of antioxidants belonging to the class of flavonoids. These tomatoes, added to the diet of cancer-prone mice, showed a significant protective effect by extending the mice lifespan. The research has been published in the 26 October issue of Nature Biotechnology.\n\nViruses -- long regarded solely as disease agents -- now are being used in therapies for cancer. Concerns over the safety of these so-called oncolytic viruses stem from their potential to damage healthy tissues. Now Mayo Clinic researchers have discovered a way of controlling the viruses behind potential cancer therapeutics. They are engineering the virus's genetic sequence, using microRNAs to restrict them to specific tissues. The microRNAs destabilize the virus's genome, making it impossible for the virus to run amok. The discovery is reported in the current issue of Nature Medicine.\n\nMany animals live longer when raised on low calorie diets.

Well, this is a tale of two sugars - glucose and fructose. Both occur naturally, but one of them has a vastly different way of communicating with your brain. In one corner we have glucose, commonly found in pineapples and oranges among others. The consumption of this sugar registers a \"full\" feeling in the brain. So basically you eat enough of the foods with this in it and your brain thinks \"Oh boy, I'm stuffed.\" Now, in the other corner you have fructose, commonly found in sodas and canned foods."}

But now the opposite is true, and we're the ones directing the future of our global water system. Watching that transition unfold is as sobering as it is stunning.\n\nThis three minute video, created by Felix Pharand for the opening of the Bonn meeting in Germany (meant to highlight major global water research), tracks this shift in power and the unsettling consequences to come.\n\n\"Anthropocene\" is the informal term for the newest geologic epoch, one in which humans are the major factor in global change. So in terms of our water supply, as humanity grows, the carbon and nitrogen cycles continue to shift while damming, extraction, and irrigation alter the water flow we so desperately depend on.\n\nThe video lays out the facts of our current status, which can be troubling enough: rivers exist that never meet the sea; we move massive amounts of sediment that would, otherwise, not be affected by natural erosion; 48,000 large dams have been built; and we've drained half of the global wetlands. And the consequences of our actions don't sound hopeful\u2014800 million people have no safe drinking water, and four out of five people across the entire world face risk to their water security.\n\nWhile, sure, most of us are aware that our fresh water supply is limited, seeing the numbers displayed so plainly is shocking. Btu hopefully, with conferences like the Bonn meeting kicking off today, we'll be able to change the direction of the water cycle again, but this time for the better. [Eureka Alert via Felix Pharand]\n\nWho knew an artificial neural network could be so pretty? The winners of Princeton's annual science photography contest, Art of Science, were announced a few days ago. And boy, are some of these images beautiful.\n\nEvery year, a jury of Princeton professors gets together to hum and haw over the thousands of images its students produce during their studies. The great thing about the competition is that it's totally open\u2014undergrads, grads, and doc students from nearly every department apply, ranging from computer science to architecture to biology.\n\nIt's the best of both worlds: we get to ogle the beautiful images that result from years of intense research, but we miss all of the hard academic labor. [Art of Science]\n\nEast-West, West-East by Martin Jucker\n\nEver wonder what the winds look like as they move across the globe? This image visualizes the strong West to East wind patterns that dominate earth's weather systems (in blue), plus the East to West wind, mainly at the poles, in red. \"As a result,\" explains author Martin Jucker, \"atmospheric phenomena can travel around the globe, exchanging information even from remote places of the Earth easily.\"\n\nCobalt Blue by Jason Krizan\n\nKrizan is part of chemistry research group called Cava Lab, which cooks up new materials. To do so, he and his peers heat new materials to 1400 degrees Celsius in alumina containers\u2014and just like with regular cooking, stuff gets stuck on the pan.

Mainly because of its hyper-dense cellular structure, which was broken apart and photographed as part of a material research course by Michael Kosk. Those patterns? They're the pathways that distribute water and nutrients through each layer of the tree.\n\nThis structural component\u2014and its chocolate-welded hinges\u2014were made entirely out of chocolate by engineering and architecture students. \"While it sounds like something out of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, the idea has a serious goal,\" explains the group, \"to systematically understand how the process of design can interact with unexplored materials.\" The curved shape has a remarkable strength-to-weight ratio of 24 times less than that of concrete.\n\nMirror Sphere by Sema Berkiten\n\nI don't completely understand the technology behind this beautiful image, so I'll let author Sema Berkiten explain: \"In computer vision, there are several methods to create a 3-D model of an object. One of them, called \"photometric stereo,\" uses multiple images of the object under different light directions. In this 3-D reconstruction technique, we need to calculate surface normals of the object as an intermediate step, and this picture is the result of that step. The image depicts the surface normals of a mirrored sphere... The surface normals depicted in this image are not all geometrically correct because the algorithm assumes that the surface is not shiny like a mirror, so what we see in this image are actually some artifacts caused by highlights and shadows.\"\n\nLight Eddies by Mitchell A.

Great job on those red blood cells! Keep up the good work!\n\nWe all know that exercise is good for you, but when you understand why, it makes getting off the couch and into the gym a lot easier. Here's an explanation of what happens when you work out, and how it can help you deal with the pains and the gains you'll run into down the line.\n\nOne year ago, a team of researchers traveled deep into the Honduran rainforest in search of Ciudad Blanca, the legendary lost city of treasures. Yesterday, they revealed images\u2014uncovered by lasers\u2014of structures that they believe to be the White City itself.\n\nThe legend of the White City has captured explorers' imaginations for centuries; Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s detailed his interest in the purportedly gold-laden metropolis as far back as 1526. But the Mosquitia region where it was rumored to exist is densely packed with rainforest, and the conquistadors never penetrated deep enough to claim their prize.\n\nModern archaeologists have been just as stymied. Mosquitia has been the focus of a half dozen intensive explorations in the last century alone, some of which have yielded signs of some ruins and mounds. No one, though, despite their best efforts, had found anything close to a full city structure.\n\nThe team of researchers from the University of Houston, though, had something none of those expeditions did. They had lasers.\n\nMajor Laser\n\nThe National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping does just what you would think; uses highly advanced lasers to see things the human eye can't. Specifically, in this case, the team\u2014led by a Los Angeles-based filmmaker\u2014used a Lidar system to penetrate the thick foliage of Mosquitia and discover the treasures that lay beneath.\n\nLidar itself isn't particularly new. Developed in the 1960s, it was originally used to measure cloud densities, but comes in handy today for everything from mapping the Amazon rainforest to hunting down modern-day pirates.

{"text":"from the urls-we-dig-up dept\n\nThe internet, which now connects almost everything in the world, has changed every aspect of the way we live, work, and socialize. It has also changed the way we do science, particularly in facilitating the dissemination of research results, but also in enabling scientific discoveries in ways previously unheard of. Here are a few examples of how the internet has affected (and even effected) genetic research.\n\nfrom the urls-we-dig-up dept\n\nThe US Center for Disease Control reported on its first case of AIDS (though it wasn't called AIDS at the time) in 1981. Some HIV-positive patients have since gained access to anti-viral drugs that hold off the fatal complications for many more years than it was previously thought possible. There are over 34 million people in the world who are HIV-positive, and there are some optimistic reports that the treatments are becoming more effective. Here are just a few fascinating stories on the development of HIV treatments.\n\nfrom the see?-it-can-be-useful dept\n\nAlthough crowdsourcing is all the rage at the moment, there has to be a worry that this is just the latest fad in the world of technology, and will soon follow portals and the blink tag into justified oblivion. Occasionally, though, an application of crowdsourcing appears that seems to address a real problem in a way that would be otherwise intractable.\n\nIn the UK, the authorities have discovered that a deadly disease affecting ash trees has started to spread from the rest of Europe, where it has been destroying forests for some time -- in Denmark and Sweden, 90% of ash trees are affected. The challenge is to find as many of the outbreaks of the disease as quickly as possible, in an attempt to stop it spreading even more widely to the UK's 80 million ash trees.\n\nThat's an impossible task given the limited number of scientists and experts available, and the large number of forests scattered over a wide area. So researchers at the University of East Anglia have come up with the idea of enlisting the public using a smartphone app. Clearly, untrained observers would be unable to make reliable assessments of outbreaks directly. But what they can do is to photograph ash trees that look as if they might be infected (pdf), and send these images to experts who would then decide whether further action needs to be taken:\n\nThe free \"Ashtag\" app will make it possible for anyone to take a photo of diseased leaves, shoots or bark and send it remotely to plant pathologists to identify whether or not the tree isinfected.\n\nAs well as collecting photographic evidence, the app also uses geo-tagging software to give a precise location of infected trees -- allowing researchers and authorities to build up a picture of where the dieback is happening. This can then be used to target areas for culling\nto stop the spread of the disease.\n\nAs that points out, geotagging allows the individual photographs to be aggregated to form an overall picture of where the infection is concentrated in the country. That will permit action to be taken where it most needed, and will also provide a picture of how the disease is spreading. Crowdsourcing is really the only way to gather so much information from such a large area, so quickly, and on a continuous basis.\n\nOther benefits of this approach are that it allows members of the public to become engaged with scientific work, and to contribute directly to the fight against this disease. Too often people feel alienated from the research they are paying for through their taxes, and frustrated that they can't do more to tackle an issue that concerns them. Crowdsourcing helps to tackle both"}

{"text":"Mine Safety and \u2026 Mating Elephants?\n\nRichard Hammond Finds New Use for Professors' Mine Safety Invention\n\nLEXINGTON, Va., Jan. 8, 2013 -- It's a pretty safe bet that when Col. Jay Sullivan and Col. Jim Squire were designing a device to help rescue trapped miners, they never once thought about an elephant.\n\nBut in early June 2012, the two VMI professors found themselves surrounded by pachyderms in sub-Saharan Africa, in a BBC production, Richard Hammond's Miracles of Nature, starring daredevil broadcast journalist Hammond, of Top Gear fame. The purpose of their journey was to demonstrate how their extremely low frequency seismic detector, or ELF-SD, could be used to replicate the way elephants communicate with one another over long distances.\n\nWhat Sullivan, a professor of mechanical engineering, calls \"the trip of a lifetime\" began in February, when a researcher got in touch with the VMI duo to ask about the animal communication possibilities of the ELF-SD.\n\n\"The idea was to take a look at all sorts of cool animal abilities,\" said Squire, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at VMI.\n\nSquire and Sullivan had been inspired to create the ELF-SD after the Sago Mine disaster killed 12 coal miners in West Virginia in 2006. The two professors, along with then-Cadet Will Flathers '08, sought to create a device that could send signals through solid rock, so people trapped hundreds of feet underground would have a way to communicate their whereabouts to the surface. The device was patented in 2010, and is now awaiting federal approval before commercial production can begin.\n\nWhen Squire and Sullivan first heard from the show's producers, they were surprised, to say the least.\n\n\"We had no idea who Richard Hammond was because we don't watch enough television, I guess, but he's a big deal,\" said Sullivan. \"If you ask the cadets, they all know who is because they all watch his show [Top Gear].\"\n\nSullivan continued, \"We were thinking about miners, and all of a sudden somebody started talking about the seismic communication aspect of [the ELF-SD].\" Squire explained that the TV show's staff had found out about the ELF through a Web search on seismic signaling.\n\nAt first, Squire and Sullivan were asked to travel to Rosamond, Calif., to demonstrate the ELF-SD's usefulness in the staged explosion of an abandoned gold mine. They made the trip over Easter weekend, and despite several setbacks, including the device itself being broken in transit and Squire's laptop computer getting \"fried\" by the X-ray machine at the airport, they were able to demonstrate the ELF-SD's ability to send signals through several hundred feet of rock.\n\nSquire and Sullivan returned to Virginia after the gold mine episode was filmed, thinking that they had done their part for Hammond's show. Two weeks later, they were invited to travel with Hammond and his team to Botswana, where they were to demonstrate that the ELF-SD could also be used to mimic the ultra low frequency waves that elephants use to communicate with one another. Elephants produce such waves in their vocalizations, and scientists believe that those waves can then be transmitted through the ground.\n\nThe weeks between receiving the invitation in April and departure in early June were spent packaging the ELF-SD for trans-Atlantic shipping and finding a company capable of shipping it. In the end, the producers of the show paid approximately $3,000 in shipping fees for the 140-pound device \u2013 and for a brief moment upon the device's arrival in South Africa, it looked like they might have to pay more.\n\nSullivan explained that the ELF-SD got hung up in customs, with South African officials demanding payment of a fee before it could be released. \"You get the feeling that you're not in Kansas anymore,\" said Sullivan.\n\nFor a moment, Sullivan and Squire didn't know what would happen, but then a \"fixer\" \u2013 an employee of the wildlife filming company Afriscreen Films \u2013 simply demanded that the ELF-SD be freed, and the officials relented immediately.\n\n\"The fixers were rugged individuals,\" said Sullivan. \"They're very smart people. They know how to get stuff done. They have to be.\"\n\nWhen Squire and Sullivan joined the ELF-SD in Botswana, after a journey that included a 14 \u00bd-hour flight from New York City to Johannesburg, they found a luxurious camp in the heart of the African bush \u2013 one that had already gained fame as a favorite getaway of Princes William and Harry of Great Britain.\n\nCamp Meno a Kwena, which translates into \"Teeth of the Crocodile,\" boasted tents that were a far cry from those Americans might remember from summer camp \u2013 these had real beds with linens, rugs on the floor, and even shaving stands, used each morning after an African servant supplied hot water. Visitors took showers outdoors, after servants had filled 10-gallon bags with hot water. Solar lights provided illumination.\n\n\"It really looked like something out of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,'\" said Squire of the camp. He added that the noise of animals, such as elephants, hippos, and zebras coming to drink in the nearby Boteti River, was a constant backdrop.\n\n\"It felt very much like an 1890s safari adventure,\" added Sullivan. He recalls an abundance of delicious food, plus French press coffee. There were even a few phone calls home, thanks to the iPhones carried by the British film crew.\n\nWorking in the field meant spending several hours setting up the ELF-SD and then waiting for elephants to show up. The episode of Miracles of Nature featuring the ELF-SD, which is now available on YouTube, shows a herd of bull elephants doing a rather abrupt U-turn in the device's direction when the ELF-SD was turned on and set to the frequency of a female elephant. Squire and Sullivan, though, bring a scientist's skepticism to the behavior observed.\n\n\"It certainly seemed like they did [respond to the ELF-SD's] signals,\" said Squire. \"But the jury's still out for me. It did seem like it was happening more often than chance would dictate.\"\n\nFor his part, Sullivan said he'd like to see a more controlled experiment. \"[The elephants] responded to it,\" he said. \"The question in my mind is, 'Was it solely through the ground that they were feeling this?'\" There's always the possibility that they were hearing the ELF-SD's frequencies as well as feeling them, he explained.\n\nWith their moment of televised fame behind them, the two professors and co-inventors have turned their attention to another one of their inventions: a robot designed to remove ticks from people's yards and thereby stem the spread of Lyme disease. The \"tick rover,\" which was patented in 2006, is scheduled to be tested this spring at Old Dominion University, said Squire.\n\n\"We have ideas,\" said Sullivan, referring to himself and Squire. \"We always have ideas. \u2026We've had a great association working with each other on different things. On a number of occasions, we've done work where we didn't have any realistic expectation of being successful but we rallied and were able to fix things. \u2026 We've had a really good run here, knock on wood.\""}

{"text":"12 Amazing Moments in Science.\n\n1. The Discovery of Neptune: The careful prediction of the position of Neptune by Urbain Le Verrier in 1846 represented a key turning point in science. Not only was it the first time that a planet was found after a deliberate search, it showed that science was gaining the capability to make useful predictions. Le Verrier was a theorist, and was said to have despised the tedium of actual observation. Neptune was right were he said it was, and was first sighted by Johann Galleon September 23, 1846. This evened out the score to one planet (Uranus, which Herschel wanted to name George) for the British and one for the French. Of course, America joined the fray with controversial Pluto, but that's another story!\n\n2. Hubble & the birth of Cosmology: It's hard to believe that less than a century ago, our galaxy was believed to be the sum of the universe.

Edwin Hubble was key to expanding our view in a way no one else has before or since. By identifying Cepheid variable stars in what we now know of as the Andromeda galaxy, we've come to realize that these island universes are in fact a stupendous distance away, in the case of Andromeda, over 2.5 million light years distant. The discovery of the phenomenon of red shift pushed this out even farther, with some quasars being known at a distance of over 2.5 billion light years!\n\n3. Charles Babbage and his Computer: Did you know that a \"computer\" was once an occupation? Among his accomplishments, Mr. Babbage devised plans for an amazing device known as the Difference Engine. Conceived in 1822 to compute the trigonometric and logarithmic functions of polynomials, the device was a computer far ahead of its era. Although never built in his time, this device was later constructed by the London Science Museum in 1991 to demonstrate that it was indeed functional. With its whirring of brass cogs and gears, the machine is just mesmerizing to watch. Which makes one wonder; would we have been saddled with Windows Vista had Babbage's original Difference Engine been built?\n\n4. Lithium Treatments: Sometimes the most effective solutions come from the most off-the-wall sources. In 1949, an Australian doctor named John Cade began injecting guinea pigs with urine extracted from manic-depressive patients in an effort to isolate an excess chemical that was perhaps contributing to their condition. The animals died, making Cade wonder if the cause was a buildup in uric acid. Lithium had been used for some time to treat gout, also caused by uric acid buildup. He then ejected a control group with a 0.5% solution of lithium, and discovered the mice became very placid. Giving lithium carbonate to one of his most mentally disturbed patients, Cade was surprised at the almost immediate turn around; the man was not only relieved of his insanity, but able to check out of the facility! Cade's remarkable discovery was one of the true \"light bulb\" moments in medical science; lithium medications are still in use today.\n\nThe little yellow stickie that could\u2026(Credit: CommonsHelper under a GNU Free license).\n\n5. Invention of Post-its: These little (and sometimes actually still yellow) babies are one of the great unsung inventions of the 20th Century. But did you know that in the 1970's chemist Art Frey originally rejected the adhesive because it was insufficiently sticky? He did, however, notice it made an excellent bookmark. These days, post-it's probably have more unauthorized applications than any another invention; post-it notes have even been found by recovery aircrew, still stuck to the nose of aircraft! When we toured the McMath Pierce Solar Observatory at Kitt Peak, Arizona, we even spotted two post-its being used to create a slit for light diffraction\u2026we love it when quick fixes become permanent solutions. Our favorite everyday use? Photo-copier editing!\n\n6. Benzene Dream: Way back in the 1860's, German Chemist Fredrich Kekule was plagued with a problem; defining the atomic structure of benzene. Expressed in the formula C6H6, this inscrutable molecule eluded him. The idea of a ring structure came to him in a dream of an intertwined fiery snake, chasing its tail. (Freud would have had a field day with that one\u2026) Kekule's discovery no less than opened up the field of chemical aromatics.\n\n7. My Body, the Phosphorous Factory: OK, this \"best-of list\" has two urine tales, almost as many as there are astronomical, but it's a tale too bizarre to not be told. Way back in 1609 when chemistry was still interlaced with alchemy, an idea had taken hold that the \"life force\" that animates living things could somehow be isolated in the excretions of the body. This led chemist Henning Brandt of Hamburg to begin collecting and reducing his own urine, distilling it, collecting its condensate in water. Although he was searching for the fabled Philosophers Stone, what he had in fact created was ammonium sodium hydrogen phosphate, a white, waxy substance that glowed in the dark. He had also discovered the element phosphorous. Of course, it took over 1,000 liters of urine to produce 60 grams of phosphorous\u2026 and one wonders what Brandt's wife thought of the vats of stinking urine that lay about the house! Brandt's own reluctance to reveal his secret eventually led to others stealing his thunder, and it was found later that bones are a much wealthier reserve of phosphorous than urine.\n\nThe famous X-ray pic \"Photo 51!\" (Credit:Rosalind Franklin).\n\n8. Double Helix discovery: I love to point out to folks an often overlooked fact about 20th century science; did you know that we cracked relativity & quantum physics before we discovered the building blocks of life? The breakthrough of the discovery of the double helix nature of DNA was published in Nature by Francis Crick and James Watson in 1953. This led to the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1962, but what's not as well known is the pioneering work by scientist Rosalind Franklin that made this discovery possible. Her X-ray diffraction image dubbed \"Photo 51\" was the first glimpse at the structure of life itself.\n\n9. The Discovery of Penicillin: In 1928, Scottish scientist Alexander Flemming noticed a lone Petri dish had been mistakenly left open. Overnight, a bluish-green mold had taken residence, surrounded by an odd halo. Flemming correctly deduced that the mold, now known as Penicillium, was suppressing the Staphylococcus bacterium, and prokaryotes worldwide have been on the run ever since. Just think of the massive number of bacterial infections that used to be fatal, that are now handled by a simple course of antibiotics!\n\n10. Nuclear Fission, at a Stoplight? Sometimes, it seems as if the hand of God pulls up the shades and lets us glimpse the \"guts\" of the universe, just for a second. Such a moment occurred to physicist Leo Slizard with realization on a London street corner that a self-sustaining fission reaction could release the vast energy in uranium. Having fled Nazi Germany just months before in 1933, Slizard was walking home after having read an article in the London Times by Ernest Rutherford denouncing the harnessing of the power of the atom as \"pure moonshine,\" when the idea for a neutron chain reaction came to him. Of course, nowadays, if his IPhone had interrupted him, he would have simply kept walking and texting\u2026\n\n11. Hubble, Take Two: Next up is not a person, but a thing; in its 20 years in space as of this month, the Hubble Space Telescope has simply redefined our place in the cosmos. Not only has Hubble returned some pretty pictures, but it has no less than minted a whole new generation of astronomy PhDs. And the trickle-down benefits have been enormous; for example, did you know that the explosion in digital camera technology that came about in the 1990's was partly due to Hubble?\n\n12. Mendeleev and the Periodic Table: Ever wonder why the periodic table of the elements has that weird shape? In 1860's Dmitri Mendeleev set about grouping known elements by chemical properties using assigned cards on a table. He soon realized the groupings could only make sense if certain elements were yet to have been discovered, an enormous insight. The discovery of the Nobel gas Helium in the corona of the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1868 vindicated the predictive power of Mendeleev's periodic table, and struck a victory for true science geekdom!\n\nSo there you have it, a baker's dozen of the wonders that can occur when scientists buck the status quo. It was a tough call, narrowing it down to \"only\" 12\u2026 if the feedback's decent, we may make this a recurring thing!

Leave a comment or tweet 'em at us!\n\nIn the meantime, play with those moldy Petri dishes, reduce and condense those bodily fluids, and above all, don't ignore those dreams of fiery snakes\u2026 the universe might just be trying to tell you something!\n\nJust what's growing there in the back of the refrigerator?

America\n\nSEATTLE, Dec. 18 (UPI) -- Large dust plumes originating in Asia are delivering thousands of species of microbial life to the North American West Coast, biologists say.\n\nResearchers at the University of Washington report they've found evidence of 2,100 unique microbial species hitching rides across the Pacific Ocean in the upper troposphere.\n\n\"The long-range transport and surprising level of species richness in the upper atmosphere overturns traditional paradigms in aerobiology,\" David J. Smith, who recently earned a doctorate in biology and astrobiology, said. \"It's a small world. Global wind circulation can move Earth's smallest types of life to just about anywhere.\"\n\nAn estimated 7.1 million tons of aerosols -- dust, pollutants and other atmospheric particles, including microorganisms -- cross the Pacific each year, researchers said, carried by wind storms into the upper reaches of the troposphere.\n\nThe troposphere, the layer of air closest to earth up to about 11 miles, is where almost all weather occurs.\n\nLarge plumes of aerosols in the troposphere can make the trans-Pacific trip in just seven to 10 days, the researchers said. Most of the microorganisms originated from soils in Asia and were either dead on arrival in North American or harmless to humans, they said.\n\nHowever, while most of the species are already present in low background levels on the West Coast, the atmospheric plumes can bring elevated levels of the organisms, researchers said.Hurricane Sandy doubled Internet outages\n\nLOS ANGELES, Dec. 18 (UPI) -- Hurricane Sandy doubled the average level of Internet outages in the United States and it took four days to bring it back to normal levels, U.S. scientists say.\n\nComputer scientists at the University of Southern California who track Internet outages throughout the world said when the hurricane hit the East coast, the outages doubled from 0.2 percent of the Internet being down -- about average -- to 0.43 percent, a USC release reported Tuesday.\n\n\"On a national scale, the amount of outage is small, showing how robust the Internet is,\" John Heidemann of the USC Information Sciences Institute said. \"However, this significant increase in outages shows the large impact Sandy had on our national infrastructure.\"\n\nDuring the hurricane the researchers sent tiny packets of data known as \"pings\" to networks and waited for \"echoes\" or responses, a method that can provide a statistically reasonable picture of when parts of the Internet are active or down.\n\nThe researchers were also able to pinpoint locations of outages, detecting a spike in outages in New Jersey and New York after Sandy made landfall.\n\nKnowing scale and location of outages could guide Internet service providers in allocating resources to respond to disasters, the researchers said.\n\n\"We are working to improve the coverage of our techniques to provide a nearly real-time view of outages across the entire Internet,\" Heidemann said. \"We hope that our approach can help first responders quickly understand the scope of evolving natural disasters.\"\n\nCoal said to overtake oil as energy source\n\nPARIS, Dec. 18 (UPI) -- Coal's share of the global energy mix is rising and it could overtake oil as the world's top energy source by 2017, an energy market report says.\n\nThe report by the International Energy Agency, based in Paris, predicts coal demand will increase in every region of the world except in the United States, where coal is being supplanted by shale gas in an agency release Monday.\n\nThat trend is likely to continue, she said.\n\n\"In fact, the world will burn around 1.2 billion more tons of coal per year by 2017 compared to today -- equivalent to the current coal consumption of Russia and the United States combined.\"\n\nChina will surpass the rest of the world in coal demand during that time period, the report predicted, while India will become the largest coal importer and second-largest consumer, overtaking the United States.\n\n\"Coal's share of the global energy mix continues to grow each year, and if no changes are made to current policies, coal will catch oil within a decade,\" van der Hoeven"}

The '80s also marked the start of the global fight against AIDS, as well as growing concern about the effect of greenhouse-gas emissions on global climate.\n\nThis week we're revisiting 50 of the top science sagas of the past 50 years - and it goes without saying that every saga has made a contribution to the current state of society. But if you had to pick one decade that sowed the seeds for the current crop of technological triumphs and troubles, it just might be the '80s.\n\nYou won't find the shuttle's first flight or the PC's debut on this list, and maybe they should be there. Doing a beta test on the timeline is what this exercise is all about. Feel free to let us know what we're missing, what we're putting too much emphasis on - and what you remember about the technological tenor of the times.\n\nFor example, I'll always remember buying my first \"computer\" in the early 1980s. It was an Atari 800, which I actually used at the newspaper where I worked to tabulate the votes in an Oscar poll. To program the darn thing, you had to type in lines of code, oh so carefully, then hit the \"record\" button on a cassette tape recorder to store the program. Later, I sprung for a floppy-disk drive. Today there's far more computing power packed inside your typical cell phone (which first came to market in 1984, by some accounts).\n\nAm I really remembering all this right?

The infectious disease killed untold millions over the course of centuries, and its eradication through widespread vaccination was a crowning achievement in public health.\n\n24. Killer asteroid: Luis and Walter Alvarez propose that a cosmic impact was responsible for the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction that killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. The hypothesis provided a focus for further scientific study into the causes of great extinctions. Cosmic impacts as well as the effects of climate change have come to be seen as the primary factors behind ancient die-offs.\n\n25. Cosmic inflation:Inflationary big bang theory is put forward by Alan Guth to explain seeming contradictions in the scientific model for the universe's creation. Subsequent observations supported inflation as the leading explanation for what happened immediately after the universe's origin to create the seeds of cosmic structure.\n\n1983\n\n26.

Evo-devo: Researchers at the University of Basel and Indiana University independently discover homeobox DNA sequences within genes, which regulate patterns of development in a wide spectrum of organisms. Such work helped lead the way to evolutionary development (\"evo-devo\") studies that shed light on how different species are interrelated.\n\n1984\n\n28.

Theorists suggest that string theory - the idea that the most fundamental constituents of matter can be thought of as minuscule strings vibrating in multidimensional space - could resolve the inconsistencies between general relativity and quantum physics. The first superstring revolution (1984-85) set the precedent for the second superstring revolution (1994-97). Even today, string theory sparks debate over whether it could be a \"theory of everything\" ... or a \"theory of nothing.\"\n\n1985\n\n30. Nanotechnology: Buckminsterfullerene is created in the lab by Robert Curl, Harold Kroto and Richard Smalley. The soccerball-like C60 molecule was the first of several artificial carbon constructs that paved the way for innovations in nanotechnology such as carbon nanotubes. Other nanotech innovations, such as gold nanoparticles and quantum dots, appear to have medical applications - but nanotechnology has raised medical concerns as well.\n\n1986\n\n31. Catching up with comets: Europe's Giotto mission observes Halley's comet up close. For the first time, humans were given a glimpse at the source of one of the most dramatic displays in the heavens - and, according to some theories, a primordial source for the stuff of life. Cometary studies continued with 2005's Deep Impact mission, which fired a \"bullet\" into the heart of a comet, and the Stardust mission, which brought samples of comet dust back to Earth in 2006.\n\n32.

{"text":"LU researcher: NASA's ET hype does disservice to science\n\nDec 13, 2010 By Jordan Reese\n\nNASA researchers recently unveiled a major discovery -- the first identified microorganism on Earth able to thrive using toxic arsenic rather than phosphorus, which forms the DNA-backbone of all other living things. But now, scientists are voicing concerns about the study's conclusions, with some saying the results are not what the researchers claim.\n\nValidity of the science aside, Lehigh microbiologist Amy Hitchcock Camp says that the clumsy delivery of the news had already overshadowed the potentially groundbreaking science. NASA touted the microorganism's impact on the search for extraterrestrial life, generating buzz about alien life forms. Yet, the microbe in question hailed from California.\n\nThis is a common error, says Camp, when there's breaking science news. A major scientific finding becomes at best misunderstood, and at worst, an example of how science has trouble communicating even its best discoveries.\n\n\"The announcement made the science look like a disappointment. This does a great disservice to the actual findings\u2014and leaves the public with misconceptions,\" says Camp, who joined the Lehigh faculty this year as an assistant professor of biological sciences. \"I think the general public would have been able to appreciate it more if NASA and Science (the journal in which the study was published) had not allowed speculation and rumors to run rampant.\"\n\nA remarkable discovery\n\nIf, in fact, the newly discovered bacterium can live on arsenic\u2014and is not simply sneaking phosphorous as some have claimed\u2014our notion of what life can be would change, Camp says.\n\n\"Until now, science has taken a rather narrow view of life\u2014that oxygen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorous, hydrogen and nitrogen are the six essential atoms for life,\" she says. \"This study could alter longstanding assumptions about that with the addition of arsenic. It's not a truly different life form. But it could inform our search for alternative forms of life.\"\n\nAs for the short-lived buzz that an alien life form had been discovered, Camp doesn't share the public disappointment. \"If we found this microbe in a galaxy far, far away, we couldn't study it,\" says Camp, who studies how bacterial cells communicate and regulate their genes. \"Perhaps for the public it would be more exciting to find life on another planet. But for me, it is more exciting because we can actually study it here.\"\n\nCamp's attraction to the story comes from her work on understanding how microbes adapt to different environments. Because the vast majority of cellular life and diversity is microbial, scientists who are interested in finding other forms of life wisely look at microbes.\n\nThe recent findings \"could open up a whole new study of the arsenic-containing biological molecules, their relative stabilities and their biochemistry,\" Camp says.\n\nArsenic was\u2014and is still, by many\u2014considered too unstable an element to function in biological molecules.\n\n\"Even if this microbe isn't utilizing arsenic in place of phosphorus in its biomolecules, it is still remarkable that it can thrive in the presence of ordinarily lethal concentrations of arsenic,\" Camp says. \"I think we can reliably take away from it that if there is any possible solution to avoiding death, nature will find it.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\nYesterday, NASA announced the discovery of a bacterium that can grow on a diet of arsenic and thus doesn't share the biological building blocks traditionally associated with all life forms.

Recent data have shown that 1 in 4 adults in England are currently obese, the highest rate in Europe, but the conclusion that the Council draws from this figure is quite stimulating. According to Ms Chesterfield, head of the Department of Health and Social Care, \"Instead of letting underfed nations make us feel guilty, we should be proud of our first place. Obesity is not a shame but a claim to fame: it proves the exceptional adaptability of the English body to the demands of the food-processing industry's free market. It's up to us now to change our own representation of large people, and sumo can help us, by showing that being overweight is not incompatible with the practice of an elite sport.\" The Council thus is launching a publicity campaign next autumn, \"Fat Makes You Healthy,\" sponsored by KFC, and on 1st October a Sumo Learning Centre \u2013 the first of this kind in the UK \u2013 will open its doors at the Arena.

{"text":"18, 2013\n\nDr. Rohini Chowgule to speak on ?Information and communication\ntechnology in health-care delivery?.\n\nMany years ago, a German scientist named Dr. Ernst Hartmann noted that different families that came to live in a given house in succession (after an earlier family moved on after living in it for three to four years), had almost similar health issues.\n\nWhat surprised him even more was that those living nearby faced no problems. Further, his observations held true over an extended period of time \u2013 his practice was about 40 years old.\n\nThat set him thinking. Was it something about the house itself that was causing health problems for its residents? He started looking at natural radiations and other factors (such as underground electromagnetic fields and cavities, water troughs and so on).\n\nSoon, he found that those houses had been built on certain \"fault-lines\" which caused discomfort and illness to those who came to reside in them.\n\nHis study brought to fore the theory that the entire earth was threaded with an invisible grid of lines at a distance of six to eight feet from each other. In course of time, this grid came to be known as the \"Hartmann Lines\".\n\nThis interesting episode was narrated at the last meeting by the guest speaker, Mr. Ajay Poddar, who spoke on \"The impact of radiation on people and how to overcome it\".\n\nArmed with a B.Tech. degree in Civil Engineering from IIT, Delhi, he has been studying the nascent field of environics for many years and is the founder of Syenergy Environics Ltd., which has been involved in original research in the field of environmental radiation and its effects on human health.\n\nAs Programme Chairman Nanik Rupani said in his introduction of the speaker, \"Radiation is going to be a very big problem in times to come, what with cellular phones and towers. It will affect everybody and we don't know what will be its consequences\".\n\nMr. Poddar said at the outset that the word environics was not in the dictionary; like the science itself, \"it was created by us\"; it energised people and places; it enhanced their performance and made them excel in whatever they were doing. In short, it helped in \"energising your spaces to your advantage\".\n\n\"Environics is an innovative practice that detects and corrects existing harmful radiations and negative energy flows in open land, built spaces, homes, factories, offices and so on to create productive and healthy spaces.\n\n\"There are certain natural geological phenomena under the earth which, like electricity, are bio-electromagnetic in nature; there are underground water streams, but while it is good to find them and sink tube wells to find water, it's not good to sleep on them or work on them because these are natural cavities of the earth.\n\n\"And then there are earth's magnetic grid lines. Besides, we also use a lot of artificial and synthetic material for our buildings which also have certain effects \u2013 they don't let buildings breathe; factors such as the shape of the building also impact energy flows.\"\n\nMr. Poddar said that apart from houses, studies had also been conducted in offices and other places. It was found that the natural radiation fault-lines were sometimes 200 times more intense than the normal energy of the human body.\n\nIn a given office area, these lines could affect the performance and also the health of about 20% of the staff \u2013 especially those who worked in areas \"cut\" or criss-crossed by natural radiation and other faults.\n\nSimilarly, in an apartment block built over underground water streams, those residents whose beds were placed above the streams were likely to be affected.\n\n\"In an office space or in a house, if you superimpose the effect of both these things (radiation and underground water streams), you will find that about 20% of the spaces are affected. (Although) you may or may not be a part of that.\"\n\nAnother name for this area of work was geopathic stress (there were about 80 websites devoted to this).\n\nThe lead given by Dr. Hartmann was followed by many others in Germany and Austria.\n\nDr. Otto Bergmann recorded 462,000 measurements and found that blood pressure, heart beat and pulse rate were affected by geopathic stress. He studied 3,000 apartments and 11,000 people.\n\nNew research had shown that geopathic stress could also result from electro-magnetic fields caused by electrical wiring, lighting, appliances (including computers, televisions, microwaves, clocks, radios), telephones (especially cellular phones) and from outdoor sources such as electric generators, transformers and electricity pylons.\n\nMr. Poddar said that even the World Health Organization had recognised \"SBS\" or \"Sick Building Syndrome\" and had held that it affected about 30% of people, as also offices, hotels, institutes and so on where people worked and lived. It caused lethargy, loss of concentration, depression and stress.\n\nHowever, Dr. Rohini Chowgule contested this claim, stating that as a pulmonary physician she was aware that \"Sick Building Syndrome\" had nothing to do with radiation but with the stale air circulating in the vicinity. Mr. Poddar conceded the point.\n\nTo continue with the talk, Mr. Poddar said he was enthused by media reports which forecast the everyday use of environics in all new buildings (with environics becoming as essential as painting and furnishing) in another ten years.\n\nThe success of environics was evident from the improved health and performance of the residents who had benefited from it. Their pulse rate, heart beat and blood pressure showed a clear improvement.\n\nSimilarly, when machines broke down due to negative radiation, they started working better once the environment was corrected.\n\nAfter his brief talk, the speaker requested his colleague Ms Manisha to demonstrate the effects of electromagnetic fields, especially around cell phones, with the help of an antenna that measured radiation.\n\nMr. Poddar concluded by saying that he had developed an anti-radiation chip that helped ward off unnecessary currents and emissions from cell phones, cell phone towers and so on. The first lot had just been received from the factory and he had brought along a sufficient quantity for distribution among the members of the Club.\n\nAnswering questions, he said that mobile towers were harmful up to a distance of 150 to 200 feet. It was necessary to keep"}

Abstract\nPrimary liver tumors are mainly represented by hepatocellular hepatocarcinoma (HCC), one of the most aggressive and resistant forms of cancer.

The alteration of cancer-related miRNA expression can be associated with tumorigenesis. In HCC, deregulated miRNAs frequently act as oncogenes or altered tumor suppressors. Distinct subtypes of hepatic cancer can also be related to an aberrant expression of particular miRNAs, arguing for the significance of using miRNAs as tumor biomark...

Welcome to Chemistry World with Victoria Gill, Richard Van Noorden, Manisha Lalloo and James Mitchell Crow. I'm Chris Smith. Coming up, why the moon is actually a much wetter place than we first thought.\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nWe've always but in the middle of these beads, they did detect a small amount of water.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo, no cheese then. That's on the way. Also talking of water, we'll be finding out what ice cores from Antarctica can tell us about climate change.\n\nInterviewee - Eric Wolff\n\nWe are much higher than it has been at any time in the last 800,000 years. So it ranges between a 170 in the cold periods and about 300 in the very warmest periods and right now we're at 380 this year and rising by 2 parts per million per year.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nThat's Eric Wolff from the British Antarctic Survey who will be joining us later and we'll also be celebrating summer with a drink.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nSo we're going to see if Rich can tell the difference between the beer that has been exposed to sunlight and hopefully there's been some interesting photochemistry affecting its flavour and the beer that's been lovingly refrigerated. So this is beer number 1 (sound of beer being poured)\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nI can see you've worked in a pub Vic. Can he have some beer with his head please? Now they say, you shouldn't taste your chemistry experiments, but this was one exception that the team were willing to make, that's the science of beer and photochemistry and it's coming up later and we'll also be solving last month's chemical conundrum.\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nIf you had a standoff between hydrogen, carbon, and chlorine, which has the highest first ionization energy.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nThe answer is on the way and if you sent in a chemical solution, then stay tuned to find out if you're one of this month's winners.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nThe Chemistry World podcast is brought to you by the Royal Society of Chemistry. Look us up online at chemistryworld dot org.\n\n(End Advertisement)\n\n(2:08 -- The moon may not be made of cheese, but it's wetter than expected)\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nNow for anyone who is disappointed to learn as a child that the moon is really made of cheese, there's some consolation because it now it looks like scientists have found that in fact it's got a lot of water up there. Richard.\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nWell, not a lot of water Chris. We've always thought and it's the titanium and the magnesium that's causing this colour, and when they looked at these beads, there's no volatile components like water or chlorine or fluorine on the surface, as you would expect, the moon is very small, it doesn't have an atmosphere. All of these volatile components would have floated away long ago, that's why the moon is bone dry, but in the middle of these beads, they did detect a small amount of water and doing some modelling to work out perhaps how quickly the water diffused away from these beads, which they think were formed during volcanic eruptions, these beads have sort of melted glassy magnesium or titanium.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nWere they formed in situ on the Moon or presumably they were formed on the early Earth and then when the Moon got formed from the Earth's crust, it got carried with this. Is that what happened?\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nWell that's the question. That's what they don't know. They actually found, as they were modelling that the amount of water that would have been present in these beads is about the same as what's in the Earth's mantle and that obviously gives rise to the question, did these come from the Earth in an impact. But they don't think it was a meteoroid from outer space because there doesn't seem to be things like nickel there that would have come from the meteoroids as well. So, now the question is, how was the water preserved in these glassy components. Did something crash in from the Earth as you say is very intriguing and they seem to just struck lucky. They seem to just found these beads. People have been looking at these soils for sometime and they happen to pick some that seem to have water in. It may be that water isn't scattered all over the Moon in these beads and that they just picked exactly the right spot.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo, what's the implication of this then? Where next, what are the big questions that this has opened up?\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nWell the question is, was there water on the early Moon, it could have hung around long enough to something interesting to happen or did it all disappear very quickly leaving the mostly dry Moon that we know today and can we find more water in other types of beads. Can we work out how the water got there perhaps by more detailed analysis on the hydrogen and deuterium isotopes of the water? So that's still to be addressed, but it's very exciting that the Moon is not really as dry as we thought.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nBut it does sound like it's going to necessitate a return visit to answer some of those questions.\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nWell, the authors from the Brown University in Rhode Island, US say that even manned crews might not actually find water. You know they think that they were quite lucky and so they are not even sure that manned crews will find water because we should see many trying, and the US's race to the Moon continues at its current pace, we might see manned visits to the Moon by 2020. So perhaps the mystery will be resolved.\n\n(5:05 -- Chemistry on Mars)\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nThanks Richard. While sticking with the subject of water and our near cosmic neighbours scientists are working on Mars, Manisha to understand a bit more about the surface chemistry there.\n\nInterviewee - Manisha Lalloo\n\nYeah, there has been quite a lot of exciting chemistry going on, on Mars at the moment and as a result of the, Phoenix Mars Lander which touched down in the arctic plains on the 25th of May and so over the last couple of months, scientists have been busy carrying out chemistry experiments that can help us study the history of water on Mars and study whether Mars has the potential to support life.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nWhat sort of things have they been doing to answer those questions?\n\nInterviewee - Manisha Lalloo\n\nFrom a chemist's perspective, I guess there are two main experiments they have being carrying out. The first is being using the wet chemistry laboratories on Phoenix and which is part of an instrument called MECA, which is Phoenix's Microscopy, Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer. Basically though wet chemistry experiments are carried out in these miniature chemistry labs and which is the size of a tea cup and contain ion-selective electrodes which can measure things such as what type of ions are in the solution and the pH of the solution of soil and water and the conductivity of the soil. So far they have found that the soil of Mars is alkaline, it's about a pH of 8 or 9 and they've also found sodium, potassium, magnesium, chloride and sulphate salts.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nHow do the abundances of those things compare with the same chemicals on Earth? Have we got a composition of the surface in Mars similar to Earth or is it very dramatically different?\n\nInterviewee - Manisha Lalloo\n\nAt the moment, they've still got a lot of analyzing left to do and it will take weeks and months before they can determine the true significance of these results. I spoke to the lead and scientist, Sam Kounaves and he says that they don't know the exact levels of salts and ions in the solutions at the moment but somewhere in between tap water and seawater.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSounds tasty. So they haven't actually got that long to do all this, have they? Because the probe can only work until winter comes and then that's it.\n\nInterviewee - Manisha Lalloo\n\nYeah, that's true and at the moment the scientists have been working to a Mars day, they've been working to Mars time which is the 24.7 Earth hour day and that mission is scheduled to last for 90 sols which is 90 Martian days. So that should end at the end of August, but the scientist I talked to, said that they can hopefully extend it for a couple of months, but that (UNCLEAR 7:16) to get all the chemistry done.\n\nWell coming back to Earth now and to Antarctica which paradoxically despite being the coldest place on Earth, also holds many of the answers to the question of global warming. Here's is Eric Wolff.\n\nInterviewee - Eric Wolff\n\nAntarctica in various places holds the key to understanding a lot of aspects of the Earth, especially to do with climate change. The work that I do is particularly on ice cores and ice cores are the clearest way we have of knowing how the famous green house gases, carbon dioxide and methane have changed in the past and although we think of Antarctica as very remote, it does have a significant effect on global climate. So, we do really need to understand that just as much as anywhere else in the world.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo, when we are talking about the ice in Antarctica, how thick is it?\n\nInterviewee - Eric Wolff\n\nIn the central parts of Antarctica, the ice can be up to 4 km or 3 miles thick, of course around the coast it's very much thinner, but that 4 km has been snow fall falling over thousands and millions of years, actually the ice sheets been there probably continuously for at least 20 million years and so it builds up to these incredible thicknesses.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd so once you want to unlock the data that's in that ice, how do you get at it, obviously you got to drill it out in someway.\n\nInterviewee - Eric Wolff\n\nSo, I have friends who are engineers who go and drill this ice forming using these, they look a little bit like very large wood boring instruments, but they drill out a cylinder of ice may be about 10 cm in diameter. We pull up 3 or 4 meters at a time and if you keep going and do that a thousand times, you get to the bottom of the ice sheet.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd so how far back, if you get to the bottom that gives you how much time?\n\nInterviewee - Eric Wolff\n\nWell the oldest ice that we've got so far from ice cores in Antarctica is 800,000 years old. We think that there is older ice somewhere in and sometime in the rest of my career I hope we will get to well beyond a million years. But 800,000 years already takes us through 8 cycles of having ice ages and warmer periods, so it's already a very good range of climate.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd how do you get the data out. So once you've got the chunk of ice, how do you actually find out what the climate was doing by analyzing that?\n\nInterviewee - Eric Wolff\n\nOkay, well, as you are employing its all chemistry, mainly we bring the ice back and some of the analysis is done in the field in Antarctica but mostly it's brought back in different sections that are sent to different labs around Europe in the case of the projects like mostly been involved with. The first thing that we measure is the isotopic content of the water itself. So that's comparing the amounts of water with oxygen with the weight of 18 and standard water with oxygen with a weight of 16 and that tells you what the temperature was at the time the snow fell. So that's really the very primary thing that you want to know, that keys everything else in. Then in addition, there are lots of impurities in the ice, for example, we can measure sulphuric acid or sulphate in the ice and it tell us lots of things, but one of the very obvious things is that you occasionally see very big spikes whether the concentration of sulphate goes up by may be a factor of 3 over the background and that's always because that was the year when there was a big volcanic eruption like Krakatau in 1883 and then finally we got these little bubbles of air that are trapped in the ice and those bubbles can be cracked open again and analyzed for all the trace gases in the atmosphere.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd when you do this analysis, what's the message that's emerging; what are you seeing?\n\nInterviewee - Eric Wolff\n\nWell, there are different messages depending on the time scales you look at. The big one that comes after the long records is that you see climate warming and cooling over 800,000 years and the most striking thing is that carbon dioxide and methane, but carbon dioxide particularly go up and down as the ice ages go up and down. Our inference from that firstly is that they are playing a major role in amplifying what should be very small climate changes into big ones that can make ice sheets come and go. Of course, it's also telling us something about the carbon cycle and about how carbon dioxide is released from the oceans and from land at different times which is something we're going to really need to understand in the future as we want the oceans to mop up some of the carbon dioxide we're putting into the atmosphere. So it both tells us how carbon dioxide affects the climate and how the climate affects carbon-dioxide.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nBecause some people have pointed out that we assume that this year too goes up and then the world warms up, but of course when you warm the planet, you warm the sea and if you've a warmer water, then less gas would dissolve in warmer water and as a result that would lead to CO2 coming out, wouldn't it? So how do we know that it's the CO2 coming first and then other effects secondarily.\n\nInterviewee - Eric Wolff\n\nWell actually in the past, it probably wasn't CO2 coming first, that's a very good point and worth making and these natural changes of several degree Celsius in global temperature that happened roughly every 100,000 years, we think it was almost certainly the small changes in the structure of the Earth's orbit around the sun that triggered everything off but then the carbon dioxide coming out soon afterwards amplified it helped in being a very big climate change. So you get this, as you say a chicken-and-egg situation where both the temperature and the carbon dioxide are rising together actually for several thousand years and the difference with what's happening now is that we don't have to say which came first, because we know which came first. We know we are putting lots of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and that's another one of the very clear results from ice cores.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nWhen we compare CO2 levels now with what your record say they have ever been in the past, where are we now on the, sort of, grand scheme of things?\n\nInterviewee - Eric Wolff\n\nWell, we're much higher than it has been at anytime in the last 800,000 years. So it ranges between 170 in the cold periods and about 300 in the very warmest periods and right now we are at 380, 385 I think, this year and rising by 2 parts per million per year. So it's much higher than anytime in that period. There are very indirect measurements from ocean sediments suggesting that carbon dioxide was significantly higher 10 - 20 million years ago and then of course a lot higher back in the geological time, when the Earth was indeed very much warmer than it is now. So within the time period when the Earth looked like it does now, with the continents in the same places, this is probably the highest level but we only know about the last 800,000 years for sure.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSure, but when it has gone that high before, what actually turn things around to make it come down again, because that's a pretty important question for us, better answer it?\n\nInterviewee - Eric Wolff\n\nYeah, that's a very good question and I don't think anybody has a particularly good idea on these 100,000 year time scales, we think what's happening is essentially the balance between what's in the deep ocean, what's in the surface ocean, and what's in the atmosphere has been changing probably due to changes in the way the ocean circulates. But over longer geological time, there is a balance between carbon dioxide being put into the atmosphere and taken out through volcanism on the one hand and weathering on the other hand and so that's determined by things like how bigger an area of mountain building is going on that causes weathering and things like that, which I have to say are beyond my limit, but they are certainly on time scales that aren't going to help us.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo when it comes to global warming, it sounds like, we've got something of a mountain to climb, thank you very much. That's Eric Wolff from the British Antarctic Survey.\n\n(Music)\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nThis is the Chemistry World podcast, with me Chris Smith and still to come, we will be finding out why heavy metals might be to blame for dolphins beaching themselves and we'll also be raising a glass and drinking the contents to beer photochemistry.\n\n(14:30 -- Can humans sense light through their skin?)\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nBut first Victoria we've heard of people having eyes in the backs of their heads but now there is a possibility that skin almost has eyes of its own.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nWell and this is the team of researchers from the University of Paris and they have found that proteins that are sensitive to light very similar to the light sensitive proteins that you find in plants that can kick start chemical reactions that tell a plant when to flower or when to unfurl its leaves. They're found in our skin. Now we've known this for a long time. But what wasn't known was whether they were actually light sensitive and whether they have any function.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo what are they doing in the skin, do we know what they do there at all?\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nWell, we still don't know. This is very preliminary research and we still don't know quite why they are there, but this particular research group has discovered that they do respond to light which was something that was completely unknown. So what they did was they expressed these cryptochromes, these are light sensitive proteins, they reduce in response to light and at least they do in the plant version, so they took the proteins from human skin and also the fly version of this protein and expressed them in cells and then they exposed them to blue lights to which the plant's cryptochromes are very, very sensitive, very highly sensitive and they found, looking at them very closely with a very sensitive spectroscopic techniques, they found that indeed they do change. They photoreduce just like the plant proteins do and so what they have concluded is that there may be a function for these proteins, we may be sensing light through these proteins in our skin and that may be contributing to, say, our circadian clock, so that's the day and night rhythm that tells us when to sleep and when to be awake.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nIsn't that what eyes are for?\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nWell exactly, I mean, we know that we sense light through our eyes and that we have chemical reactions that are stimulated by proteins that are found in our retinas and we know very well that the circadian rhythms are linked very closely with those chemical reactions. So it's quite controversial, this research team haven't concluded quite what these proteins are doing, when they respond to light, just that they do and in fact we spoke to one researcher who explained that in humans who are blind and can't sense light through their eyes at all, those people don't have any body clocks, so they don't have a circadian rhythm, so we can only sense light through our eyes, this is what he was telling us. So it seems that we still haven't determined what the function of these skin cryptochromes is.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nThere was a paper in Science a few years back, where they were experimenting that the idea of shining lights into the backs of people's knees on airplanes to try to reset the body clock, so they wouldn't get jet lagged and in fact it was found to be rubbish.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nRight!\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd there is no evidence that light shown on skin can adjust the body clock, even though the paper in Science to start with, was subsequently disproved. So it sounds like this agrees with what your researcher told you.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nYeah, exactly and it still leaves these light sensitive proteins, they are a bit mysterious.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nWell, let us hope someone can shed some light on that dark mystery before too long. Thank you Victoria.\n\n(17:32 -- How mercury could be responsible for Dolphins beaching themselves)\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nWell, from a heavy question about lights to a heavy question about heavy metals, because there is a suggestion James, that this might be the reason that some animals like dolphins choose to beach themselves.\n\nInterviewee - James Mitchell Crow\n\nWell some Australian scientists have been looking at the connection between mercury poisoning and dolphins beaching themselves. And so a group at Monash University in Melbourne have looked at local pod of dolphins in Port Phillip bay just outside of the City of Melbourne and measured the mercury levels of apparently healthy dolphins swimming around in the bay and compared their levels with the dolphins who have beached themselves and subsequently died and have found that the beached dolphins have average mercury levels over twice that of the healthy dolphins.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nIs that throughout their body or are there any particular hotspots, like the brain for example, is this sort of a neurological effect?\n\nInterviewee - James Mitchell Crow\n\nYes, the levels detected would definitely have neurological effect which would likely induce confusion and disorientation. So could potentially be directly leading them to beach themselves.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo this is a, sort of, dolphin equivalent of the Mad Hatter syndrome.\n\nInterviewee - James Mitchell Crow\n\nYeah, that's right, in the particular area that these guys have been researching in Port Phillip Bay there's lot of dredging work going on at the moment in the port which is sort of stirring up the sediment and potentially increasing the mercury levels in the water. The team suggests that the likely source of the mercury was the historical gold mines dotted throughout Victoria which have gradually washed down the rivers and ended up in the bay, in the sediment and eventually through the fishes that dolphins eat, accumulate in the dolphins. The teams are going to go on and look at historical mercury levels and try and establish whether this is an increasing problem. So then the next step that these guys are going to take is to, take teeth from dolphin samples in museums and check the mercury levels there. The other benefit of using teeth is that you know exactly how old the dolphin is, so you can determine how much mercury is accumulated over its lifetime, to try and establish whether the mercury levels are increasing.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nWell let's hope it will, thanks James.\n\n(19:40 -- Malcolm Forbes, chemistry professor from the University of North Carolina, explains how chemical techniques are helping create the perfect pint)\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nNow as you put it to me almost every scientist likes beer, which is partly why you became interested in studying it and how sunlight can affect the way it tastes. Here's Malcolm Forbes.\n\nInterviewee - Malcolm Forbes\n\nI have a special technique I have developed in my lab called Time Resolved Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and it looks at fast photochemical reactions on the sub microsecond time scale that allows you to look at the structure of a free radical and the (UNCLEAR 20:06) structure looked at its reactivity, may be some of its molecular dynamics.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd what do you think is going on when beer changes flavour in this way?\n\nInterviewee - Malcolm Forbes\n\nWell, what we believe happens is the hop compound, these are called the isohumulones these are the compounds that give beer its bitter flavour. They absorb light and once they absorb light they are in a very high energy state and they break apart and they break apart into something called free radicals, which people have heard of in the cosmetics industry that are responsible for wrinkles, for example in aging free radicals play a big part of the aging process, but these radicals in beer are trapped almost immediately by sulphur sources in the beer and they make compounds called thiols and thiols are extremely stinky compound; they are found in skunks; found in cat urine and that are almost anything that smells really bad has thiols in it and humans are very sensitive to these smells. So we wanted to find out what radical exactly were being trapped by these sulphur compounds and were creating bad smells.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd so what did you do?\n\nInterviewee - Malcolm Forbes\n\nWell, Denis my collaborator at the University of Ghent sent us different types of hop compounds, some of them were of the natural variety, some that were chemically modified a little bit, the brewing industry uses to combat this problem and we put them in our spectrometer, we shined Ultraviolet light laser pulses on them and created free radicals and trapped these signals in real time and we determined their structure and we are able to say, Yes, indeed hop compounds produce free radicals and these are the radicals that are formed and this leads directly to an understanding of the mechanism, the formation of skunky beer.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo now you know this, are we, and this is the million dollar question, are we any closer to being able to stop it so that we don't have to put up with nasty smelling and nasty tasting beer?\n\nInterviewee - Malcolm Forbes\n\nYes, and I think that the answer is a natural additives to beer that can absorb the light before it reaches the hop compounds, so what you need is a compound that will have a very easy way to absorb the light and then dissipate the energy in some other way than giving it to the hop compounds and there are such additives, these are heavily guarded trade secrets in the brewing industry and the company that funded this research, The Interbrew-Baillet Latour Foundation and they are sponsored by Interbrew and they actually benefit from this because now there are beers that are sold in Beer bottles and they are not as light sensitive as other beers since they have a much longer shelf life and they don't get the bad smell when they open the beer and will last for a much longer time.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo this is almost like sun cream for beer, isn't it?\n\nInterviewee - Malcolm Forbes\n\nYeah!\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nDo you see the same chemistry happening in other things, not just beer? There must be other things like the way like the way the hops are behaving in other foodstuff which is also going to make things taste bad.\n\nInterviewee - Malcolm Forbes\n\nYes in fact anytime you have a natural foodstuff with sources of sulphur or usually amino acids like cysteine and so whenever you have a compound that makes free radicals in the sun and it is near these natural products that contain cysteine you are likely to get these thiols and I would say that almost any natural foodstuff that is left out in the sun, if the light doesn't get it, certainly oxygen will and free radicals are always responsible for the degradation and it's bad taste. There are pharmaceuticals that get bad in the sun very quickly, that's why people tell you not to keep your medications out in the sun or not to expose it to too much light because it will degrade very quickly.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nProfessor Malcolm Forbes who is from the University of North Carolina.\n\n(23:36 -- A live experiment in beer chemistry in the Chemistry World garden, and can you answer our Olympic-themed chemical conundrum?)\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nRight well we've come outside now partly because it is pretty unusual in this country to have a summer's evening where it's nice enough where we can get outside, but also to test out some of Malcolm's science for ourselves and also to have a major session by the look of it, because Victoria you've covered my table with beer bottles. So what are we going to do?\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nIt's all I promise you in the name of chemistry and we are doing an experiment in beer photochemistry. We have two bottles on the table at the moment, of beer encased in colourless glass and that's important because we've taken one of those bottles and left it on a sunny window sill for 12 hours of sunshine and the other one we have kept in this packaging and put it in the fridge. So we've one beer exposed to light and one not.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd for our Australian listeners I should reassure you this is nice warm beer at room temperature.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nHey, it has been under my desk all day, so it's at perfect room temperature. So we are going to see if Rich can tell the difference between the beer that's been exposed to sunlight and hopefully there has been some interesting photochemistry affecting its flavour and the beer that's been lovingly refrigerated.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo we are going to ask Richard to taste this. Let us pour Richard a beer, save some for me..\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nOkay, so this is beer #1.\n\n(Sound of beer being poured into the glass)\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nI can see you've worked in a pub Vic! Can we have some beer with his head, please?\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nYeah, we'll just wait for that, it will shrink a little bit.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nWe could be waiting for sometime. Should we pour the other one out of it now?\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nYeah!\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nJust well that one settles the five feet of head it now has..\n\n(Sound of beer being poured into the glass)\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nThat's a bit better, okay so Richard doesn't know which one is which.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nRight, that's right I hope, Okay so, we will try you on this one first. This is beer B.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nOkay Richard, you're ready?\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nI'm ready.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nIt my taste awful. I don't know.\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nI don't know. Let's try it out anyway isn't it.\n\n(Sound of Richard sipping the beer)\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nIt's so difficult. I am so used to having it without the lime. It tastes a little odd. I will tell you which one is awful when I have tasted both.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nSo beer A, and it's now finally settled so you can have the one you are supposed to have first, second.\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nRight here we go.\n\n(Sound of Richard sipping the beer)\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nI would have to say that the beer B the one I tasted first did taste a little weird compared to my normal culinary experience.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nJust to say, I did wash the glass before he tried. He has actually effectively got that right, because your beer B is one which you've got a big red \"do not drink\" sign on the bottle actually. So what's this all about?\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nSo, yes he's quite right. Beer B is the one that should taste weird and it's known as skunked because it has a compound in and that's lovingly referred to as skunky thiol. Now what's happened here is.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nNothing to do with cannabis.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\n(Laughs) Yeah. No, no, quite different. This is about alpha acids that are hop derived compounds that are in the beer and when light hits the beer, it starts a chemical reaction between the alpha acids and other molecules that would otherwise just remain in your beer and cause no harm to the beer's flavour. So, these photosensitive molecules that kick start these reactions are called flavins. Now these flavins when they are excited by light, they cleave off a side chain of these alpha acids, and then these side chains are quite reactive compounds, so they go on and react with sulphur sources in the beer to form what's called 3-methylbut-2-ene-1- thiol or MBT.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nThese are few to say.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\n(Laughs)Indeed. But it's a.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAlso after you've had a few.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nMore commonly referred to as skunky thiol. Now it's very chemically similar to the compounds that skunks emit when they are frightened. I've never actually smelled that in my life, but I'm told by Malcolm Forbes, professor of chemistry at the University of North Carolina that this skunky thiol is in fact the exact same compound that gives cat urine its distinctive aroma.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo could this be one when we say the beer tastes like piss. Actually there is a real chemical basis for saying that.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nYes. Exactly. That's chemically very accurate.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nThank you very much Vic. Well, there you have it; I'll drink the rest of the one that isn't the marked with the red \"do not drink\" sign in a minute. Talking about asking people things. We got a chemical conundrum from last month Richard.\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nYeah. Last month you remember we offered you our set of exclusive RSC visual elements trumps for anyone who could answer the following question, if you had a standoff between hydrogen, carbon and chlorine which one has the first ionization energy?\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nAnd the answer we were looking for is hydrogen. Congratulations to our six winners. William O'Donnell, Christine Monsell, Nick Laken, Ali Akbar, Victoria Black, and Peter Wesen.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAward to all of you. What about next month, Richard?\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nWell of course we're looking forward the Olympics this month. So we have a chemistry angle on this fantastic sporting event in Beijing.

We've got.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSome skunk. Skunky beer!\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nNo we're not giving away beer. We just don't have the postal allowance to be able to wrap it up and post it, but yeah we have five exclusive signed copies of John Emsley's new book Molecules of Murder, which is being published by the RSC this month.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd most people would kill to get to their hands on a copy of that that has to be said. John Emsley is a brilliant writer. Okay well that's it for this month's Chemistry World podcast. We'll be back at next month with another fun instalment of what's happening in the world of chemistry.

{"text":"Manufacturing and\/or Defining Life\n\nThe Associated Press reports on the latest struggle for scientists: defining life. The story states,\n\nIn suburban Washington this summer, prominent\nscientists at the J. Craig Venter Institute, who were key players in\nmapping the human genome, switched DNA from one bacterium into another,\nchanging its genetic identity. That put the world on notice that man's\nability to manipulate life is dancing around the point of creation.\n\nNow Venter is asking for a patent for a\ncompletely new bacteria that would be created by inserting genes into a\nhollowed-out cell of what once was a urinary tract bug. Venter doesn't\nview that as creating life, just \"modifying life to come up with new\nlife forms.\" At least half a dozen other research teams\naround the world are going farther, trying to create life out of\nchemicals, mimicking the beginnings of life on Earth. They're somewhere\nfrom three to 10 years from success, they figure.\n\nFor them, and Venter, new man-made life forms\nmean new energy sources, environmental clean-up mechanisms and\nlife-saving medicines. For others, such a breakthrough would mean\nunderstanding how life began on Earth by trying to recreate it. . . .\n\nMany scientists familiar with these challenges of defining life say the answers won't be easy to find. \"It's an important but ultimately frustrating\nquestion if one expects to come up with a nice clean shiny answer; it\nain't going to happen,\" said Francis Collins, a prominent Christian\nscientist and director of the National Human Genome Research Institute.\n\nThat talk about life is going to get\nuncomfortable as dreams of creation, from Frankenstein's monster on,\nget closer to reality, said University of Pennsylvania bioethicist Art\nCaplan. \"This issue of 'what is life' has been at the\ncore of biology for about 400 years,\" Caplan said. He said it leads to\nthe more theological questions about whether life is special and\nwhether we are special. Later this century, the definition of life will\nbe at the heart of a political and societal debate as heated and\ndivisive as abortion and embryonic stem cell research, Caplan predicts.\n\nLook for changes in religion, too.\n\n\"As knowledge has (been) added, religions have\nadapted,\" Venter said. \"I don't see why this is any different. We're\npushing the frontiers of knowledge, understanding life on this planet.\" Venter dismisses suggestions that scientists are\nplaying God as media sensationalism. And Collins, a scientist who talks\nat length about his faith, said he finds it interesting that the people\nwho most often use the phrase \"playing God\" usually don't believe in\nGod.\n\n\"Playing God\" is a secular, not religious, term,\nsaid Ted Peters, a professor at the Graduate Theological Union in\nBerkeley, Calif., and author of the book \"Playing God.\" He said people\nwho worry about that are really talking about tinkering with nature. \"What Craig Venter is doing is an extremely\ncomplicated form of animal breeding,\" Peters said. \"We're going to be\nchanging the face of the planet no matter what.

Ben Mitchell, a bioethicist connected with\nTrinity University, an evangelical Christian college in Illinois,\nworries about entrusting such monumental developments with scientists. \"Human history is enough; it is sufficient to\nremind us of the problem of hubris,\" Mitchell said. \"It is at least a\ncautionary note, to caution us to be aware of unintended consequences.\". . . ."}

But the 800-mile-wide, very far-out member of the sun's family announced last week suggests that even bigger worlds may be hiding in the solar system's exurbs. Caltech astronomers Michael Brown and Chad Trujillo call their find Quaoar (pronounced KWA-o-are), after a god of Los Angeles-area Indians. They spotted it in June with a wide-angle telescope on California's Mount Palomar and confirmed its size\u2013about half that of Pluto\u2013with the Hubble Space Telescope. The frozen orb follows a circular orbit almost 4 billion miles from the sun\u2013nearly 30 percent farther than Pluto. It's in the Kuiper Belt, a swarm of millions of icy bodies that was found in the past 10 years. Most are small, but astronomers have identified some that approach Quaoar's size\u2013and there could be others as big as Pluto, now considered the largest Kuiper object. \"What we once thought was the outer edge of the solar system is just the door to a whole new section,\" Brown says. \u2013 Charles W. Petit\n\nMARINE BIOLOGY Pretty teeth, dear\n\nThe pink, foot-long marine bloodworm Glycera dibranchiata bears no resemblance to Jaws, the James Bond villain-until you get to its four tiny teeth. Just as Jaws had teeth of steel, the worm appears to toughen its chompers by adding a touch of copper to the tip. It's the first organism known to strengthen a body part with copper, researchers say in last week's Science. Calcium or silicon are more common constituents of the minerals in tooth and bone, says Helga Lichtenegger of the University of California-Santa Barbara. She speculates that the copper may have a second role, because the metal can catalyze chemical reactions. The worms are predators with a poisonous bite, and the copper might activate the venom as it passes through the sharp, syringelike teeth and into prey. - Nell Boyce\n\nFORENSIC SCIENCE\n\nLess than truthful\n\nA panel of leading scientists says that instead of catching spies, polygraph exams keep honest folks out of sensitive jobs. Tens of thousands of employees at federal agencies annually face the scientifically unproven exams to determine whether they are security risks. While bad guys may learn to fool the machines-which measure respiration, blood pressure, and pulse-factors such as stress and exertion can cause good guys to fail. The report, from the National Research Council, does see promise in future lie-detection schemes based on such technologies as functional MRI, which maps brain activity.\n\nThe FBI and CIA, both major polygraph users, are reviewing the findings.

They then infected mice and tissue cultures with the modified viruses and tested several drugs against them.

It might also reassure critics of such work, who fear that bioterrorists could unleash the virus. - N.B."}

{"text":"Events on the world lines of two theoretical physicists, from the horizon to timelike infinity. A scientifically minded blog with varying amounts of entertainment, distractions, and every day trivialities.\n\nPages\n\nThursday, August 26, 2010\n\nYesterday, Stefan and I went to see the \"Body Worlds\" exhibition, which is currently in Offenbach, close to Frankfurt, Germany. Body Worlds is a traveling exhibition that displays human bodies and body parts that have been preserved using a technique called plastination. Basically, it works by removing all bodily fluids and fat from the tissue by washing it out with acetone, and then replacing these fluids with silicone. That is to say, the exhibits are not anatomic models but actually real. The method of plastination used for these purposes was invented by Gunther von Hagens, then at the University of Heidelberg. His work there likely was inspiration for the horror movie \"Anatomy,\" starring Franka Potente, which still causes me the occasional nightmare.\n\nThe exhibition itself was absolutely non-nightmarish. It had in fact a high educational value, and at least for me no yuck-factor. Besides that, it also had a missionary theme, that of documenting and explaining the process of aging and not only the complexity but also the fragility of the body. Besides many whole-body exhibits in fancy positions - dancing, playing saxophone, jumping over fences, during intercourse (must be 16 or older to see that) - they had all organs separately, some showing various illnesses and diseases (fatty liver, cancerous uterus, smoker's lung), as well as artificial joints. Some of the organs were cut into small slices or into half, so you could see inside. It is quite amazing really, to see all the muscles, bands, and nerves. Most stunning I found the capillary system that leaves behind the shape of the body after plastination (see picture to the left, more here).\n\nWhat I found somewhat annoying about the exhibition is that in all of the full body exhibits there were necessarily parts missing for better visibility (or possibly because they were just missing? Who knows what these people died from.) To begin with, most of the skin had been removed, but sometimes one or the other muscle, or this or that band. Unfortunately, there was nowhere to find a detailed explanation of what parts had been removed, so I was sometimes left wondering if there shouldn't be another muscle on that leg or another part on that spine or so. Also, I could have done without the photos of happy 100 year old men water skiing, proclaiming that happiness is the key to a long life. On the other hand I learned one or the other thing. For example, I wasn't aware the liver lies to closely below the diaphragm. And did you know that your testicles are doomed to shrink after you've passed your mid 40s? Or, more amusingly, that two centuries ago it was believed sperm is produced in the brain. Because, you see, that's were the soul is located and how could it be produced elsewhere. (Of course today we're more enlightened and know that the male soul sits in the testicles ;-).)\n\nThe bodies that are being used for plastination stem from people who donated them during their lifetime by signing the necessary forms. You can indeed donate your own body if you want to be conserved for educational means. Presently, there's more than 10,000 people who have signed up, and I suspect that most of them will not be used for exhibitions but rather for anatomy courses. On the other hand you might become famous post-mortem on Lady Gaga's stage. Apparently, the Lady has expressed interest in a decoration consisting of human bodies. In the exhibition guide, there's a selection of donors summarizing their motivations, which ranges from a love for science over some sort of immortality to admiration of von Hagens' work. The anonymity of the endproduct's origin I guess sorts out most narcissistic motivations. As to me, I'm signed up for organ donation, in various countries, and prefer to maximize my educational value during my lifetime.\n\nMonday, August 23, 2010\n\nIf you know one thing about quantum mechanics, it's Born's rule: The probability of a measurement is the square of the amplitudes of the wave-functions. It is the central axiom of quantum mechanics and what makes it quantum. If you have a superposition of states, the amplitudes are sums of these states. Taking the square to obtain the probability means you will not only get the square of each single amplitude - which would be the classical result - but you will get mixed terms. These mixed terms are what is responsible for the interference in the famous double-slit experiment and yield the well-known spectrum with multiple maxima rather than one reproducing the two slits, as you'd get were the particles classical. (Dr. Quantum shows you what I mean.)\n\nThe short summary is that they haven't found any deviation to a precision of one in a hundred. But their method is really neat and worth spending a paragraph on.\n\nThe experimental setup that the group has used is a tripe-slit through which pass single photons. If one computes the probability to measure a photon at a particular location on the detector screen in usual quantum mechanics, you square the sum of the wave-functions originating from each of the three slits. You get several mixed terms, but they are all second order in the wave-function. If Born's rule holds, this allows you to express the probability for the three-slit experiment as a sum of probabilities from leaving open only one of the slits and leaving open combinations of two slits. Thus, what the clever experimentalist do is a series of measurements leaving each single slit open, all combinations of two slits open, and leaving all three slits open, and see if the probabilities add up. And they do, to very good precision.\n\nSo, there's nothing groundbreaking to report here in terms of novel discoveries, but I very much like the direct test of the foundations of quantum mechanics this experiment constitutes. I think we could use more tests in this direction, and higher precision will come with time.\n\nFriday, August 20, 2010\n\nYou are not a Gadget - A Manifesto By Jaron Lanier Knopf (January 12, 2010)\n\nJaron Lanier is an interdisciplinary computer scientist who doesn't shy away from also crossing borders also to the arts. He could probably be described as a creative intellectual, is known for his work on virtual reality, less known for his music, and now he has written a book. More details on Lanier's bio are on his website.\n\nLanier is a man with opinions, and that's basically what his book is about: Despite it being called \"A Manifesto\" what it really is is a collection of opinion pieces. Lanier is a skeptic, and concerned about many developments in software and information technology and their impact on human societies. I am very sympathetic to the points he is trying to make. Unfortunately, he doesn't make them well.\n\nLanier for example bemoans the \"locked in\" effect in which a piece of software, despite far from being optimal or even being plain annoying, becomes so wide spread that at some point it is more or less impossible to replace or change it; it simply would be too much effort. That is of course true, but it is hardly a new problem of software in particular. The same problem has hindered and does hinder progress in many other aspects of our life. Take tax laws for example. A mess. You want to throw them out and start all over again from scratch. Yet, too much effort and resistance. In practice, you fiddle something here or something there. Or, even worse, take norms and standards. Surely it would be less annoying if the world could agree on one paper format or one standard for power outlets. But the effort for such a change would be enormous. That is not to say that Lanier isn't making a correct point. It is a good point and one that we should pay more attention to. It's just to say, he misses the larger societal context and complains about an ancient problem without offering any new insight about it.\n\n\"If you love a medium made of software, there's a danger that you will become entrapped in someone else's recent careless thoughts. Struggle against that.\"\n\nAnother large concern of his is that the present organization of the internet, the spread of easy-to-use templates as well as making money per advertisement hampers creativity.\n\nAbout the former point: it is of course true that the availability of default websites has decreased expressions of individual design. On the other hand, it's what allowed the vast majority of people to set up a website in the first place, and let me add that I know plenty of people with a PhD who insist they aren't able to understand html or css-style sheets. It's a matter of convenience. And in addition, it is actually a great relieve that one can generally at least open and read these unindividual websites. Lanier is concerned that making use of imperfect software will change your humanity to adapt to the software instead the other way round. I can't but have the impression that this concern is borne out of observing a specific community of people rather than the average person. In any case, the scientist in me hears the rethoric and waits for the evidence. Yet, there's no evidence to come in Lanier's book.\n\n\"Am I accusing all those hundreds of millions of users of social networking sites of reducing themselves in order to be able to use the services? Well, yes, I am.\"\n\nDon't people also \"reduce themselves\" by buying a mass-produced car that comes in one of 5 colors and the only option to customize it is put a sticker on the bumper? The vast majority of people on the planet neither has the interest not the skills nor the money to individualize every detail of their average life. The artist might find that sad, but that's reality.\n\nIn any case, the latter point is a crucial one of course. You know that I too have frequently warned about the side-effects that the now common way of financing online presentations via adverts has. People often claim the internet is democratic, then they claim this sort of financing per adverts is just capitalism in action. As a matter of fact the internet is neither democratic, nor is what you're seeing a sensible capitalistic system, simply because people are not payed for their work. They are instead being paid by accidental clicks on banners that pop up on the screens of visitors who might have been looking for something entirely different to begin with. It's a feedback mechanism that one has no reason to expect to lead to any outcome that's beneficial for our societies.\n\nAgain however, Lanier misses the larger context. He puts forward a concrete proposal for how to allow artists to earn from their work better than is the case today, basically some system of micro-payments. That is all well and nice, but only addresses part of the problem. The problem that frankly concerns me much more than whether Lanier's musical friends can make a living is that the present organization erodes one of the most essential foundations of democratic societies: journalism. This issue is only mentioned in Lanier's book in the passing at some point. More generally, it is well-known that some services, especially those that are essential to the foundations of our societies, are better offered as public services than as private services. For what I am concerned, the best solution is probably a mixture. I find it particularly disingenuous that Lanier then claims \"the only alternative [to some version of the proposal he is advocating] would be to establish some form of socialism.\"\n\nLanier also has a proposal for how to improve our financial systems that I don't feel competent to judge on. I can't but think that again he has missed the relevant point. The problem is not to come up with some proposal for improvement. Everybody I know seems to have some idea for how to improve our financial system. Just that most of them don't get their ideas printed in books. The problem is not coming up with an idea for improvement. No, the problem is that the present political and economic system has no instance for such proposals to be considered and be tested viable for reality and promising for improvement. The problem lies on a much deeper level.\n\nIt goes on like this. Lanier is a computer scientist, all right, and he clearly knows his field, but again and again he fails to put his proposals or arguments into the larger context and contrast them with the realities of politics and social dynamics. For example, he bemoans that the programming language LISP has fallen out of favor, though in his opinion it is essential to realize some of the proposals he is making. It strikes me similar to the complaint that we're not all speaking Esperanto.\n\n\"Wikipedia, for instance, works on what I call the Oracle illusion, in which knowledge of human authorship of a text is suppressed in order to give the text superhuman validity. Traditional holy books work in precisely the same way and present many of the same problems.\"\n\nHis criticism of the benefits of using the knowledge of large groups, though strongly expressed, remain superficial. In my opinion, he is throwing out the baby with the bathwater by not clearly explaining exactly what he is critical of and why, where the benefits are and what the drawbacks are. It is not very insightful.\n\nTo make matters worse, the book is very incoherently written. It is subdivided in 12 Chapters, that contain vaguely related short subsections to various topics. Ironically, since Lanier is outspoken critical of the blogosphere, the whole thing reads more like a collection of blogposts than a book. I am sure that all these little pieces he is offering fit perfectly together in Lanier's intellectually creative mind, but I had a hard time seeing a line of thought. Somewhere he elaborates on a research project he is working on with a friend on the relation between olfactation and language. That's certainly interesting, but I can't avoid having the impression Lanier just wrote down whatever crossed his mind. The book finally ends unexpectedly, without even so much as an attempt at drawing a conclusion or summarizing the argument. There are pretty much no references in the book to back up his claims or to at least justify his concerns.\n\nThat is not to say though that the book is uninteresting. See, having spent the money to buy and the time to read it, I am inclined to find something of value in it now. Lanier touches on many important points, and I hope that the book makes people think. However, exactly because I think that the theme of Lanier's book is important, it is even more disappointing it is so badly argued.\n\nWhat keeps me up at night is the question whether mankind will be able to solve all the problems it is causing, and do so in a timely manner. The question whether, from here on, the suffering on Earth will increase and progress will turn into regress, or whether we will manage to find a sustainable balance. I am wondering how to stabilize our economies, and how to complement them with desperately needed global political institutions.\n\nWhat keeps me up at night is the question whether the gap between the rich and the poor will ever close, how to ameliorate hunger and disease, war and corruption. Whether climate change will increase the pressure on our political, social, and economic systems so much we'll be tumbling back into the middle ages and our children will speak with awe of the times when everybody had an iPod.\n\nWhen I follow these thoughts, I always end up at the same point, at the question whether humans will ever be able to organize their collective actions smartly enough to manage the effects their presence has on this planet, if we are able to make intelligent enough decisions in a world in which events are getting closer connected every day, or if some brainless slime mould will remain ahead of us. I worry if we will ever be able to make this step or if progress will stop here and now, forever being limited by our inability to grasp the dynamics of global social systems.\n\nWhat keeps me up at night is the question what I can do to help alleviate unnecessary suffering. Not much ever comes to mind - What is a PhD in physics really good for? - except possibly write about it, talk about it. If you open a newspaper, look beyond the stories. Everybody has an opinion on everything and you'll disagree with many of them, but that's not the relevant layer to look at. What's relevant is that it doesn't matter what all these opinions are, as long as there's no way to intelligently use them. It's all talk and no action. It's all well-meant, but no outcome. It's all rhetorics, but no conclusion. It's all, still, trial and error till one day we'll make an error we won't be able to fix.\n\nThat's what keeps me up at night. And then there's Stefan's snoring.\n\nWhat I do in these sleepless moments is to focus on the problems that I understand well. Why is the cosmological constant so small, yet nonzero? Does the universe have the same laws of nature everywhere? What is space and time? Questions to which I'm sure there is an answer, and though I'm unlikely to find one, nobody will die and nobody will suffer if I wake up in the morning and still don't know why the neutrino masses are so small.\n\nAnd next time we'll talk about these questions that let me sleep at night.\n\nSaturday, August 14, 2010\n\n\n\nBlack Swan Rising By Lee Carroll\n\n\n\nThe Ice Cream Girls By Dorothy Koomson\n\nA well-written and well-told story about two girls who in their teenage years were charged for murdering one of their teachers. The story is told when they are in their mid 30s, at which time one of them is being released from prison while the other one is fighting psychological problems and trying to save her marriage. This line of the story is interrupted with the events back when they were teenagers. The characters are well-developed and the plot is interesting. Only shortcoming is that the ending is entirely obvious all the time, simply due to lack of characters introduced.\n\nThe Time Traveler's Wife By Audrey Niffenegger\n\nA lovely, yet incredibly sad story about a man who involuntarily jumps through time. It is written partially from his point of view and partly from his wife's. It is the one and only time-travel story that I can recall having read that stayed truthful to its own logic. I didn't see the movie, but the book is well-written and definitely worth reading.\n\nThanks For the Memories By Cecelia Ahern\n\nIs an incredibly dumb, annoying and foreseeable story about a women who receives somebody else's memories with a blood transfusion. Obviously the guy whose memories she now has is nice, good-looking and single. Guess what happens. Don't waste your money on that.\n\nThursday, August 12, 2010Tuesday, August 10, 2010\n\nSome months back, I summarized for you a paper that I wrote last year about a model called \"Deformed Special Relativity\" (DSR) with an energy-dependent yet observer-independent speed of light. In my paper, I essentially constructed a scenario that allows one to conclude these models are in conflict with observations to very high precision. Since then, several of you have been asking what happened after that, so here's a brief update.\n\nA short version of my paper was published in PRL, and was mentioned in Science. As you can guess, this made some people quite unhappy. After all, the version of DSR I argued to be ruled out to high precision due to incompatibility with well-confirmed physics of the standard model is the one that's been claimed for a decade to allow a first glimpse on quantum gravitational effects. Frankly, I'm not even happy myself the model doesn't work because I'd very much prefer would we be able to observe something and connect our research to experiment.\n\nSince my paper was published, Giovanni Amelio-Camelia and Lee Smolin, who have both worked on DSR, put out a few papers attempting to find a flaw in my argument. You find these papers here, here and here. My replies to these papers are also on the arxiv, you find them here, here and, the most recent one from today, here. In a nutshell, Amelino-Camelia et al's argument is just wrong due to a mistake in the re-calculation of the constraint. Smolin's two papers are more interesting in that he's doing the smart thing: trying to find an assumption I've made that can be replaced or shown to be not fulfilled to find a way DSR might work. One has to give it to him, he is actually amazingly creative. So far however, neither of his arguments has worked, though they gave me something to think about I hadn't considered in my original paper. Note also that Smolin has meanwhile updated his paper from April, while I haven't come around to update my reply yet, so don't get confused.\n\nIn any case, I'm afraid this won't be the end of the story. I'm admittedly quite tired of the whole issue since I have nothing really to win here. I'm either wrong, then I'm wrong, or I'm right, then I'm wasting my time arguing about a model that's wrong. Anyway, if you have any questions about this discussion, that's the place to ask.\n\nFriday, August 06, 2010\n\nA month ago, Tommaso Dorigo wrote a blogpost Rumors about a light Higgs. I usually just ignore such blogposts. That day, I was in a particularly foul mood and bothered to leave a comment that expressed very clearly my disapproval of such rumor spreading. (You'll find it in the comment section to Tommaso's post, I'm the \"not verified B\".)\n\n\"One culprit here is the Web, which was invented to foster better communication among physicists in the first place, but has proved equally adept at spreading disinformation. But another, it seems to me, is the desire for some fundamental discovery about the nature of the universe \u2014 the yearning to wake up in a new world \u2014 and a growing feeling among astronomers and physicists that we are in fact creeping up on enormous changes with the advent of things like the Large Hadron Collider outside Geneva and the Kepler spacecraft.\"\n\nThe first physics rumor that I can recall hearing of was the discovery of the top quark. It is also one of the very few rumors I've heard that later actually got confirmed. It's not that I don't hear rumors about some alleged signal in some experiment. I certainly find this interesting and thought-stimulating. I think it's quite natural that one talks about this with colleagues, and discusses the probability of it being confirmed and wonders about the implications. But I don't publicly distribute these stories. Nowadays, sooner or later, I'll find that rumor on some blog and then possibly even in a newspaper. Sometimes, by the time I read about it, I already know the rumor wasn't confirmed.\n\nWell, Tommaso's rumor wasn't confirmed either. But the question that stayed with me is whether rumors constitute a valid vehicle to get science across. I don't think so for the following reasons.\n\nFirst problem is that while it might draw interest in the short run, it erodes trust as well as interest in the long run. Science lives from accuracy more than any other field. The more often people read claims that something maybe was discovered, but then it wasn't, the less attention they'll pay if they read it again. Quantum gravity in cosmic rays! No wait, nothing to find there. Quantum gravity in gravitational wave interferometers! No wait, nothing to find there. Quantum gravity at the LHC. Well, let's see how that goes.\n\nSecond problem is one of principle. If rumors are considered a useful tool to draw attention, why not make up a few? It's easy enough, isn't it? Last week for example, I talked to a friend who was just visiting CERN. He doesn't want his name mentioned, but he told me...\n\nThird problem is that these rumors tend to circle around a few presently particularly popular topics or institutions, and if they dominate the news the vast majority of topics remains uncovered. Let's face it, most people on this planet still have no clue how a laser works and are confused by something called the particle-wave-duality. Their understanding of physics is stuck in the middle of the last century, if not some centuries earlier. There's plenty of physics that needs to be brought across more urgently than the latest rumor about dark matter detection. Yes, you might think that's dull. But you think it's dull because you're being fed constantly with the highly speculative, allegedly groundbreaking, maybe-discoveries. I myself would sometimes rather read a useful, popular, introduction about a not-quite-as-hot topic in a field I don't work on rather than quotations about the latest controversy.\n\nLast month, when I saw the July issue of Scientific American on Stefan's doorstep, I was thinking \"Oh, no.\" The headline read \"Is the Universe Leaking Energy?\" I was thinking, they probably picked some way-out random paper from the arXiv and are trying to proclaim that there's something fishy with energy conservation in General Relativity. Einstein was wrong! Stefan later said, he had exactly the same thought when he saw the headline. Reading the article however, I was pleasantly surprised: Tamara Davis has provided a well-written, insightful and entertaining explanation of, yes, just standard physics knowledge! She writes about symmetries and Noether's laws, conserved quantities, and about time-dependent backgrounds. She explains why there is no conflict between the seeming violation of energy and and accepted physical laws. It's textbook knowledge, yet it made it the title story. That's the sort of articles that we need more of.\n\nMonday, August 02, 2010\n\nOn a recent flight I was reading Jaron Lanier's book You Are Not a Gadget: A Manifesto. I got stuck somewhere in the middle and then dozed off watching Avatar. (Brilliant. Best movie I've seen for a long time, even on a tiny in-seat monitor.) This combination got me thinking about a common theme in both: collective intelligence. Lanier is a skeptic. He writes\n\n\"The intentions of the cybernetic totalist tribe are good. They are simply following a path that was blazed in earlier times by well-meaning Freudian and Marxists [...] A self-proclaimed materialist movement that attempts to base itself on science starts to look like a religion rather quickly [...] The Singularity and the noospehre, the idea that a collective consciousness emerges from all the users on the web, echo Marxist social determinism and Freud's calculus of perversion.\"\n\nAnd later, in a section \"Why It Matters,\" he writes \"Emphasizing the crowd means deemphasizing individual humans in the design of the society.\"\n\nI am very sympathetic to many points Lanier is making, but I dislike the \"Manifesto\"-style in which he's trying to lead his arguments. In any case, should I make it to the end of his book, I'll write a review. For now however, I want to focus on the topic of collective intelligence, for despite all the words Lanier is quite fuzzy on the use of terminology. I started wondering: What do people actually mean when they talk about collective intelligence? Are they really all talking about the same thing? I came to the conclusion that there's two different notions of collective intelligence, and I thought I'd amuse you with writing about a topic that I know pretty much nothing about.\n\nSetting the Stage\n\nFirst, let us be clear on what we're talking about: A collective or a group or a crowd will in the following simply be a set with elements. The elements of that set operate on input and create output. I will refer to the input and output likewise as \"knowledge.\"\n\nI further do not actually want to talk about the \"intelligence\" of a collective in the common sense for two reasons. One is that a collective can be intelligent one day and stupid the next day. I'd rather focus on one particular process the collective makes instead of assigning a qualifier to it as a whole. A process could be a decision as well as a direct action. Second reason is that using the term intelligent isn't useful without defining it. Thus, I would instead like to talk about collective processes that are beneficial for the collective. That's basically because I don't think measures like the IQ are particularly meaningful to assess intelligence since they also test for knowledge. Sure, the both are in humans correlated with each other because both draw upon the functionality of the same brain, but in principle it's different things: The one, knowledge, is the input a system has to work with, the other one, intelligence, is the procedure by which the input is processed. Clearly, to make good decisions both is needed. That's true for individuals as much as for groups. Consequently, to make beneficial decisions the collective needs to be well-informed as well as have a good way to process that information. Googeling doesn't make you more intelligent. It gives you more information.\n\nThus, what I will mean in the following with \"collective intelligence\" is the ability of a set of elements operating on some input to perform processes that are beneficial for the collective. Note that you'll have to define what your set is before you can make any statements. I know, it sounds pretty abstract, but it will be useful in its generality for the following.\n\nCollective Intelligence Type I\n\nThe first sort of collective intelligence is simply the gain in knowledge that you can get when you bring many elements of your set together. If every element brings some knowledge, you've now trivially more knowledge together. But that isn't the interesting aspect. The interesting aspect is that you can give the elements of your set the possibility to operate on each other's output, which means that you can create more knowledge than you could have done had they be disconnected.\n\nThere's many examples for this sort of collective knowledge. It's what you count on if you bring smart people together and let them talk to each other. They'll exchange ideas, they will build on each others' conclusions, and that way they can produce something genuinely new, say, a groundbreaking paper. I'll count that as a process that's beneficial for the collective. (A recent meeting of this sort is this one, report unfortunately in German.) It is this sort of collective intelligence that has become vastly easier to make use of with the internet, web2.0 and other advances of information technology. It is much easier today than it was two decades ago to give people with shared interests a platform to exchange their ideas.\n\nNote that I carefully wrote that you can get a gain of knowledge by better connectivity. It is however not a given. Just providing a possibility to share knowledge is not necessarily a way to arrive at a good decision, conclusion, or even useful creation of knowledge. Under certain circumstances, too much sharing of knowledge actually dumbs down a group because it reduces heterogeneity. Besides, human cognitive processes are messy and affected by all sorts of biases. As a consequence, the benefit of sharing knowledge depends on how the knowledge is shared, for example because judgement about the truth-value of a piece of knowledge is often dependent on the source it came from. These are some pitfalls that Surowiecki pointed out in his book The Wisdom of Crowds (read my review here). To exploit the additional knowledge gain you get from connecting groups of people you thus have to do some research about the effects and side-effects of social interactions.\n\nYou, and you, and you and I, we are some sort of collective and we exchange knowledge. If you give me a piece of information that's useful for my work or if you learn something from me, it's beneficial and I would argue we're thus part of an collective intelligence in that sense. Clearly, the internet has opened a vast potential for this. There's all sorts of unused possibilities in connecting billions of people online which we have only begin to explore. However promising, this sort of collective intelligence is at the same time of a very trivial sort. We're not actually doing anything new here. People have talked to each other and exchanged ideas as long as humans have wondered how to best skin a bear. The difference is just that now we're connecting more people faster and easier.\n\nA mathematical example for this sort of collective intelligence is a group with some basis elements and operators acting on them to create the full group. The basis elements are in this case the knowledge you start with. The operators are the collective. If you only allow each operator to repeatedly act on the same element (his own \"knowledge\") you'll generate only a small part of what you'll generate if you allow all operators to act on all elements (use all knowledge).\n\nCollective Intelligence Type II\n\nThe first type of collective intelligence is common and readily found in human groups, but in my opinion actually not the interesting type. The interesting type of collective intelligence is one in which knowledge is created by the collective as a whole and not by any of its elements. An example for that is your brain. Your brain is some sort of collective. It consists of neurons that process input and create output. Yet the thought processes that allow you to make conclusions are circuits in your brain that are not assigned to any specific neuron. The steps of your decision can not be broken down to processes on the elements simply because they don't exist on that level. Your intelligence is a truly emergent feature. It doesn't make sense on the level of a neutron.\n\nNote how very different this is to the first example of bringing together elements that create knowledge individually. The first type of collective intelligence is very common among human groups, the latter isn't. Wikipedia is an example of the first sort of (trivial) collective intelligence: It thrives from adding up the knowledge of many individuals. It doesn't actually collectively create anything truly new. The same is the case for crowdsourcing: Posing a problem to a large group of people allows you to use all their knowledge as well as their intelligence. Yet you're not creating anything that wasn't previously there already.\n\nA simple example of actual collective intelligence of type II is the starting point of Surowiecki's book. Have a group of people estimate something like the number of marbles in a jar or the weigh of an ox or something like that. Then take the average value. It will generally give a pretty good result, basically because individual errors average out. (This is an example that does not work well if you allow people to exchange their guesses in advance, it will skew the result. Recall above cautionary note about how to exploit collective wisdom.) What's new here is that one has added a process that was not previously there, a procedure to aggregate individual knowledge other than just adding it up. Note here that it's relevant to first define what you mean with the collective you're talking about before you decide what sort of intelligence you're dealing with. You could easily enough add Bob to your ox-estimating group and what Bob does is that he asks everybody for their guess and takes the average value. Now who is intelligent: Bob or the group? It would depend on whether you did count Bob with his input processing as being part of the group originally, so one has to be precise. Anyway, in this simple case one is just taking an average value, not a very sophisticated aggregation of knowledge, but there are less trivial cases.\n\nFor example our economic system, according to the standard general equilibrium theory, the well-known interplay of supply and demand that, ideally, results in pricing products in such a way that the economy runs maximally efficient. The equilibrium that one works towards is not something known by anybody participating in that system. The aggregation mechanism is a free market economy. Now one can debate how well that actually works and under which circumstances the model doesn't apply, but that's not really the point here. The point is that this \"invisible hand\" of optimization is a features that adds something truly new, some intelligence that is not present on the individual level.\n\nOther examples for human collectives are arguably political decision making processes. Again, one can debate how well these work and how beneficial the outcome really is, more research is clearly needed, but it suffices to say here that at least they work better than nothing at all. The thing is however that for human collectives you need some mechanism to bring back the insight gained from the aggregate to the individual level, either by communicating the result of a decision or directly by converting it into an action or recommendation. Just leaving it standing inaccessibly at the aggregate level isn't useful because actions are still made by the individuals.\n\nI want to add another example of human collectives here which is the academic system. In the academic system we do not have written down rules to aggregate knowledge, neither do we have a model for how it works. However, if you look at the history of science, we nevertheless de facto have some aggregation mechanism. It's not like there was ever a vote whether or not Coulomb's (wrong) magnetic field law should be kept in the textbooks, yet here we are without it. I think Smolin in his book The Trouble with Physics (read my review here) summarized it well:\n\n\"Science has succeeded because scientists comprise a community that is defined and maintained by adherence to a shared ethics.\"\n\nThe shared ethics Smolin is talking about is basically some sort of scientific method. Again one can debate whether Smolin's suggestion is the best way to set up the system, but that isn't the point here. He's right in that, written law or not, scientists have used some sort of ethics and that's what made the scientific community more than just a bunch of smart people. It has created a solid and growing body of knowledge that spreads though educational systems and is the driver of innovation. Note however that this sort of collective intelligence does not create a theory, it (ideally) merely singles out the ones to be kept.\n\nAnother example for this sort of collective intelligence outside the human realm is the DNA of the bacterium Escherichia Coli containing information in its topology and not only in its sequence. That's not some \"knowledge\" that any of the elements of the DNA string encodes - it can only be read off from the whole string. An example of the mathematical sort might be a manifold. Consider every point of the manifold the knowledge and parallel transport by some infinitesimal step the elements of your collective. If you only look at the local surrounding you'll never figure out additional information in the topology of the whole thing. You'll have to do something more for that, like looking for closed loops.\n\nLimitations\n\nClearly for me as a scientist the interesting question is what can collective intelligence do for scientific progress. I think we're doing well with the first type of collective intelligence. It is frequently used. The second type of intelligence is however one that does not exist for the creation of scientific knowledge and I am not sure it ever will.\n\nWhat would it mean, this collective intelligence of type 2 in science? Consider a large group of scientists, maybe thousands, working on a notoriously difficult problem, possibly for decades. They'll collect and publish many pieces of knowledge. Collective intelligence of type 2 would be an aggregation process not working on the individual level that finds a solution to this difficult problem from the pieces scientists have found. However, the aggregation process that commonly worked for this is an individual finding the right pieces and being able to draw the right conclusions, thus type 1 of collective intelligence. Remember what I said earlier, as long as our society is run by the actions of individuals you need some way to bring back collective knowledge to the individual level, otherwise it's useless. But what mechanism do we have for that in science other than a scientist?\n\nThere are some few cases in which indeed scientific conclusions have been drawn by aggregation of accumulated knowledge. For example finding relations between seemingly distinct (medical) topics from citation analysis. But these examples are rare and I'm not sure how far one can ever get with this. This then opens the following question: Can it happen that we will not be able to arrive at some insights simply due to the limitations of the human brain to recognize knowledge that is not present at the individual level? And what is the next step of evolution? Can we ever go beyond that?\n\nI've argued there's two types of collective intelligence: One in which bringing together elements of a group and connecting them creates output that was not possible to create without the connections. In this case however, the output is still created by the single elements, it's just that the connections allow more of it and thus making them can open unused potential. This is the trivial, type 1, sort of collective intelligence. The second, more interesting, sort of collective intelligence one has when the knowledge is not present at the individual level at all. It is contained on the collective level, and its production cannot be assigned to any element of the group in particular.\n\nFor what groups of humans are concerned, the first sort of collective intelligence is already well in use and with a better understanding of social dynamics and psychology we will be able to exploit more unused potential. For what the second type is concerned, I think one should rightfully be skeptic. It is questionable how much can be achieved by it, and unclear how it can be created or used. We're a long way from global collective intelligence like that connecting the lifeforms on Pandora.\n\nIn his book, Lanier offers the reader a list with suggestions for \"what each of us can do\" featuring the item \"Write a blog post that took weeks of reflection before you heard the inner voice that needed to come out.\" Well, I report that I've been reflecting on this for some weeks, though not continuously. After all, I have a job to do. My inner voices are typically busy with some other things than wanting to come out, like reminding me I should put the laundry into the dryer now. In any case, I hope it won't take you several weeks to read it ;-)"}

{"text":"Science and Society\n\nBig Myths of Everyday Science\n\n1 of 26\n\nThe myth: Food that you drop on the floor is OK to eat if you pick it up within five seconds (a.k.a. the \"Five Second Rule\"). The reality: Germs are on the floor, and if food lands on the germs, they will stick to the food immediately. This is especially true in the kitchen, where bacteria such as salmonella thrive. Seen here is a salmonella culture, so ask yourself: Do you want to eat that?Image Credit: AP Photo\/Elaine Thompson\n\nThe myth: Acids will burn your skin, and even disfigure you. The reality: Hundreds of different acids exist, and most of them aren't strong enough to damage your skin. Vinegar and citric acid are two weak acids that we consume frequently. However, some acids are corrosive. Hydrochloric, nitric and sulfuric acids can damage skin -- like that of the woman in this picture, who was burned by sulfuric acid from batteries -- but not all acids will do so.Image Credit: Paula Bronstein\/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: Brain cells don't regenerate. The reality: The reason people believe this myth is that scientists thought for a long time that complex brains would be disrupted by new cell growth. In 1998, however, scientists in Sweden and at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif., discovered that brain cells can regenerate. The learning and memory center of the brain can create new cells. Even better news is that Steve Stice, a University of Georgia stem cell researcher, discovered a process to create replicas of human embryonic stem cells that can morph into brain cells. Shown above are stem cells from a tank in his lab in Athens, Ga., Tuesday, March 13, 2007.Image Credit: AP Photo\/John Bazemore\n\nThe myth: A penny dropped from a tall building can kill someone on the ground. The reality: While people may think a penny dropped from the Empire State Building would pick up enough speed to kill a person on the ground, this just isn't true. The non-aerodynamic nature of a penny, as well as its relatively small mass, keeps this from happening. A person on the ground would most certainly feel a sting from the impact, but the penny wouldn't kill.Image Credit: Michel Porro\/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: Lightning doesn't strike the same place twice. The reality: Lightning can absolutely strike the same place twice. In fact, it's actually quite common -- the Empire State Building is struck by lightning about 25 times per year, for example. Lightning favors tall buildings and trees, but in a large field, lightning is likely to strike the tallest object several times before it moves sufficiently far away to find another tall target. Above, multiple bolts of lightning strike the ground in the desert north of Scottsdale, Ariz., during a late evening storm.Image Credit: AP Photo\/Scott Troyanos\n\nThe myth: There's no gravity in space. The reality: Yes, there is a lot of gravity in space. So much, in fact, that gravity is what causes stars to orbit the center of a galaxy, Earth to orbit the sun and a satellite to orbit the Earth. The reason that astronauts seem to be weightless in space is that they are orbiting Earth; they're falling towards it, but moving sufficiently sideways to miss it. In short, they're falling but never landing. At orbit height, about 250 miles (402 kilometers) above Earth, gravity is only reduced by 10 percent.Image Credit: NASA\/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: There is a dark side of the moon. The reality: The dark side of the moon only exists as a Pink Floyd album. The sun illuminates every part of the moon at some point. There is, however, a side of the moon that is never visible from Earth. This is caused by tidal locking, which causes the moon to take just as long to rotate around its own axis as it does to revolve around Earth. We always see the same side of the moon, but the other side isn't always dark -- when we have a crescent moon, sunlight mostly illuminates the side we don't see.Image Credit: Mike Hewitt\/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: Evolution means getting better, or going from \"lower\" to \"higher.\" The reality: Though natural selection weeds out less advantageous genes from the gene pool, imperfect organisms often survive. Mosses, fungi, sharks and crayfish, among others, have remained basically unchanged over long periods of time. Other species have changed a lot, and not always in ways that seem like obvious improvements. Evolving to be more \"fit\" doesn't necessarily mean a species makes \"progress\" -- it just means it is more likely to survive and reproduce in its environment.Image Credit: Dan Kitwood\/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: Humans explode in the vacuum of space. The reality: This comes from science fiction movies, not real life. Humans can survive brief encounters with empty space as long as they fully exhale beforehand. This keeps the lungs from bursting, which would send air into the bloodstream. Without oxygen, however, the person will pass into unconsciousness and die from asphyxiation. This is one reason why space suits are so important: They let us breathe in the vacuum of space.Image Credit: Buyenlarge\/Archive Photos\/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: Synthetic chemicals are dangerous. The reality: Many chemicals made in laboratories and factories are exactly the same as those found in nature, and very few synthetic products are as toxic as natural substances. Some natural chemicals are fatal. Cyanide is a natural substance, and it's fatal at a dose of 10,000 mcg. Botulism is natural, but a thimbleful could kill half the people in a city. Even common plants like poison oak and poison ivy are dangerous. On the other hand, the majority of prescription drugs are synthetic, and they've helped dramatically increase life expectancy.Image Credit: David McNew\/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: We only use 10 percent of our brains. The reality: If this is true, why is it that damaging almost any part of the brain inhibits some vital cognitive or regulatory function? Variations of this myth state that each of us only uses 10 or 20 percent of our dearest organ, but in fact, imaging technologies like fMRI reveal that we use most or all of our brains in one way or another. What is certainly true is that we all fall short of our maximum intellectual potential in the way we live our lives -- which is probably the metaphorical origin of this pseudo-factoid.Image Credit: Charles Hewitt\/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: Going out in chilly weather causes you to catch cold. The reality: A cold is caused by a viral infection of the respiratory system. Viruses don't magically appear in your body because you went out to get the mail without your scarf and mittens. Most of the time, we contract viruses when we come into close contact with other people who are already infected, which means you're putting yourself at greater risk for disease by staying inside by the fire with your friends and family than you would if you wandered off into the icy woods all alone.Image Credit: Rob Penn\/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: Studies show vaccines cause autism. The reality: There is no salient evidence linking childhood vaccines to autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This myth has a clearer origin than most: A 1998 paper in the respected medical journal The Lancet seemed to indicate that the common MMR vaccine could lead to the development of ASD. Not only was this study later retracted and denounced by the journal, but many characterized it as a work of outright scientific fraud, in which researchers had tampered with the data to fit the desired conclusions. Despite this retraction, many parents have remained wary of vaccines. While there's no conclusive proof that vaccines do not cause ASD, no significant research stands to show that it does.Image Credit: iStockphoto\/Thinkstock\n\nThe myth: Rubber tires protect a car from lightning. The reality: The tires have nothing to do with it. If you're unlucky enough to be caught out in a thunderstorm, it is certainly safer to be inside a car than outside. Cars provide fairly strong fortification against lightning strikes, but not for the reason you'd think. When lightning strikes an automobile, it's actually the car's metal exterior frame that protects the passengers, acting as a conductor and passing the electrical current right along to the ground. This is the reason that a convertible, no matter how rubber its tires are, can't protect you like a hardtop vehicle.Image Credit: AP Photo\/Marcio Jose Sanchez\n\nThe myth: Sugar makes children hyperactive. The reality: Let them eat cake! Researchers have found no substantial link between the consumption of sugar and hyperactivity. A meta-analysis published by the Journal of the American Medical Association found that over 16 qualified studies, researchers could identify no significant correlation between sugar intake and cognitive performance or behavior. Of course, there are plenty of well-established links between sugar intake and obesity (as well as other problems), so parents should still know when to take away the cotton candy.Image Credit: Paul Conrath\/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: The Big Bang theory explains how the universe was created or began to exist. The reality: The Big Bang theory extrapolates from our observations about the present universe that the early universe underwent a massive, rapid expansion that has continued to this day. Some people have interpreted the data to postulate that time, space, matter and energy had a beginning in the finite past, but the central value of the Big Bang theory is the explanation of the early expansion of the universe -- not how the universe came into being.Image Credit: Courtesy NASA\n\nThe myth: The Earth is closer to the sun in summer. The reality: It's just not. In fact, the exact opposite is true for people who live above the equator: The Earth is closest to the sun in January, which is a winter month in the Northern Hemisphere. Of course, for people in the Southern Hemisphere, January's the best time to hit the beach and enjoy a cool glass of lemonade in the afternoon. So what causes the seasons if not distance to the sun? It's the tilt of the Earth's axis. The Earth wobbles as it rotates. Thus, your summer months are the time when your part of the globe receives the most direct sunlight, and winter months are the time when the sun's rays reach you at an oblique angle. Image Credit: NASA\n\nThe myth: Albert Einstein flunked his math classes in school. The reality: Einstein, by all accounts, was always good at math. Other versions of this myth allege that Einstein was an all-around poor student. There's no evidence for this; in fact, remaining records indicate that the young Albert did very well in his classes and received high marks. It's a wonderful excuse for underachieving kids to feed their parents: \"Even Einstein got D's!\" Unfortunately, you can take no refuge in the idea of a slacker Einstein -- so study up.Image Credit: Central Press\/Stringer\/Hulton Archive\/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: Humans evolved from chimpanzees. The reality: You are not looking at your distant grandfather -- you're looking at your distant cousin. Humans and chimpanzees evolved from the same common ancestor. Human beings share at least 95 percent of their DNA with chimpanzees, and studies of comparative anatomy and comparative genetics can show us really how much our bodies have in common with those of our hairy relatives. The reason for the similarity is that we have a common ancestor; the reason for the difference is that our genetic paths diverged at some point in the past, and we evolved different characteristics in the intervening years.Image Credit: Gerry Ellis\/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: Antibiotics kill viruses. The reality: Antibiotics are wonderful little targeted poisons that help your body kill bacteria -- that's bacteria, not viruses. Furthermore, you can't exactly \"kill\" a virus at all, since a virus is not really alive to begin with. When a disgusting flu or cold sets in, we all wish we could take a pill to chase it away. Unfortunately, you can't battle the germs that cause cold and flu this way, and in many cases, taking antibiotics for a viral infection could make the problem worse. Stick to your doctor's advice and only take antibiotics when he or she specifically prescribes them.Image Credit: Courtesy Joe Raedle\/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: A full moon makes people go nuts. The reality: You're only especially liable to commit murders on a full moon if you're a werewolf. For centuries, nearly all cultures have ascribed mystical powers and otherworldly influence to the bright, round face of a full moon. In fact, the English words \"lunacy\" and \"lunatic\" come from the word \"lunar\" -- having to do with the moon. But despite the general consent of human mythology, this notion is not borne out by science, and multiple investigations have found no substantial link between the phases of the moon and murder, aggression, insanity, vandalism of national monuments, prank phone calls, or human sacrifice rituals.Image Credit: Getty Images\n\nThe myth: A penny placed on a railroad track can derail a train. The reality: Get real. Freight trains weigh many thousands of tons. This would be kind of like saying you could capsize a barge with a firecracker. The U.S. Federal Railroad Administration has no record of a coin wrecking a train, though larger obstructions like cars and rocks have caused deadly derailments, so locomotives are by no means invincible. And for that matter, neither are you -- while pennies don't derail trains, plenty of people have themselves been hit by trains or otherwise killed while trying to flatten pennies on railroad tracks. If you really want to smash a penny flat, take it to one of those machines in the gift shop. Image Credit: Roland Magunia\/AFP\/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: Bats are blind. The reality: Bats see just fine, thank you very much. Bats like Chiroderma villosum (shown above) have eyes, and their eyes work. It's as simple as that. So what's the origin of this myth? Like dogs, bats rely heavily on other senses like hearing and smell. In fact, using a hyper-advanced sound-based system called echolocation, bats are able to maintain their bearings while flying at night and to hunt nearly invisible prey in the dark. It may be the fact that these creatures are unfazed by darkness that has led people to assume their eyes are vestigial.Image Credit: Oxford Scientific\/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: The Coriolis effect is what determines the clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of water in a flushed toilet. The reality: Sadly, this is one of the rare instances in which Lisa Simpson gets the science wrong. In the sixth-season Simpsons episode \"Bart vs. Australia,\" Lisa educates her brother on the Coriolis effect, which she claims causes water to drain counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern. This is not really true. The Coriolis effect is the name for an inertial force that determines the trajectory of objects moving within a rotating frame of reference. For example, it helps us understand how the rotation of the Earth affects the movement of weather patterns. The amount of water in your toilet is too small to be affected by Coriolis.\nNow that you've seen our Big Myths of Everyday Science Pictures, check out our 10 Science Principles You See in Action Every Day.Image Credit: Courtesy China Photos\/Getty Images"}

Shamefully, perversions of biology, anthropology and psychology have at various times racially justified colonialism, slavery and disenfranchisement. Medicine's own intersections with concepts of race have tended to be horrible as well: the grotesque Nazi experiments and the notorious Tuskegee studies of syphilis spring to mind.\n\nLooking to change that awful record for the better is the drug BiDil, approved in 2005 to reduce the toll of congestive heart failure specifically among African-Americans. BiDil is not a product of research on the human genome, but researchers in the field of pharmacogenomics are combing our DNA for clues to new therapies--and better ways to match them to appropriate groups of patients. Because investigators will inevitably keep looking for correlations with racial groups, they will keep finding them. Thus, the era of race-based medicine dawns.\n\nIn \"gassing up with Hydrogen,\" Sunita Satyapal, John Petrovic and George Thomas write about the difficulties of storing hydrogen in automobiles to create a replacement for today's internal-combustion engines. Given the technical and economic challenges the authors describe, the targets they list for storage quantity and costs for 2010 and 2015 seem optimistic. But even if those targets are met, then what? For automobiles running on hydrogen fuel to replenish their supplies, several thousand fueling stations would have to be built at the cost of billions of dollars. Further, a new delivery infrastructure would have to be created to get hydrogen (or hydrogen precursors) to those stations.\n\nFinally, where is the hydrogen to come from? Today most hydrogen is obtained from natural gas in a process that releases carbon dioxide. Hydrogen can also be made by electrolyzing water, but it takes lots of electrical energy to break hydrogen-oxygen bonds. If that electricity is obtained by burning coal, more carbon dioxide will be produced.\n\nROAD DATA--\"Automobile accidents in the U.S. are now the subject of a large-scale investigation as if they were an epidemic--as they are. The Department of the Army, the American Medical Association and other major groups are studying many phases of the matter, from the design of tollbooths to the personality of truck drivers. Among other significant findings are that sedatives and tranquilizing drugs dull a driver's skill, and that the dangerous effects of an evening of drinking may last as long as 18 hours, regardless of coffee therapy.\"\n\nSTRESSING MICE--\"The tranquilizing drugs are definitely what is needed for crowded living--at least for mice. Two workers from the Johns Hopkins Medical School cooped up groups of mice in canisters and gave half the groups Miltown [an early antianxiety drug], and the other half nothing. Half an hour later, they injected all the groups with a lethal dose of amphetamine. At the end of the experiment the untranquilized mice were all dead and the tranquilized ones were not even breathing hard.\"\n\nQuantum cryptography has an uncrackable reputation [see \"Best-Kept Secrets\"; SciAm, January 2005]. A sender typically transmits a message encoded by polarized photons; anyone listening in would cause errors to appear in the reception, alerting the sender and receiver. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, however, show in the April 25 Physical Review A that quantum cryptography can be hacked, at least to a limited extent. They found a way to entangle the polarization of transmitted photons with the momentum of an eavesdropper's photon. By measuring the momentum, the eavesdropper could deduce the transmitted polarizations. Quantum users can breathe easy, though: the trick works for only 40 percent of the data and would not be practical, because the setup requires that the eavesdropper use the same photon detector as the receiver.\n\nLycopene, abundant especially in tomatoes, does not appear to prevent prostate cancer as once hoped (and hyped). Past studies had suggested that a diet rich in the antioxidant could protect against the disease, presumably because lycopene neutralizes free radicals, which are reactive molecules that can damage cells and DNA. In the latest study, a team led by researchers from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and the National Cancer Institute followed 28,000 men between the ages of 55 and 74. Lycopene and other antioxidants exerted no preventive effect, the scientists found. In fact, in a surprise, the team saw a positive correlation between one antioxidant, beta-carotene, and an aggressive form of prostate cancer. Look up the results in the May 2007 Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention.\n\nAfter hundreds of dogs and cats fell ill this past spring, government officials traced the source to melamine, a nitrogen-rich compound found in plastics and fertilizer that, when ingested by the animals, crystallized in their kidneys and caused renal failure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration later announced that producers may have deliberately added the compound to wheat gluten and rice protein concentrates to inflate the measured amount of protein. The greater the protein level in the concentrates, the higher the market price the products fetch. Regardless of whether its addition was deliberate or accidental, melamine snuck past standard industry protein analysis, suggesting that the century-old test methods should be reevaluated. Several alternatives exist, but the food industry has yet to make a switch.\n\nTraditionally, food protein is measured by a method developed by Danish brewer Johann Kjeldahl in the late 1800s. In this analytical technique, a strong acid digests a sample, breaking down the organic matter and releasing nitrogen, which is then converted to ammonia. The amount of ammonia indicates how much nitrogen was in the original sample and, hence, the amount of protein. This \"proved to be a robust, precise method,\" says Julian McClements, a food scientist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. It is attractive because it can be used for a variety of products and protein types. Another, similar nitrogen-based technique, called the Dumas test, is also popular with industry. It relies on burning the sample to release nitrogen. The Association of Analytical Communities (AOAC) International, a scientific association that sets standards for analytical methods, lists the Kjeldahl and Dumas techniques as the standard methods for measuring protein in food.\n\nLaboratory Letdowns; August 2007; Scientific American Magazine; by John Dudley Miller; 2 Page(s)\n\nDespite airtight double doors, disposable laboratory clothing, frequent decontamination and other precautions, accidental infections can happen at U.S. biological laboratories. Perhaps worse, though, is that accidents are going unreported. Although the U.S. has not confirmed any cases of sick scientists spreading their lab-derived infections to the public in the past 40 years, the case of the tuberculosis-carrying traveler Andrew Speaker shows that modern jet transportation could quickly spread deadly infections globally. Most important, the culture of nonreporting and lax enforcement of already weak incident-reporting regulations in the U.S. could make such secondary infections more likely. Indeed, some scientists believe they may have already occurred, as they have in other nations in which lab infections of smallpox, SARS, Marburg and H1N1 influenza viruses have spread to the general public.\n\nResearch institutions would rather not face the blame and bad publicity associated with accidents, remarks immunologist Gigi Kwik Gronvall, a senior associate at the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Biosecurity. Instead many opt to hide their mistakes and hope that federal regulators do not find out.\n\nA Return on Redwoods; August 2007; Scientific American Magazine; by Mark Fischetti; 3 Page(s)\n\nFor years, special-interest groups have raised money to buy and rope off wild lands to protect them. But in June a unique partnership announced it had purchased 50,635 acres of northern California redwood forest and would preserve the land by operating it as a nonprofit business. The acquisition was funded entirely by private capital. The lead group, the Redwood Forest Foundation, Inc. (RFFI), in Gualala, Calif., claims the deal creates the first nonprofit working forest in the country and could be a model for safeguarding other natural resources.\n\n\"It's always difficult to get the first transaction done,\" says Don Kemp, executive director of RFFI and architect of the arrangement. \"I'm hoping this one will be a catalyst for others.\"\n\nOn the Rebound; August 2007; Scientific American Magazine; by Linda Baker; 1 Page(s)\n\nEconomics 101 states that if prices decline, consumption will increase. Now economists are applying this law of demand to policies intended to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming. The result is called the rebound effect, and it takes place when higher consumption undercuts the energy savings produced by a given technology. For example, a household that saves energy and money by installing better insulation may then decide it can afford to raise the thermostat during the winter. \"If you invoke a program or policy that lowers the cost, people do more of that thing,\" remarks Richard Newell, an energy and environmental economist at Duke University.\n\nAlthough most experts accept the existence of the rebound effect, the debate continues over its magnitude. Two recent studies reveal different quantitative results but also point to a consensus regarding the best way to adjust for the human tendency to use more when costs are less. In the context of climate change, the superior instrument appears to be a tax on carbon emissions.\n\nA chance to peek into the future--at least one possible future--is always a tempting fantasy. But if it were offered in reality, would you take it? And if you didn't like what you saw, how hard would you try to change it? After almost 20 years spent reading, mapping and analyzing human DNA, researchers at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) believe that personal genetic information is nearly ready for use by consumers in managing their health, so the institute is launching a large-scale study to gauge whether consumers are ready for the information.\n\nThe year-long Multiplex Initiative will ultimately involve thousands of subjects, who will be offered a personal genetic report card based on screening for gene variations associated with increased risk for major diseases. The investigators are interested in how many take up the offer, why, and how participants respond to their results. The researchers also hope to gain insights into the best ways for health professionals to communicate information about genetic risk.\n\nThe neutrino is the oddball of particle physics. It has no charge and rarely interacts with other particles, but it comes in three flavors--electron, muon and tau--and madly oscillates from one flavor to the next as it travels along. For the past five years, researchers at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill., have been firing beams of muon neutrinos at the MiniBooNE detector, a huge spherical tank filled with 800 tons of mineral oil, to see how many of the particles changed in flight to electron neutrinos. The first results, announced in April, mostly vindicated the Standard Model--the conventional theory of particle physics--but an unexplained anomaly in the data leaves open a more exotic possibility. Some scientists speculate that the cause of the anomaly is a new kind of neutrino that can take shortcuts through the extra dimensions predicted by string theory.\n\nThe impetus behind MiniBooNE was to follow up a previous experiment, conducted at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the 1990s, which had shown evidence for a fourth type of neutrino. Called the sterile neutrino, this putative particle would be even more elusive than the three ordinary flavors because it would not be subject to the weak nuclear force as the other particles are but would interact only through gravity. Because the existence of sterile neutrinos would challenge the Standard Model, researchers were eager to run a similar experiment to confirm or refute the findings. The results from MiniBooNE, however, were a mixed bag. For neutrinos with energies ranging from 475 million to three billion electron volts, the number of flavor oscillations nicely matched the Standard Model predictions, but at lower energies investigators found a significant excess of electron neutrinos.\n\nPlaying It by Ear; August 2007; Scientific American Magazine; by Tim Hornyak; 1 Page(s)\n\nPrince Shotoku was a seventh-century politician attributed with authorship of Japan's first constitution. Famed as a nation builder, he is said to have been able to listen to many people simultaneously, hearing the petitions of up to 10 supplicants at once and then handing down judgments or advice.\n\nInspired by the legendary prince, Japanese researchers have spent five years developing a humanoid robot system that can understand and respond to simultaneous speakers. They posit a restaurant scenario in which the robot is a waiter. When three people stand before the robot and simultaneously order pork cutlet meals or French dinners, the robot understands at about 70 percent comprehension, responding by repeating each order and giving the total price. This process takes less than two seconds and, crucially, requires no prior voice training.\n\nAdults may resist scientific facts because of childhood experiences. Yale University psychologists note that before children can even speak, they develop common-sense assumptions about the physical world that can persist into adulthood and clash with scientific discoveries. For instance, because objects fall down if not held up, kids may have trouble accepting the world is round, reasoning that things on the other side should naturally fall off. Intuitive notions concerning psychology also lead children to see everything as designed for some reason--for example, a cloud's purpose might be to rain--which can lead to opposition to evolution. In reporting their work in the May 18 Science, the researchers also note that when both adults and kids obtain knowledge from others, they judge claims based on how much they trust the source of an assertion. It suggests that science will meet exaggerated resistance in societies where alternative views are championed by trustworthy authorities, such as political or religious figures.\n\nA long-standing mystery of photosynthesis is how the process converts sunlight with nearly 100 percent efficiency to chemical energy. The key may be quantum coherence, the same phenomenon that makes lasers and superconductors work. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, investigated purple bacteria, where an ensemble of pigments and proteins absorbs light and channels its energy into chemicals. Components of this complex oscillate after they get excited with light, and these excitations are kept synchronized by specific vibrations of the protein connecting these components, like well-timed pushes on a swing to keep it in motion. This coherence makes the ensemble act together as a \"supermolecule\" of sorts, rapidly settling on the most efficient energy pathway. The research, in the June 8 Science, could improve designs for solar cells and other synthetic light-harvesting devices.\n\nSciAm Perspectives: Worse Than Gasoline; August 2007; Scientific American Magazine; by the Editors; 1 Page(s)\n\nLawmakers of both parties are proposing amendments to the so-called energy independence bill that would massively subsidize the coal industry to produce liquid coal as a replacement for foreign oil. (The admirable original bill is designed to increase fuel efficiency in cars and light trucks, encourage production of biofuels, and provide funds to develop technology that will capture carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.)\n\nSenator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, opposed big subsidies for coal-based fuels until mid-June, when he moved to offer up to $10 billion in loans for coal-to-liquid plants. At the same time, Senator Barack Obama, from coal-rich Illinois, abruptly shifted his support for subsidizing coal-derived fuel production to concentrate on another bill he had been sponsoring that would cut greenhouse gas emissions and reduce carbon content in transport fuel.\n\nSustainable Developments: Making Development Less Risky; August 2007; Scientific American Magazine; by Jeffrey D. Sachs; 2 Page(s)\n\nLife at the bottom of the world's income distribution is massively risky. Poor households lack basic buffers--savings accounts, health insurance, water tanks, diversified income sources, and so on--against drought, pests, disease and other hazards. Even modest shocks, such as a temporary dry spell or a routine infection, can be devastating.\n\nThese risks have knock-on effects. To take one prime example, the expected economic return on the use of fertilizer is very high in Africa, yet impoverished farmers cannot obtain it on credit because of the potential for a catastrophic loss in the event of a crop failure. Their households cannot bear the risk of a loan, and so they remain destitute. Managing risk is therefore important not only for smoothing out the well-being of these farmers over the years but also for enabling their escape from extreme poverty.\n\nThe photographs of prisoner abuse from Abu Ghraib shocked most Americans. But social psychologist Philip Zimbardo had seen it all 30 years before in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University, where he randomly assigned college students to be \"guards\" or \"prisoners\" in a mock prison environment. The experiment was to last two weeks but was terminated after just six days, when these intelligent and moral young men were transformed into cruel and sadistic guards or emotionally shattered prisoners.\n\nAs he watched the parade of politicians proclaim that Abu Ghraib was the result of a few bad apples, Zimbardo penned a response he calls the Lucifer Effect (also the title of his new book from Random House), namely, the transformation of character that leads ordinarily good people to do extraordinarily evil things. \"Social psychologists like myself have been trying to correct the belief that evil is located only in the disposition of the individual and that the problem is in the few bad apples,\" he says. But, I rejoin, there are bad apples, no? Yes, of course, Zimbardo concedes, but most of the evil in the world is not committed by them: \"Before we blame individuals, the charitable thing to do is to first find out what situations they were in that might have provoked this evil behavior. Why not assume that these are good apples in a bad barrel, rather than bad apples in a good barrel?\"\n\nForum: Have Brain, Must Travel; August 2007; Scientific American Magazine; by Jim Bell; 2 Page(s)\n\nThese are incredibly exciting times for space exploration. NASA currently operates more than 50 robotic spacecraft that are studying Earth and reaching throughout the solar system, from Mercury to Pluto and beyond. Another 40 unmanned NASA missions are in development, and space agencies in Europe, Russia, Japan, India and China are running or building their own robotic craft. With such an armada at our disposal, delivering a stream of scientific data from so many distant ports, you might think that researchers like me who are involved in robotic space exploration would dismiss astronaut missions as costly and unnecessary. To the contrary: many of us embrace human exploration as a worthy goal in its own right and as a critically important part of space science in the 21st century.\n\nAlthough astronaut missions are much more expensive and risky than robotic craft, they are absolutely critical to the success of our exploration program. Why? Because space exploration is an adventure--a human adventure--that has historically enjoyed broad public support precisely because of the pride we take from it. President John F. Kennedy committed the U.S. to sending astronauts to the moon to make a statement about the power of democracy and freedom, not to do science. As a by-product, some outstanding lunar science was done, leading ultimately to an understanding of the moon's origin. What is more, the Apollo moon program trained and inspired an entire generation of researchers and engineers, who made the breakthroughs that paved the way for robotic missions, as well as much of the technology that we take for granted today.\n\nThe late Harvard University paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould said that every species designation represents a theory about that organism--the species assignment is more than a mere naming; it is a classification of the organism within the context of all the other creeping, crawling, clinging and cavorting life on earth. As such, the discovery of a charismatic new species of animal or plant often piques the interest of both the scientific community and the lay public. Finding an entirely new genus is even more exciting. So it is somewhat shocking that a peer-reviewed publication announcing the discovery of a previously uncharacterized family of plants--an even higher taxonomic level than genus--has gone virtually unnoticed.\n\nThe shock intensifies when one considers the incredible ubiquity and great economic importance of this plant family, species of which are probably adorning your home, softening the ambience of your dentist's waiting room or being plodded on by the rambling behemoths of your local football team.\n\nRace in a Bottle; August 2007; Scientific American Magazine; by Jonathan Kahn; 6 Page(s)\n\nTwo years ago, on June 23, 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first \"ethnic\" drug. Called BiDil (pronounced \"bye-dill\"), it was intended to treat congestive heart failure--the progressive weakening of the heart muscle to the point where it can no longer pump blood efficiently--in African-Americans only. The approval was widely declared to be a significant step toward a new era of personalized medicine, an era in which pharmaceuticals would be specifically designed to work with an individual's particular genetic makeup. Known as pharmacogenomics, this approach to drug development promises to reduce the cost and increase the safety and efficacy of new therapies. BiDil was also hailed as a means to improve the health of African-Americans, a community woefully underserved by the U.S. medical establishment. Organizations such as the Association of Black Cardiologists and the Congressional Black Caucus strongly supported the drug's approval.\n\nA close inspection of BiDil's history, however, shows that the drug is ethnic in name only. First, BiDil is not a new medicine--it is merely a combination into a single pill of two generic drugs, hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate, both of which have been used for more than a decade to treat heart failure in people of all races. Second, BiDil is not a pharmacogenomic drug. Although studies have shown that the hydralazine\/isosorbide dinitrate (H\/I) combination can delay hospitalization and death for patients suffering from heart failure, the underlying mechanism for the drug's efficacy is not fully understood and has not been directly connected to any specific genes. Third, and most important, no firm evidence exists that BiDil actually works better or differently in African-Americans than in anyone else. The FDA's approval of BiDil was based primarily on a clinical trial that enrolled only self-identified African-Americans and did not compare their health outcomes with those of other ethnic or racial groups.\n\nThe number of catastrophic wildfires in the U.S. has been steadily rising. The nation has spent more than $1 billion annually to suppress such fires in eight of the past 10 years. In 2005 a record 8.7 million acres burned, only to be succeeded by 9.9 million acres in 2006. And this year is off to a furious start.\n\nTo a great extent, the increase in fires stems from a buildup of excess fuel, particularly deadwood and underbrush. Forests harbor more fuel than ever in large part because for decades, land management agencies, including the U.S. Forest Service, have followed a policy of trying to quickly put out every fire that starts. Fires, however, can clear out debris, preventing material from accumulating across wide areas and feeding extremely large, intense fires that become impossible to fight. Even in the absence of such a policy, firefighters find themselves compelled to combat many blazes because people continue to build homes further into wildlands, and those structures require protection. Exacerbating the problem, spring snowmelts have been occurring earlier, extending the number of weeks every year when forests are exposed and dangerously dry.\n\nWindows on the Mind; August 2007; Scientific American Magazine; by Susana Martinez-Conde and Stephen L. Macknik; 8 Page(s)\n\nAs you read this, your eyes are rapidly flicking from left to right in small hops, bringing each word sequentially into focus. When you stare at a person's face, your eyes will similarly dart here and there, resting momentarily on one eye, the other eye, nose, mouth and other features. With a little introspection, you can detect this frequent flexing of your eye muscles as you scan a page, face or scene.\n\nBut these large voluntary eye movements, called saccades, turn out to be just a small part of the daily workout your eye muscles get. Your eyes never stop moving, even when they are apparently settled, say, on a person's nose or a sailboat bobbing on the horizon. When the eyes fixate on something, as they do for 80 percent of your waking hours, they still jump and jiggle imperceptibly in ways that turn out to be essential for seeing. If you could somehow halt these miniature motions while fixing your gaze, a static scene would simply fade from view.\n\nThe Physical Science behind Climate Change; August 2007; Scientific American Magazine; by William Collins, Robert Colman, James Haywood, Martin R. Manning and Philip Mote; 10 Page(s)\n\nFor a scientist studying climate change, \"eureka\" moments are unusually rare. Instead progress is generally made by a painstaking piecing together of evidence from every new temperature measurement, satellite sounding or climate-model experiment. Data get checked and rechecked, ideas tested over and over again. Do the observations fit the predicted changes? Could there be some alternative explanation? Good climate scientists, like all good scientists, want to ensure that the highest standards of proof apply to everything they discover.\n\nAnd the evidence of change has mounted as climate records have grown longer, as our understanding of the climate system has improved and as climate models have become ever more reliable. Over the past 20 years, evidence that humans are affecting the climate has accumulated inexorably, and with it has come ever greater certainty across the scientific community in the reality of recent climate change and the potential for much greater change in the future. This increased certainty is starkly reflected in the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the fourth in a series of assessments of the state of knowledge on the topic, written and reviewed by hundreds of scientists worldwide.\n\nA menacing fin pierced the surface and sliced toward us. A great blue shark--three meters in length--homed in on the scent of blood like a torpedo. As my wife, Melanie, and I watched several large sharks circle our seven-meter Boston Whaler, a silver-blue snout suddenly thrust through a square cutout in the boat deck. \"Look out!\" Melanie shouted. We both recoiled instinctively, but we were in no real danger. The shark flashed a jagged smile of ivory saw teeth and then slipped back into the sea.\n\nWe had drawn the sharks by ladling blood into the ocean, but we were not interested in their well-known attraction to blood. Rather we were investigating the hunters' mysterious \"sixth sense.\" Laboratory research had demonstrated that sharks can sense extremely weak electric fields--such as those animal cells produce when in contact with seawater. But how they use that unique sense had yet to be proved. We were on that boat to find out.\n\nFor many of us in affluent regions, our bathroom scales indicate that we get more than enough to eat, which may lead some to believe that it is easy, perhaps too easy, for farmers to grow our food. On the contrary, modern agriculture requires vast areas of land, along with regular infusions of water, energy and chemicals. Noting these resource demands, the 2005 United Nations-sponsored Millennium Ecosystem Assessment suggested that agriculture may be the \"largest threat to biodiversity and ecosystem function of any single human activity.\"\n\nToday most of humanity's food comes directly or indirectly (as animal feed) from cereal grains, legumes and oilseed crops. These staples are appealing to producers and consumers because they are easy to transport and store, relatively imperishable, and fairly high in protein and calories. As a result, such crops occupy about 80 percent of global agricultural land. But they are all annual plants, meaning that they must be grown anew from seeds every year, typically using resource-intensive cultivation methods. More troubling, the environmental degradation caused by agriculture will likely worsen as the hungry human population grows to eight billion or 10 billion in the coming decades.\n\nData Center in a Box; August 2007; Scientific American Magazine; by M. Mitchell Waldrop; 4 Page(s)\n\nThe next steel shipping container you see being hauled by a truck or train might not stow the usual mass of lumber, textiles or foodstuffs. It might hold 10 tons of finely interlaced computer servers, ready to be deposited in a parking lot to serve 10,000 employees at a corporate headquarters--or 10,000 people on the Internet. Sun Microsystems has just started delivering these data-centers-to-go, taking the concept of portable computing to a whole new level.\n\nTrue, the Project Blackbox system is portable only in the industrial sense that it is integrated into a standard 20-foot shipping container. But once delivered to a site, it is almost as self-contained as any laptop. All the system requires is a power cable and an Internet connection--plus a water supply and an external chiller for cooling. As many as 250 servers inside provide up to seven terabytes of active memory and more than two petabytes of disk storage. Perhaps most critically, says Greg Papadopoulos, Sun's chief technology officer in Menlo Park, Calif., Project Blackbox will deliver that functionality in about one-tenth the time and at one-hundredth the cost of building a traditional computer room of equal prowess.\n\nPhysicist Anton Zeilinger may not understand quantum mechanics, but he has not let that stand in his path. Besides paving the way for ultrapowerful computers and unbreakable codes that run on quantum effects, the 62-year-old Austrian has a gift for pushing the limits of quantum strangeness in striking ways. Recently he observed the delicate quantum link of entanglement in light flickered between two of the Canary Islands, 144 kilometers apart. He dreams of bouncing entangled light off of satellites in orbit.\n\nThough better known to the world at large for such headline-grabbing experiments, Zeilinger, who is based at the University of Vienna, has gone to comparable lengths to test the underlying assumptions of quantum mechanics itself. His results have left little hiding space from the conclusion that quantum reality is utterly, inescapably odd--so much so that 40 years after first encountering it as a student, Zeilinger still gropes for what makes it tick. \"I made what I think was the right conclusion right away,\" he says, \"that nobody really understands it.\"\n\nDVDs create sharper images than videotapes and have steadily displaced the older medium. Yet movie studios are trying to spawn a newer market by producing even higher definition video.\n\nDisk makers have released two competing high-definition formats: Blu-ray and HD DVD. The technical press is comparing the battle with the late-1970s match between VHS and Betamax videotape standards. But the current contest may play out differently: some manufacturers are making machines that can play both formats, and Warner Brothers has announced that it will soon release movies recorded in both schemes on a two-sided disk.\n\nThe head of a new cosmology think tank--provocatively named Beyond--at Arizona State University, physicist Paul Davies says he wants to look into \"the origin of the universe, life, consciousness and the emergence of humanity.\" In this, his 27th book, Davies examines the perplexing fact that many basic features of the physical universe seem tailor-made to produce life. He embraces the so-called anthropic principle: the idea that the universe's suitability for intelligent life is not an accident but a logical development. In accessible, relatively jargon-free language, he summarizes the current state of knowledge in cosmology and provides an introduction to particle physics. He then asks the question: Does the design of the universe imply the existence of an intelligent designer? Davies comes down on the side of some sort of undefined \"life principle\" in the cosmos, but he says that this \"is something I feel more in my heart than in my head.\"\n\nIn one of his notebooks, Charles Darwin wrote: \"Origin of man proved.--Metaphysic must flourish.--He who understands baboon would do more towards metaphysics than Locke.\" Robert M. Seyfarth and Dorothy L. Cheney--pioneers in the study of primate psychology--take up the challenge. Baboons live in groups of up to 100, which include a few males and eight or nine matrilineal families of females. Daily life encompasses intrigues that range from alliances of three individuals up to battles that involve three or four extended families. Paste on top of this a complicated mix of personal relationships--from short-term bonds for mating to longterm friendships that lead to cooperative child rearing--and the result \"is a kind of Jane Austen melodrama,\" in which each individual must predict the behavior of others and take care to form the most advantageous relationships. Any way you look at it, the authors say, most of the problems facing baboons can be expressed in two words: other baboons. The authors aim to understand the intelligence that underlies this social organization: How do baboons conceive of the world and their place in it? Do they understand kinship relations? How do they infer the motives of others?\n\nThe abundance of atmospheric ozone (O3) is relative-levels that are dangerously high in the atmosphere's lowest layer, the troposphere, would be dangerously low in the stratosphere, one layer above. As such, ground-level ozone is not plentiful enough to fill the so-called ozone hole. In addition, ozone is regulated primarily by local chemical processes, and a temperature barrier at the troposphere-stratosphere border prevents a large-scale mixing of ozone across atmospheric levels.\n\nStratospheric ozone provides a shield from harmful ultraviolet solar radiation. Conversely, elevated levels of tropospheric ozone can lead to human health problems and damage to crops and forests.\n\nFact or Fiction?; August 2007; Scientific American Magazine; by Ciara Curtin; 1 Page(s)\n\nDuring the height of the space race in the 1960s, legend has it, NASA scientists realized that pens could not function in zero gravity. They therefore spent years and millions of taxpayer dollars developing a ballpoint pen that could put ink to paper without needing gravitational force to pull on the fluid. But their crafty Soviet counterparts, so the story goes, simply handed cosmonauts grease pencils.

For a moment, everyone is cheering, the guest of honor smiles at the trailing wisps of smoke, and the flames seem to have vanished for good.

The guest of honor, bewildered, continues to blow, and is soon out of breath from battling the seemingly inextinguishable flickers of light.\n\nThe common definition of an imaginary number, or complex number, is the square root of a negative number. The concept of i is straightforward enough: since i is the square root of -1, then it logically follows that i squared must be equal to -1. Although the square root of a negative number is often considered undefined, the brilliance of complex numbers lies in the assumption that this square root is nonetheless meaningful. Since almost all of the basic properties of algebra or real numbers apply to complex numbers, they are merely an extension of the real number system. In a way, complex numbers are just as \"real\" as real numbers.\n\nThroughout history, humans have relied on nature as a source of healing. Natural products, which are chemical compounds produced by living organisms, are widely known for their medicinal properties. Willow bark, for example, has been an age-old remedy for fever and headaches; scientists have since isolated its active compound, salicin, and developed it into the modern-day pain reliever aspirin. Like salicin, the vast majority of natural products discovered to date has been from terrestrial organisms. Marine natural products, on the other hand, have gone largely unnoticed until the past five decades; this emerging field of research presents an exciting new drug discovery process that has its roots not on land, but in the sea.\n\nIt used to be that a cancer diagnosis was akin to a dreaded death sentence.

The NOVA program explored the leading theories, including the possibility that a comet broke apart in the atmosphere and smashed into the continent in multiple pieces, triggering explosions, forest fires and other devastating effects that led to the demise of up to 35 species of large mammals. The judges called the program, which used striking computer animations of the animals in question, a balanced exploration of a controversial theory. \"The piece exhibited great writing, with dramatic tension between competing views,\" said Janet Raloff of Science News.

They came from somewhere else in the galaxy,\n\nIt doesn't sound like such a great discovery, until you consider that these particles - hydrogen, oxygen, and neon - are the fundamental building blocks for planets, stars, and lifeforms like human beings. To know that these elements exist outside our own solar system is incredible. There may be another Earth-like planet out there after all.\n\nIt seems worms can talk. And if fish can hear, that explains why I suck at fishing.\n\nResearchers at Cornell University and California Technical Institute have discovered that round worms, or, nematodes, can communicate with one another by stringing together different molecules similar to the way we string together words in a sentence.\n\nUnderstanding the \"language of worms\" can be an indispensable weapon in the fight to combat nematode infections in humans and nematode prolificacy in agricultural environments.\n\nThe humorous claim that gravity should have been apparent without the apple seems to have some merit after all.\n\nNew research at the University of Missouri suggests that children are born with what scientists call \"intuitive physics knowledge.\"\n\n\"We believe that infants are born with expectations about the objects around them, even though that knowledge is a skill that's never been taught. As the child develops, this knowledge is refined and eventually leads to the abilities we use as adults.\"\n\nInfants as young as two-months understand that unsupported objects will fall and that unseen objects do not cease to exist. This last one is somewhat funny because it's completely and obviously true. I don't know how many times I've lost at peekaboo. (Yep. You can lose at peekaboo!)\n\nThe study also found that at five-months, infants expect \"non-cohesive\" substances to be different from solids. At 10 months, they repeatedly choose the larger portion of food when offered various amounts, indicating they understand concepts like quantity.\n\nThe Two Ways of Life, above, was an allegorical tableau vivant, or mise-en-sc\u00e8ne was created by Oscar Rejlander in 1857.

The other, with perhaps less enthusiasm, looks towards virtue: religion, industry and family. Penitence, in the center, looks toward the right, rejecting vice. The image was the first publicly exhibited photograph of a nude, the first major art photograph and the first photo-montage.\n\nThe image, not surprisingly, caused a sensation. One reviewer described it as \"magnificent\u2026.decidedly the finest photograph of its class ever pronounced\" and the print was shown in March 1857 at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition (one of the first to exhibit photographs along with other art). A copy was purchased by Queen Victoria for the Prince Consort. Even with royal patronage, however, many felt that the photographic nude crossed the line of decency. The Scottish Society even refused to display it at their Exhibition in Edinburgh.\n\nI stumbled upon an article discussing the find of a 33,000-year-old dog skull.

The Amber Room was looted during World War II by Nazi Germany and brought to K\u00f6nigsberg. Knowledge of its whereabouts was lost in the chaos at the end of the war.

Well that's one way to look at it, another would be to say the Romans didn't tolerate anyone who wasn't willing to bend to the Roman will and that's something else entirely. The following story is just one example of the Roman will, their inclination toward tolerance and a slice of reality.\n\nFrom the 100falcons.wordpress.com article:\n\nThe Roman Empire was a nice package of countries and peoples.

They were not damned, as it turned out, but they were annihilated. Rome itself admired them for generations.\n\nFrom the space.com article:\nAntimatter, which annihilates matter upon contact, seems to be rare in the universe. Still, for decades, scientists had clues that a vast cloud of antimatter lurked in space, but they did not know where it came from.\n\nThe mysterious source of this antimatter has now been discovered \u2014 stars getting ripped apart by neutron stars and black holes.\n\nFrom the wired.com article:\nDiseases carried to North America by Spanish explorers killed millions of the continent's original inhabitants, but the trip cut both ways: scientists say Christopher Columbus took syphilis back to Europe.\n\nIn a study published in the January 14 issue of the journal Public Library of Science Neglected Tropical Diseases, Emory University geneticists studied 26 strains of treponema, the bacterial genus to which the infamous venereal disease belongs. After comparing their differences and evolutionary history, they decided that modern syphilis-causing strains most closely resembled those found in South America.\n\nThe findings give ammunition to adherents of the so-called Columbian theory of syphilis, which holds that the disease arrived in Europe with Columbus. Their opponents point to earlier European evidence, especially syphilitic lesions in skeletons from a 14th century English monastery, as absolving the notorious explorer of this particular scourge.\n\nThis probably won't settle the debate, but both sides do agree on one basic fact: a pandemic of syphilis hit Europe shortly after Columbus' return, and it changed the course of history."}

This week Zealous Xenobiologist Zach Kagan brings you exciting tales of global warming, stem cells, the secrets of the the brain and more.\n\nLast Wednesday Havemeyer Hall became a battleground over the future direction of Neuroscience research. In a public debate, moderated by Robert Kulwhich of Radiolab fame, two top neuroscientists argued over the direction of future research: In one corner we have Sebastian Seung, MIT professor of computational neuroscience and swanky dresser, and in the other corner we have the one-and-only director of the Center for Neural Science at NYU, Tony Movshon. Seung came into the ring swinging, arguing the the ways that neurons interconnect throughout the brain is the most important avenue for research. Movshon fought back, standing firm in his belief that scientists should specialize in which area of the brain they study, getting deeper into how each individual part functions. In the end both combatants went the whole fifteen without a knock out, but it was a hell of a show.\n\nMost people, other than Fox news pundits, will agree that global warming is caused by increased carbon dioxide levels. However, there have been many other warm periods, which begs the question\u2013was CO2 also involved in these instances? The answer is generally yes, according to a sweeping new study analyzing the global mean temperatures and carbon dioxide levels throughout time. When CO2 levels go up, temperature rises not long after. For example, approximately 21,000 years ago variations in the Earth's orbit caused warmer summer in the norther hemisphere, causing glaciers to melt, the resulting glacial water altered the Atlantic current system, allowing deep sea CO2 to escape into the atmosphere, warming the planet. Columbia post doctorate fellow Jeremy Shakun remarks: \"We constructed the first-ever record of global temperature spanning the end of the last ice age based on 80 proxy temperature records from around the world\u2026 It's no small task to get at global mean temperature.\""}

The result was the first eukaryote, a complex cell type that today makes up all plants, animals and fungi: pretty much any organism you can see without a microscope. Eukaryotic cells are those that contain endosymbionts, the descendants of that original undigested cell. They are the mitochondria that power our cells, and the chloroplasts that allow plants to photosynthesize. Although they've been with us pretty much forever, they live separate lives, maintaining their own genomes, producing their own proteins, and exchanging them amongst each other. At least, we thought they did. But a new study from the University of Guelph has overturned a century of dogma by suggesting that chloroplasts may live as independently from one another as they do from the plant cells that host them.\n\nIn my last post, I gave you an overview of the International Polar Year Conference that just wrapped up in Montreal.

{"text":"Extra-terrestrial life remains terrestrial\n\nJul 11, 2012 By Christine Heidemann\n\nOn the trail of arsenic and phosphate: the \"arsenic bacterium\" GFAJ-1 really does need phosphate for growth. Credit: Jodi Switzer Blum \/ NASA\n\n(Phys.org) -- A study by ETH Zurich researchers demonstrates that the \"arsenic bacterium\" postulated as a spectacular new life form by NASA in 2010 cannot do without phosphorus. This demonstrates the continuing validity of a central dogma of biology.\n\nIt was a sensation: the fact that a bacterium uses toxic arsenic instead of phosphorus as a vital building block completely turned on its head our understanding of life as we know it. It also fed speculation as to what extra-terrestrial life might look like.\n\nThe scientific community was correspondingly striked when NASA announced in a press conference in 2010 that a team of biologists from the US Geological Survey, the American geological research agency, had found an extraordinary microorganism called \"GFAJ-1\" in the mud of Lake Mono in California \u2013 a lake that has extremely high saline and arsenic contents and thus displays unusual conditions for normal terrestrial life. Obviously not only was this newly discovered mite unharmed by arsenic, but was also able to use the poisonous semimetal instead of phosphorus to build macromolecules, and in particular the genome molecule DNA.\n\nArsenic as element of organic life?\n\nThe US scientists thereby overturned a biological dogma \u2013 namely that all organic life on Earth, from the tiniest microorganism to humans, is assembled from six basic building blocks: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus.\n\nPhosphorus and arsenic are indeed chemically very similar, which is why it is not a problem for the toxic element to \"infiltrate\" into organs and cells. Once there, arsenic in compound form unleashes its destructive effects. Are we now to believe that this highly poisonous substance can suddenly replace phosphorus as a seventh fundamental element in a bacterium, and even allow the organism to grow? A daring thesis that brought many sceptics up in arms.\n\nMore detailed insight into its metabolism\n\nThe research group led by Julia Vorholt, Professor at the Institute of Microbiology, has now refuted the \"arsenic bacterium\" thesis in a paper published in the scientific journal \"Science\". The ETH Zurich team of microbiologists and analytical chemists gave the first detailed systematic insight into the microorganism's metabolism.\n\nUsing high-resolution mass spectrometry and a newly-developed computer-assisted analysis that simulates all the possible combinations of biomolecules containing arsenic, the researchers made a specific search for arsenic compounds inside the cells of GFAJ-1 bacteria. By doing this they actually did find a few sugar molecules containing arsenic. But: Tobias Erb, ETH Zurich Fellow and first author of the paper, explains that \"Contrary to the assumption by the NASA scientists, the arsenic sugar is not actively formed by the bacterium itself, but involves a spontaneous process instead.\"\n\nIn further experiments based on so-called isotope labelling studies, Julia Vorholt, Tobias Erb and Senior Researcher Patrick Kiefer also showed that the \"arsenic bacterium\" has a functioning phosphate metabolism, whereas they were unable to find any evidence of metabolic activity by the arsenic sugar. The result from Zurich is that \"Therefore there are no indications that GFAJ-1 grows with the assistance of biomolecules containing arsenic, or that it uses them actively as cell building blocks.\"\n\nIt's impossible without phosphate\n\nVorholt and her team, in collaboration with ETH Zurich Professor Detlef G\u00fcnther and Senior Researcher Bodo Hattendorf, who are both trace element and microanalysis experts at the Laboratory of Inorganic Chemistry, also showed that the robust microbes accumulates phosphate extremely efficiently from the environment. Julia Vorholt says \"This ability enables the bacterium to have enough phosphate available to synthesise the most important vital building blocks in spite of the high ambient concentrations of arsenic.\" She says the arsenic bacterium's main DNA strands, the so-called genetic information backbone, also consist of phosphate, not of the toxic semimetal. \"We were unable to detect any traces of arsenic whatsoever in the DNA strands.\"\n\nTraces obviously underestimated\n\nFinally the ETH Zurich scientists also looked more closely at the NASA data published in Science in 2010. Very tiny traces of phosphate were also present in the nutrient medium when the bacterium was grown in this study. These were obviously sufficient for the bacterium's growth. The team of authors at ETH Zurich suspect that the NASA scientists probably underestimated the traces of phosphate.\n\nIn view of these comprehensive results, the five researchers conclude that the central dogma of biology still remains valid. The debate as to whether life on Earth is possible beyond the six known fundamental elements must probably be regarded as closed until there is proof to the contrary.\n\nIn late 2010, NASA set the Internet buzzing when it called a press conference to discuss an astrobiological finding that would impact the search for extraterrestrial life.

Chris will be familiar to you as an explorer and mainstay of CFZ expeditions and as an expedition coordinator. Take it away Chris:\n\nMultiple Suns\n\nThe appearance of two suns in the sky sounds more than merely Fortean; rather something from the Book of Revelations, one of the signs and wonders that announce the Second Coming, a dire event that follows the opening of one of the seven seals. It is understandable then that in March this year the appearance of two suns over a part of China caused some Internet excitement.\n\nThis very rare effect involves the appearance of a second image of the sun, of very similar size and brightness, typically one or two degrees away, and commonly when the sun is just above the horizon. The image may be alongside the true sun or above it; sometimes there is more than one false sun (up to nine have been reported), and there have also been sightings of multiple images of the moon and even one of the planet Venus. Minnaert, in his book Light and Colour in the Open Air, doubted its reality in the early editions, but was forced to change his mind when drawings and photographs became available. Corliss, in the Rare Halos, Mirages, Anomalous Rainbows\u2026 Catalog cites a number of reports, most observed at sea, and involving altitudes of the sun and moon above the horizon as high as 25\u00b0.\n\nIt should be stressed that this does not refer to the 'sun dogs' or 'mock suns', caused by reflections of the sun from ice crystals. This is a fairly common effect (I have seen it twice) and easily identified: the sun dogs appear, usually as a pair with one on each side of the sun, as part of a bright ring at an angle of 22\u00b0 around the sun.\n\nLogically, if two suns are seen at one place, we might expect no sun to be visible at another, but this, if it happens, has never been reported. Presumably multiple images of the sun or moon must be the consequence of some abnormal refraction effect, of the sort that produces mirages, Fata Morgana, and the curious 'looming' effect that can make islands out at sea appear large and close when seen from the shore. Nevertheless it is extraordinarily hard to see how as many as nine clear and distinct images can be generated; perhaps the abrupt density changes associated with cold fronts, or the pattern of convection cells that can form in warm weather, may cause multiple paths. Certainly the experts consulted about the China sighting were baffled, and I know of not a single paper on the subject.\n\nThe Tunguska Event\n\nIn June 1908 a colossal explosion took place in a very remote region of Siberia. The exact power of the explosion, which blew down trees over an 80-square-mile area, is impossible to establish, but it seems to have been in the 5 to 30 megaton range. It must have taken months for the news to reach Moscow; the Tsarist government took no action, and it was not until 1927, when the chaos of World War I, the Bolshevik Revolution and the Civil War had died down, that an expedition was sent. Although the site was still devastated, with fallen trees pointing away from the site of the blast, there was no sign of any impact crater, and the damage seems to have been done by a massive airburst.\n\nMany ideas, some of them rather wild, have been put forward to explain the nature of the blast: an antimatter meteorite; a quantum black hole; even an alien spaceship blowing up on landing! However, the discovery of tiny particles of iron with a high proportion of nickel in the soil and the fallen trees suggested a meteorite; the discovery of traces of iridium, a heavy metal very rare on earth but often found in meteors, strengthened this. Nevertheless, it was not obvious why a solid stone meteor should explode at high altitude instead of reaching the ground and forming a crater, and there were suggestions that a comet, or at least a fragment of one, could be responsible. Now that we understand that many asteroids are merely loose aggregations of pebbles held together by a weak gravitational attraction the meteor idea becomes more plausible; calculations show that even a solid stony object can be broken up by high pressures in the atmosphere before it reaches the ground. On the other hand, the observation of a bright column of light in the sky for ten minutes before the explosion suggests that a detached fragment of the object hit the Earth first: the Shoemaker-Levy comet that hit Jupiter was preceded by similar fragments pulled off by tidal stresses. The high metal concentration is also hard to square with a stony meteorite, and it may be that a comet, or the nucleus of one, is still a possibility.\n\nIt is worth noting one more thing: if the object had arrived five hours later it would have hit the outskirts of St Petersburg. And if it had impacted during one of the more fractious periods of the Cold War instead of 1908\u2026.\n\nThe Moving Coffins of Barbados\n\nIn 2007, on our way back from searching for giant anacondas in Guyana, the CFZ team made a stopover in Barbados. While we there we inspected the tomb of the Chase family in Christ Church graveyard, famous for its 'creeping coffins'. In the early nineteenth century several members of the family were buried here. The first two burials, in 1807 and 1808, happened without incident. However, when the tomb, built out of large cemented blocks, was opened for a third burial in 1812 it was found that the two coffins, encased in lead, had been flung against the wall. There was no disturbance to the dust on the floor. The coffins were replaced and the third burial took place. The fourth burial, that of plantation owner Thomas Chase who had purchased the tomb for his family, was only a month later, but the same disorder was seen; from then on, whenever the vault was opened for another burial, the coffins were found in state of disarray. In 1819 the Governor of Barbados himself checked for secret entrances, placed seals on the vault and scattered sand on the floor to detect intrusion; yet when he checked nine months later the coffins had moved again, and there was no sign of footprints. After this the Governor ordered the tomb to be emptied and the coffins reburied: they have apparently been content to remain where they are ever since. It is hard to imagine any explanation, short of an elaborate conspiracy, to explain this one.\n\nBall Lightning\n\nIn the town of Khabarovsk (USSR), in the summer of 1978, a ball of orange light about 1.5 m diameter appeared over a local cinema and was observed for a full minute as it descended to the street, When it finally exploded it caused a crater 1.5 m across and 20-25 cm deep. The estimated energy release was about one billion Joules, or enough to completely evaporate half a ton of water. This is the most spectacular example of ball lightning so far observed, but very far from the only one. A paper published in 1993 gave examples of over 3200 distinct sightings.\n\nThe cause remains a complete mystery, though it engaged the interest of (among many others), the famous Russian physicist and Nobel Prize winner Peter Kapitza. The same paper mentions a discussion in a Soviet technical journal which produced 138 different explanations! Since most sightings are associated with thunderstorms, an explanation in terms of plasma physics has always been preferred (and I can certainly produce something that looks like ball lightning, though it presumably isn't, in my microwave oven using nothing more than a candle). Since wiring was damaged up to 150 m from the explosion in the Khabarovsk case this would suggest an electromagnetic pulse, but there is no explanation of how the air can remain ionised for the long (10 \u2013 60 seconds) duration of ball lightning, instead of the milliseconds typical of plasmas. Other causes suggested include antimatter, a fractal state of matter called an aerogel, and even the elusive Dirac magnetic monopole. The recent discovery of positron annihilation gamma radiation in the aftermath of violent lightning strikes suggests that antimatter can actually be created: so if you do see ball lightning, treat it with respect.\n\nThe Annemarie Schneider Poltergeist\n\nThe paranormal is a huge disappointment to those who, like me, would like to believe. Telepathy retreats ever further into a statistical limbo of analysis and meta-analysis (as Rutherford said \"If your experiment needs statistics, you ought to have done a better experiment\"). Psychokinesis scarcely ever occurs under properly controlled conditions; certainly I have never heard of anyone being barred from Las Vegas casinos for winning vast sums at the craps tables using their PK powers. Precognition seems to be as bogus as every other form of prophecy; Soal, who spent years investigating it, was reduced in the end to cheating out of sheer frustration. As for teleportation, which Charles Fort seems to have invented as a joke, there is not even bad evidence that anyone ever teleported or ever will.\n\nOut of the vast pile of debris that constitutes the paranormal library, one phenomenon seems to remain standing: poltergeists. There are far too many accounts to even list, but one in particular stands out : the Rosenheim poltergeist or, since all the effects were associated with one adolescent girl (as they so often are), perhaps it should be called the Annemarie Schneider poltergeist. The events centred round the office of a Bavarian lawyer called Sigmund Adam. They began in 1967 with a series of telephone calls, at a rate sometimes of several per minute, apparently made from the office. The calls continued when all the telephones were locked, only Adam himself holding the key. There were a range of electrical problems, involving exploding light bulbs, blown fuses and lights that went on and off by themselves. The power company and the telephone company could find no problems with the equipment. Objects began to move, apparently of their own accord. When a paranormal investigator and two physicists were brought in they noted that the events only occurred when a young secretary, Annemarie Schneider, was present. Schneider apparently had just come out of a difficult relationship, and anyone who attended the talk 'Sex and the Single Poltergeist' at the last Unconvention will remember the link between poltergeist activity and sexual tensions in adolescents. The case became internationally famous: I remember reading about it in the British newspapers at the time. Despite the attention of journalists, police and investigators the effects continued, and did not end until Schneider herself left. It is worth noting that no-one claimed to have seen her faking anything. Unfortunately no illusionists or magicians seem to have checked on her, so the possibility of fraud by an attention-seeking neurotic remains, but it would be remarkable if a teenage girl could have replicated the sort of effects associated with skilled mediums who are allowed to set the terms under which they work.\n\nOliver is away at the LAPIS Conference, at which he will be videoing bits and bobs for CFZtv as well as speaking himself.

{"text":"The *Science* Magazine News Blog\n\nDavid Grimm: February 2009 Archives\n\nFebruary 16, 2009\n\nThe Scottish terrier that was a finalist at the Westminster Dog Show last week is a mutant. And she's not alone. With their stubby legs and long bodies, Scottish terriers, Bassett hounds, and dachshunds have been purposely bred by humans to have chondrodysplasia, a dwarfing of the legs that is considered a defining--and desirable--trait in some breeds of little dogs. Now, geneticist Elaine Ostrander of the National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, and her colleagues have identified the underlying genetic variant that truncated these dogs' legs and made it possible for dachshunds, for example, to burrow down a hole to hunt badgers.\n\nAs she showed glossy images of her photogenic canine subjects, Ostrander described how researchers have been seeking genes that explain the origins of diversity in the 300 known breeds of dogs, which come in all shapes and sizes, with long hair and short fur, smashed faces and long snouts. In 2007, Ostrander's lab found a single gene in short dogs, such as Chihuahuas and Pekingese, that regulated the expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1); the gene was missing in giant breeds, such as bullmastiffs and great Pyrenees.\n\nFebruary 15, 2009\n\nMalaria grips many of the impoverished regions throughout the world, killing between 700,000 and 2.7 million people each year. And as Earth warms, researchers only expect the problem to get worse. But at a symposium here yesterday, entomologist Matthew Thomas of Penn State University, University Park, said the story may not be that simple. Researchers have been ignoring the fact that temperatures vary throughout the day, he says, and when these daily fluctuations are taken into account, they show that predicted incidences of malaria can be off by 50% to more than 100%.\n\nTemperature is critical to malaria's spread. A mosquito picks up the Plasmodium parasite that carries the disease when it bites an infected human, and it carries the parasite in its gut, where it matures--a process that takes about 10 to 14 days at about 25\u00b0C. At temperatures below about 16\u00b0C, the parasite doesn't mature fast enough, and the mosquito dies before it can pass it on. Temperatures above 40\u00b0C kill the parasite.\n\nFebruary 15, 2009\n\nAs a crowd of kids lean in to look, intrepid Julia Rademacher Wedd, 7 years old, steps onto a low plastic stool and places her hand on a contraption that resembles a large steel mushroom.

It wasn't a real bug, but a larger-than-life plastic reconstruction made possible by shooting x-ray beams up to a billion times brighter than a hospital x-ray at ancient pieces of amber. A three-dimensional plastic printer made the model, which Tafforeau said at a press conference today is better than any virtual representation on a computer. \"You can feel it in your hands.\"\n\nLong-extinct insects, corroded ancient bronzes, parchments too delicate to unroll--these are some of the ancient objects that the world's most advanced x-ray facilities, including ESRF, are bringing to light.

That's what happened to me on Friday, when I joined the speakers from The Evolution of Human Diets session for lunch after their seminar. Anne Stone of Arizona State University handed me a strip from a vial, as if she were handing out toothpicks after a meal. When I licked it, I tasted only a mild acrid flavor, like licking the glue on an envelope. I was a \"nontaster,\" she said. Not so for the co-organizer of the session, paleoanthropologist Peter Ungar of the University of Arkansas. He told me that when he licked the paper, it was intensely bitter--he grimaced to show me just how awful. He was definitely a \"taster.\"\n\nIt seems that we all were licking paper dipped in phenylthiocarbamide, or PTC, which is a bitter organic compound.

The scientists that attended came to the conclusion that the \"Law of Difficulty\" is true.\n\nI leave you with a few choice quotes:\n\n\"To be a scientist, you have to learn all this weird stuff, like how many molecules are in a proton,\" University of Chicago physicist Dr. Erno Heidegger said.\n\nDr. Ahmed Zewail, a Caltech chemist whose spectroscopic studies of the transition states of chemical reactions earned him the Nobel Prize in 1999, explained in layman's terms just how hard the discipline of chemistry is, using the periodic table of the elements as a model.\n\n\"Take the element of tungsten and work to memorize its place in the periodic table, its atomic symbol, its atomic number and weight, what it looks like, where it's found, and its uses to humanity, if any,\" Zewail said. \"Now, imagine memorizing the other 100-plus elements making up the periodic table. You'd have to be, like, some kind of total brain to do that.\"\n\nSo when things aren't working out in the lab, just remember, what you're trying to do is really friggin' hard. Happy Friday, Newscripts readers!\n\nIn this week's issue of C&EN, I wrote about how 3-D printing fever has taken hold of some folks in academia. Sure, scientists and engineers COULD keep a 3-D printer in the lab strictly for printing out a molecular model, a prototype, or even an intricate lab logo. But they're starting to do much more with the machines.\n\nAs Lee Cronin, a chemist at Scotland's University of Glasgow, told me, in the early days of 3-D printing, \"people thought it was cool but gimmicky.\" Now, though, they're beginning to use the technique to solve problems, he added.\n\n3-D Printed Lab Jack Credit: Courtesy of Joshua Pearce\n\nIn the story, I describe how some scientists have used 3-D printers to make lab equipment such as centrifuges,funnels,lab jacks, and electrophoresis gel combs. These early adopters claim that the machines, which build solid objects layer by layer from materials like plastics and ceramic powders, can save labs thousands of dollars. And, they say, 3-D printers help foster an open-access scientific community that will speed the progress of research.\n\nOne research group I didn't get to mention in my story is that of Simon J. Leigh, a chemist-turned-engineer at the U.K.'s University of Warwick. Leigh and his team are developing new materials for 3-D printers, with the goal of eventually incorporating them into devices for the lab and beyond.\n\nFor instance, late last year, the researchers published a PloS One paper detailing how they concocted \"carbomorph,\" a material made of the thermoplastic polycaprolactone and 15 wt% carbon black. \"The aim of the project was to develop a material that could go into a printer that's off the shelf,\" Leigh says. In addition to being electrically conductive, carbomorph had the added benefit of being extrudable by a standard low-cost 3-D printer (they used a Bits from Bytes 3000).\n\nPacMan thinks this is as delicious as a bowl full of cherries: 3-D printed game controller. Credit: Courtesy of Simon Leigh\n\nLeigh's team demonstrated that the substance could also be incorporated into several devices. One of these instruments was an electronic interface. The researchers added carbomorph buttons to an electrical circuit: When a user pressed one of them, its capacitance increased and triggered an electrical signal. Being able to embed sensors like these anywhere on a device rather than adding them on at defined spots in post-production could be extraordinarily useful, Leigh says.\n\nIn one, perhaps gimmicky, example, Leigh and his team printed sensor buttons into a video-game controller. \"But there's no reason why the same process could not be used to make custom interfaces for scientific equipment,\" he says.\n\nIn 2011, the research team also developed a magnetic material for 3-D printing that it used to manufacture a flow sensor. Specifically, the scientists added magnetite nanoparticles to a resin matrix and printed a tiny rotor (impeller). By monitoring the small piece's rotational speed via external magnetic field, the researchers were able to determine the speed of liquid across it.\n\nWhy go to all the trouble of designing new materials and printing devices you could buy? Leigh says it's almost a natural \"evolutionary step.\" First, there were desktop computers, next there will be desktop manufacturing systems. In science, especially, Leigh adds, \"you want something that's more bespoke these days. You don't want to waste material or time\" to get the equipment you need.\n\nEver wish you could tear a page out of C&EN and eat it because it's so good? Well, it might happen in the future \u2026 Fanta creates an edible ad. [ShortList] But just to be clear, this is old news: Newscripts has written about edible ads (and greeting cards) before. [C&EN]\n\nScientists in California want to create laser beams to evaporate asteroids before they hit Earth. No word on using them to fill the dean's house with popcorn or if they will be mounted on sharks. [LA Times]\n\nSpeaking of lasers, this one was meant for studying space, but it moonlights as a counterfeit honey detector. [Slate]\n\nWho knew panda flirting was so complicated? The Edinburgh Zoo's Yang Guang \"has recently begun to execute handstands against trees, walls, and rocks, and to leave scent marks as high up as he can\" in an attempt to get the attention of lady panda Tian Tian. [Guardian]\n\nCAS asked participants to guess when the 70 millionth substance would be added to its database. The person who submitted the answer (date and time) closest to reality would take home an e-book reader.\n\nWell, I'm a bit behind in reporting the outcome. But better late than never, right?\n\nThe 70 millionth compound was added to CAS's Registry on Dec. 6, 2012. The winner? Lucky grad student Tom Pearson of Nottingham Trent University, in England. An organic chemist, Pearson is developing new ways of sticking sugar units together with an eye toward drug synthesis. And he received a Kindle Fire for his correct prediction.\n\nPearson doesn't normally enter contests, so this is the first time he's won anything, he tells me. \"I had 10 minutes free in my day and thought I'd enter,\" he says of the contest.\n\nBut Pearson's win wasn't complete luck. Like every true science nerd, he used some math and logic to arrive at his winning entry: \"I basically just stared at the counter for a couple of minutes and tried to work out the average rate at which substances were being added. After working out the rate, I then determined the date that the 70 millionth substance would be added.\"\n\nCAS added the 50 millionth substance to its registry back on Sept. 7, 2009. On the basis of these dates, and doing a little math of my own, I estimate that CAS adds about 16,900 new chemical substances to its database per day. That's about 1 new compound every 5 seconds. Yowza!!\n\nThe 70 millionth substance, given CAS Registry number 1411769-41-9, is a pyrazolyl piperazine disclosed in a patent filed with the Korean Intellectual Property Office. It's a calcium-ion channel blocker with potential applications in treating pain, as well as conditions such as dementia.\n\nA few fun facts from CAS about its registry:\n\nIn 2012, 63% of patents covered by CAS originated in Asia.\n\nMore than 70% of new substances added to the registry from the literature come from patents."}

Crop production inKansascan help provide\nglobal food and energy needs. Changing climates inKansasand around the world will\ncomplicate the need of sustainably meeting food and energy security goals. Understanding\nthe impacts of climate change variables and their progressive interactions is critical\nto developing agricultural systems that will enhance productivity even in changing\nclimates.\n\nBiomedical Research and Technology for a Connected Wireless World\n\nThis seminar presents an overview of biomedical research, development, and service\nactivities supported by the K-State Medical Component Design Laboratory (K-State's\nDepartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering) in cooperation with other academic\nand industry partners. It begins with a perspective on where health care is headed\nin this increasingly connected world by addressing telemedicine, home care, and emerging\nwearable sensor technology for real-time health assessment and prediction.\n\nThe presentation specifically addresses K-State's work in wearable, game-changing\nhealth monitoring systems\/devices for both humans and animals. This is followed by\na summary of ongoing K-State\/NASA partnerships for the development of biomedical systems\nfor use in reduced-gravity environments such as Mars. Finally, the speaker addresses\nefforts to design health monitoring tools and educational aids that improve the quality\nof life for disabled children.\n\nChaotic Fluid Motions: How Sparrows Affect the Weather\n\nDr. Larry A. Glasgow, Professor of Chemical Engineering\n\nSince the publication of the classic paper by Edward Lorenz in 1963, scientists and\nengineers have come to a greater appreciation of the consequences of nonlinearity\nwith respect to familiar events. In particular, the complexities of atmospheric phenomena\nand the sensitivity of such fluid motions to initial conditions are now better understood.\n\nIn this presentation we look at trajectory constructions in phase space to aid comprehension\nof system dynamics. Some simple physical demonstrations are used to help explain concepts\nlike steady-state, stability, and catastrophe. The probability of successful long-term\nprediction of the weather is the focus of concluding remarks.\n\nChemistry in Outer Space\n\nThis lecture will explore a combination of physics and chemistry, from the big bang\ntheory, the formation of stars and to the formation of planets, all through a chemist's\neyes. Solar synthesis of the elements is emphasized, as well as chemicals found in\nouter space.\n\nClimbing Colorado's Highest Mountains\n\nDr. Kevin Blake, Professor of Geography\n\nThe highest peaks in the Rocky Mountains are in Colorado, where there are more than\n50 peaks that exceed 14,000 feet above sea level (the Fourteeners), far more than\nany other state or province in North America. These varied and stunning peaks have\nlong attracted vacationers from the Midwest and the world to gaze upon their majesty,\nand at times, attempt to climb to the highest points. This presentation explores the\nallure of the Colorado Fourteeners, especially for those who heed the \"peakbagging\"\ncall to climb every mountain. Many photographs from the presenter's hikes address\nwhat the Fourteeners are, why some mountains are more famous than others, some of\nthe risks and rewards of climbing the mountains (including wildlife encounters), and\nhow mountain climbing informs the geographical study of how people idealize nature.\n\nA Cubic Mile of Oil\n\nDr. Kenneth J. Klabunde\n\nIn a year, we consume, worldwide, about one cubic mile of oil (CMO). Counting electricity\nproduction, nuclear and other forms, we consume the equivalent of three cubic miles\nof oil. This talk emphasizes the challenges to replace a CMO and what types of renewable\nenergy are most promising \u2013 solar, thermal, solar electric, hot rocks, wind, biofuels,\nnuclear and others.\n\nDig It: Secrets of the Soil\n\nDr. Chuck Rice\n\nDid you know that soils are part of our everyday lives? Soil contributes to medicines,\npaint, food, energy, and clean water. We build on it, we bury things in it. Soils\nsustain us and are a critical resource of the earth. Soils aid in regulating climate,\nflooding, and disease. Soils act as an interface between the atmosphere and the groundwater,\nproviding a filter for air and water. A change in soil due to global change could\nresult in a loss of this genetic resource and the ecosystems services supplied through\nthe soil.\n\nEarthquakes and Tsunamis: Japan 2011 and Indian Ocean 2004\n\nDr. Don Von Bergen, Head of Arts, Sciences, and Business at K-State Salina\n\nThis presentation provides an overview of the geology behind earthquakes and the resulting\ntsunamis. Much of the talk will focus on the devastating earthquakes and resulting\ntsunamis that occurred in Japan and Indonesia in 2011 and 2004. The format of the\ntalk is an interactive PowerPoint slideshow. Questions and discussion is encouraged.\nNo prior knowledge is needed. This talk can be adapted to any age group.\n\nExploration, Drilling and Oil Production in the Gulf of Mexico\n\nDr. Don Von Bergen\n\nThis talk is an overview of the geology and operations involved in exploring for,\ndrilling, and ultimately producing oil and natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico. It is\ndesigned to give the audience a better understanding of the methods used to find oil\/natural\ngas in the Gulf, major steps and technology involved in safely drilling an oil well,\nand the steps taken to safely and efficiently produce it. Some of the discussion will\nfocus on the factors that can lead to a \"blow-out\" and subsequent explosion like occurred\non the Deepwater Horizon, resulting in the \"infamous\" April 2010 oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe format of the talk is an interactive PowerPoint slideshow. Questions and discussion\nare encouraged. No prior knowledge is needed. The talk can be adapted to any age group.\n\nFriend or Defriend: Managing Your App\n\nFrom Molecular Sociology to Smart Materials\n\nDr. Christer Aakeroy, Professor of Chemistry\n\nHow do molecules communicate with each other? Why do some molecules like each other\nand others do not? Any biological system relies on molecular recognition, binding,\nand function, and if we could improve our understanding of these processes we would\nbe able to build new materials that are faster, smarter, or cheaper than current alternatives.\n\nThis lecture will (a) present some strategies for how we can begin to build new molecular\narchitectures and (b) describe how these structures can be used for materials applications,\nincluding molecular filters that will selectively capture and destroy a variety of\ntoxins.\n\nGreening the Greyscape: Sustainable Urban Stormwater Management\n\nUrban stormwater runoff has been identified as a major non-point source contributor.\nLoadings of heavy metals, sediments, and excess nutrients have been identified in\nurban runoff. Impervious surfaces in urban areas exacerbate the problem by increasing\nthe volume and flow rate of runoff and providing an area for contaminants to accumulate\nbefore wash off. The most effective mechanism for controlling urban NPS pollution\nis to reduce the amount of runoff through infiltration and storage on the landscape.\nMoving water into the ground reduces the volume of water immediately hitting steams,\nditches, and channels. Vegetation helps in stormwater structures by reducing erosion,\nincreasing filtration, and using water and nutrients for normal plant functions.\n\nLasers: The Light Fantastic\n\nWe will look at lasers and other light sources to determine what is special about\nlasers. We will then delve deeper into the nature of light, its color and how it is\ncreated. We will also discuss feedback and how it can be used to create very intense\nlight. All this comes together when we take a laser apart to see how it works. Time\npermitting we will explore some applications of laser light. This talk is very demonstration\nintensive and has proven to be very entertaining for both the students and the lecturer.\n\nNew Media and Global Everything\n\nDr. Thomas Gould\n\nNew Media and Your Hometown\n\nDr. Thomas Gould\n\nSome Serious Fun in Fluid Mechanics\n\nDr. Larry A. Glasgow\n\nThis presentation consists of an introduction to rheology and elementary flows; the\nmaterial is related to everyday physical experience through numerous examples and\ndemonstrations. For example, flow regimes (laminar and turbulent) are discussed with\nthe introduction of the Reynolds number, and examples of both are brought forward.\n\nBasic features of lift and drag are described within the context of sports: the behavior\nof balls in flight can be used to explain a number of important concepts in fluid\nmechanics. Also, a number of common rotational fluid motions (vortices) are described\nwith examples. This talk should make it possible for audience members to explore their\nenvironment with appreciation for the importance of dynamic fluid behavior.\n\nTechnology in Animal Agriculture: Frankenfoods or Solution to Hunger?\n\nA wide range of technologies, including pharmaceuticals, recombinant proteins, assisted\nreproductive techniques, modern genetics, and probiotics are used to improve production\nefficiencies in animal agriculture. A number of these technologies raise concerns\namong consumers, yet few understand the issues involved. This presentation will discuss\nthe logical framework that is used to evaluate technologies for use in animal agriculture,\nthe regulatory process by which new technologies are evaluated and the tradeoffs between\nvery broad or very limited use of such technologies.\n\nAt a time when society has concerns about the ozone layer, footprints, and global\nwarming, appreciation and awareness for our environment is higher than before in history.\nThe mass media utilizes words such as \"accountability\" and \"responsible use\" as a\nmeans for emphasizing the fact that conscientious consumption of our natural resources\nand recycling is everybody's business. Individuals or groups cannot participate in\nthis effort unless they are aware of the need and know some strategies for integrating\nenvironmental awareness into their daily lives. Many organizations do not reinforce\nor reward environmental awareness. There is little few formal training that teaches\nreuse and recycling and much of society views these activities as something that is\neveryone else's responsibility. This workshop will share ways your entire organization\ncan be a part of these efforts without a huge budget, hiring on extra staff, or implementing\ntime-consuming programs.\n\nThe objectives for this session are to: 1. Explain the benefits of knowing factual information related to nature and our environment. 2. Explore how lifestyles affect our natural environment. 3. Discuss various strategies that contribute to sustainability. 4. Provide practical ideas of how individuals can be conscientious consumers."}

And when they look in familiar places, they find new ones. In 2009, Dana Willner, a biologist at San Diego State University, led a virus-hunting expedition into the human body. The scientists had ten people cough up sputum and spit it into a cup. Five of the people were sick with cystic fibrosis, and five were healthy. Out of that fluid, Willner and her team fished out fragments of DNA, which they compared to databases of the tens of millions of genes already known to science. Before Willner's study, the lungs of healthy people were believed to be sterile. But Willner and her colleagues discovered that all their subjects, sick and healthy alike, carried viral menageries in their chests. On average, each person had 174 species of viruses in the lungs. But only 10 percent of those species bore any close kinship to any virus ever found before.\"\u2014Carl Zimmer - A Planet of Viruses"}

Some of these rocks came from NASA's Spirit Mars rover, which scientists compared to Martian meteorites that had crash landed on Earth. Spirit's rocks came from a 3.7 billion-year old section of the planet, and shows signs of early exposure to oxygen before they sank back into the terrain. The Martian meteorites however, came from deep within the surface, which is why they seem to appear unaffected by any form of oxygen-containing atmosphere.\n\nThe wall-less restaurant is surrounded by a lake, and its roof is made from bamboo, interwoven with layers of thatch and fibre-reinforced plastic.

{"text":"Lab life\n\nExpect observations on lab life, fish life and the outside world in this mixed up blog.\n\nThe thoughts and opinions expressed in this blog are not those of the University of Sheffield or the CDBG, and should not be seen as such.\n\nTo comment on a post using twitter use the hashtag #lablife\n\nScience and cartoons\n\nTwo pieces of news caught my eye today; a new mushroom has been described and named, and Sonic the Hedgehog, a video game character is 20 today. Read on to find out what the connection between them is.\n\nOpinions are divided, heated debates can be heard in science departments the world over, the bone of contention? Should new genes, species, disease and other discoveries be named in an orderly fashion, or at the whimsy of the discoverer?\n\nThe privilege of naming a new discovery has long been the reward for diligence and hard work. Immortalizing oneself or an admired contemporary was the traditional choice. But more imaginative choices have also been made.\n\nOne of my favourites, and close to my heart, are the members of the hedgehog gene family.The first Hegehog gene was discovered in 1978 by Christiane N\u00fcsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus, in the fruitfly, Drosophila. If Drosophila lack the gene for Hedgehog, they have a thick coat of spikes (called denticles) that reminded the scientists of a hegehog, and so that's what they named it.\n\nLater, similar genes were found in vertebrates, but instead of there being just one Hedgehog gene, there were multiple, and they needed to be distinguished from each other, two were named after hedgehog species, Indian and Desert, whilst the most famous (and most biologically active) was amusingly named Sonic, after the video game character.\n\nFruitfly genes provide fertile ground for interesting names, such as the two mutants amnesiac and cheapdate. They're both have defects in the same gene (called amnesiac), whilst the mutant amnesiac has memory loss, the change that causes the cheapdate phenotype (physical manifestation of a gene), lowers the fly's tolerance to alcohol.\n\nOther favourites are; methuselah, which increases the lifespan of flies, named after the biblical figure who lived to 969, stargazer mutants look up over and over (due to an affect on the cerubelum) and brainiacflies have much larger brains then normal.\n\nZebrafish gene names are often imaginative too, such as the class of blood mutants, that were discovered by the Zon lab, which are named after fine wines, such as chardonnay, chablis and merlot (rumour has it that the discoverer of a new gene in the lab is awarded a bottle of the corresponding wine \u2013 hence a increase in more obscure and expensive wines as time has gone on!)\n\nUnderstandably perhaps, the penchant for amusing names in science seems be dying out, in favour of methodical, structured naming, saving doctors from having to give the unfortunate news, for example, that a patient has a mutation in swiss cheese(which results in holes in the brain although for the record, I know of no patients that have this mutation!)\n\nHowever, wit amongst scientists has not been lost forever, for today I learned of a new species of mushroom, discovered by researchers from San Fransisco State University, that is shaped like a sea sponge, and was therefore named: Spongiforma squarepantsiiafter the yellow-marine dwelling-cartoon character.\n\nThis makes me happy.\n\nWhy genetics isn't the answer to every question\n\nWhen I meet someone new, and they ask me what I do, I tend to say I study genetics. It's a word people are familiar with, and they may even have some idea of what it means, but I often find many don't. (If I bring up the zebrafish first, I suspect they go away thinking I'm a marine biologist, after all, it took me a number of years and the establishment of fishforscience to persuade my mother otherwise!)\n\nThe media's insistence on saying that any newly discovered gene function means it's the gene 'FOR' something has probably distorted many people's ideas about what genetics is about and what it's really 'FOR'. Although I often talk about the diseases I study, I try and emphasize that the genes aren't there to cause disease, as really the genetic disease is often caused by the lack of the gene. So perhaps the headline should read: \"Gene for Health discovered\", though I guess that would get repetitive after a while.\n\nIn this interesting article from Prof Stephen Jones on the BBC website, he bemoans the newspaper headlines and highlights the many holes we have in our knowledge of what does cause us to be different from each other (whilst still clearly looking like our parents). The bottom line is, that genetics are complicated, and rarely does one gene explain a dramatic change in our appearance or health.\n\nFact or Fiction\n\nThe lovely science team at the BBC have created another little quiz for us to play with. This one tests your knowledge of fact or fantasy in science.\n\nClick the image to go to the quiz.\n\nAs you can see, I did ok, but I'm pretty sure I should have done better! (But I like being a Professor)\n\nIve had a Brainwave\n\nThrough the support of the British Science Association and the University of Sheffield a team of enthusiastic scientists, mathematicians, engineers and artists are aiming to bring science to the masses. The Science Brainwaves team take part in heaps of activities in and around Sheffield, and have even been known to escape Yorkshire and have traveled as far as the casino en ligne francais Brecon Beacons (although I don't think any of them were complaining about casino online running an experimental \"Einsteins Kitchen\" at the Green Man festival!)\n\nKnow your scientists\n\nScience on TV is absolutely essential, getting the public to understand what, how and why scientists do the work we do is fundamental to ensuring we continue to be supported by public funds. The BBC does a pretty good job of producing science programs, the latest Horizon series has casino poland been particularly fantastic. But how well do casino online you know the scientists that have brought us the biggest advances in our knowledge? Why not take their fun why not take their quiz and see how much general knowledge has seeped into your brain?

The urine undergoes a distillation process and then joins other recovered fluids like sweat and water vapor in the water processor. The processor filters out solids before sending the waste water through a series of multi-filtration beds to remove contaminants. The new system will also cut the annual cost of shipping supplies to the space station.\n\nBreastfeeding Improves Lung Health\n\nA new study by UK and US scientists found that breastfeeding improves lung function in children, BBC reports. Researchers studied 1,456 babies from the Isle of Wight to their 10th year, and found that those who were breast fed for at least four months could blow out more air after taking a deep breath, and could blow it out faster.

{"text":"While checking my daily science sources, I ran across this interactive tour of Titan at the Cassini web site. It lets you peer beneath the heavy clouds that hide this world from our view.\n\nTitan is the largest moon orbiting Saturn and is a fascinating blend of organic materials in its atmosphere and on its surface. The Cassini mission to Saturn will pass by this fascinating place 45 times during its extended exploration. What planetary scientists are finding here may well rewrite the books on many aspects of solar system science.\n\nImagine that an astronomer announces the discovery of a new planet in our solar system. Imagine that that planet has life on it and that it may actually be intelligent life. That science is peer-reviewed and other scientists agree that there is a discovery here.\n\nNow, imagine that a non-scientist political appointee to NASA decides that the discovery doesn't conform to White House guidelines on what science should be, and so he yanks the report and hides it from the media and public.\n\nImagine that a medical researcher discovers a treatment that can completely cure AIDS. It is tested and seems to work on all patients who have AIDS. Or that the doctor finds a cure for breast cancer.\n\nNow, imagine that a non-medical political appointee to National Institutes of Health decides that the breakthroughs are \"controversial\" because they doesn't conform to White House guidelines about what diseases should be treated and which ones shouldn't. So, the NIH is directed (by non-scientists) stop the research and refuse treatment to people who need the cure.\n\nImagine that a research team finds a way to create fuels from some commonly available ingredients. The team tests it and shows that it could reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and could also help our economy.\n\nNow imagine that a White House operative decides that this breakthrough is directly athwart political goals and therefore isn't in the best interest of the business community. And so he yanks the research and hides it.\n\nAs far as I know, none of these scenarios have happened.\n\nYet. But they (or similar ones) will.\n\nWhy? The White House in the U.S. is now putting non-science political appointees in agencies to control the science and its outcomes. Why? Partly so that this administration can direct science and hide anything that may be inconvenient or perceived as a threat to its ideology.\n\nWhy, that sounds very familiar. Didn't they used to do that in communist countries? Don't they still do that in some countries?\n\nWe all know what the 800-pound gorilla in the room is here: global warming. Suddenly the reports on global warming are coming out, and even as manipulated as they are by industry heavies, the word isn't good. In the U.S., the president is largely handicapped by truth and reality, and so now he must put in his operatives to control science's truths in order to effect some sort of reality that assumes that if they manipulate science, nobody will notice that things are going wrong.\n\nToday's news stories are pointing to some inconvenient truths about acts of scientific sabotage by the Bush administration. Here are the links.\n\nScience and Politics\nAnd there are more. These articles all describe a bad precedent of politically motivated ideologues in government interfering in the workings of science, and not in a good way. Would you want the government to interfere in a family member's chance for a cure? For your ability to travel to your job using clean fuels? For a scientist's discovery to be announced free of political interference? Think that interfering in science just inconveniences scientists? Think again. It's not just politics as usual. Unwarranted political interference in science harms us all for the benefit of a few.\n\nBlogrolls are interesting things. I use mine to link to places I like to visit, and I hope you like to visit them, too. I don't always agree with every view on every blog I link to, but I do find them all to be thought-provoking and worth my time to visit when I get a chance.\n\nA few years ago I happened across an online \"stock market\" in blogs called BlogShares. Instead of real-life stocks, this game trades in blogs. As you can imagine, there are blogs that talk about nearly every facet of human existence, literally from A to Z. Blogshares lists them (and gains listings every day) in categories called \"Industries.\" A blog's value is based on how many links go to and from it. The site estimates the value of a blog and sells shares in it.\n\nI was intrigued by it, so I listed my blog and started playing the game. I worked my way up into the top 200 players (although I'm certainly not the wealthiest player in the game), and have learned a lot about the amazing variety of blogs out there, simply by reading the blogs I've visited as I played the game. Not that I have as much time to play as much as I once did. Work and real life do have a way of intruding into game play, but I still make trades, vote on blogs, moderate votes that others make on blogs, and in general, keep my finger on the pulse of the game as I have free time to do so.\n\nI'm not going to get into the specifics of the game; if you're interested, go check it out. But, I do want to mention how many very cool and interesting people are playing it. There are folks from around the world playing 24\/7, buying and selling shares, trading in \"ideas\" (which are another unit of exchange in the game), and sharing their tips on how to play the game in the online discussion forum attached to the game.\n\nWhen I first began playing the game, it was still being run by its inventor, a student named Seyed Razavi (who eventually sold it to the group that runs it today). He didn't actually start out to create a strict copy of a stock market so much as he wanted to explore social networking through the exploration of the blogging phenomenon by using a game to do so. He also wanted to explore how power law theories might work in human networking systems.\n\nA power law basically says that over time, any system will evolve to favor a small subset of users\/units\/participants, or, in other applications, a small subset of participants or objects in a given system will consume the majority of the system's resources. You could say, for example, that when a planetary system begins to form, the largest bodies will gather in the most amount of system resources; i.e., the large planets get larger, possibly at the expense of the smaller ones.\n\nFor blogs, the power law shows that some blogs get more attention than others; they get larger numbers of sites linking to them, and so forth.\n\nThe power law distribution as applied to blogs is an interesting use of a scientific statistical tool to measure human interactions on the Web. And, Blogshares both shares in that power law and facilitates interactions by rewarding sites with more links a higher value than those with few or no links. My own blog has about 51 links to it (some from other BlogShares users), and is valued reasonably well (in the 500s per share). The sites with the most links to them, like Flickr, have very high share values (in the millions of dollars per share).\n\nSome years ago, before the Web was a huge presence in our lives, the idea that getting on the computer and socially interacting was a new one. It's interesting that the \"geeks\" among us (me included) are often derided in the media for being anti-social nerds because we interact via computer networks.\n\nBut, as it turns out, the social interactions we're now doing on computer networks are following some of the same laws of interaction and social structure that we see in real life (when, for example, small subsets of our societies control 80 percent of wealth and commodities). The power law does, indeed, describe an interesting human propensity to \"cluster\" in our online activities, even as we do in \"real life.\" And, for those who have been playing Blogshares and didn't know it, we've all been taking part in a social and science experiment. It reminds me of the old days, when Xerox and their PARC facility used to invite people to participate in MUD (Multi-User Domains) so they could study and model human interactions.\n\nIn that game, I actually built a home in a virtual ski area in New Mexico. I had an art gallery, a pool, a salon (wherein I invited guests to come in and debate various issues), and a front room where I interviewed guests for my home. Other people had built virtual homes in the MUD (it was called Lambdamoo), and so each personal \"space\" was like an extension of a person's imagination. The interactions were great fun, sometimes disturbing, and always way more than I ever imagined we'd see on a computer network way back when I first learned to program computers in high school in the early 1970s.\n\nOf course, today we have gone way beyond the MOOs and MUDs of yesteryear to places like SecondLife, which purports to be a parallel life online. (I haven't visited it, not sure if I really have time), and forums like BadAstronomy (where all of us astronomy- and science-minded folk can talk about our mutual interests). But, it may well turn out to be not terribly different from the MOOs and MUDs, forums and BlogShares\u2014online places where humans can network in yet another way, among the endless varieties of networks we already have. And, as it does, it will go into competition for that most valuable of resource: user time, sucking it in according to the power law that states that the most popular ones will end up taking the most attention from users. An interesting experiment, indeed"}

Paul's brand new series Britain's Secret Seas will air on Sunday 8 May on BBC 2.\n\nLoading...\n\nExecutive Vice-President of Earthwatch, Nigel Winser, said: \"This year we celebrate our 40th anniversary - 40 years of pioneering 'citizen science'. At Earthwatch we believe that engaging all areas of society in the tough environmental challenges that we face is the future. Protecting our planet for future generations is a huge and complex task. This is why motivating a worldwide taskforce of people dedicated to protecting our planet is crucial.\"\n\nPaul Rose added: \"I've experienced first-hand the degradation of some of the most beautiful and species-rich environments on our planet. We do not have the luxury of time to safeguard these precious resources for future generations. By involving many thousands of people from all over the world in hands-on data collection, Earthwatch is able to massively accelerate the rate at which we are able to gather the information we need to make bold and informed conservation decisions.\"\n\nAt the lecture, marine scientist Dr William Megill from the University of Bath talked about the contribution that Earthwatch volunteers have made to his research into grey whales and turtles in the North Pacific for the past ten years. Dr Megill showed how technology has developed from 35mm film cameras and hours of dark-room work, to modern and accurate GPS (Global Positioning Systems) which allow precise data to be obtained remotely. His research is also experimenting with the development of new submersible robots.\n\nDr Megill explained how Earthwatch volunteers are crucial to generating high quality data and conservation success. Dr Megill said: 'Without the many pairs of hands that volunteers are able to provide to assist researchers, the delicate instrumentation which we rely on would just be flotsam collecting barnacles on the ocean.\"\n\nAround 450 people attended the event at the Royal Geographical Society.\n\nFrom the University of Oxford, scientist Dr Chris Newman who, together with Dr Christina Buesching, is researching climate change impacts on the mammal populations of Nova Scotia, presented their series of landmark papers highlighting how, with the right training, volunteers from all walks of life can make a significant contribution to the study of ecosystems and climate change.

Well, that's not all\nleeches are good for. Ida B\u00e6rholm Schnell and Philip Thomsen and their\ncolleagues from the University of Copenhagen and the University of Cambridge\nhave been using the little parasites to catalogue endangered species.\n\nIt's exceedingly difficult to monitor rare mammals in remote\nregions because, well, the animals are rare and the regions are remote. Unlike\nhumans, leeches seem to have no trouble finding mammals. Thanks to modern\nsequencing techniques, mammalian DNA can be extracted from leeches after their\nlast blood meal. What makes leeches particularly useful is that fact that they\nstore this meal for many months.\n\nAfter successfully testing the extraction of goat DNA from\nleeches killed four months after their last meal, the scientists left the lab\nand set out to collect leeches from the dense forests of the Central Annamite\nregion of Vietnam. Almost all the captured leeches (21 our of 25) contained\nmammalian DNA. Six different mammals had donated their blood to the leeches, two of which had only recently been described\nand two others of which were considered 'threatened'.\n\nLeeches come to you with the blood\nsamples, rather than you tracking down the animals in the jungle. Simple and\ncheap, and the sampling does not require specially trained scientists, but can\nbe carried out by local people.

But what about \"colorism\"? If you don't know, colorism is the sub-prejudice that finds people treating people of color differently based on how light or dark their skin is. Though it's rarely talked about, colorism is a major cause for concern in courtrooms around the United States, according to a new study.\n\n.\n\nColorism doesn't just impact criminals, either.

In order to see that invisible part of the world, we need this special machinery.\"\n\nThe free database works by combining \"spectroreflective\" measurements of petals and leaves with micro-electrode-based studies of how different insects see, so that researchers can generate different views of each plant depending on the pollinator they are studying.\n\nThe resulting images are gorgeous, but understanding how the world appears to insects is not just a scientific party trick. According to Chittka, the database has a range of important potential uses, not least of which is in food production:\n\n\"Every third bite that you consume at the dinner table is the result of insect pollinators' work. In order to utilize insects for commercial pollination purposes, we need to understand how insects see flowers.\n\nWe need to understand what kind of a light climate we need to generate in commercial glass houses to facilitate detection of flowers by bees.\"\n\nI absolutely love this idea: instead of simply constructing greenhouses, we could be designing lightscapes for optimal pollination.

This is the promise of a world changing idea and this month's Scientific American highlights 20 such projects that could build a cleaner, healthier, smarter world.\n\nTrapping lightning to zap garbage and generate electricity or a lab on a stamp to monitor liver damage using a single drop of blood; the ideas highlight the power of science and technology to improve the world. Another project in the pipeline plans tiny sensors to allow us to index the physical world the way the Web maps cyberspace. The Central Nervous System for the Earth (CeNSE) has multiple applications from reduction of energy use, to rehabilitation of stroke patients. The simpler idea of marine zoning features too, with just such wide reaching implications for our sick seas. A related Perspectives column in the issue also argues that the time when we could do anything we want with the oceans is over.\n\nThe five categories: energy, transportation, environment, electronics and robotics, and health and medicine, each contain a key idea along with 'ones to watch', and All projects were chosen by Scientific American's board of editors in consultation with its advisory board. All show that innovation is the most promising elixir for what ails us.\n\nMedicine: The Double Life of ATP p84\nA few decades after ATP was identified as a universal energy currency inside cells, another controversial discovery was made about the small molecule \u2013 its role in signalling between cells. This month in Scientific American, Baljit S. Khakh and Geoffrey Burnstock chronicle the tumultuous journey taken to better understand the dual role of ATP. Burnstock \u2013 a pioneer of the field \u2013 began studying ATP's signalling role early in his career. The legacy of his work continues through Khakh and other scientists who build on this to better understand human diseases and new therapeutic options.\n\nFifty years ago, scientists observed a role for ATP outside of cells and soon thereafter Burnstock and colleagues observed that motor nerves and muscle cells use ATP to communicate with each other. However, the idea of ATP as a neurotransmitter was controversial and not accepted by the scientific community until the 1990s. Since then, researchers have identified two types of ATP receptors, which can lead to either short term changes \u2013 such as muscle contraction \u2013 or long term effects \u2013 such as gene activation within cells. Khakh and colleagues have advanced the understanding of how these different receptors work and how they can be utilized for new types of drugs.\n\nBecause ATP is ubiquitous, the molecule's influences can vary from tissue to tissue, offering new insights into a wide range of disorders and diverse ways to treat them. The authors conclude: \"It is gratifying for us to see how the role of ATP as a signaling molecule has gone from an idea that was widely deemed dubious 50 years ago to a large and vibrant field of inquiry today of interest to the entire biology community and of great potential import to medicine.\"\n\nCommentary: War is Peace p40\n24-hour news channels and the limitless expanse of the Internet have provided us with a staggering amount of information, as well as an onslaught of disinformation, as stated in a commentary in this month's issue of Scientific American. Lawrence M. Krauss further argues that in this cacophony, there is a critical role for science: to utilize empirical testing to discern which claims have merit and which should be tossed aside.\n\nThe health care debate in the United States sparked various claims and propaganda which rapidly spread. Krauss argues, \"fair and balanced\" reporting does not mean that all information, regardless of how outrageous, should receive equal coverage.\n\nIt is up to science and scientific methodology to help guide the way in discerning between various claims. So far it has failed in this task, prompting Krauss to ask why: \"Is it because we do such a miserable job in schools teaching what science is all about \u2013 that it is not a collection of facts or stories but a process for weeding out nonsense to get closer to the underlying beautiful reality of nature?\"\n\nMicroscopy Images: Illuminating the Lilliputian p94\nA gallery of images captured by light microscopy reveals the high art of the natural world in this month's Scientific American.\n\nOptical microscopy provides dazzling proof that beyond the resolution of the human eye resides a sweepingly large world of small things, both around and within us.

This ensures that they only produce flowers after the damaging cold of winter has passed. The plant must have a way of 'remembering' how much cold weather it has endured and in 2011 the researchers uncovered the mechanism plants use. When sufficient time in the cold has passed, an epigenetic switch silences a flowering-repressor gene called FLC. These epigenetic changes are then passed on to daughter cells during the rest of the plants developmental cycle.\n\nDifferent plants have different vernalization requirements, as the length of winter cold they experience varies with geography and climate. In new research published in the journal Science, Professor Dean's team have worked out how different plants set the level at which this epigenetic switch is triggered. They looked at a variety of Arabidopsis thaliana derived from North Sweden (Lov-1), and compared it to the reference 'Columbia' variety. Columbia needs 4 weeks of cold to trigger the epigenetic switch. The Lov-1 variety needs 9 weeks of cold to achieve the same, a natural variation to cope with the longer winters at northern latitudes...\"\n\n\"(ScienceDaily July 16, 2012) - New\"While the body has a capacity to repair small defects in skeletal muscle, the only option for larger defects is to surgically move muscle from one part of the body to another. This is like robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" said George Christ, Ph.D., a professor at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center's Institute for Regenerative Medicine. \"Rather than moving existing muscle, our aim is to help the body grow new muscle.\"\n\nIn the current issue of Tissue Engineering Part A, Christ and team build on their prior work and report their second round of experiments showing that placing cells derived from muscle tissue on a strip of biocompatible material -- and then \"exercising\" the strip in the lab -- results in a muscle-like implant that can prompt muscle regeneration and significant functional recovery.

Last year, the first time around, we had a blast, embarking on an Ahab-like quest for hagfish, observing the role played by mind-controlling parasites in the ecology of the island's tidal zone, learning how to use broken 300-year-old pipe stems and cod ear bones to reconstruct American's first economic boom, and much more. (Here are some articles the students wrote about their experiences.)\n\nThis year promises to be just as much fun (and intense).\n\nThe deadline for registering is April 16. You can reigster and get more information on the course page at the Shoals Marine Lab web site. (Shoals is jointly run by Cornell and the University of New Hampshire.) For those beyond college interested in the class, here are some details about taking the course non-credit.\n\nA couple of my articles are included in a new book, The New York Times Reader: Science and Technology. Edited by S. Holly Stocking, it's an anthology that can stand on its own, or serve as reading for a journalism class. Here's a description of the book from the publisher's web site:\n\nScience writing poses specific challenges: Science writers must engage their audiences while also explaining unfamiliar scientific concepts and processes. Further, they must illuminate arcane research methods and statistics andI'll be giving a talk at the Museum of Science in Boston on Saturday, April 17. It's the keynote address at the annual meeting of the Massachusetts Academy of Science. I'm going to talk about spangled dinosaurs, how scientists are splashing colors all over the history of life, and what all that color can tell us about evolution.\n\nMy talk is just one part of an all-day celebration of science for all ages. (The entire Zimmer clan will be in attendance.) For information on registration and tickets, visit the meeting web site.\n\nThere's a certain kind of headline I have become sick of: \"Scientists Have Sequenced the Genome of Species X!\"\n\nFifteen years ago, things were different. In 1995, scientists published the first complete genome of a free-living organisms ever\u2013that of a nasty germ called Haemophilus influenzae. Bear in mind, this was in the dark ages of the twentieth century, when a scientist might spend a decade trying to decipher the sequence of a single gene.\n\nAnd then, with a giant thwomp, a team of scientists dropped not just one gene, but 1740 genes, spelled out across 1.8 million base pairs of DNA. At the core of the paper was an image of the entire genome, a kaleidoscopic wheel marking all the genes that it takes to be H. influenzae. It had a hypnotizing effect, like a genomic mandala. Looking at it, you knew that biology would never be the same.\n\nLooking over that paper today, I'm struck by what a catalog it is. The authors listed every gene and sorted them by their likely function. They didn't find a lot of big surprises about H. influenzae itself. It had genes for metabolism, they reported, and genes for attaching to host cells, and for sensing the environment. But scientists already knew that. What was remarkable was the simple fact that scientists could now sequence so much DNA in so little time.\n\nThen came more microbes. Then, ten years ago this coming June, came a rough draft of the human genome. Then finished drafts of other animals: chickens, mice, flies, worms. Flowers, truffles, and malaria-causing parasites. They came faster and faster, cheaper and cheaper. The acceleration now means that the simple accomplishment of sequencing a genome is no longer news.\n\nOn Wednesday I caught a talk at Yale by Jonathan Rothberg, a scientist who invented \"next-generation sequencing\" in 2005. By sequencing vast numbers of DNA fragments at once, the new technology made it possible to get a genome's sequence far faster than earlier methods. Rothberg's company, 454, got bought up by Roche, leaving him without a lot to do. So he came up with a new machine: a genome sequencer about the size of a desktop printer that can knock out complete genomes with high accuracy in a matter of hours. Rothberg has been unveiling details of the machine over the past few weeks. To convince his audience that the machine actually works, he flashed another mandala wheel\u2013the 4.7 million base pairs of E. coli.\n\nI recalled when the first E. coli genome was published in 1997. It was the result of years of work by 17 co-authors, an event celebrated in newspapers. Now Rothberg just threw up a quick slide of the germ's genome just to show what he could do in a matter of hours. And I have to say that the sight of yet another circular map of a genome, on its own, no longer gave me a thrill. It's a bit like someone waving you over to a telescope and saying, \"Look! I found a star!\"\n\nWhat remains truly exciting is the kind of research starts after the genomes are sequenced: discovering what genes do, mapping out the networks in which genes cooperate, and reconstructing the deep history of life. Thanks to the hundreds of genomes of microbes scientists can now compare, for example, they can see how the history of life is, in some ways, more like a web than a tree. Insights like these are newsworthy. The sequencing of those genomes, on its own, is not.\n\nAnd yet my email inbox still gets overwhelmed with press releases about the next new genome sequence. The press releases typically read like this:\n\n\"Scientists have sequenced the genome of species X. Their research, published today in the Journal of Terribly Important Studies, will lead to new insights about this important species. Maybe it will even cure cancer or eliminate world hunger!\"\n\nAnd then those press releases give rise to news articles. Here are dozens of pieces that came out over the past couple days, describing the freshly-sequenced genome of the zebra finch. What did the scientists actually learn about zebra finches through this exercise? The articles typically referred to 800 genes involved in the birds learning how to sing. Of course, nobody seriously would expect them to use just one or two genes for something so complex, so this was no big surprise. The articles also mentioned that a lot of the genes were similar to human language genes. This is not really news, either. For the most part, the articles look to the future\u2013to experiments that scientists will be able to do on zebra finches, in the hopes of learning about human speech. But that's not news of an achievement\u2013that's a promise.\n\nPerhaps press release writers and journalists are still operating on the assumption that any new genome is news. But that assumption has been wrong for years now. Let's wait to see what scientists actually discover in those marvelous mandalas.\n\n[Update: Thanks to Jonathan Eisen for coining the easy-t0-remember acronym for my current disorder: YAGS. That goes into my personal lexicon right away.]\n\nThis morning, during my daily graze of news and commentary, I've come across some fairly excellent science-themed April Fool's jokes. But it will take an exceptional hoax to mount a serious challenge to what is arguably the finest science-themed April Fool's joke of all time, which today celebrates its fifteenth anniversary: the tale of the hotheaded naked ice borer.\n\nThen-Discover-senior-editor, now-contributing-editor, and forever-all-around-good-guy Tim Folger concocted an article detailing the mystery of penguins vanishing from sight, and the discovery of a thermally endowed rodent that melted the ice under their feet and dragged them into their frozen tunnels.\n\nIn fairness to the fooled, science is often so bizarre, it's not always easy to distinguish the reality from the hoax. (And fortunately, this morning's good news about science writer's Simon Singh's victory against chiropractors and the ridiculous libel laws of England is no joke.) So far, here the ones I've encountered that have made me smile\u2026add you own in the comment thread.\n\nCorey writes, \"I got this tattoo as an homage to the pain of my graduate work. It's a model of fulvic acid which is a representation of natural organic matter in the soil. I work with this molecule for my grad work and I figured I might as well get it etched into my skin so I can look at it and say, 'Well, at least it hurt less than grad school at Cornell.'\"\n\nMost of life on Earth is a mystery to us. The bulk of biomass on the planet is made up of microbes. By some estimates, there may be 150 million species of bacteria, but scientists have only formally named a few thousand of them. One of the big causes of this ignorance is that scientists don't know how to raise microbe colonies. If you scoop up some dirt and stick it under a microscope, you'll see lots of different microbes living happily there. If you mash up all the DNA in that mud and read its sequence, you'll discover an astonishing diversity of genes belonging to those microbes\u2013thousands in a single spoon of soil. But now try to rear those microbes in a lab. When scientists try, they generally fail. A tiny fraction of one percent of microbe species will grow under ordinary conditions in Petri dish.\n\nThis staggering difficulty is the reason why E. coli and a few other species became the laboratory darlings of biologists during the 1900s. As I write in Microcosm, E. coli will happily explode in a flask full of broth. As a result, a lot of what we know about life we know from E. coli. Certainly a lot of those lessons hold true for any species\u2013genes encoded in DNA, DNA used to produce RNA and proteins, a genetic code, and so on. But there are a lot of microbes that are very unlike E. coli. Even in our gut, for example, E. coli is just a minor player in an ecosystem made up of hundreds or thousands of species. Yet we know relatively little about its neighbors.\n\nOne reason for the trouble we have in raising microbes is that the environment we like is not the environment a lot of them like. If you are feeding on minerals in boiling water at the bottom of the ocean, it's possible that you might find life in a luke-warm flask in an oxygen-rich atmosphere at sea-level air pressure unbearable\u2013perhaps even toxic.\n\nBut the physical surroundings of microbes can't account for all the trouble they pose for would-be microbial zoo-keepers. If you scoop up some wet sand from a pleasant beach, you will still be hard-pressed to get more than a few species to grow in the lab.\n\nTo coax bacteria to grow, microbiologists have been upgrading their Petri dishes. They have been building cages that mimic the natural habitat of the bacteria, and in some cases taking their chambers out of the lab and putting them in the environments where the bacteria live.\n\nThese semi-wild chambers have brought scientists more success, and they've also helped scientists figure out why the microbes are so hard to grow in the first place. Along with the right physical conditions, microbes need to live alongside the right microbes.\n\nIn the new issue of Chemistry and Biology, a team of scientists\u2013led by Anthony D'Onofrio, a post-doc in the laboratory of Kim Lewis at Northeastern University, and Jason Crawford in the lab of Jon Clardy at Harvard\u2013report a striking success in cultivating bacteria that were previously impossible to cultivate. They made their discovery while studying some bacteria that live on a beach near Boston. Some of the bacteria, while unable to grow on their own in a Petri dish, grew if they were near certain other species. Perhaps, the scientists speculated, the hard-to-grow bacteria depended on something the other species made.\n\nThe scientists tested different molecules made by bacteria to see if any of them were fostering the growth. They eventually figured out that the responsible molecule was something known as a siderophore. Some species of bacteria make siderophores as a way to get their minimal daily required does of iron. Iron is essential for the growth of cells, but in many environments free iron is in short supply. So bacteria make iron-trapping molecules\u2013siderophores\u2013and release them through special channels. The siderophores drift around, and sometimes manage to snag iron atoms. They fold up around the iron, assuming a shape that allows them to slip through other channels back into the bacteria. Once inside, they open up again and set their iron free.\n\nIt turns out that a lot of species on the beaches around Boston\u2013and presumably in a lot of other places in the world\u2013don't make their own siderophores. Instead, they rely on other species to produce siderophores, and once those molecules swallow up the iron, the bacteria that don't make siderophores snatch them up. The scientists found that with different kinds of siderophores made by different species of bacteria, they could suddenly get a lot of microbes to grow.\n\nDiscoveries like these are exciting both in a practical and intellectual way. We've already harvested lots of valuable molecules from microbes, such as antibiotics and gene-copying enzymes. If scientists can raise lots of new species of microbes, they may be able to find new molecules. But the result is fascinating in itself. Apparently, a lot of microbial species depend on the kindness of strangers. And apparently, there are bacteria out there that are churning out siderophores despite the fact that other species are slurping up the iron they forage. If that was all there was to the story, this would not be a situation that could last long. The cheaters would thrive by skipping the effort of making siderophores, and eventually there wouldn't be enough honest bacteria left to keep all the microbes supplied with their iron. It's likely, instead, that the cheaters are not cheaters at all, but rather have services of their own to offer the microbial community.\n\nAnd so the reason that we know so little about life on Earth may be that we have yet to figure out the complicated social life of microbes.\n\nToday Discover gains two new bloggers: Razib Khan and Ed Yong.

{"text":"You might not need a whole 1.21 gigawatts to travel through time, after all.\n\nComputer engineers at the University of California at Berkeley have found a way to reduce the minimum voltage required to store a charge in a capacitor--an electron-storing device that works somewhat like a battery--paving the way for ultra-low-power computing. This is a result of a project started in 2008 and led by Asif Khan, a UC Berkeley electrical engineering graduate student, and Sayeef Salahuddin, a UC Berkeley assistant professor of electrical engineering.\n\nThe engineers took advantage of ferroelectrics, a class of materials that can hold both positive and negative electric charges, even when there's no voltage applied. On top of that, the electrical polarization in ferroelectrics can be reversed with an external electric field.\n\nThe team was able to demonstrate that when a capacitor made of ferroelectric-based materials was paired with an electric insulator, the charge accumulated for a given voltage could be amplified in a phenomenon called \"negative capacitance.\" This means you can create a charge that would normally require a higher voltage. And this, when applied to transistors--the on-off switch components that generate the zeros and ones that are the core of binary computing used in all personal computers--would translate into lower minimum voltage required to operate a computer processor. \u2026 Read more\n\nBenjamin Franklin once advised a friend to take older women to bed because, figuratively speaking, \"in the dark all cats are gray.\" Well, not these kittehs.\n\nResearchers in the U.S. and Japan have developed green-glowing kittens with resistance to the feline version of AIDS, which may help work on AIDS research in humans.\n\nIn a study published in Nature Methods, researchers from the Mayo Clinic and Yamaguchi University took a genome approach to producing cats that are apparently resistant to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), a deadly condition that attacks infection-fighting T-cells as AIDS does.\n\nThe researchers including Mayo Clinic molecular biologist Eric Poeschla inserted genes into feline eggs before sperm fertilization. They added a gene for a rhesus macaque protein, known as a \"restriction factor,\" that can prevent infection by FIV, and a jellyfish gene for tracking the cells that also makes the kitties glow a spooky green.\n\nWhen cells were taken from the cats and exposed to FIV, they were found to be resistant; the animals themselves will also be exposed to the virus in the future. \u2026IBM has inked a deal with health insurer WellPoint that will let the latter use the technology behind \"Jeopardy\"-playing computer Watson to suggest patient diagnoses and treatments.\n\nThe arrangement, which marks the first time the Watson technology will be used in a commercial application, will be announced Monday, according to The Wall Street Journal.

We rely on hundreds of thousands of such people to use science and engineering methods to benefit society.\n\nQuite a fun video. Frans de Waal shows us a task he gave Capuchin monkeys to see if they responded to a sense of fairness. See the rest of the talk.\n\nFrans de Waal is a Dutch primatologist and ethologist. He is the Charles Howard Candler professor of Primate Behavior in the Emory University psychology department in Atlanta, Georgia. His research centers on primate social behavior, including conflict resolution, cooperation, inequity aversion, and food-sharing.\n\nThe largest comprehensive analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov finds that clinical trials are falling short of producing high-quality evidence needed to guide medical decision-making.\n\nThe analysis, published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found the majority of clinical trials is small, and there are significant differences among methodical approaches, including randomizing, blinding and the use of data monitoring committees.\n\nThis is a critical issue as medical studies continue to leave quite a bit to be desired. Even more importantly the failure to systemically study and share evidence of effectiveness once treatments are authorized leaves a great deal to be desired. On top of leaving quite a bit to be desired, the consequences are serious. If we make mistakes for example in how we date fossils it matters but it is unlikely to cause people their lives or health. Failure to adequately manage and analyze health care experiments may very well cost people their health or lives.\n\n\"Our analysis raises questions about the best methods for generating evidence, as well as the capacity of the clinical trials enterprise to supply sufficient amounts of high quality evidence to ensure confidence in guideline recommendations,\" said Robert Califf, MD, first author of the paper, vice chancellor for clinical research at Duke University Medical Center, and director of the Duke Translational Medicine Institute.\n\nThe analysis was conducted by the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI), a public-private partnership founded by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Duke. It extends the usability of the data in ClinicalTrials.gov for research by placing the data through September 27, 2010 into a database structured to facilitate aggregate analysis.\n\n[Jonathan Grainger, researcher, Aix-Marseille University] says a baboon named Dan learned more than 300 words. \"Dan's our star baboon,\" he says. \"He's a high-performing individual, basically. He does well in most tasks.\"\n\nBut here's the amazing thing: Dan and the other baboons also learned to tell whether a string of letters they'd never seen before was an English word. That's something first-graders learn to do when they start reading, but scientists had assumed that children were simply sounding out the letters to decide whether they make sense.\n\nOf course, the baboons couldn't do this because they're not learning to read a language they already speak. They had to rely on a part of the brain that can tell whether objects fit a known pattern.\n\u2026\nMichael Platt, who directs the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, says he was surprised by what the baboons were able to do.\n\n\"I was really looking for holes to poke in this study, but it was very difficult to find any because it was really beautifully done,\" he says. \"And I think the linchpin here was that the baboons, once they had learned the rule, could generalize to new words that they had not seen before.\"\n\nPlatt says when you think about it, the finding makes sense, given what's known about human and animal brains. \"Brains are always looking for patterns,\" he says. \"They are always looking to make some statistical pattern analysis of the features and events that are in the environment. And this would just be one of those.\"\n\nPlatt says that's a big departure from the idea that reading is a direct extension of spoken language.\n\nOne questions I have, is why the experiment done in France tested wether the Baboons could recognize English words?\n\nFrom the New York Times opinion piece, Ritalin Gone Wrong, by L. Alan Sroufe is a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Minnesota's Institute of Child Development:\n\n.\n\u2026\nToBut in 2009, findings were published from a well-controlled study that had been going on for more than a decade, and the results were very clear\u2026 At first this study suggested that medication, or medication plus therapy, produced the best results. However, after three years, these effects had faded, and by eight years there was no evidence that medication produced any academic or behavioral benefits.\n\nAs I have written before I am skeptical of the amount of drug use our health care system encourages: Lifestyle Drugs and Risk.\n\nThat just 1 minute of exercise a day could help prevent diabetes seems to good to be true. But research at the University of Bath indicates it might be true. I am a bit of a soft touch for seeing the benefits of exercise. And I also love health care that focuses on achieving healthy lives instead of what most of the spending focuses on: treating illness.\n\nPerforming short cycle sprints three times a week could be enough to prevent and possibly treat Type 2 diabetes researchers at the University of Bath believe.\n\nVolunteers were asked to perform two 20-second cycle sprints, three times per week (but really this works out to under 10 minutes of total time including warm up). After six weeks researchers saw a 28% improvement in their insulin function. Type 2 diabetes occurs when blood sugar levels build up to dangerously high levels due to reduced insulin function, often caused by a sedentary lifestyle. The condition can cause life-threatening complications to the heart, kidneys, eyes and limbs, and has huge costs (monetarily and to people's lives).\n\nRegular exercise can help keep blood sugar levels low but busy lifestyles and lack of motivation mean 66% of the population is not getting the recommended five 30-minute sessions of moderate exercise a week.\n\nDr Niels Vollaard who is leading the study, said: \"Our muscles have sugar stores, called glycogen, for use during exercise. To restock these after exercise the muscle needs to take up sugar from the blood. In inactive people there is less need for the muscles to do this, which can lead to poor sensitivity to insulin, high blood sugar levels, and eventually type 2 diabetes\u2026 We already knew that very intense sprint training can improve insulin sensitivity but we wanted to see if the exercise sessions could be made easier and shorter.\"\n\nIn the study the resistance on the exercise bikes could be rapidly increased so volunteers were able to briefly exercise at much higher intensities than they would otherwise be able to achieve. With an undemanding warm-up and cool-down the total time of each session was only 10 minutes.\n\nThis type of study is very helpful in identifying solutions that will allow more people to lead healthy lives and save our economies large amount of money. Medical studies can't be accepted on face value. They are often not confirmed by future studies and therefore it is unwise to rely on the results of 1 study. The results provide interesting information but need to be confirmed (and in the area of studies on human health this has been shown to be problematic \u2013 are health is quite a tricky area to study).\n\nThe experiments, designed by psychology graduate student and first author Inbal Ben-Ami Bartal with co-authors Decety and Peggy Mason, placed two rats that normally share a cage into a special test arena. One rat was held in a restrainer device \u2014 a closed tube with a door that can be nudged open from the outside. The second rat roamed free in the cage around the restrainer, able to see and hear the trapped cagemate but not required to take action.\n\nThe researchers observed that the free rat acted more agitated when its cagemate was restrained, compared to its activity when the rat was placed in a cage with an empty restrainer. This response offered evidence of an \"emotional contagion,\" a frequently observed phenomenon in humans and animals in which a subject shares in the fear, distress or even pain suffered by another subject.\n\nWhile emotional contagion is the simplest form of empathy, the rats' subsequent actions clearly comprised active helping behavior, a far more complex expression of empathy. After several daily restraint sessions, the free rat learned how to open the restrainer door and free its cagemate. Though slow to act at first, once the rat discovered the ability to free its companion, it would take action almost immediately upon placement in the test arena.\n\n\"We are not training these rats in any way,\" Bartal said. \"To control for motivations other than empathy that would lead the rat to free its companion, the researchers conducted further experiments. When a stuffed toy rat was placed in the restrainer, the free rat did not open the door. When opening the restrainer door released his companion into a separate compartment, the free rat continued to nudge open the door, ruling out the reward of social interaction as motivation. The experiments left behavior motivated by empathy as the simplest explanation for the rats' behaviorAs a test of the power of this reward, another experiment was designed to give the free rats a choice: free their companion or feast on chocolate. Two restrainers were placed in the cage with the rat, one containing the cagemate, another containing a pile of chocolate chips. Though the free rat had the option of eating all the chocolate before freeing its companion, the rat was equally likely to open the restrainer containing the cagemate before opening the chocolate container.\n\n\"That was very compelling,\" said Mason, Professor in Neurobiology. \"It said to us that essentially helping their cagemate is on a par with chocolate. He can hog the entire chocolate stash if he wanted to, and he does not. We were shocked.\"\n\nNow that this model of empathic behavior has been established, the researchers are carrying out additional experiments. Because not every rat learned to open the door and free its companion, studies can compare these individuals to look for the biological source of these behavioral differences. Early results suggested that females were more likely to become door openers than males, perhaps reflecting the important role of empathy in motherhood and providing another avenue for study\u2026\n\nInteresting study. My guess is this is the kind of thing those that don't like science would deride. I believe in the value of science. I believe in the value of learning. I believe that such experiments are what drives science forward. I believe if you want your economy to benefit from investing in science you should be encouraging hundreds and thousands of such experiments. Funding for this study was provided by The National Science Foundation (NSF), and others.\n\nI am thankful that more and more countries are willing to invest in science, especially since the USA is showing an increasing anti-science attitude. I would rather the USA continue to believe in the value of science and other countries looked to increase investments. But, it is much better that other countries increase their interest in science, and willingness to invest in science, to more than make up for the USA's decisions to reduce the appreciation for science than for the world to just lose do to a decrease in investments in science.\n\nYouTube SpaceLab is an open competition inviting 14 \u2013 18 year olds (anywhere in the world) to create an idea for a science experiment in space. You don't have to actually do the experiment, you just have to record yourself explaining it.\n\nEntries must have be submitted on YouTube by 07:59 GMT on December 8th.\n\nThe winning experiments will be conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) and beamed live on YouTube for the whole planet to see.\n\nWinners get the choice to either watch the rocket blast off with your idea on it in Japan or take a specially tailored astronaut training course in Russia when you turn 18. There are other amazing prizes for the runners-up too.\n\nHere is an example entry from 3 students in UK on an experiment to learn about quorum sensing by bacteria in the micro gravity of space.\n\nThe Steen method, on the other hand, orders the passengers in such a way that adjacent passengers in line are sitting in corresponding seats two rows apart from each other (e.g., 12A, 10A, 8A, 6A, etc.). This method trades a small number of aisle interferences at the front of the cabin, for the benefit of having multiple passengers stowing their luggage simultaneously. Other methods, such as Wilma and the Reverse Pyramid also realize parallel use of the aisle in a natural way as adjacent passengers are frequently sitting in widely separated rows.\n\u2026\nWe have seen experimentally that there is a marked difference in the time required to board an aircraft depending upon the boarding method used. The evidence strongly supports the heuristic argument from Steen that methods that parallelize the boarding process by more efficiently utilizing the aisle (having more passengers stow their luggage simultaneously) will board more quickly than those that do not. The relative benefit of the application of this theory will grow with the length of the aircraft. Here, we used a 12-row mock airplane, but a more typical airplane with twice that number of rows will gain more by the implementation of parallelized boarding methods.\n\nHow this improvement scales with the cabin length is different for each method. For the Steen method, the benefit will scale almost linearly. If the airplane is twice as long, the time savings will be nearly twice as much since the density of luggage-stowing passengers will remain the same and the boarding will still be maximally parallel. For Wilma and random boarding the benefit will not be as strong since the benefits of parallel boarding are randomly distributed along the length of the cabin instead of being regularly distributed.\n\nI am not optimistic that airlines will even test out this method. People tend to think companies apply sensible, proven concepts and methods. But that is much less likely to be done than people think. The failure of many places to use simple queuing theory improvement (customers should form one line and be served the next available person not form many individual lines) is one example of failures by companies to apply decades old proven better methods. The poor adoption of multivariate designed experiments is another. Applying better ideas is a process that is not done very efficiently in business, health care, education or even science and engineering \u2013 in fact in any human endeavor. This is a waste that impacts each of us every day. It is also an opportunity for you to gain advantages just by applying all the good ideas lying around that others are ignoring. You need to test the ideas out in your setting (using the PDSA cycle in an organizational context a good method).\n\nThe \"aha\" moment or the sudden arrival of the solution to a problem is a common human experience. Spontaneous problem solving without evident trial and error behavior in humans and other animals has been referred to as insight. Surprisingly, elephants, thought to be highly intelligent, have failed to exhibit insightful problem solving in previous cognitive studies. We tested whether three Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) would use sticks or other objects to obtain food items placed out-of-reach and overhead. Without prior trial and error behavior, a 7-year-old male Asian elephant showed spontaneous problem solving by moving a large plastic cube, on which he then stood, to acquire the food. In further testing he showed behavioral flexibility, using this technique to reach other items and retrieving the cube from various locations to use as a tool to acquire food. In the cube's absence, he generalized this tool utilization technique to other objects and, when given smaller objects, stacked them in an attempt to reach the food. The elephant's overall behavior was consistent with the definition of insightful problem solving. Previous failures to demonstrate this ability in elephants may have resulted not from a lack of cognitive ability but from the presentation of tasks requiring trunk-held sticks as potential tools, thereby interfering with the trunk's use as a sensory organ to locate the targeted food.\n\u2026\nFurther inspired by K\u00f6hler's chimpanzee studies, in experiment 4 we conducted 8 additional sessions to investigate whether Kandula would stack items to reach food. For these sessions, the baited branches were hung at a height that could be reached by stacking three butcher block cutting boards or by the use of other objects. In addition, the elephant was given sticks and other enrichment items. Kandula first touched several items and then moved two items, a plastic disk and a block under the suspended branches, placing one front foot on each in an unsuccessful attempt to reach for the branch. He solved the problem in an unexpected novel manner, moving and standing on the object closest in size to the absent cube, a large ball. Standing on unstable platforms such as this had not been previously observed. He repeated this behavior 9 times during this session. During the session's last minutes, Kandula picked up a block ~2 m from the food and placed it directly on top of a block that he placed under the food in a previous attempt. He stood on the stacked blocks and attempted to reach the food but was unsuccessful. He stacked two blocks again in the second and sixth sessions but each time his trunk was several inches from the food.\n\nThis is very cool research. I do wonder why they didn't provide more videos (and in a more user-friendly format than .mov files). I made them available via YouTube."}

{"text":"The Runners-Up\n\nFirst runner-up: RNA ascending. RNA molecules, long\nviewed as little more than couriers shuttling messages or amino\nacids around the cell, are turning out to be remarkably versatile.\nSmall pieces of RNA are known to shut down genes in the nematode\nCaenorhabditis elegans, a phenomenon very similar to gene\nsilencing, which occurs in plants. RNA interference (RNAi) could be\na boon to studies of gene function (ScienceNOW, 23 May), so\ninterest in RNA has exploded. This year, molecular biologists\ndiscovered that RNAi can quell gene activity in mouse and human\ncells as well.\n\nMeanwhile, others learned more about the production of the more\nfamiliar messenger RNA (mRNA): High-resolution pictures captured\nthe yeast RNA polymerase II--which builds the mRNA based on the\ngene's sequence--in action, and researchers found key proteins\ninvolved in splicing together the coding regions of mRNA after\nnon-coding sequence has been removed.\n\nResearchers also made an important discovery about the\nspliceosome, the complex of proteins and RNAs that removes\nnoncoding sequence from nascent mRNA. They found that the\nspliceosome's RNAs, not its proteins, control the removal of\nunwanted sequence. This has spawned a new field, \"ribozymology,\"\naimed at clarifying and harnessing RNA's enzymatic potential. In\none experiment, researchers forced RNA enzymes or \"ribozymes\" to\nevolve by selecting for those that are able to replicate RNA. These\nresults indicate that RNA could have preceded DNA in the earliest\nlife-forms (ScienceNOW, 17 May).\n\nNeutrino mystery solved. One of the great triumphs of\nscience in the past century has been understanding how stars burn\nnuclear fuel. But physicists have always been puzzled by the fact\nthat an expected byproduct--so-called \"electron\" neutrinos--were\nnot nearly as abundant as required by the straightforward theory.\nIn 1998, one group presented evidence that seemed to explain the\ndiscrepancy: They had shown that neutrinos \"oscillate\" from one\nflavor (such as the electron neutrino) to another (such as the muon\nor tau neutrino). If the electron neutrinos were turning into\nanother variety as they streamed away from the sun, that would\nexplain the shortfall of electron neutrinos. In June, scientists at\nthe Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in Ontario announced results\nshowing that this is indeed is the case (ScienceNOW, 18\nJune).\n\nGenomes take off. This year, two competing international\nteams published the landmark drafts of the 3.3 billion base pair\nsequence that defines our species (ScienceNOW, 12 February).\nThe big surprise when the drafts were revealed: Our genetic code\ncontains only about 35,000 genes, not even twice as many as the\nlowly worm, Caenorhabditis elegans. (By year's end, however,\nthe number began creeping upward.)\n\nSequences of more than 60 other organisms are done. Most are\nthose are microbes, such as Staphylococcus (ScienceNOW, 20\nApril) and other human pathogens. A draft sequence of the Japanese\npuffer fish genome--the most compact genome of all vertebrates--is\nnow in the public databases (ScienceNOW, 26 October). The\nsequencing of the rat (ScienceNOW, 5 March), mouse,\nzebrafish, a freshwater puffer fish, a malaria mosquito\n(ScienceNOW, 6 March), the fungus Neurospora crassa,\nand fission yeast is proceeding at full speed. Similarly, private\ncompanies announced that they have rough copies of the rice and\nmouse genome sequences (ScienceNOW, 27 April).\n\nSuperconductor surprises. Two teams discovered vastly\ndifferent superconductors at higher than expected temperatures.\nEarly in the year, researchers announced that one of the simplest\ncompounds in the chemistry stockroom--magnesium diboride--becomes a\nsuperconductor at 39 Kelvin (ScienceNOW, 16 February). The\nsecond surprising superconductor is made of C60 molecules,\npopularly called buckyballs. In August, researchers announced that\nwhen they stuffed organic molecules into a crystal of\nC60, the distance between the buckyballs increased and\nthe superconductivity temperature rocketed to 117 K\n(ScienceNOW, 30 August). The researchers hope to hike that\nfurther to room temperature, opening new possibilities for\nsuperconducting molecular electronics.\n\nSee also:\n\nA Superconductor Breaks the Mold (ScienceNOW, 13\nDecember)\n\nGuide me home. Several studies over the past year helped\nsort out the controls that help neural projections called axons\nfind their way during embryo development. One study showed that,\nwhen presented with conflicting signals (one stop and one go), the\ngrowing tip of an axon doesn't get confused. Additional studies\nthis year focused on how the message received at the axon's surface\ntranslates into axon movement. It turns out that the signals\nactivate regulators that instruct the actin cytoskeleton to build\nup the axon in one direction or another.\n\nClimatic confidence. A major milestone was reached in\nJanuary when the United Nations-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel\non Climate Change (IPCC) officially declared that \"most of the\nobserved warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due\nto the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations\"\n(ScienceNOW, 22 January). A better understanding of climate\nchange finally allowed IPCC to pin much of the blame for rising\ntemperatures on human activities. It has become clear that even a\ncombination of volcanic debris, solar flickering, and the natural\njostlings of the climate system could not explain the 0.6\u00b0C\nwarming of the past century.\n\nCancer in the crosshairs. Thirty years after President\nRichard Nixon and the U.S. Congress declared a \"War on Cancer,\" a\nnew breed of cancer drugs is entering the clinic. This year, the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a drug called\nGleevec for use in treating one kind of leukemia. It's a milestone\nbecause Gleevec is the first small-molecule drug that works by\ntargeting the specific biochemical defect that causes the cancer.\n(But see ScienceNOW, 21 June.)\n\nBanner year for Bose-Einstein. Cooled atoms that march in\nquantum lockstep were big news in 1995, and this year that work\ngarnered physics Nobel honors for their discoverers\n(ScienceNOW, 9 October). But the field hasn't rested on its\nlaurels. In March, two groups figured out how to make Bose-Einstein\ncondensates (BECs) of so-called metastable helium, a result that\nmight lead to laserlike beams of atoms that could carve\nnanocircuits out of silicon. Scientists also acquired new skills in\nmanipulating the condensates. They observed a kind of atomic\nsupernova, dubbed a \"bose nova,\" in a BEC, as part of the atomic\nvapor collapsed on itself, throwing off a miniature shock wave of\natoms akin to the blast from a collapsing star.\n\nCarbon consensus. Researchers who had been puzzling over\nhow much carbon dioxide is absorbed by U.S. forests and fields have\nfinally reconciled their conflicting results. The consensus is\nabout 500 million metric tons, or about one-third of current U.S.\nemissions. Researchers now hope a similar approach will pinpoint\ncarbon uptake in other regions, such as the tropics, where it seems\nto fluctuate most. The bad news: Because much of the U.S. sink is\ndue to ecosystems recovering from past exploitation, this sponge is\nsteadily shrinking and will taper off within 100 years."}

{"text":"Meta\n\nCAT | Microscopy NewsHarvard has done it again! This time scientists in the laboratory of Federico Capasso at Harvard's Schoolof Engineeringhave designed an innovative flat lens made of gold. No more than 1,000th the width of a human hair, it focuses light via antennae as opposed to refraction required of a glass lens.\n\nBy adjusting the length and angles of the antennae, the lens can create different amplitudes and phases. Each concentric ring of antennae can then be adjusted to achieve the desired focal length. In other words, there should be no need for glass lenses and all the complexity and bulk required for achromatic correction.\n\nHappily for microscope retailers, this new lens is currently only optimized for near-infrared light of a single wavelength used in telecommunications\u2026\u2026but one day it will undoubtedly revolutionize light microscopy not to mention cameras and other optical systems that currently employ glass lenses.\n\nSuch was our reaction the first time Hubble's \"Eagle Nebula\" imagery beamed in from deep space. Now it seems Arthur Clarke's prophetic words ring true once again, this time from a universe within the microscope.\n\nFrom Science Daily comes news of a breakthrough in microscopy from scientists at the School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering, with potentially far-reaching implications. \"World's Most Powerful Optical Microscope: Microscope Could Solve The Cause of Viruses\", reads the headline.\n\nThey report seeing structures as small as 50 nanometers in size, 20 times smaller than the best optical microscope currently available. Nano, a prefix meaning \"dwarf\" in Greek, also means one billionth of a meter.\n\nTo put that in perspective, the period at the end of this sentence is almost 500,000 nanometers in diameter. Which means they've effectively moved beyond the electron microscope \u2013 well beyond it, and the implications are significant.\n\nDaniel's microscopy photos is a brilliant blog showcasing his artistic images of a variety of items that can be found around the house!

Or unravel a spider's recipe for spinning silk as strong as steel.\n\nIt's now possible with the new Isis 2 target station in Oxfordshire, a \"super microscope\" that uses electron beams instead of light waves to achieve a magnification level that surpasses all others.\n\nIsis' first neutron source opened in 1984 and has been invaluable to engineers, helping them to solve a myriad of everyday occurrences like how to efficiently make fabric softener, but Isis 2 will open doors to bigger science. According to BBC News, \"At its core is a lump of tungsten metal the size of a packet of biscuits \u2013 the 'target' \u2013 into which pulses of protons are fired at 84 percent of the speed of light. The target radiates neutrons like a discoball scatters light \u2013 20,000 million million per second.\"\n\nA team of research scientists at Autonomous University in Madrid is one step closer to creating a new kind of microscope \u2013 one that will study delicate materials by bouncing helium atoms off their surfaces. The team, led by Rodolfo Miranda, has completed work on an ultrasmooth mirror, what will become an integral part of the atomic microscope.\n\nUnlike the electron microscope, which can potentially annihilate a subject-in-view with its strong electron beams, the atomic microscope will rely on a low-energy beam of helium atoms to get a more precise image of a structure's surface.\n\nMiranda claims the mirror, which is less than an inch wide, is the world's smoothest.\n\nI was surfing the Web for microscopy news when I ran across this heart-warming story about a woman who donated her deceased husband's beloved microscope to her hometown high school in Farmer City, Illinois.\n\nKathy (Schield) Patterson, who now lives in Fairfax, Va., donated the 75-pound Nikon Diaphot to Blue Ridge High School. Her husband, Mike, was a research scientist and college pathology professor who died a few years ago. According to Pentagraph.com, the 1985 model sells for roughly $7,000 on eBay. Science teacher Mike Hendricks says the donated microscope is the best one in the lab. Apparently the slides are pretty valuable, too.\n\nWe have recently been alerted to a remarkable new web site  . JOVE is a UTube for research experiments and nothing less than superb. Any scientist can make a video of his\/her experiment and post it on the site so that scientists round the world can learn, replicate and improve\u00a0their methodologies. JOVE also make the videos for a variety of research labs. It was founded by senior researchers from, among others, Harvard Medical School, and offers\u00a0a truly exciting addition to the world of microscopy.

{"text":"Amino Acids, Sugars, Chirality, and Dinosaurs from Space\n\nA new paper from noted American chemist Ronald Breslow was recently accepted by the Journal of the American Chemical Society. It's titled, \"Evidence for the Likely Origin of Homochirality in Amino Acids, Sugars, and Nucleosides on Prebiotic Earth,\" but you may know it better as \"the one study that says 'advanced' dinosaurs could rule other planets.\"\n\nThis is a tad confusing, because the paper itselfwasn't about dinosaurs at all. It centered on chirality, a property of an object, organism, or molecule which means that the object is not identical to its mirror image. Human hands are a good example of chirality. Your left hand can never be perfectly superimposed upon your right. In fact, this example is so ideal that chemists and molecular biologists dub chiral molecules as having either \"left-handed\" or \"right-handed\" chirality.\n\nNoted in the paper, sugars and amino acids -- two of the major building blocks of life -- are homochiral, which means they all vastly follow either right-handedness or left-handedness. Sugars tend to be right-handed (D-sugars), while amino acids tend to be left-handed (L-amino acids).\n\nBreslow's primary goal with the paper was to postulate on how this homochirality came about on Earth. He argued that meteorites carrying organic material struck the Earth almost four billion years ago and thus seeded life with left-handed amino acids and right-handed sugars.\n\nThough thoroughly fascinating, the paper probably wouldn't have garnered much attention from the media. Chirality simply doesn't quite captivate a mainstream audience. But you know what does? Super-intelligent advanced dinosaurs from space! In the paper's conclusion, Breslow states:\n\n\"An implication from this work is that elsewhere in the universe there\ncould be life forms based on D-amino acids and L-sugars. Such life forms\ncould well be advanced versions of dinosaurs, if mammals did not have\nthe good fortune to have the dinosaurs wiped out by an asteroidal\ncollision, as on Earth. We would be better off not meeting them.\" (added emphasis)\n\nThis conclusion spawned a headline arms race across the internet on Wednesday. A few of my favorites: \"Scientists Say Intelligent Dinosaurs Could Rule Other Planets.\" \"Dinosaurs from Space!\" \"Dinosaurs: This is the greatest closing paragraph to a scientific paper ever.\"\n\nThe last headline gets at the point I'd like to make with this post. Breslow's conclusion was only mildly connected to the paper's primary focus and a tad overstated. This may not be kosher with some, but frankly, I'm okay with it. Embellishment like that, though slightly misleading, makes science fun and accessible to the masses. If Joe Schmoe -- while aimlessly surfing the web -- gets drawn in by a headline touting \"space dinos,\" reads the article and learns a little about chirality and the origins of life, then no harm has been done. It might even inspire Joe to become a molecular biologist!\n\nNow, of course, scientists should use restraint when crafting attention-grabbing conclusions. If the researchers who conducted the study, \"Roles of the Drosophila SK Channel (dSK) in Courtship Memory\" ended by stating that fruit flies with slightly altered genetics could TAKE OVER THE WORLD, well, that's not okay. That's just crazy talk."}

{"text":"Modern science is subject to strict ethical codes when it comes to scientific trials, and for good reason. In the past, thousands of experiments were conducted without regard to safety or ethics, often with deadly consequences. Many were performed because public safety or the imminent threat to the nation was deemed paramount over individual rights. Others resulted from the misapplication of junk science, shortsightedness, or political greed. Such unethical research programs are still making headlines today, as the federal and state governments apologize and grant compensation to victims. Yet, despite our progress in reining in unethical testing practices, some of the below research programs still use questionable methods. That said, here are 10 of the darkest chapters in U.S. scientific history.\n\nAfter celebrating its 60th anniversary a couple of years ago, it appears the FBI's \"Ten Most Wanted Fugitives\" list will reach another milestone in the not-so-distant future: 500 fugitives. So far, 495 people have earned this dubious distinction \u2014 from international terrorists like Ramzi Ahmed Yousef and Osama Bin Laden, to serial killers like Ted Bundy and assassins like James Earl Ray. What follows are some little-known facts about the FBI's program and this well-known assortment of murderers, pedophiles, bank robbers, crime bosses and gang leaders.\n\nMythological creatures come in all shapes and sizes, but it seems the same old creatures always hog the headlines. We constantly hear about gremlins, zombies, gorgons and cyclops \u2014 but now it's time for some lesser-known creatures to shine. Ten of the more obscure mythological creatures appear below, a collection that includes messenger squirrels, horse-headed, human-bodied tricksters, and gigantic, thrashing catfish that supposedly cause earthquakes. Since it's tough to rank bizarre qualities, these mythological creatures are ranked based on their alleged deadliness.\n\nNothing warms a scientist's heart like a science-fiction film that bothers to \"get the science right.\" There are plenty of B-grade bad sci-fi movies out there, but every so often a golden nugget stands out. Great science-fiction movies can be educational, stir our imagination, and even inspire younger viewers to pursue careers in science. And while even the gems on this list all contain a scientific error or two, as a rule they do not break the science-fiction mantra of disregarding more than one physical law of nature per film.\n\nStatistics tell us that between one-third and one-half of marriages in the United States are likely to fail. Once a social stigma, divorce is now becoming an accepted part of the American lifestyle. The media continues to trivialize holy matrimony, placing all the emphasis on the wedding, just one day, as opposed to the marriage, which is meant to be a lifelong partnership. We are constantly bombarded with the scandalous affairs of celebrities and politicians; people get married on reality TV shows, and commercials make light of spouses lying to each other. In this environment, it's little wonder that the divorce rate is so high.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be this way. Once identified, most marital problems can be resolved. Here are five common mistakes that can turn marriages into divorce, and how you and your spouse can avoid them.\n\nSo you've made the decision to eat a better diet, which means eating less fast food and adding more fruits and vegetables to your diet. Congratulations! In addition to weight-management benefits, many fruits and vegetables are loaded with powerful antioxidants, which can help your body fight the stresses of oxidation that have been linked to cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's and even aging itself. Chances are you've seen a story or two on so-called \"super foods,\" with foods such as red kidney beans, blueberries and tomatoes. One caveat that is rarely mentioned \u2014 much of the antioxidant power of these foods occurs only in their raw form. That's not so much a problem with blueberries (delicious raw), but very problematic with red kidney beans (not edible raw).\n\nHere are five food types ranked according to their antioxidant power, based on a database maintained by the United States Department of Agriculture. You'll find no mention of raw foods that you don't eat, and no rare foods (elderberries, chokeberries, etc.) that are never available at your local grocer. Instead, here are five readily available foods with tremendous antioxidant powers.\n\nHistory loves a winner. And in the field of science, the big winners are generously rewarded with Nobel Prizes, lucrative patents and international acclaim. Those who lost out in the quest for scientific recognition sometimes waited too long to publish a theory, or perhaps didn't follow the right procedure in applying for a patent. But sometimes, these historic also-rans did everything right, were the first to make a major discovery and still didn't receive the credit they deserved. Here are five such scientists who made important breakthroughs but have been overshadowed in the history books.\n\nSince 1976, February has been designated as Black History Month in the United States. So each February, children across America bring home projects or books featuring famous African-Americans such as Martin Luther King Jr., Booker T. Washington, Harriet Tubman and George Washington Carver. Those legendary figures are certainly worth celebrating, yet there have been many other African-American men and women who achieved significant milestones for their race, and made significant contributions to society, but get little attention today. Here are 10 notable African-Americans who are often overlooked during Black History Month.\n\nYou may not have heard them in years, but odds are you can finish each of these little ditties the way a couple might finish each other's sentences: \"Give me a break, give me a break \u2026\"; \"I am stuck on Band-Aid \u2026\"; and \"Plop, plop, fizz, fizz \u2026\" These jingles for the likes of Kit Kat and Alka-Seltzer may seem old school, but you can't question their staying power. They have managed to replay over and over again in our heads, which is what makes them so effective. Only time will tell if any of today's advertising campaigns, such as Geico's revolving door of characters (the cavemen, lizard with distinguished accent, etc.) will one day be remembered so fondly. Here, for your listening and viewing pleasure, are the 10 best commercial jingles of all time.\n\nDay to day, the weather doesn't necessarily fascinate. It's sunny, it's cloudy, and sometimes it rains (or snows). The weather changes daily, but generally within relatively narrow parameters. Watch it long enough, carefully enough, however, have the good luck to be in the right place at the right time, and you might just witness some of the following strange weather phenomena."}

It's a good time to think about all the people who live their whole lives without modern-day appliances, and how the burgeoning human population, climate change and declining resources are converging into a recipe for disaster.\n\nEvery branch of science will be needed to solve this simmering stew of problems, says Emory physicist Sidney Perkowitz. For a recent issue of Physics World, he writes about the history of stoves and ovens, and how physics is tackling some of the environmental and resource usage issues associated with cooking.\n\n\"Despite the rapid development of cooking technology and its gastronomic application since 1800,\" Perkowitz writes, \"two to three billion people worldwide, mostly in developing countries, still eat food prepared by the ancient method of cooking over open fires or in rudimentary stoves fed by solid fuel \u2013 wood, agricultural residue, animal dung and sometimes coal.\n\n\"Cooking over open fires or on primitive stoves presents a series of costs. Most sobering is the health cost, in the form of some two million annual deaths caused by respiratory illnesses arising from indoor smoke. Our climate also suffers, with these cooking methods increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide by about 3 percent per year and producing black carbon (a main component of soot) and other emissions caused by inefficient burning. Also, the heavy consumption of biomass at up to two tons per family per year, often in a non-sustainable form, leads to deforestation.\""}

{"text":"Batty about research\n\nEARLIER THIS month the European Research Council, which funds blue-sky research, announced its \"starting grant\" awards. In the current economic climate, the ERC's investigator-driven or \"bottom-up\" approach offers something of an oasis that allows researchers to identify new opportunities in any field of research.\n\nIt's a competitive arena, but for those who manage to secure the funding it can mean a big chunk of change that lets them build their research teams and go after frontier questions that could yield important answers.\n\nThis year the ERC earmarked around \u20ac800 million in grants for over 530 early-career researchers in Europe. Ireland's performance in bagging just four of those grants has been criticised, but for the recipients here, it offers them the chance to pursue an idea that would likely not have been funded from the national purse.\n\n\"I have wanted to do this for 15 or 20 years,\" says Dr Emma Teeling, whose five-year \u20ac1.5 million ERC grant will see her look to bats for clues about healthy ageing.\n\n\"If you want to try and understand the ageing process or halt it, as a zoologist I think you need to go and look to mother nature and see is there anything out there that doesn't age. And bats appear not to age the same way as other mammals.\"\n\nDespite expending three times more energy than similar-sized mammals, bats can live up to nine times longer than expected, according to Dr Teeling, a lecturer at the school of biology and environmental science in UCD. \"There are only 19 mammals that live longer than man given their body size, and 18 of these are bats,\" she says.\n\nHer project will track a population of wild bats in France over the course of years and take tiny samples of blood to perform genetic analyses and see what tricks the flying mammals might have up their sleeves.\n\nDr Teeling, who will use techniques she has developed in previous research funded by Science Foundation Ireland, hopes to compare what is happening with bats to what goes on in other mammals and work out at least part of the successful formula. Then future research could look at modifications to emulate the bats' healthy longevity.\n\n\"This is the basic science that could potentially drive something magnificent such as halting or reversing ageing,\" she says.\n\nAnother ERC awardee with genes in mind is Prof Aoife McLysaght, who will use her \u20ac1.3 million grant to look for disease-related genes that are conspicuous by their absence."}

{"text":"They are the best of beings; they are the worst of beings. They are animals; they are plants. They are saviors; they are killers. They are predators; they are parasites. They are, in short, dinoflagellates \u2014 a large, diverse and eccentric group of (usually) single-celled organisms that are as celebrated as they are feared. And I hereby nominate them for Life-form of the Month: January.\n\nIf you were to look at a dinoflagellate through a microscope, you might see anything from a small brown ball to an elaborate structure with whorls and spines \u2014 that depends on the species. All dinoflagellates live in water, most famously the ocean (though some live in freshwater), and many of them can swim: protruding from their outsides they have two whip-like structures known as flagella, one for moving and one for steering. (Flagella is plural: if they had only one, they'd have a flagellum.)\n\nSome dinoflagellates have eyes. Others give off light. Some, like plants, make energy from the sun; others, like animals, capture and eat their prey. Some do both. Funky.\n\nBut even if you've never seen a dinoflagellate and wouldn't recognize one if it waved its flagella at you, you've probably come across them, for they impinge on our lives in two important ways, one good, one bad. Read more\u2026\n\nTags:\n\nAnother year; another 584 million miles traveled on our endless journey 'round the sun; another set of joys and regrets, disasters and triumphs. And sitting here, reflecting on the year, I am also moved to reflect on the nature of memory \u2014 and on memory in nature. For the conscious, brain-based memories that we humans set so much store by are not the only memories out there.\n\nThe most obvious example of a different type of memory is the immune system. This remembers pathogens you've been exposed to \u2014 the viruses, bacteria and other baddies that you've encountered during your lifetime. The way it works is complicated, but essentially what happens is this: when you're exposed to a pathogen \u2014 either because you get sick, or because you're vaccinated against it \u2014 special cells in the immune system form a memory of what that particular pathogen looks like. If you encounter the same pathogen again, the memory cells will recognize it, and your body will be able to mount a faster immune response.\n\n(Some pathogens have evolved a tricky way of escaping the immune system: they constantly change what they look like, so the body has no prior memory of them. The champions of disguise are trypanosomes, the single-celled parasites that cause diseases like sleeping sickness. A huge proportion of their genome is a costume box, full of the molecular equivalent of capes and cloaks.) Read more\u2026\n\nTags:\n\nHere's my prediction for the Next Big Thing in health care: chronotherapy, or therapy by the clock. Yes, in the future, your medicines, your operations, your mealtimes and when you step onto the treadmill or the badminton court \u2014 all will be overseen by your personal chronoconsultant.\n\nIt's been known for ages that our bodies have daily, or \"circadian,\" rhythms. Body temperature is lower in the morning than it is in the afternoon. Blood pressure is low during the night, and rises just before you wake. Muscles are stronger in the afternoon than they are in the morning, and you may have greater dexterity then, too. Badminton players tend to serve more accurately in the afternoon, for example.\n\nBut now it's clear that the body clock is in charge of many other, more subtle processes as well. The content of human breast milk changes during the day. Evening milk is full of compounds that make a baby sleepy; morning milk isn't. The liver, too, has a strong daily rhythm: many of its activities shut down during the night. Levels of several hormones, including melatonin (involved in sleep) and ghrelin (involved in appetite), rise at night. Testosterone, in contrast, is highest in the morning and lowest in the late afternoon. Cholesterol is made more rapidly at night. Even cancers have a rhythm: breast cancers, for instance, grow faster during the day. Read more\u2026\n\nTags:\n\nAs I mentioned last week, next year is to be the International Year of Biodiversity. So I thought I'd kick off the celebrations by looking at some of the funkiest beings on the planet: viruses.\n\nViruses have a bad reputation: in humans, they cause illnesses as varied as colds, flu, cervical cancer, polio and ebola. But to focus exclusively on the harm they cause is to do them an injustice, for viruses are also fascinating, mysterious and powerful forces of nature.\n\nTags:\n\nThis year, as you may have noticed, has been one long party in honor of Charles Darwin. That's now drawing to a close. But don't put away your glad rags. Next year is also slated to be one long party; this time, in honor of biodiversity. Yes, 2010 is to be an international knees-up for the other species on the planet.\n\nIt's not clear to me what, in practice, this celebration is going to mean. But the prospect of it has led me to get out some picture books \u2014 books like \"The Deep,\" which is full of incredible photographs of strange beings. For example: Chondrocladia lampadiglobus, the ping-pong tree sponge, which lives more than a mile and a half below the surface of the sea. This creature looks more like a piece of modern art than an animal: it has an array of spherical, translucent globes on stalks that join together at the center. It looks harmless, decorative even. But it's a carnivore. Shrimps or other critters that settle on it quickly become stuck; the sponge then consumes them.

However, new research led by scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego suggests an even earlier cause. The bad news \u2013 humans are still to blame. The good news \u2013 relatively simple policy changes can hinder further coral reef decline.\n\nEmploying a novel excavation technique to reconstruct the timeline of historical change in coral reefs located on the Caribbean side of Panama, a team of scientists led by Scripps alumna Katie Cramer and current Scripps Professor of Oceanography and Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) Emeritus Staff Scientist Jeremy Jackson has determined that damage to coral reefs from land clearing and overfishing pre-dates damage caused by anthropogenic climate change by at least decades.\n\n\"This study is the first to quantitatively show that the cumulative effects of deforestation and possibly overfishing were degrading Caribbean coral and molluscan communities long before climate change impacts began to really devastate reefs,\" said lead author Cramer, currently based at the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network at the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nCoral reefs have suffered alarmingly since the 1980s due to coral bleaching and coral disease, thought to stem from the warming of the oceans due to anthropogenic, or human-induced, climate change. However, until recently, the impact of prior human activities on Caribbean coral reefs had not been studied with experimental techniques.\n\nHistorical records and qualitative surveys provide hints that declines in corals in some parts of the Caribbean occurred as far back as the early 1900s after coastal lands began to be cleared to make way for plantations. However, the current study is the first to quantify the changes that reef corals and mollusks have undergone as a result of long-term stress caused by the deposition of silt, nutrients, and pollution onto coral reefs from land clearing and the depletion of reef fish that prevent algae from overtaking reefs.

The advent of specialist craftsmen, an increase in fertility and the construction of permanent architecture are just some of the profound changes that followed.\n\nOf course, the transition to agriculture was far from rapid. The period around 14,500 years ago has been regarded as the point at which the first indications appear of cultural change associated with agriculture: the exploitation of wild grains and the construction of stone buildings. Farming is believed to have begun in what is known as the Fertile Crescent in the Levant region, which stretches from northern Egypt through Israel and Jordan to the shores of the Persian Gulf, and then occurred independently in other regions of the world at different times from 11,000 years ago.\n\nRecent evidence, however, has suggested that the first stirrings of the revolution began even earlier, perhaps as far back as 19,000 years ago. Stimulating this reinterpretation of human prehistory are discoveries by the Epipalaeolithic Foragers in Azraq Project (EFAP), a group of archaeologists and bioarchaeologists working in the Jordanian desert comprising University of Cambridge's Dr. Jay Stock, Dr. Lisa Maher (University of California, Berkeley) and Dr. Tobias Richter (University of Copenhagen).\n\nOver the past four years, their research has uncovered dramatic evidence of changes in the behaviour of hunter-gatherers that casts new light on agriculture's origins, as Dr. Stock described: \"Our work suggests that these hunter-gatherer communities were starting to congregate in large numbers in specific places, build architecture and show more-complex ritual and symbolic burial practices \u2013 signs of a greater attachment to a location and a changing pattern of social complexity that imply they were on the trajectory toward agriculture.\" Keep on reading...\n\nDoesn't this raise the chick and egg paradox? Is the temperature rising because CO2 is rising or is CO2 rising because the temperature is rising?\n\nScienceDaily\u2014 Why did the atmosphere contain so little carbon dioxide (CO2) during the last Ice Age 20,000 years ago? Why did it rise when Earth's climate became warmer? Processes in the ocean are responsible for this, says a new study based on newly developed isotope measurements.\n\nThis study has now been published in the scientific journal Science by scientists from the Universities of Bern and Grenoble and the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in the Helmholtz Association.\n\nAround 20,000 years ago, the atmospheric CO2 concentration during the last Ice Age was distinctly lower than in the following warm period. Measurements from Antarctic ice cores showed this already two decades ago. An international team of glaciologists thereafter looked even further back in time. The climate researchers found that this close connection between carbon dioxide and temperature has existed over the past 800,000 years: with low CO2 concentrations during the Ice Ages and higher CO2 values during warm periods. Now they tried to answer also the question as to where the carbon dioxide was hidden during the Ice Ages and how it got back into the atmosphere at their ends.\n\n\"We have now been able to identify processes in the ocean which are connected to the observed rise in CO2,\" says Dr. Jochen Schmitt, lead author of the recently published study and researcher at the Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of Bern. According to Schmitt, during the Ice Age more and more carbon dioxide accumulated in the deep ocean, causing the concentration of atmospheric CO2 to drop. Only at the end of the Ice Age this stored CO2 was transported back to the sea surface through changing ocean circulation and thus emitted back into the atmosphere, write the scientists in the scientific journal \"Science.\"Thermal measurements of Enceladus's fissures have revealed temperatures as high as -120 deg Fahrenheit (190 Kelvin). \"If you add up all the heat, 16 gigawatts of thermal energy are coming out of those cracks,\" says Porco.\n\nShe believes the small moon, with its sub-surface liquid sea, organics, and an energy source, may host the same type of life we find in similar environments on Earth.\n\nEngineers at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow are working on deflecting asteroids by use of high-powered lasers.\n\nScienceDaily \u2014 Pioneering engineers at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow are developing an innovative technique based on lasers that could radically change asteroid deflection technology.\n\nThe research has unearthed the possibility of using a swarm of relatively small satellites flying in formation and cooperatively firing solar-powered lasers onto an asteroid -- this would overcome the difficulties associated with current methods that are focused on large unwieldy spacecraft.\n\nDr Massimiliano Vasile, of Strathclyde's Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, is leading the research.

The idea of some dark entity out there in the far reaches of space sucking up anything and everything that ventures near with such power and force that even light can't escape it's clutches, both enthralls and terrifies. Thus, the idea of one moving close enough to our planet would seem good reason to hit the panic button. But, in some cases, it appears, it might not be such a bad thing, at least if it were very, very small. That's what one small group of researchers has concluded after simulating the effects of one tiny black hole hitting and passing through the Earth, on a computer. They have posted their ideas and conclusions on the preprint server arXiv.\n\nThe reason the research team began simulating minuscule black holes and what impact they might have if they struck the Earth, is because they believe that such black holes, if they truly do exist, would have to have dark matter as one of its components. Thus, if they can prove that tiny black holes exist, such as by proving that they have left evidence behind when striking the Earth, they would have gone a long ways towards offering proof that dark matter exists. Something no one else thus far has been able to do.\n\nThe good news is that their simulations show that if such black holes did strike the Earth, the impact would be negligible, similar they say, to a very minor earthquake felt all over the planet. This is because they are so small, on the order of the diameter of atomic nuclei and travel so fast. They estimate it would take less than a minute for one to make it all the way through the Earth and out the other side. The bad news, at least for researchers, is that such collisions are only predicted to occur every few million years or so.\n\nScienceDaily \u2014 -- up to 30 million miles per hour.\n\n\"These warp-speed planets would be some of the fastest objects in our galaxy.

Image courtesy of Masato Ono, Tamagawa University\n\nCan nature get any stranger? Japanese honeybees kill giant hornets by cooking them with their brains.\n\n(BBC)- Japanese honeybees' response to a hive-invading giant hornet is efficient and dramatic; they form a \"bee ball\" around it, serving to cook and asphyxiate it.\n\nNow, researchers in Japan have measured the brain activity of honeybees when they form this killer ball.\nOne highly active area of the bees' brains, they believe, allows them to generate the constant heat which is deadly for the hornet.\n\nProf Takeo Kubo from the University of Tokyo explained that \"higher centres\" of the bee's brain, known as the mushroom bodies, were more active in the brains of Japanese honeybees when they were a part of the \"hot defensive bee ball\".\n\nTo find this out, the team lured the bees to form their ball by attaching a hornet to the end of a wire and inserting the predator into the hive.\n\nThis simulated invasion caused the bees to swarm around the hornet. The researchers then plucked a few of the bees from the ball and measured, throughout each of their tiny brains, the relative amount of a chemical that is known to be a \"marker\" of brain activity.\n\n\"We found that similar [brain] activity is evoked when the Japanese honeybees are simply exposed to high temperature (46C) in the laboratory,\" the researcher told BBC Nature.

Troy Zars, an associate professor of biological sciences at the University of Missouri and neurobiology expert, said that understanding why rejected male flies find solace in ethanol could help treat human addictions.\n\n\"Identifying the molecular and genetic mechanisms controlling the demand for reward in fruit flies could potentially influence our understanding of drug and alcohol abuse in humans, since previous studies have detailed similarities between signaling pathways in fruit flies and mammals,\" Zars said.\n\nIn the study, male fruit flies that had mated repeatedly for several days showed no preference for alcohol-spiked food. On the other hand, spurned males and those denied access to females strongly preferred food mixed with 15 percent alcohol. The researchers believed the alcohol may have satisfied the flies' desire for physical reward.\n\nZars said the new discovery could lead to greater understanding of the relationship between the social and physical causes of substance abuse in humans.

The team has been cautious about classifying the fossils because of their unusual mosaic of features.\n\n\"These new fossils might be of a previously unknown species, one that survived until the very end of the Ice Age around 11,000 years ago,\" says Professor Curnoe.\n\n\"Alternatively, they might represent a very early and previously unknown migration of modern humans out of Africa, a population who may not have contributed genetically to living people.\" Keep on reading...\n\nNew research indicates as little as one sugary beverage a day can increase risk of heart disease by 20 percent in men.\n\nScienceDaily \u2014 Men\"This study adds to the growing evidence that sugary beverages are detrimental to cardiovascular health,\" said Frank B.

Some honey bees, too, are more likely than others to seek adventure. The brains of these novelty-seeking bees exhibit distinct patterns of gene activity in molecular pathways known to be associated with thrill-seeking in humans, researchers report.\n\nThe findings offer a new window on the inner life of the honey bee hive, which once was viewed as a highly regimented colony of seemingly interchangeable workers taking on a few specific roles (nurse or forager, for example) to serve their queen. Now it appears that individual honey bees actually differ in their desire or willingness to perform particular tasks, said University of Illinois entomology professor and Institute for Genomic Biology director Gene Robinson, who led the study. These differences may be due, in part, to variability in the bees' personalities, he said. The study team also included researchers from Wellesley College and Cornell University.\n\n\"In humans, differences in novelty-seeking are a component of personality,\" he said. \"Could insects also have personalities?\"\n\nRobinson and his colleagues studied two behaviors that looked like novelty-seeking in honey bees: scouting for nest sites and scouting for food.\n\nWhen a colony of bees outgrows its living quarters, the hive divides and the swarm must find a suitable new home. At this moment of crisis, a few intrepid bees \u2013 less than 5 percent of the swarm \u2013 take off to hunt for a hive. These bees, called nest scouts, are on average 3.4 times more likely than their peers to also become food scouts, the researchers found.\n\n\"There is a gold standard for personality research and that is if you show the same tendency in different contexts, then that can be called a personality trait,\" Robinson said. Not only do certain bees exhibit signs of novelty-seeking, he said, but their willingness or eagerness to \"go the extra mile\" can be vital to the life of the hive.

As described in a paper published March 9 in Science, the researchers believe an asteroid slammed into the moon approximately 4 billion years ago, leaving behind an enormous crater and iron-rich, highly magnetic rock.\n\nWhile there is evidence that the Moon once generated its own magnetic field, there is little to suggest it was strong enough to account for the anomalies seen in earlier surveys, Sarah Stewart-Mukhopadhyay, the John L. Loeb Associate Professor of the Natural Sciences, and one of three co-authors of the paper, said. To explain the findings, then, researchers turned to a number of elaborate scenarios.\n\nWednesday, March 7, 2012\n\nScienceDaily\u2014 Strong.\n\nIn the article, Barbara Shukitt-Hale, Ph.D., and Marshall G.

To analyze the strength of the evidence about berry fruits, they extensively reviewed cellular, animal and human studies on the topic.\n\nAntibodies that stop the progression of Alzheimer's disease in mice discovered.\n\nScienceDaily \u2014 Antibodies that block the process of synapse disintegration in Alzheimer's disease have been identified, raising hopes for a treatment to combat early cognitive decline in the disease.\n\nAlzheimer's disease is characterized by abnormal deposits in the brain of the protein Amyloid-\u00df, which induces the loss of connections between neurons, called synapses.\n\nNow, scientists at UCL have discovered that specific antibodies that block the function of a related protein, called Dkk1, are able to completely suppress the toxic effect of Amyloid-\u00df on synapses. The findings are published March 6 in the Journal of Neuroscience.\n\nProfessor Patricia Salinas (UCL Department of Cell & Developmental Biology) who led the study, said: \"These novel findings raise the possibility that targeting this secreted Dkk1 protein could offer an effective treatment to protect synapses against the toxic effect of Amyloid-\u00df.[...]\n\nIn this paper, scientists conducted experiments to look at the progression of synapse disintegration of the hippocampus after exposure to Amyloid-\u00df, using brain slices from mice. They were able to monitor how many synapses survived in the presence of a specific antibody which targets Dkk1, compared to how many synapses were viable without the antibody.\n\n13,000 years ago, a comet or asteroid likely impacted near Mexico and changed the climate for an extended time period. The timing may be associates associated with the extinctions of many large North American animals, including mammoths, mastodons and other mega fauna.\n\n(PHYSORG)- A 16-member international team of researchers that includes James Kennett, professor of earth science at UC Santa Barbara, has identified a nearly 13,000-year-old layer of thin, dark sediment buried in the floor of Lake Cuitzeo in central Mexico. The sediment layer contains an exotic assemblage of materials, including nanodiamonds, impact spherules, and more, which, according to the researchers, are the result of a cosmic body impacting Earth.\n\nThese new data are the latest to strongly support of a controversial hypothesis proposing that a major cosmic impact with Earth occurred 12,900 years ago at the onset of an unusual cold climatic period called the Younger Dryas. The researchers' findings appear today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nConducting a wide range of exhaustive tests, the researchers conclusively identified a family of nanodiamonds, including the impact form of nanodiamonds called lonsdaleite, which is unique to cosmic impact. The researchers also found spherules that had collided at high velocities with other spherules during the chaos of impact. Such features, Kennett noted, could not have formed through anthropogenic, volcanic, or other natural terrestrial processes. \"These materials form only through cosmic impact,\" he said.\n\nScienceDaily \u2014 Millions of people suffer from Parkinson's disease, a disorder of the nervous system that affects movement and worsens over time. As the world's population ages, it's estimated that the number of people with the disease will rise sharply. Yet despite several effective therapies that treat Parkinson's symptoms, nothing slows its progression.\n\nWhile it's not known what exactly causes the disease,Now, scientists at UCLA have found a way to prevent these clumps from forming, prevent their toxicity and even break up existing aggregates.\n\nUCLA professor of neurology Jeff Bronstein and UCLA associate professor of neurology Gal Bitan, along with their colleagues, report the development of a novel compound known as a \"molecular tweezer,\" which in a living animal model blocked \u03b1-synuclein aggregates from forming, stopped the aggregates' toxicity and, further, reversed aggregates in the brain that had already formed. And the tweezers accomplished this without interfering with normal brain function.\n\nThe research appears in the current online edition of the journal Neurotherapeutics.\n\nSome questioned whether aliens were about to land, with one woman tweeting: \"UFO invasion?!

These pesky bloodsuckers were nearly an inch long.\n\nNew fossils found in China are evidence of the oldest fleas - from 125 million to 165 million years ago, said Diying Huang of the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology. Their disproportionately long proboscis, or straw-like mouth, had sharp weapon-like serrated edges that helped them bite and feed from their super-sized hosts, he and other researchers reported Wednesday in the journal Nature.\n\nScientists figure about eight or more of today's fleas would fit on the burly back of their ancient ancestor.\n\n\"That's a beast,\" said study co-author Michael Engel, entomology curator at the Natural History Museum at the University of Kansas. \"It was a big critter. I can't even imagine coming home and finding my miniature schnauzer with one or more of these things crawling around on it.\"\n\nThe ancient female fleas were close to twice the size of the males, researchers found, which fits with modern fleas.\n\nBut Engel said it's not just the size that was impressive about the nine flea fossils. It was their fearsome beak capable of sticking into and sucking blood from the hides of certain dinosaurs, probably those that had feathers."}
{"text":"10 Important Scientific Discoveries and Achievements of 2012\n\nPrivate Spaceflight: In May, California's SpaceX became the first private company to successfully fly a spaceship to the International Space Station. The achievement could free NASA to focus on designing spacecraft that can leave low-earth orbit while private companies focus on ferrying supplies and humans to the space station and other nearby targets. Last week, the company successfully tested its reuseable Grasshopper rocket to a height of about 12 stories. If successful, the rocket could greatly reduce the cost of spaceflight.\n\nOcean Exploration: In March, Avatar and Titanic director James Cameron became the first human to reach the Mariana Trench\u2014the deepest known part of the ocean\u2014in a solo mission. Cameron became the first human to explore the nearly 7-mile-deep trench since Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard took the trip in 1960.\n\nDriverless Cars: Nevada, Florida, and California all passed laws allowing self-driving cars on their roads. Internet giant Google has been extensively testing its autonomous car and has driven more than 300,000 miles without incident.\n\nDiamond Planet: Scientists discovered a \"carbon-rich\" exoplanet in October\u2014which turns out to be very hot, perfect for turning carbon into diamonds. The so-called \"diamond planet\" is 40 light-years from earth and is twice earth's size\u2014but because of its diamonds, the planet is more than eight times earth's mass. According to an analysis by Forbes, the planet is likely worth $26.9 nonillion dollars, which is $26.9 followed by 30 zeros\u2014or enough to finally put this fiscal cliff issue to bed for millions of years.\n\nAntarctic Exploration: This year was a big one for Antarctic exploration\u2014after more than a decade of drilling, Russian scientists bored through more than 2.5 miles of ice to reach Lake Vostok's liquid waters. Preliminary tests for life there didn't turn up much, but in Western Antarctica, a team of American researchers found life in the subfreezing waters of Lake Vida. That discovery suggests that life could potentially survive in seemingly inhospitable environments in space.\n\nControversial Flu Research: In June, researchers in the Netherlands and Wisconsin published a highly controversial study of the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus in which they were able to genetically modify the virus to be transmittable between mammals. The newly-created virus has been called \"scarier than anthrax\" and led the World Health Organization to call for a moratorium on synthetic flu virus research.\n\nNew Skydiving Record: After years of false starts and delays, Austrian skydiver Felix Baumgartner broke the 50-year-old skydiving record when he jumped from a capsule more than 24 miles above Earth's surface. In doing so, he became the first human to break the sound barrier outside of an aircraft and proved the effectiveness of the full-body pressure suit, which could one day help astronauts survive if they have to abort a mission.\n\nAntibiotic-resistant Superbugs: Both the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization warned that gonorrhea could soon join HIV as an \"uncurable\" disease as the bacteria is quickly developing resistance to most known antibiotics. The disease is estimated to infect more than 100 million people per year and can cause infertility, painful urination, and birth defects in babies born to women with the disease.\n\nHiggs Boson: On July 4, scientists at Europe's CERN announced they'd found a particle that could be the famous \"Higgs boson\" particle, which is believed to be responsible for all mass in the universe. The discovery of the particle has been called the \"final missing ingredient in the Standard Model of particle physics,\" which is used to describe every known thing in the visible universe.\n\n\"We have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature,\" CERN Director General Rolf Heuer said of the discovery.\n\nCuriosity\n\nAnd one major disappointment:\n\nTransatlantic Travel: Much of the world watched in August as the Air Force tested its X-51A Waverider, a hypersonic, unmanned aircraft that would be able to reach speeds of more than 4,500 miles per hour\u2014fast enough to cross the Atlantic in an hour. Unfortunately, the test failed in less than a minute, sending the Air Force back to the drawing board.\n\nJason Koebler is a science and technology reporter for U.S. News & World Report.

{"text":"Tuesday, 21 December 2010\n\nI don't know if you have heard this, but science just got real. Recently, a bacteria was found in a salty lake that defies everything modern science has ever thought possible. This bacteria can substitute one of the six previously \"essential\" elements needed for life to exist. This is HUGE NEWS!\n\nThe bacteria uses Arsenic, a poison, in place of phosphorus to live. Until now, scientists claimed that for life to exist on Earth, the life form in question has to use either carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur or phosphorus to exist. No example has EVER been found that defies this rule of biochemistry. I know what you're thinking, \"Who gives a shit?\" Well, this little discovery has opened a whole bunch of new questions as to what can be possible.\n\nFor one, this life form indicates that life could have begun and ended many more times than we thought possible. Some speculate that this bacteria has been around before Earth had oxygen!\n\nThink of it like this, if our ancestry can be traced back through a tree of life, this bacteria indicates a whole different species of tree. Life can exist outside our known understanding, also exciting news for alien enthusiasts everywhere.\n\nIf this bacteria can use such a harsh element to live, who knows how many planets and moons it can exist on. Previously we all thought life could only exist if the planet had water, an atmosphere, was the right distance from a star, etc. This shatters that notion, making it now possible for life to exist in some of the most inhospitable places in the Universe.\n\nImagine a world where these arsenic based life forms can thrive (a place radically different than our planet). What happens when they start to grow larger and more complex?\n\nRelated Posts\n\nComments (17)\n\nI remember learning about the things that are essential for life in high school and wondering how the hell anyone can know for SURE that absolutely every living thing in the universe requires X, Y and Z to exist. It never made sense to me. I think this is an awesome discovery. It gets us out of our ignorant little we-know-it-all boxes. We don't know shit, in the spectrum of things.\n\nVery interesting, this pretty much confirms my notions that life probably does exist on other planets...I've always thought it was possible for other lifeforms to exist and thrive under different conditions.\n\nOkay, so I love that you're so excited about this, because I love nerd-talk. It's the best, and the most fun.\n\nI have no disagreement with how exciting this is, I just think that there's a lot of things that we don't know, so how is this a shocker? The only thing that bothers me about science: why do we need to know every fucking thing in the universe? And this is coming from a person that prizes knowledge. But seriously...the past's the past. And if there's no evidence to support it besides a bacteria...no meaning of a schedule or a drawing or a new bone to suggest anything (by all of these I'm saying there's no significance to it other than the fact that there was something before what we already knew (which is SO shocking because we're so effing fantastic, right?))...than whoopdy-doo. Ya know?\n\n@Kelsicus@xanga - Whoopdy do indeed. It seems the more we know, the less we know in this instance. It amazes me the amount of money that is spent on simple \"knowledge\" that gets us no closer to knowing exactly what it is we want to know.\n\n@raiderjester@xanga - I think true wisdom is best summed up by Socrates: It's knowing that you know nothing. Because you can't know everything. Knowledge is too vast. No one can know that much. It's about learning mostly.\n\nA chemist from the Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution in Gainesville, Florida, who works on alternative forms of DNA, is sceptical that the bacteria really do contain arsenic. \"I doubt these results,\" he says, since in order to measure the modified DNA it has to be put into a water-containing gel, which would rapidly dissolve any arsenate molecules. Any hypothesis that arsenate might replace phosphate in biomolecules must take this into account, he says."}

{"text":"Archive for April, 2012\n\nI listened to two Long Now Foundation talks on my way to Newark, Delaware and back yesterday for my colloquium talk. These podcasts tend to be quite long, so they were perfect for the drive. The first was by environmental activist and journalist Mark Lynas and the second by National Geographic photographer Jim Anderson. Both were much more interesting than I expected. Lynas, who originated the anti-genetically modified organism (GMO) food movement in Europe in the 1990s, has since changed his mind and become more pragmatic. He now advocates for a more rational environmental movement that embraces technological solutions such as GMO foods and nuclear energy. He argues that many more people are killed by particulate matter from coal-fired generating plants in a year than over the entire history of nuclear use. I have always felt that nuclear power is the only viable technology to reduce carbon emissions. I have also argued previously that I'm more worried about the acidification of the ocean due to CO2 than an increase temperature. I think we should start building CANDU reactors now and head towards fast breeder reactors.\n\nJim Anderson talked about the loss of diversity of domesticated plants and animals and how they are essential for the survival of humans. For the first 9,900 years of agriculture, we increased the diversity of our food stuff. For the last hundred, we have gone in the other direction. We used to have hundreds to thousands of varieties of fruits and vegetables and now we're down to a handful. There are at most 5 varieties of apples I can buy at my local supermarket, yet a hundred years ago, each orchard would produce its own variety. This leaves us extremely vulnerable to diseases. The world's banana supply is dominated by one variety (the Cavendish) and it is under siege by a fungus that threatens to wipe it out. The Irish potato famine was so severe because they relied on only two varieties that were both susceptible to the same blight. Our fire wall against future blights are seed banks, where we try to preserve as many varieties as we can. However, not all seeds can remain viable forever. Many have to be planted every few years from which new seeds are harvested. This replanting is often done by amateur horticulturists. The podcast made me think that with the cost of genome sequencing dropping so rapidly, what we need now is for someone, like Google, to start sequencing every living being and making it publicly available, like Google Books. In fact, if sequencers become cheap enough, this could be done by amateurs. You would find some plant or animal, document it as well as you can, and upload the sequence to the virtual seed bank. This can be a record of both wild and domesticated species. We can then always resurrect one if we need to. There could also be potential for mischief with highly dangerous species like small pox or anthrax, so we would need to have a public discussion over what should be available.\n\nIf you have any interest at all in economics, finance, or the financial crisis, then I highly recommend PBS Frontline's series on Money, Power and Wall Street, which can be accessed here. I watched episode two last night on how the 2008 bank bailouts were engineered in 2008. Then New York Fed president Tim Geithner favored bailouts, following the game plan established by Robert Rubin, Larry Summers and Alan Greenspan during the 1990\u2032s. While then Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson was initially hesitant because of the moral hazard. However, he did approve of the bailout of Bear Stearns in March, 2008 where the US Federal Reserve basically gave JP Morgan 30 billion dollars to buy it. Paulson had a total change of heart after he let Lehman Brothers fail in September, 2008. The credit market seized and he started to panic when even non-financial institutions started to complain that they would have trouble operating because their access to loans had dried up. This led to the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) where Paulson forced all the major banks to take money without any conditions. I thought that we should have let the banks fail in 2008. The US Fed could then temporarily nationalize the failed banks and start anew. They could even retain most of the lower level staff so institutional knowledge would not be completely lost. Instead of bolstering insolvent banks, we could have lent to small businesses and homeowners directly.\n\nI listened today to the podcast of science fiction writer Bruce Sterling's Long Now Foundation talk from 2004 on \"The Singularity: Your Future as a Black Hole\". The talk is available here. Sterling describes some of the ideas of mathematician and science fiction writer Vernor Vinge's conception of the singularity as a scary moment in time where super human intelligence ends the human era and we have no way to predict what will happen. I won't address the issue of whether or not such a moment in time will or not happen in the near future or ever. I've posted about it in the past (e.g. see here, here and here). What I do want to discuss is whether or not there can exist events or phenomena that are so incomprehensible that it will reduce us to a quivering pile of mush. I think an excellent starting point is former US Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld's infamous speech from 2002 regarding the link between Iraq and weapons of mass destruction prior to the Iraq war, where he said:\n\n[.\n\nWhile Rumsfeld was mocked by the popular media for this seemingly inane statement, I actually think (geopolitical consequences aside) that it was the deepest thing I ever heard him say. Rumsfeld is a Bayesian! There is a very important distinction between known unknowns and unknown unknowns. In the first case, we can assign a probability to the event. In the second we cannot. Stock prices are known unknowns, while black swans are unknown unknowns. (Rumsfeld's statement predates Nassim Taleb's book.) My question is not whether we can predict black swans (by definition we cannot) but whether something can ever occur that we wouldn't even be able to describe it much less understand it.\n\nIn Bayesian language, a known unknown would be any event for which a prior probability exists. Unknown unknowns are events for which there is no prior. It's not just that the prior is zero, but also that it is not included in our collection (i.e. sigma algebra) of possibilities. Now, the space of all possible things is uncountably infinite so it seems likely that there will be things that you cannot imagine. However, I claim that by simply acknowledging that there exist things that I cannot possible ever imagine, is sufficient to remove the surprise. We've witnessed enough in the post-modern world, to assign a nonzero prior to the possibility that anything can and will happen. That is not to say that we won't be very upset or disturbed by some event. We may read about some horrific act of cruelty tomorrow that will greatly perturb us but it won't be inconceivably shocking. The entire world could vanish tomorrow and be replaced by an oversized immersion blender and while I wouldn't be very happy about it and would be extremely puzzled by how it happened, I would not say that it was impossible. Perhaps I won't be able to predict what will happen after the singularity arrives but I won't be surprised by it clear and simple terms. Their use of metaphors was particularly good. I think these are two very good examples of how to talk about science to the general public.\n\nI highly recommend this EconTalk podcast on financial fraud with William Black. It gives a great summary of how financial fraud is perpetrated. It also clearly highlights the difference in opinions on the cause of the recent financial crisis. What most people seem to agree on is that the financial crisis was caused by a system wide Ponzi scheme. Lots of mortgages were issued (some were liar loans where the recipients clearly were not qualified, while some were just risky); these loans were then packaged into mortgage-backed securities (e.g. CDOs) by investment banks who them sold them to other banks and institutional investors like hedge funds and pension funds. As long as housing prices increased, everyone made money. Homeowners didn't care if they couldn't pay back the loan because they could always sell the house. The mortgage lenders didn't care if the loans go bad because they didn't hold the loans and made money off of the fees. Like a classic Ponzi scheme, when the bubble burst everyone lost money, except for those who got out early.\n\nThe motivation for the mortgage lenders seem quite straightforward. They were making money on fees and the more mortgages the more fees. When they ran out of legitimate people to lend to, they just lent to riskier and riskier people. The homeowners were simply caught in the bubble mania at the time. I remember people telling me I was an idiot for not buying and that house prices never go down. The question at dispute is what were the incentives for the investment banks and institutional investors to go along with this scheme. Why were they fueling the bubble? Libertarians like Russ Roberts, the host of EconTalk, believes that they didn't care if the bubble burst because they knew they would be bailed out by the government. To him, the moral hazard due to government intervention was the culprit. The pro-regulators, like Black, believe that this was a regulatory failure in that the incentives were to commit and reward fraud. The institutional investors simply didn't do the due diligence that they should have because the money was rolling in. He cites the example of Enron, where incredible profits were booked through accounting fraud, which not only didn't raise alarm to investors, but only attracted more money leading to more incentives to perpetuate the fraud. He also says that thousands of people were prosecuted for fraud in the eighties after the Savings and Loans crisis but no one has been prosecuted this time around. He believes that unless we criminalize financial fraud, this will only continue. The third view, shared by people like Steve Hsu and Felix Salmon, was that the crisis was mostly due to incompetence (Steve calls this bounded cognition). The investment banks had too much confidence or didn't fully understand the risks in their financial instruments. They thought they could beat the system. The fourth possibility is that people knew it was a Ponzi scheme but either felt trapped and couldn't act or thought they could get out in time. It was a pure market failure in that the rational course of action led to a less efficient outcome for everyone."}

The German team, led by Marlijn Noback of Eberhard Karls University of T\u00fcbingen, took computer-aided measurements of the nasal cavities of 100 skulls representing 10 human groups living in five different climates. They found that the nasal cavities of cold, dry climate populations are relatively high and show a larger and more abrupt change in diameter in the upper part of the cavity than those of hot, humid climate populations.

If this feat is achieved, it would be possible for the average person to design, customize and print a specialized robot in a matter of hours. Currently, it takes years and many resources to produce, program and design a functioning robot. This project would completely automate the process, from sketches on-demand, anywhere, and with the skill of a team of professional engineers, leading to potential transformations in advanced manufacturing.\n\n\"This research revolutionizes the design and manufacturing of robots, with a profound potential impact on society,\" says Ralph Wachter, a program director in the NSF Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering. \"It would remove barriers to manufacturing robots, making it possible for average citizens to customize and manufacture their own robots to meet their needs. This opens the door to great possibilities.\"\n\n\"This research envisions a whole new way of thinking about the design and manufacturing of robots, and could have a profound impact on society,\" says MIT Professor Daniela Rus, project leader and director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL). \"We believe that it has the potential to transform manufacturing and to democratize access to robots.\"\n\nThe Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, known as CSAIL, is the largest interdepartmental laboratory at MIT and one of the world's most important centers of computer science and information technology research. The lab has played a major role in the technology revolution of the past 50 years. Currently, CSAIL is focused on conducting groundbreaking research in artificial intelligence, computer systems, and the theory of computation, while also tackling pressing societal challenges such as education, health care, manufacturing and transportation.\n\n\"Our goal is to develop technology that enables anyone to manufacture their own customized robot. This is truly a game changer,\" adds engineering professor Vijay Kumar, who is leading the team from the University of Pennsylvania. \"It could allow for the rapid design and manufacture of customized goods, and change the way we teach science and technology in high schools.\"\n\nBreaking News: Mars Suitable for Life!! - Earlier"}

{"text":"Research NewsLook up at the night sky and you'll see stars, sure. But you're also seeing planets\u2014billions and billions of them. At least.\nThat's the conclusion of a new study by astronomers at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) that provides yet more evidence that planetary systems are the cosmic norm.

{"text":"New & Noteworthy\n\nYou may never have herded cows. But in one way or another, you've certainly experienced the tragedy of the commons.\n\nWhen herders get away with cheating, everyone loses. The same thing is often true for yeast. Image from Wikimedia Commons\n\nThis happens when a village shares a pasture that can only feed a certain number of cows. For the system to work, everyone has to cooperate and keep the total number of cows under that limit. But inevitably, one cheater comes along and adds extra cows to his herd. At no immediate cost to himself, he gets all the benefits of the extra cows. But then tragedy kicks in as the pasture is overgrazed until no one can have any cows.\n\nThis doesn't just happen out in the village. We can see it in the overfishing of the oceans, the production of carbon dioxide contributing to global warming, the milking of investors on Wall Street, and many other aspects of modern life. But perhaps surprisingly, we can even see it in cultures of the humble yeast S. cerevisiae.\n\nIn a recent issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Waite and Shou set up a yeast system to look at the factors influencing the tragedy of the commons. In human society, sometimes cheaters cause a collapse, but other times, cooperators get together and exile the cheaters from the village. You might think that since yeast aren't quite as smart as humans, in yeast \"society\" the cheaters would always win. However, Waite and Shou found that sometimes the cheaters were marginalized or even driven out, and the cooperators thrived!\n\nTo do these experiments, the researchers set up a very clever pasture in miniature. They engineered three strains, each marked with a different-colored fluorescent marker so they could be distinguished from each other.\n\nThe two \"cooperator\" strains needed each other to survive on minimal medium: one required lysine and produced excess adenine, while the other required adenine and produced excess lysine. The \"cheater\" strain required lysine but it didn't provide any nutrients. So the cheater needed one of the cooperators to survive, but didn't contribute anything to the common good.\n\nAs we might expect, being cooperative has a cost. The generous production of extra nutrients made the cooperator grow slower than the otherwise identical cheater strain. So you would predict that if you mixed the cooperators and the cheater in equal numbers and grew them together, the cheater would take over and collapse the culture every time.\n\nHowever, when the researchers mixed all three strains in a 1:1:1 ratio and grew lots of replicate cultures, they found that cheaters didn't always prosper. Sometimes the nice guys finished first.\n\nOf course some of the cultures did collapse under the influence of the rapacious cheaters. After a while these cultures stopped growing and turned out to be made up of mostly dead or dying cheater cells. The cheaters had taken over the culture, selfishly using up the lysine until eventually there was not enough to continue growing.\n\nBut unexpectedly, other replicate cultures were growing much faster, at rates similar to cultures without any cheaters. In these cultures, the two cooperator strains had either dominated the culture or even driven the cheaters extinct!\n\nTo explain this, the researchers proposed that the intense selection pressure led to an adaptive race between cooperators and cheaters. In surviving cultures, the rare cooperator with a small advantage had outcompeted the cheaters.\n\nTo confirm this, they took a close look at the winning cooperators. They found that the fitness advantage could be inherited, so they used whole-genome resequencing to find out why the cooperators were outcompeting the cheaters. They kept finding mutations in the same five genes.\n\nThese genes all made sense, as mutating them would help in an environment with limited amounts of lysine. For example, most of the mutations were found in ECM21 and DOA4. Both of these gene products are important in pathways that break down proteins like permeases. Knocking them out would keep the permeases around longer, making for better lysine uptake. But this newfound advantage did not come without a price.\n\nWhile cheating is usually a good short term strategy, it doesn't always work out so well in the long term. Image from Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe researchers tested directly whether the adaptive mutations improved growth in limiting amounts of lysine. Without exception, they did. But almost all these strains grew more slowly in abundant lysine than did their ancestor strains. That explains why these mutant strains only became a significant proportion of the population late in the life of the culture, when lysine levels were very low.\n\nThe same mutations can arise in both cooperators and cheaters, of course. But when cheaters become better at growing in low lysine levels, they just become that much better at making themselves extinct. When cooperators get better at growing in low lysine levels, they are better able to keep growing and keep the cheaters at bay.\n\nSo the take-home lesson is that cooperation does pay, after all. Especially in a constantly changing environment, cooperators can often win the adaptive race and squelch the cheaters. Maybe we should take a hint from little S. cerevisiae that being kind to each other is not only a nice thing to do, it's in all of our best interests!\n\nSGD periodically sends out its newsletter to colleagues designated as contacts in SGD. This Fall\/Winter 2012 newsletter is also available online. If you would like to receive the SGD newsletter in the future please use the Colleague Submission\/Update form to let us know.\n\nSGD has incorporated two new S. cerevisiae strain genomes: CEN.PK113-7D and ZTW1. CEN.PK113-7D is a laboratory strain derived from parental strains ENY.WA-1A and MC996A, and is popular for use in systems biology studies. ZTW1 was isolated from corn mash used for industrial bioethanol production in China in 2007. We have also incorporated an updated genomic sequence for W303-derivative K6001, a key model organism for research into aging. The previous version of W303 was an early view courtesy of Markus Ralser. SGD has updated the ORF DNA and protein sequence alignments to include these two additional strains, and the updated W303. We have also included the new genomic, coding, and protein sequences in both the BLAST Search and Pattern Matching (PatMatch) tools. The alignments are accessible via the Analyze Sequence section on the Locus Summary pages. Also available are retrieval and download options.\n\nUnlike the rest of us, cells are happy with either a copy or the original.\n\nIf you got to choose between an original and a copy of that original, you'd undoubtedly choose the original. Because of mistakes during the copying process, the original is bound to be superior.\n\nCairns was the first scientist to try to apply the same logic to cells like mother cells of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, or stem cells. The idea is that since these cells make lots of copies of themselves, they might have some mechanism for keeping the original DNA and sending the copies to the new cells. This would protect the original DNA from building up mutations.\n\nWhile this seems reasonable, the many studies done to date have failed to provide any compelling evidence to support the idea. When scientists look at a cell's DNA in bulk, they see it randomly dividing between mother and daughter. But this is not the end of the story.\n\nAnother idea people have had is that one of the strands of the double helix is kept in its original form in the mother while the other is free to be passed on to the daughter. There is mounting evidence in yeast and mammalian cells that there is some strand-specific selection going on. But in a new study out in GENETICS, Keyes and coworkers show that this selection is not dependent on a strand being an original as opposed to a copy.\n\nIf mother cells preferentially keep one of the strands, then the red ones should only end up in the MD and DM cell types in this experiment. The real results were that all four cell populations had the red DNA. (Image from Keyes et al. used with permission from GENETICS)\n\nThey use a couple of cool tricks to be able to follow specific strands of DNA in specific cell types in these experiments. First, they engineered a strain that would incorporate BrdU (bromodeoxyuridine) into newly synthesized DNA, so that they could distinguish between the original and copied strands. Second, they used a technique to separate mother cells from daughter cells that involves arresting the mother cells with alpha factor, labeling them with biotin, and then allowing them to divide: the mothers can be pulled away from the daughters by their biotin labels.\n\nAs you can see from the image on the right, Keyes and coworkers let a population of biotin-labeled mother cells divide once in the presence of BrdU. Next they separated mothers (M) from daughters (D) and biotinylated the daughters.\n\nNext they let the two populations divide separately one more time in unlabeled thymidine (TdR) instead of BrdU, and separated mothers from daughters again. As shown in the figure, this allowed them to isolate four different cell populations:\n\n1) MM: the original mother cells 2) MD: daughters of the original mothers 3) DM: mother cells derived from the first daughter 4) DD: daughters of the first daughter\n\nThe image shows the prediction if the Watson strand (W) is preferentially kept by the mother. As you follow along, remember that the red strand represents the labeled DNA.\n\nIf mother cells inherit the Watson strand specifically (W) and the daughter cell always gets the Crick strand (C), then we would predict that only MD and DM cells should have BrdU DNA. The other two cell types should only have unlabeled DNA.\n\nLet's follow the mother side to see why. The mother cell would inherit the unlabeled Watson strand and a labeled Crick strand because she would keep the original from the first division. The labeled and so copied Crick strand would then be passed preferentially to the daughter.\n\nThe same sort of logic applies to the daughter cell. The daughter inherited the labeled Crick strand. Since this daughter now becomes the mother in the next division, the labeled strand now becomes the Watson strand. She would keep this labeled strand and pass the unlabeled Crick strand to her daughter.\n\nThese are not the results they got. Instead, all the cell types had pretty close to the same amounts of BrdU. The moms did not preferentially hang on to either the original Watson or Crick strand.\n\nThey then followed this up with a separate, similar experiment that looked at each individual chromosome on a microarray. The results were that there was no bias for either strand for any of the chromosomes.\n\nIt seems that mom doesn't hang onto the original DNA even at a single chromosome. In the cases of strand-specific selection that are now being studied, there are most likely other ways to pick a strand that have nothing to do with whether it is an original or a copy. Another great idea foiled by data\u2026\n\nThank you for your patience during our move to the new data center last week.\n\nSystems Administrator Stuart Miyasato with the SGD servers in their new location\n\nThis move is very significant for us, as we are now in a professionally managed computing facility with all the necessary backup cooling and power contingencies available. This move also allows us to continue expanding our services.\n\nThe computer room is critical for the stability of SGD and other resources. Our previous location was created when SGD was young, and did not accommodate the amount of growth we have enjoyed. We are very happy to have the opportunity to be located in this brand new facility designed for research computing."}
{"text":"Life on Earth first came out of the oceans, but the water itself may have originated from extraterrestrial space rocks. A new study points to a turbulent period when the solar system's giant planets hurled chunks of icy rubble in Earth's direction.\n\nThis goes against the more favored scientific theory that Earth's oceans and atmosphere formed from elements within the planet interior, around 4.5 billion years ago. The Nature study argues that the primordial temperatures never dropped enough to condense both volatile elements and water alike, and that the waters of our blue planet must have arrived during a later period of planet building, about one hundred million years after Earth was formedCongress charged NASA with finding 90 percent of nearby space rocks greater than 140 meters (460 ft) by 2020.

Called \"North Korea Uncovered\", the project has pinpointed everything from nuclear facilities to restaurants, from anti-aircraft arsenals to a waterslide.\n\n Here's a look back at some of the highlights.\n\nAny guesses on future Google Earth discoveries? Will Google Earth be an ever-more-important scientific tool in the future? Post in the comments.Yep, that's right. Mickey proves Kermit wrong in the whole \"it's not easy being green\" arena with the release of Disneynature's first film, Earth. Opening today in theaters, the movie follows three animal \"families\" on a journey for survival across our planet.\n\nThere is no denying we humans are obsessed with real estate. We always like to think we've landed ourselves a prime piece of land to settle on, and that outlook extends past your home, vacation home, and country and all the way out to the Earth itself.\n\nHollywood, in its infinite desire to generate easy profits, has decided to do yet another remake of the Jules Verne classic Journey to the Center of the Earth -- this time in 3-D!. As we can see from the trailer, this movie is going to be a special effects extravaganza. Now, while we all know that the entire idea of traveling to the center of the Earth is pure fantasy, and any \"science\" represented in the movie is not to be taken seriously, we have so much scientific information about the state of the Earth's interior -- much more than Jules Verne ever could know -- that somehow the premise just falls flat.\n\nThe search for a planet analogous to our own has taken one step closer with the discovery of the smallest extrasolar planet yet orbiting a star which could support life. It is about three and one-third times the size of Earth, much more in line with our home than the gas giants on the scale of Jupiter or Saturn we had been finding up to this point. (An even smaller planet has so far been found, but it is orbiting a pulsar. Pulsars spew highly powerful radiation, so it's highly unlikely that anything within their vicinity could survive).\n\nPhoto Galleries\n\nearth"}
