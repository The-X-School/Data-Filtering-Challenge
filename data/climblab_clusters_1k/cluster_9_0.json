{"text":"Science Musings Blog\n\nSaturday, January 16, 2010\n\n...in vacant or in pensive mood...\n\nFor those with a decent amateur telescope, spring is a good time for galaxy hunting. There is a swath of sky between the Big Dipper and Virgo that is rich in \"island universes\", including the magnificent M81 in Ursa Major and the Whirlpool Galaxy in Canes Venatici. M94 is in Canes Venatici too, another of Charles Messier's fuzzy spots. And that is what it looks like through an amateur telescope. It's only the bright central core of the galaxy that one sees -- a smudge on the windowpane of night.\n\nThursday's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) is the most revealing image yet of this beautiful face-on spiral, more or less a twin of our own Milky Way Galaxy. For the first time we see the faint outer arms of the galaxy, dragging their gas and stars in a grand sweeping revolution -- perhaps turning once on its axis every few hundred million years.\n\nWhat I love about this photograph is the way it reveals the three-dimensionality of space.\n\nWhen we look at M94, we are looking pretty much straight up out of the flat spiral of the Milky Way; that is to say, we are looking into the deep universe with as little as possible obscuring local stuff in the way. But there happens to be three Milky Way stars in the picture, the three bright objects with diffraction spikes (caused by the telescope). These stars are less than, say, a thousand light-years away, which is about the thickness of the Milky Way Galaxy in our neighborhood of the spiral arms. These stars are much too faint to be seen with the naked eye.\n\nM94 is 15 million light-years away. If the Milky Way Galaxy were a dinner plate (containing hundreds of billions of stars, including the Sun and the three we see here), M94 would be another dinner plate a few hundred feet away -- down the block. That makes it, by the way, a relatively near neighbor. By comparison, the closest spiral galaxy, the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), would be a dinner plate just across the room.\n\nExcept for the three local stars, the stars we see in this image of M94 are the giants of that galaxy. A mediocre star like the Sun would not show up in the picture at all.\n\nBut wait! We have another layer of universe.\n\nHere and there among the stars of M94 you can see what look like little elongated smudges; for example, one above and one below the central nucleus. I can count a dozen or so. These are other galaxies, other M94s if you will, far, far beyond -- other dinner plates in the next town.\n\nAnd so this APOD invites our imaginations to soar, up and out of our galaxy across millions of light-years of empty space to another magnificent whirl of hundreds of billions of stars, and then on -- on -- on into the depths of a universe whose vastness and hidden wonders our species has only begun to sample."}

This view includes the whole galaxy and the surrounding sky, and clearly shows the asymmetric spiral arms. The longer of the two arms has intense star formation, which is visible here as a pink glow.\n\nBy John Roach, Contributing Writer, NBC News\n\nTwo complementary views of the so-called Meathook Galaxy, released today, show how astronomers are piecing together the history of this lopsided group of stars.\n\nThe galaxy, located about 50 million light years away in the southern constellation Volans (The Flying Fish), is recognized for its asymmetrical spiral arms. One is tightly folded in on itself and host to a recent supernova, and the other is dotted with new star formation and extends far out from the nucleus.\n\nNASA \/ ESA \/ ESO\n\nThis close-up Hubble view of the Meathook Galaxy focuses on the more compact of its two asymmetric spiral arms as well as the central regions. The spiral arm was the location of a supernova that exploded in 1999. These Hubble observations were made in 2006 in order to study the aftermath of this supernova. Ground-based data from MPG\/ESO 2.2-metre telescope were used to fill out parts of the edges of this image.\n\nThe lopsided appearance is thought to be due to the gravitational interactions of another galaxy, though the culprit remains unknown, the European Space Agency noted in an image advisory. This interaction is probably responsible for an episode of recent star formation, seen as the patches of pink and red, particularly in the longer of the two spiral arms.\n\nThese colors come from hydrogen gas in star forming regions, ESA explains. As the powerful radiation of newborn stars excites the gas in the clouds they formed from, it glows in a bright shade of red.\n\nThe close-up view from the Hubble Space Telescope focuses on the nucleus of the Meathook and the more compact of its two spiral arms. Not seen in the image is a massive star that exploded at the end of its life in a supernova, witnessed in 1999. By comparing older ground-based observations, previous Hubble images and these made in 2006, astronomers have been able to study the details of the star's violent death. By the time this image was made, the supernova had faded"}

{"text":"March 18, 2013\n\nThese images of distant galaxies shown above are a perfect examples of gravitational lensing. In the middle of the image are a large number of galaxies stretched out into almost straight streaks of light that look like shooting stars. Meanwhile, just above and to the right of the large, bright elliptical galaxy in the upper left of the image is a spiral galaxy whose apparent shape has been stretched and mirror-morphed into the shape of an alien from the classic 1970s computer game Space Invaders! A second, less distorted image of the same galaxy appears to the left of the elliptical galaxy.\n\nHubble's ability to see distant objects will be enhanced with the start of Frontier Fields in the near future, an observing campaign that aims to combine the power of Hubble with the natural gravitational telescopes of high-magnification clusters of galaxies \u2014 as seen here with Abell 68. This will enable Hubble to see objects that would ordinarily be too distant or faint for it to see.\n\nFrontier Fields will study six different galaxy clusters to give us a sneak preview of the very earliest stars and galaxies, before the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018. Although the resulting images projected to us of these distant galaxies are typically heavily deformed, this process, called gravitational lensing, is a hugely valuable tool in cosmology, the branch of astronomy which deals with the origins and evolution of the Universe.\n\nThe effect of this huge concentration of matter is to deform the fabric of spacetime, which in turn distorts the path that light takes when it travels through the cluster. For galaxies that are even further away than the cluster \u2014 which is already at the impressive distance of two billion light-years \u2014 and which are aligned just right, the effect is to turn galaxies that might otherwise be invisible into ones that can be observed with relative ease.\n\nAnother striking feature of the image, one unrelated to gravitational lensing, is the galaxy in the top right corner of the image. What appears to be purple liquid dripping from the galaxy is a phenomenon called ram pressure stripping. The gas clouds within the galaxy are being stripped out and heated up as the galaxy passes through a region of denser intergalactic gas.\n\nThis image comes from the infrared channel of Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3, combined with near-infrared observations from the Advanced Camera for Surveys. This offers a modest taster of the kind of images that will come from the forthcoming NASA\/ESA\/CSA James Webb Space Telescope, which is scheduled for launch in 2018.\n\nInfrared images are particularly useful for studying very distant objects whose light is redshifted into the infrared by the expansion of the Universe, as well as for peering through dust clouds which are opaque to visible light. The Webb telescope will produce images which are sharper than Hubble's infrared images, but more importantly, it will be much more sensitive, thanks to its advanced sensors and larger primary mirror.\n\nThe image is based in part on data spotted by Nick Rose in the Hubble's Hidden Treasures image processing competition.\n\nComments\n\nPerhaps what is being lens is magnetism? Per R Duncan\/UT physicist, 44*10 to 13 power Gauss makes a magnetic field that distorts normal rules. Rather than unlimited gravity making black holes that have to be taken on faith, perhaps it is magnetism that we know exists as pulsars, quasars, etc., making jokes with the universe."}
{"text":"Deep in the heart of the spiral Milky Way galaxy, a hot vortex of matter swirls around a black hole more than a million times as massive as the sun. Many galaxies, perhaps all, contain such a \"monster in the middle.\"\n\nThese supermassive black holes sustain themselves by swallowing stars, planets, asteroids, comets and clouds of gas that wander by the crowded galactic core.\n\nNASA's NuSTAR spacecraft recently caught the Milky Way's central black hole in the act of having a snack.\n\n\"We got lucky and captured an outburst from the black hole during our [first] observing campaign,\" says Fiona Harrison, the mission's principal investigator at the California Institute of Technology.\n\nNuSTAR is an orbiting observatory designed to take pictures of violent, high-energy phenomena in the universe.

The Milky Way's black hole had just swallowed ... something.\n\nBlack hole snacks are a violent process in which the \"meal\" is ripped apart by powerful tides and heated to millions of degrees as it slides down the gullet of the gravitational singularity. In this case, NuSTAR picked up X-rays emitted by matter being heated up to about 100 million degrees Celsius.\n\nThe observation raises hopes that astronomers will be able to solve a long-standing mystery: Why is the Milky Way's supermassive black hole such a picky eater?\n\nCompared to giant black holes at the centers of other galaxies, the Milky Way's is relatively quiet. More active black holes tend to gobble up matter in prodigious quantities. Ours, on the other hand, is thought only to nibble or not eat at all.\n\nAsteroids could be a primary food source. One model holds that trillions of asteroids surround the Milky Way's core. Astronomers using the Chandra X-ray Observatory have indeed detected flares consistent with asteroids 10 km wide or larger falling into the black hole.\n\nThese space rocks would be about the same size as the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs on Earth 65 million years ago. Smaller space rocks might be falling in, too, but their flares would be too weak for Chandra to detect.\n\nNuSTAR brings something new to the problem. With its unprecedented ability to detect and make focused images of X-ray flares, the telescope will almost certainly help astronomers understand what's happening deep in the core of our galaxy.

{"text":"This image shows Arp 147, a pair of interacting galaxies some 430 million light years from Earth, as seen by the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Hubble Space Telescope. The ring-shaped object on the right is a remnant of a spiral galaxy that collided with the elliptical galaxy to the left millions of years ago.\n\nBy John Roach, Contributing Writer, NBC News\n\nHere's a piece of eye candy to share with your honey this Valentine's Day: a colorful ring of stars encrusted with black holes that cast a pink glow, thanks to a little creative image processing.\n\nSo what are we actually seeing? This is a pair of interacting galaxies known as Arp 147, located about 430 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Cetus. The unusual arrangement was formed when the remnant spiral galaxy (right) collided with the elliptical galaxy on the left. The collision produced an expanding wave of star formation that shows up here as a blue ring containing an abundance of massive young stars. These stars race through their evolution in a few million years and explode as supernovae, leaving behind neutron stars and black holes, as explained in a Chandra image advisory.\n\nSome of these neutron stars and black holes have companion stars and can become bright X-ray sources as they pull in matter from these companions. The nine X-ray sources scattered around the ring in Arp 147 are so bright that they must be black holes, with masses likely 10 to 20 times that of the sun.\n\nThe image also shows an X-ray source in what astronomers believe is a poorly fed supermassive black hole in the center of the red galaxy. Other objects in the image include a foreground star (visible at lower left) and a background quasar (seen as the pink source above and to the left of the reddish galaxy).\n\nInfrared observations of Arp 147 with NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and ultraviolet observations with NASA's Galaxy Evolution Explorer allowed astronomers to estimate the rate of star formation in the ring. According to their calculations, the most intense star formation ended about 15 million years ago in Earth's time frame.\n\nX-ray images from four celestial phenomena \u2014 the supernova remnants G292.0+1.8 and 3C58, the Cat's Eye Nebula and the spiral galaxy NGC 4631 \u2014 have been combined to produce this holiday graphic from the Chandra X-ray Center.\n\nBy Alan Boyle, Science Editor, NBC News\n\nAstronomers and artists are making it easy to turn beautiful imagery from outer space into greetings for the holiday season. You just have to know where to look ... and be a little crafty yourself.\n\nFor example, the Space Telescope Science Institute is offering 25 designs based on Hubble Space Telescope imagery that are suitable for printing as greeting cards. Some of the cards incorporate the latest, greatest pictures that were sent down last year after Hubble's final servicing mission. You can print out the cards at home, but you'll get the best result if you bring the images in to a photo or print shop.\n\nOr maybe you don't need to print out a single card. Instead, how about sending out space images as e-cards? The team behind NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory offers an assortment of e-cards for lots of occasions, ranging from Thanksgiving to Valentine's Day, from the Fourth of July to birthdays. The false-color X-ray hues make for a festive look. Heck, some of the cards are even animated.\n\nThe Space Weather Center offers more e-cards that feature astronomical images as well as high-energy experiments here on Earth.\n\nEven astronauts appreciate getting holiday greetings, and NASA is offering an easy way to send a postcard to the International Space Station, with no postage required. Just use this Flash-enabled website to select a card and write your message. As an alternative, you can send a holiday tweet to the Twitter account used by NASA's astronauts. If you hurry, you can get your message in before three of the space station's crew members take a Thanksgiving trip back down to Earth (departure is scheduled for 8:22 p.m. ET on Turkey Day.)\n\nAnother way to celebrate the holiday season, space-style, is to click your way through an online Advent calendar. The idea comes from the tradition of making calendars with little doors that children can open for each day from Dec. 1 to 25. A treat can be found inside each door -- with the biggest and best treat behind the door for Christmas Day, of course.\n\nA couple of years ago, Alan Taylor at The Big Picture began the tradition of unveiling a fresh Hubble picture for each day between Dec. 1 and Christmas -- and last year, the Planetary Society's Emily Lakdawalla joined in on the fun with an Advent calendar featuring solar system views. (Her calendar ran all the way through the end of the year.)\n\nI've linked to last year's offerings, but it's a safe bet that there'll be a fresh crop of glorious views for this Advent season, beginning a week from today. In fact, you just might see a different kind of spaced-out Advent calendar right here on Cosmic Log.\n\nSpeaking of calendars, I always look forward to the 12-month space calendars offered by the European Space Agency's Hubble team. The new calendar is usually posted to the SpaceTelescope.org website pretty late in the season, but this year there's a work-around. Because the days and dates line up in 2011 the same way they did in 2005, you can simply adapt the 2005 calendar files for the coming year. It doesn't hurt that the 2005 edition has some of my favorites, such as the Cat's Eye Nebula and the Red Rectangle.\n\nCrafty, no?\n\nIf you have other suggestions for giving the holiday season a space spin, feel free to pass them along in your comments below.

Why?\n\nI believe the conventional assumption concerning angular moment in the universe on very large scales is that it is net zero. (i.e. The universe does not rotate.) As far as I know there is no observational evidence on a very large scale or on a large scale to question that base assumption.\n\nFor example a cluster of galaxies does not rotate. If clusters of galaxies did rotate as a group that would be evidence that the net angular moment in the universe was not zero.\n\nI have not seen a good explanation as to why the stars in a spiral galaxy rotate as a group which means that a spiral galaxy has net angular moment.\n\nJust as puzzling for the opposite reason, is why the stars in an elliptical galaxy do not rotate as a group. The stars in an elliptical galaxy orbit the elliptical galaxy's centre such that the net angular moment of the entire elliptical galaxy is zero.\n\nWhy do the stars as a group in a spiral galaxy rotate? Can angular moment be created?\n\nAlso curiously, elliptical galaxies have almost no gas and dust, whereas, spiral galaxies, I believe, have 20% of their mass in gas and dust.\n\nThe diagram in the attached link shows how the net angular moment of spiral galaxy is positive while it is net zero for an elliptical galaxy."}

{"text":"^ That's a section of galaxy M83 in a composite image of Chandra X-ray and optical data. The large, deep pink spot at the top middle is a new ultraluminous X-ray source, or \"ULX\"; these are objects that give off more gamma ray radiation than typical binary systems, or \"as much energy in X-rays as a million suns radiate at all wavelengths.\" In the case of the most powerful ULXs, the suggestion is that one of the binary partners is a very large black hole, on the order of 40 to 100 solar masses; the largest known stellar mass black hole in our galaxy, by comparison, is more like 15 solar masses.\n\nBut there are a few even more unusual things about this particular ULX. One is its high variability: \"the source had increased in X-ray brightness by at least 3,000 times [between 2000 and 2010] and has since become the brightest X-ray source in M83,\" says NASA. The other is the age of its stellar companion, which is thought to be a red giant, about 500 million years old; in a binary system, the two bodies are usually about the same age, having formed from the same source, so the implication is that this black hole is about 500 million years old. Other ULXs before this one had hot, bright young blue stars for companions, so this is the first time astronomers have seen evidence for a large stellar mass black hole this old.\n\nThis suggests that there could be many more old black holes drifting around, which I suppose most astronomers would predict--given that very large stars almost invariably form black holes at the end of their relatively brief lives, in theory--but they're usually darned hard to spot, so they got a bit lucky that they were looking when this one started eating some material and sending out X-rays (and that its jet was pointing directly at us, of course). I tend to think that once a good way of detecting the quiet black holes is hit upon, we'll find that there are oodles and oodles of them, young and old, pretty much everywhere stars have been."}

All that we actually see is a snapshot. Perhaps these stars have their velocities for some other reason. The article does not mention if the velocities are in different directions or all generally in the same direction. If it is the same direction, perhaps the stars formed out of a fast-moving stream of gas. Maybe th remains of a plasma jet? If different directions you need to rule out coincidence, which may be hard given so few stars. Also most studies I've seen neglect the influence of electric and magnetic fields on dust, gas, plasma.

As the material which made up the exploding star which caused the gamma-ray burst and the material from which our galaxy is made came into being at the same time, i.e. The big bang, how have we managed to travel billions of light years since the big bang and the light from the gamma-ray burst is catching up with us only now when it started its journey so soon after the big bang."}
{"text":"Thomas E. Everhart, who has headed Caltech for the last nine years, announced Wednesday that he will step down as president next year. In a letter to faculty and students, Everhart, 64, said he was making his announcement now to provide ample time to find a successor who can continue some of the broad initiatives already underway to enhance the quality of education and research at the famed Pasadena institution.\n\nNowadays Big Science requires Big Money. Recognizing that fact, the W. M. Keck Foundation has come up with a $70-million gift to Caltech to build the world's largest optical telescope, a 10-meter (400-inch) instrument that will enable astronomers to peer farther into the universe and further back in time than ever before. Because the universe is expanding, the farther away an object is, the longer ago it was created.\n\nSquinting into the dark heart of the Milky Way, astronomers have discovered a star that orbits closer to the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy than any other star yet observed. The relatively dim star, known as S0-102, is so close that it takes just 11.5 years to circle the black hole at speeds as high as 5,000 kilometers per second - or 1.7% as fast as the speed of light. The previous record-holder, S0-2, took 16 years to make its way around. A black hole is a star whose mass has collapsed to a point called a singularity.\n\nHoping to develop one of the world's major observatories, San Diego State University officials have announced plans to build a powerful, $2-million research telescope at their Mt. Laguna Observatory 40 miles east of San Diego. The university hopes the 100-inch telescope will attract astronomers from around the world to study at the observatory, which sits 6,100 feet above sea level in the Cleveland National Forest. Its visitor center already has two apartments for visiting astronomers.\n\nSquinting into the dark heart of the Milky Way, astronomers have discovered the closest star yet to the galaxy's supermassive black hole. The relatively dim star, S0-102, takes just 11.5 years to circle the black hole. The previous record-holder, S0-2, took 16 years to make its way around. A black hole is a star whose mass has collapsed to a point, a singularity. Its intense gravity distorts space-time so much that not even light can escape. The one at the center of the Milky Way contains the mass of 4 million suns. is because they usually detect so-called exoplanets through indirect means - by observing how they obscure a tiny bit of light as they pass between their star and our vantage point, or how their gravity makes their host star wobble. Scientists can surmise a planet's distance from its star and some details about its size and mass, but it's difficult for them, for instance, to characterize the components in an exoplanet atmosphere - the kind of detail that might help researchers assess, someday, whether life could thrive on a planet or not. But on Thursday, a team of Canadian and American scientists reported new observations that provide unprecedented detail about a large, gaseous planet orbiting a young, bright star called HR 8799, about 130 light years away from our sun. The observations, made using at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, were published online in the journal Science . Pointing the telescope toward the far-off planetary system and analyzing infrared signals, the team could see \"chemical fingerprints\" of the atmosphere of the giant planet HR 8799c that potentially explain how it formed, the study's coauthors said Wednesday during a phone call with reporters.\n\nThe W. M. Keck Foundation on Monday will announce a gift of $150 million to boost scientific research at USC's medical school and at two affiliated hospitals, adding to the university's recent success in attracting supersized donations. The gift is the single largest in the 57-year history of the Keck Foundation, which has backed many scientific projects, including the famous Keck Observatory and telescopes in Hawaii. For USC, the money marks the third mega-gift since March, for a total of $460 million, as new President C. L. Max Nikias seeks to build the Los Angeles university's endowment.\n\nAn international team of astronomers on Monday announced the discovery of 28 planets outside the solar system, the greatest single haul since the first so-called exoplanet was found 12 years ago. Still eluding the planet hunters, however, is the much-longed-for Earth replica, a planet like ours that could nourish some kind of life, allowing humans to feel a little less lonely in the cosmos.\n\nAuto navigation systems that display maps and directions have been showing up in high-priced cars for several years. Aside from cost, the main drawback of these digital maps is that they require drivers to take their eyes off the road to continually glance at the map.

Each ice crystal acts like a miniature lens. Because The setting of the above picture is Athens, Greece. The distant planet Jupiter appears by chance on the halo's left. Exactly how ice-crystals form in clouds remains under investigation.\n\nHow do stars form? A study of star forming region W5 by the sun-orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope provides clear clues by recording that massive stars near the center of empty cavities are older than stars near the edges. A likely reason for this is that the older stars in the center are actually triggering the formation of the younger edge stars. The triggered star formation occurs when hot outflowing gas compresses cooler gas into knots dense enough to gravitationally contract into stars. Spectacular pillars, left slowly evaporating from the hot outflowing gas, provide further visual clues. In the above scientifically-colored infrared image, red indicates heated dust, while white and green indicate particularly dense gas clouds. W5 is also known as IC 1848, and together with IC 1805 form a complex region of star formation popularly dubbed the Heart and Soul Nebulas. The above image highlights a part of W5 spanning about 2,000 light years that is rich in star forming pillars. W5 lies about 6,500 light years away toward the constellation of Cassiopeia.\n\nThe four interacting galaxies (NGC 7319, 7318A, 7318B, and 7317) have an overall yellowish cast and tend to have distorted loops and tails, grown under the influence of disruptive gravitational tides.

In fact, individual stars in the foreground galaxy can be seen in the sharp Hubble view, hinting that it is much closer than the others. Stephan's Quintet lies within the boundaries of the high flying constellation Pegasus.\n\nThis bright meteor streaked through dark night skies over Sutherland, South Africa on November 15. Potentially part of the annual Leonid meteor shower, its sudden, brilliant appearance, likened to a camera's flash, was captured by chance as it passed between two clouds. Of course, the two clouds are also visible to the eye in dark southern skies - the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds - satellite galaxies of our own Milky Way. This year's Leonid meteor shower peaked on November 17 as the Earth passed through the stream of dust from periodic comet Tempel-Tuttle.\n\nGlaring near the top of the frame, the shuttle orbiter Endeavour rockets into the night on the STS-126 mission. Endeavour left planet Earth on November 14 from Launch Pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, making the 27th flight to the International Space Station. To record the dramatic view, the camera was placed so the shuttle's flight path tracked across the Moon, from a vantage point in Indian River City, Florida. Near picture center the almost full, perigee Moon shining through thin clouds silhouettes the shuttle's dense exhaust trail. On board the space station, the crew and the STS-126 astronauts can celebrate the orbital outpost's 10th anniversary today. Construction of the International Space Station officially began with the November 20, 1998 Russian launch of the station's first element, the bus-sized Zarya module.\n\nWhat does the Earth look like from the Moon? A new version of this space age perspective was captured by the robotic Kaguya spacecraft currently in orbit around Earth's Moon. Launched two months ago by Japan, the scientific mission of the Selenological and Engineering Explorer (SELENE), nicknamed Kaguya, is to study the origin and evolution of the Moon. Last month Kaguya reached lunar orbit and starting transmitting data and images. This frame is from Kaguya's onboard HDTV camera. An astronaut standing on the lunar surface would never actually see the Earth rise, since the Moon always keeps the same side toward the Earth. This Earthrise as well as the famous Earthrise captured 40 years ago by the crew of Apollo 8, only occurs for observers in lunar orbit, faint wisps and sheets of dust and gas are particularly evident. The Great Nebula in Orion can be found with the unaided eye just below and to the left of the easily identifiable belt of three stars in the popular constellation Orion.

For starters, on this Friday morning in August 2002, no intense auroral activity was expected at all. Possibly more surprising, however, the aurora appeared to show an usual structure of green rays from some locations. In the above image, captured from North Dakota, USA, a picket fence of green rays stretches toward the horizon. Mirroring the green rays is a red band, somewhat rare in its own right. Lights from the cities of Bismarck and Mandan are visible near the horizon. Large sunspot groups indicate that activity from an active Sun is relatively likely, possibly causing other streams of energetic particles to cascade onto the Earth and so causing more auroras.\n\nGet out your red\/blue glasses and float next to Phobos, grooved moon of Mars!

Well beyond the orbits of the outer planets, Voyager 1 is believed to be entering the realm of deep space near the edge of the heliosphere, the region dominated by the solar wind and magnetic field. Causing some debate, new results from instruments still operating have given indications that the spacecraft could finally be encountering a fluctuating boundary known as the solar wind's termination shock. Illustrated above, the bubble-shaped termination shock is produced when the wind from the Sun slows dramatically and piles up as it runs in to the tenuous interstellar gas. Still farther out, beyond the heliopause, solar wind and interstellar gas begin to mix, while the heliosphere's motion through interstellar space creates a bow shock, analogous to a boat moving through water. Estimates are that both Voyager 1 and 2 have enough power and fuel to operate until about the year 2020. The spacecraft continue to coast toward interstellar space at over 3 AU per year.\n\nBeautiful and bright, the 2002 Leonid meteors battled against glaring moonlight. This winning example, from Tuesday morning skies above Laughlin, Nevada, USA, finds an undaunted Leonid streaking between the familiar constellation of Orion (left) and an overexposed full Moon. As anticipated, the Leonid shower packed a double punch on November 19 with planet Earth plunging through two dense clouds of meteroids, dusty debris left by the passage of comet Tempel-Tuttle. Some European observers reported 10 or so meteors a minute during the first peak near 4:00 Universal Time while North American skygazers witnessed slightly lower rates near the second peak around 10:30 UT. Overall, observed rates were much lower than last year's Leonid meteor storm, but for many the sky was still filled with a rewarding spectacle of bright meteors. And that performance may be a fond farewell for years to come. The annual Leonid meteor shower will not likely approach even these rates again until the end of this century.\n\nAs meteor after meteor streaked across a moonless sky, photographers across the world snapped pictures of the 2001 Leonids Meteor Shower. Many recognized this as the best meteor shower they had ever seen. In fact, the 2001 Leonids was the most active meteor shower since the mid-1960s. The above photo captures three Leonid meteors crossing a photogenic star-field. On the far right is the Pleiades star cluster. The brightest meteor crosses right in front of the Hyades star cluster, situated below the image center. Just left of center is the bright planet Saturn, and the bright star below Saturn is Aldebaran. The ten-minute exposure was taken near Victoria, British Columbia, Canada at 2:45 am PST on 2001 November 18.\n\nThe Leonid Meteor Shower this year could be described as good but not great. During November 17 and 18 the Earth crossed through several streams of sand-sized grit left orbiting the Sun by Comet Tempel-Tuttle. Several distinct peaks in meteor activity were reported, with rates approaching 400 meteors per hour for brief periods for some dark locations. Pictured above, a Leonid meteor was caught from Florida streaking through the constellation of Orion on the morning of 2000 November 18. Visible as a red-tinged smudge to the left of the three nearly linear stars that compose Orion's belt is the picturesque star-forming region known as the Orion Nebula. Next year, the Leonids Meteor Shower is expected by many to be much more active.\n\nA dim double star system cataloged as Gliese 623 lies 25 light-years from Earth, in the constellation of Hercules. The individual stars of this binary system were distinguished for the first time when the Hubble Space Telescope's Faint Object Camera recorded this image in June 1994. They are separated by 200 million miles - about twice the Earth\/Sun distance. On the right, the fainter Gliese 623b is 60,000 times less luminous than the Sun and approximately 10 times less massive. The fuzzy rings around its brighter companion, Gliese 623a, are image artifacts. The lowest mass stars are classified as red dwarf stars, but even red dwarfs are massive enough to trigger hydrogen fusion in their cores to sustain their feeble starlight. Slightly less massive objects, known as brown dwarfs, can shine only briefly as their central temperatures are too low to utilize hydrogen as nuclear fuel. The present estimates of the mass of Gliese 623b are right at this red dwarf\/brown dwarf border but future observations should help clarify the nature of one of our Galaxy's small stars. Dim and difficult to detect, an abundance of objects like Gl623b has been proposed as a possible solution to the mystery of \"Dark Matter\" in the Universe.\n\n\"Goodness, Gracious, Green Balls Of Fire!\", might have been an appropriate theme song title for the 1998 Leonid meteor shower. Many observers, like astrophotographer Steve Dunn watching from Cape Canaveral, Florida, USA, reported that a lot of the characteristically bright Leonid meteors had a greenish tint. Around 6:00 AM EST on November 17, he photographed this dazzling Leonid fireball leaving a striking green-to-white trail against a background of stars in the constellation Coma Berenices. Dunn comments that he considers himself a green novice observer, but is now anticipating next November's appearance of the Leonids shower.\n\nTwisted magnetic fields arching from the solar surface can trap ionized gas, suspending it in huge looping structures. These majestic plasma arches are seen as prominences above the solar limb. On September 14, this dramatic and detailed image was recorded by the EIT experiment on board the space-based SOHO observatory in the light emitted by ionized Helium. It shows hot plasma escaping into space as a fiery prominence breaks free from magnetic confinement a hundred thousand miles above the Sun. These awesome events bear watching as they can affect communications and power systems ninety three million miles away on Planet Earth.\n\nWhat mysteries might be solved by peering into this crystal ball? This crystal ball is quite unusual because it is actually a moon of Jupiter, the crystals are ice-crystals, and the ball is not only dirty and opaque but cracked beyond repair. Nevertheless, speculation is rampant that oceans exist under these tortured ice-plains that could support life. Europa, the smallest of Jupiter's Galilean moons, was photographed last month in natural color by the robot spacecraft Galileo, now in orbit around Jupiter. The brown patches are what one might think: dirt -- tainting an otherwise white ice-crust. Europa, nearly the same size as Earth's Moon, similarly keeps one face toward its home planet. The hemisphere of Europa shown above is the one that always trails. Why is Europa's surface the smoothest in the Solar System? Where are Europa's craters?\n\nDensely packed stars in the core of the globular cluster M15 are shown in this Hubble Space Telescope (HST) image taken in April of 1994. The stars revealed are contained in an area 1.6 light years across and their colors roughly indicate their temperatures - hot stars appear blue, cooler stars look reddish-orange. M15 has long been recognized as one of the densest cluster of stars in our galaxy outside of the galactic center itself. Even the unprecedented resolving power of the HST cameras could not separate the individual stars in its innermost regions. However, this HST image reveals that the density of stars continues to rise toward the cluster's core, suggesting that a sudden, runaway collapse due to the gravitational attraction of many closely packed stars or a single central massive object, perhaps a black hole, could account for the core's extreme density.\n\nAs I was admiring the great Hubble image of Stephan's Quintet, I was thinking that the image would have been even better if it had shown emission nebulae. (Actually, I can spot a bit of blue-green in parts of foreground galaxy NGC 7320, but these blue-green spots and knots don't stand out well against the broad blue spiral arms where they are found.) If these emission nebula had been shown as red they would have stood out so much better, and it would have been so much easier to tell how many very young stars the galaxies contain, as opposed to stars which are merely bluer and younger than the Sun.\n\nAs I searched the Hubble Legacy Archive, I found that it does indeed contain Ha data both for nearby NGC 7320 (where 656 nm has been redshifted to 657 nm) and for much more distant galaxy NGC 7318B, the galaxy in Stephan's Quintet which has set off the most brilliant fireworks (where, if I understand the data correctly, the Ha line has been redshifted to 665 nm).\n\nCheck out this page to find Hubble data about Stephan's Quintet. The second picture from the top in the right-hand column appears to show Ha data.\n\nSo it would have been possible to process the Hubble data so that it had shown the red emission nebulae of Stephan's Quintet. It would have been so nice if Hunter Wilson had included the Ha data - not that he didn't do a splendid job anyway."}

{"text":"Physics Professor and Chair Discovers New Details about Important Radio Galaxy\n\nSince his Ph.D. thesis on the growth of radio jets 40 years ago, Paul Wiita, chair of The College of New Jersey's Physics Department, has been fascinated with radio galaxies, the largest connected objects in the universe. His most recent work on them, in collaboration with Dr. S. Sirothia and Prof. Gopal-Krishna of Pune, India, concerns the discovery of \"fossil lobes\"on the well-known radio galaxy \"3C452,\" and is soon to be published in the March 1, 2013 issue of Astrophysical Journal Letters. Through research launched twenty years before by Wiita and Gopal-Krishna, and the use of software developed by Sirothia, the three scientists have changed the classification of 3C452 from a \"classical\" to \"double-double\" radio galaxy, and, consequently, unearthed a clue to the evolution of our universe.\n\nA radio galaxy, such as 3C452, normally has two extensive lobes filled with extremely hot gas (plasma) and magnetic fields that can extend far beyond the stars that make up the visible galaxy. These lobes are inflated by plasma moving at nearly the speed of light through a pair of jets. The oppositely directed jets are launched from the vicinity of an extremely massive black hole at the center of the galaxy. By rapidly orbiting the lines of magnetic field, the plasma's electrons create electromagnetic radiation seen as radio waves through a radio telescope. During their approximately 10 million years of activation, these \"radio-loud\" lobes can grow millions of light years long, pushing through intergalactic gasses and filling created voids with plasma. \"The energy and momentum carried by the jets that form the lobes can compress clouds of much colder gas. This can trigger star formation,\" said Wiita. \"If the clouds are massive enough, then the formation of entire galaxies could be triggered by the radio lobes.\"\n\nThe production of stars and galaxies by radio lobes has led to the theory that radio galaxies played a role in the evolution of the universe, a theory that has become more The Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) of Gopal, India, used to observe the fossil lobes of Galaxy 3C452strongly supported with the discovery of Double-double radio galaxies (DDRGs). DDRGs are radio galaxies with four lobes of plasma instead of two. The outer lobes are called \"fossil lobes,\" as they are relics of past activity of the radio galaxy, indicating that there were at least one previous active period. Through the same mechanisms seen in today's radio lobes, fossil lobes may have contributed to the synthesis of past stars and galaxies, advancing the evolution of the universe.\n\nThrough observations taken at the low radio-frequency of 325 megahertz with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in India, Sirothia, Gopal-Krishna, and Wiita discovered fossil radio lobes around 3C452, signifying that this galaxy also was emitting radio waves in the past and the lobes may have contributed to the evolution of the universe.\n\nTheir work illustrates that lower radio frequency observations may lead to more DDRG discoveries that would strengthen the theory that radio galaxies significantly contributed to the universe in the past. With the construction of more sensitive telescopes in Australia and Europe, the 3C452 discovery may be the forerunner of many more DDRG discoveries to come."}
{"text":"Scientists pin down the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud\n\nCareful observations of a rare class of double stars have\nallowed a team of astronomers to deduce a more precise value for this neighboring dwarf galaxy \u2014 163,000 light-years.\n\nBy\nESO, Garching, Germany \u2014\nPublished:\nMarch 7, 2013\n\nThis photograph shows the Large Magellanic Cloud, a neighbouring galaxy to the Milky Way. The positions of eight faint and rare cool eclipsing binary stars are marked with crosses (these objects are too faint to appear directly in this picture). By studying how their light changes and other properties of these systems, astronomers can measure the distances to eclipsing binaries accurately. A long series of observations of these objects has now led to the most accurate determination so far of the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud \u2014 a crucial step in the determination of distances across the universe. \/\/ESO\/R. Gendler\n\nAfter nearly a decade of careful observations, an international team of astronomers has measured the distance to our neighboring galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), more accurately than ever before. This new measurement also improves our knowledge of the rate of expansion of the universe \u2014 the Hubble Constant \u2014 and is a crucial step toward understanding the nature of the mysterious dark energy that is causing the expansion to accelerate. The team used telescopes at the European Southern Observatory's (ESO) La Silla Observatory in Chile as well as others around the globe.\n\nAstronomers survey the scale of the universe by first measuring the distances to close-by objects and then using them as standard candles to pin down distances farther and farther out into the cosmos. But this chain is only as accurate as its weakest link. Up to now, finding an accurate distance to the LMC, one of the nearest galaxies to the Milky Way, has proved elusive. As stars in this galaxy are used to fix the distance scale for more remote galaxies, it is crucially important.\n\nBut careful observations of a rare class of double stars have now allowed a team of astronomers to deduce a more precise value for the LMC distance \u2014 163,000 light-years.\n\n\"I am very excited because astronomers have been trying for a hundred years to accurately measure the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud, and it has proved to be extremely difficult,\" said Wolfgang Gieren from the University of Concepci\u00f3n in Chile. \"Now, we have solved this problem by demonstrably having a result accurate to 2%.\"\n\nThe improvement in the measurement of the distance to the LMC also gives better distances for many Cepheid variable stars. These bright pulsating stars are used as standard candles to measure distances out to more remote galaxies and to determine the expansion rate of the universe. This, in turn, is the basis for surveying the universe out to the most distant galaxies that can be seen with current telescopes. So the more accurate distance to the LMC immediately reduces the inaccuracy in current measurements of cosmological distances.\n\nThe astronomers worked out the distance to the LMC by observing rare close pairs of stars known as eclipsing binaries. As these stars orbit each other, they pass in front of each other. When this happens, as seen from Earth, the total brightness drops, both when one star passes in front of the other and when it passes behind.\n\nBy carefully tracking these changes in brightness and measuring the stars' orbital speeds, it is possible to work out how big the stars are, their masses, and other information about their orbits. When this is combined with careful measurements of the total brightness and colors of the stars, scientists can find remarkably accurate distances.\n\nThis method has been used before, but with hot stars; however, certain assumptions have to be made in this case, and such distances are not as accurate as scientists would like. But now, for the first time, scientists have identified eight extremely rare eclipsing binaries where both stars are cooler red giant stars. These stars have yielded more accurate distance values \u2014 accurate to about 2%.\n\n\"ESO provided the perfect suite of telescopes and instruments for the observations needed for this project \u2014 HARPS for extremely accurate radial velocities of relatively faint stars, and SOFI for precise measurements of how bright the stars appeared in the infrared,\" said Grzegorz Pietrzynski from the University of Concepci\u00f3n in Chile and the Warsaw University Observatory in Poland.\n\nRichard, I have to agree with Anthony. The number 160,000 lightyears was a guesstemite. Now they are able to find the distance with more precision, perhaps they will be able to measure other things not directly related to that distance that will allow us to know more about space itself. You never know what you will discover or where it will lead.\n\nSubmitted: 3\/18\/2013 8:59:12 AM (CST)\n\nTHOMAS A WALKERfrom MICHIGAN\nsaid:\n\ndark energy and time force are the same thing\n\nSubmitted: 3\/16\/2013 12:21:18 PM (CST)\n\nANTHONY BARREIROfrom CALIFORNIA\nsaid:\n\nRichard, this finding seems very significant to me.\n\nPhotometry of eclipsing binary red giants with ground-based telescopes is a very well-established and reliable method. A rough estimate of 160,000 light years with an unknown confidence interval is very different from an estimate of 163,000 +\/- 3260 light years. Since we use the distance to the LMC as a stepping stone in estimating distances to every more distant object in the universe, both estimated distances and uncertainties will multiply with greater distances. So having a more accurate estimate and a tighter confidence interval is a big deal.\n\nThis team deserves to be proud of their accomplishment!\n\nSubmitted: 3\/15\/2013 1:01:14 PM (CST)\n\nSAM NAUMANfrom TEXAS\nsaid:\n\nGood article. Refining measurements is a continuous effort especially when new techniques are used. Money used for space and astronomy exploration is never money wasted.

{"text":"Hubble spots a bright spark in a nearby spiral galaxy\n\nJun 11, 2012Lying around 50 million light-years away, Messier 99 is one of over a thousand galaxies that make up the Virgo Cluster, the closest cluster of galaxies to us. Messier 99 itself is relatively bright and large, meaning it was one of the first galaxies to be discovered, way back in the 18th century. This earned it a place in Charles Messier's famous catalog of astronomical objects.\n\nIn recent years, a number of unexplained phenomena in Messier 99 have been studied by astronomers. Among these is the nature of one of the brighter stars visible in this image. Cataloged as PTF 10fqs, and visible as a yellow-orange star in the top-left corner of this image, it was first spotted by the Palomar Transient Facility, which scans the skies for sudden changes in brightness (or transient phenomena, to use astronomers' jargon). These can be caused by different kinds of event, including variable stars and supernova explosions.\n\nWhat is unusual about PTF 10fqs is that it has so far defied classification: it is brighter than a nova (a bright eruption on a star's surface), but fainter than a supernova (the explosion that marks the end of life for a large star). Scientists have offered a number of possible explanations, including the intriguing suggestion that it could have been caused by a giant planet plunging into its parent star.\n\nThis Hubble image was made in June 2010, during the period when the outburst was fading, so PTF 10fqs's location could be pinpointed with great precision. These measurements will allow other telescopes to home in on the star in future, even when the afterglow of the outburst has faded to nothing.\n\nA version of this image of Messier 99 was entered into the Hubble's Hidden Treasures Competition by contestant Matej Novak.

Rejkuba et al.\n\nJanuary 10, 2008 A dramatic new Chandra image of the nearby galaxy Centaurus A provides one of the best views to date of the effects of an active supermassive black hole. Opposing jets of high-energy particles can be seen extending to the outer reaches of the galaxy, and numerous smaller black holes in binary star systems are also visible.\n\nThe image was made from an ultra-deep look at the galaxy Centaurus A, equivalent to more than 7 days of continuous observations. Centaurus A is the nearest galaxy to Earth that contains a supermassive black hole actively powering a jet.\n\nA prominent X-ray jet extending for 13,000 light-years points to the upper left in the image, with a shorter \"counterjet\" aimed in the opposite direction. Astronomers think that such jets are important vehicles for transporting energy from the black hole to the much larger dimensions of a galaxy, and affecting the rate at which stars form there.\n\nThis image shows a composite of a radio and an optical image of Centaurus A.\n\nPhoto by NASA\/CXC\/CfA\/R. Kraft et al.\/ESO\/VLT\/ISAAC\/M. Rejkuba et al\n\nThe inner part of the X-ray jet close to the black hole is dominated by these knots of X-ray emission, which probably come from shock waves, akin to sonic booms, caused by the jet. Farther from the black hole there is more diffuse X-ray emission in the jet. The cause of particle acceleration in this part of the jet is unknown.\n\nHundreds of point-like sources are also seen in the Chandra image. Many of these are X-ray binaries that contain a stellar-mass black hole and a companion star in orbit around one another. Determining the population and properties of these black holes should help scientists better understand the evolution of massive stars and the formation of black holes.\n\nAnother surprise was the detection of two particularly bright X-ray binaries. These sources may contain stellar mass black holes that are unusually massive, and this Chandra observation might have caught them gobbling up material at a high rate"}

Image credit: Hubble\n\nThere are spiral galaxies and elliptical galaxies, but one of the strangest you're ever going to see is a ring galaxy. One of the most famous examples of these is Hoag's Object, discovered in 1950 by Art Hoag \u2013 but there are other examples as well.\n\nAnd a ring galaxy really does look like a ring. There's a bright central core, and then a large gap without much luminous matter, and then a bright ring containing hot, blue stars.\n\nAstronomers think that ring galaxies are formed when a smaller galaxy passes through the center of a larger galaxy. The space between stars in a galaxy is vast, so when galaxies collide, the stars don't actually crash into each other. Instead, it's their gravity that makes a mess. In this situation, it's thought that the smaller galaxy slices right through the disk of the larger galaxy. The gravity of the smaller galaxy collapses vast clouds of gas and dust, and creates a burst of star formation around the edge of the larger galaxy.\n\nThe change in gravity drastically affects the orbit of the stars in the larger galaxy. They orbit outward and bunch up into the bright starforming ring. This blue ring is continuing to expand outward, and astronomers believe that it only lasts for a few hundred million years before it begins disintegrating. Eventually only the bright galaxy core will remain.\n\nIn 2004, astronomers released an image of the ring galaxy AM 0644-741 to celebrate 14 years of service by the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nWe have written many articles about galaxies for Universe Today.

{"text":"Nav view search\n\nNavigation\n\nSearch\n\nScientific rationale\n\nThe issue of dust synthesis and evolution in supernovae and their remnants is of great importance to understand the dust budget of galaxies and the origin of cosmic dust in the early universe. The first detection of dust and molecules in the hot ejecta of a core-collapse supernova occurred more than two decades ago. Since then, dust has been observed to form in many other core-collapse supernovae some hundred days after their explosion, often along with the detection of silicon monoxide, SiO, and carbon monoxide, CO. Despite the observational evidence of the synthesis of solids in these hot and harsh environments, there is no consensus on how and how much dust forms in Type II supernovae. Masses derived from infrared observations of hot dust synthesised a year after the explosion fall short of the dust masses derived in the later stage of supernova evolution, i.e., supernova remnants. The debate has recently been rekindled by the observation of large amounts of cold dust in a few supernova remnants by the Herschel telescope at sub-millimetre wavelengths. For more than two decades, pre-solar dust with an origin in supernovae has been found in meteorites and its supernova isotopic fingerprint studied in the laboratory. Such studies provide valuable information on the supernova nucleosynthesis, the ejecta chemical composition, and the locus of dust formation. Pre-solar supernova grains also bring evidence of the survival of ejecta material exposed to the harsh conditions encountered in the remnant, and of the chemical seeding of the solar nebula by supernova explosions, as illustrated by the finding of long-lived nuclides like 60Fe on Earth.\n\nBecause of the great efforts deployed by various communities studying supernovae and their remnants, we think it is very timely to organise an international workshop on the specific topic of dust synthesis and evolution in these environments to try and shed light on the following issues:\n\nDust at high redshift - its sources and role in star formation in the early universe\n\nNucleosynthesis of supernova explosion\n\nExplosion models and early mixing in supernova ejecta\n\nDust formation - its chemistry and physics\n\nPre-solar supernova dust in meteorites - clues on formation processes\n\nMulti-wavelength observations of dust in supernovae ejecta and their remnants\n\nSupernova remnants as dust sources or sinks \u2013 dust reprocessing\n\nSupernova seeding of the interstellar gas and the solar nebula\n\nResults on supernova dust from Herschel and the promise of ALMA\n\nThe workshop will be highly inter-disciplinary and will bring together experts in Astronomy, Astrophysics, Chemistry, Solid State, Nuclear and Meteorite Physics.\n\nThis international workshop is part of the European Science Foundation EuroGENESIS CoDustMas network action, and will take place on 5-8 November 2012 at the Centro Stefano Franscini in Ascona, Switzerland."}

{"text":"Gravitational waves that are 'sounds of the universe'\n\nOct 03, 2011\n\nThis is a simulation of matter ejected from a star merger. Credit: Stephan Rosswog\n\nEinstein wrote about them, and we're still looking for them -- gravitational waves, which are small ripples in the fabric of space-time, that many consider to be the sounds of our universe.\n\nJust as sound complements vision in our daily life, gravitational waves will complement our view of the universe taken by standard telescopes.\n\nAlbert Einstein predicted gravitational waves in 1918. Today, almost 100 years later, advanced gravitational wave detectors are being constructed in the US, Europe, Japan and Australia to search for them.\n\nWhile any motion produces gravitational waves, a signal loud enough to be detected requires the motion of huge masses at extreme velocities. The prime candidate sources are mergers of two neutron stars: two bodies, each with a mass comparable to the mass of our sun, spiraling around each other and merging at a velocity close to the speed of light.\n\nSuch events are rare, and take place once per hundreds of thousands of years per galaxy. Hence, to detect a signal within our lifetime the detectors must be sensitive enough to detect signals out to distances of a billion light years away from Earth. This poses an immense technological challenge. At such distances, the gravitational waves signal would sound like a faint knock on our door when a TV set is turned on and a phone rings at the same time.\n\nCompeting noise sources are numerous, ranging from seismic noise produce by tiny quakes or even a distant ocean wave. How can we know that we have detected a gravitational wave from space rather than a falling tree or a rambling truck?\n\nTherefore, astronomers have been looking for years for a potential electromagnetic light signal that would accompany or follow the gravitational waves. This signal would allow us to \"look through the peephole\" after hearing the faint knock on the door, and verify that indeed \"someone\" is there. In their new article just published in Nature, Prof. Tsvi Piran, Schwarzmann University Professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and Dr. Ehud Nakar from Tel Aviv University describe having found just that.\n\nThey noticed that surrounding interstellar material would slow debris ejected at velocities close to the speed of light during the merger of two neutron stars. Heat generated during this process would be radiated away as radio waves. The resulting strong radio flare would last a few months and would be detectable with current radio telescopes from a billion light years away.\n\nSearch after such a radio signal would certainly take place following a future detection, or even a tentative detection of gravitational waves. However, even before the advanced gravitational wave detectors become operational, as expected in 2015, radio astronomers are geared to looking for these unique flares.\n\nNakar and Piran point out in their article that an unidentified radio transient observed in 1987 by Bower et al. has all the characteristics of such a radio flare and may in fact have been the first direct detection of a neutron star binary merger in this way.\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Detectors in the US, Germany and Italy are lying in wait to gather evidence that would unveil one of Albert Einstein's last secrets: gravitational waves.

{"text":"Monday, April 30, 2012\n\nHow can a star get kicked out of the galaxy?\n\nIn fact, the primary mechanism that astronomers have come up with that can give a star the two-million-plus mile-per-hour kick it takes requires a close encounter with the supermassive black hole at the galaxy's core.\n\nSo far astronomers have found 16 of these \"hypervelocity\" stars. Although they are traveling fast enough to eventually escape the galaxy's gravitational grasp, they have been discovered while they are still inside the galaxy.\n\nNow, Vanderbilt astronomers report in the May issue of the Astronomical Journal that they have identified a group of more than 675 stars on the outskirts of the Milky Way that they argue are hypervelocity stars that have been ejected from the galactic core. They selected these stars based on their location in intergalactic space between the Milky Way and the nearby Andromeda galaxy and by their peculiar red coloration.\n\n\"These stars really stand out. They are red giant stars with high metallicity which gives them an unusual color,\" says Assistant Professor Kelly Holley-Bockelmann, who conducted the study with graduate student Lauren Palladino."}
{"text":"Feb 28, 2013\n\nThe Green Bank Telescope and some of the molecules it has discovered. Credit: Bill Saxton, NRAO\/AUI\/NSF\n\n(Phys.org)\u2014\n\nThe scientists used the National Science Foundation's Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia to study a giant cloud of gas some 25,000 light-years from Earth, near the center of our Milky Way Galaxy. The chemicals they found in that cloud include a molecule thought to be a precursor to a key component of DNA and another that may have a role in the formation of the amino acid alanine.\n\nOne of the newly-discovered molecules, called cyanomethanimine, is one step in the process that chemists believe produces adenine, one of the four nucleobases that form the \"rungs\" in the ladder-like structure of DNA. The other molecule, called ethanamine, is thought to play a role in forming alanine, one of the twenty amino acids in the genetic code.\n\nIn each case, the newly-discovered interstellar molecules are intermediate stages in multi-step chemical processes leading to the final biological molecule. Details of the processes remain unclear, but the discoveries give new insight on where these processes occur.\n\nIn the above video, students and their astronomer-advisor share the excitement of discovery.\n\nPreviously, scientists thought such processes took place in the very tenuous gas between the stars. The new discoveries, however, suggest that the chemical formation sequences for these molecules occurred not in gas, but on the surfaces of ice grains in interstellar space.\n\n\"We need to do further experiments to better understand how these reactions work, but it could be that some of the first key steps toward biological chemicals occurred on tiny ice grains,\" Remijan said.\n\nThe discoveries were made possible by new technology that speeds the process of identifying the \"fingerprints\" of cosmic chemicals. Each molecule has a specific set of rotational states that it can assume. When it changes from one state to another, a specific amount of energy is either emitted or absorbed, often as radio waves at specific frequencies that can be observed with the GBT.\n\nNew laboratory techniques have allowed astrochemists to measure the characteristic patterns of such radio frequencies for specific molecules. Armed with that information, they then can match that pattern with the data received by the telescope. Laboratories at the University of Virginia and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics measured radio emission from cyanomethanimine and ethanamine, and the frequency patterns from those molecules then were matched to publicly-available data produced by a survey done with the GBT from 2008 to 2011.\n\nA team of undergraduate students participating in a special summer research program for minority students at the University of Virginia (U.Va.) conducted some of the experiments leading to the discovery of cyanomethanimine. The students worked under U.Va. professors Brooks Pate and Ed Murphy, and Remijan. The program, funded by the National Science Foundation, brought students from four universities for summer research experiences. They worked in Pate's astrochemistry laboratory, as well as with the GBT data.\n\n\"This is a pretty special discovery and proves that early-career students can do remarkable research,\" Pate said.\n\nThe researchers are reporting their findings in the Astrophysical Journal LettersCombining the cutting-edge capabilities of the ALMA telescope with newly-developed laboratory techniques, scientists are opening a completely new era for deciphering the chemistry of the Universe."}

Hubble calculated the distance to the Andromeda nebula by working out the distance to the Cepheid variables within it, using the relationship between their brightness and pulse frequency. He found out it was around 2.5 million light years away, further than any stars in our galaxy. He studied other spiral nebulae and found a similar result, they were all too far away to be part of the Milky Way, and so must be separate spiral galaxies themselves.\nWhen a galaxy is moving away from earth the wavelength of light from it changes and becomes redder. This is called red shift. By seeing how much the light has been red shifted, it is possible to work out the recession velocity of the galaxy. The greater the red shift, the greater the speed of recession. Hubble compared the speed and the distances of different galaxies and found that the more distant the galaxy, the faster it moves away from us. This can be calculated with Hubble's law;\nspeed of recession (km\/s) = Hubble constant x distance (km)\nP7 \u2013 Gas Behaviour\nThe coldest that anything can ever get is \u2013273\u0410C, this temperature is known as absolute zero. At absolute zero, atoms have as little kinetic energy as it's possible to get and it is the start of the kelvin scale of temperature. To convert from degrees Celsius to kelvin add 273. To convert from kelvins to degrees Celsius subtract 273.\nGas particles are very light, so when they collide with something they exert a force on it. In a sealed container gas particles collide with the container's walls, creating an outward pressure. If the same amount of gas was to be put in a bigger container, the pressure would decrease because there would be fewer collisions between the gas particles and the container's walls. Likewise, if the volume is reduced the pressure will increase because the particles are more likely to collide with other objects.\nThe pressure of a gas depends on how fast the particles are moving and how often they hit the walls of their container. If a gas was heated, the particles would move faster and have more kinetic energy, creating more pressure. The temperature in kelvins and pressure are proportional.\nP7 \u2013 Structure of the Atom\nIn 1909 Ernest Rutherford tried firing positive alpha particles at thin gold foil. Most of the alpha particles went straight through, but others bounced back. Rutherford realised this meant that most of the mass of the gold atom was concentrated at the centre in a nucleus. The rest of the atom was mainly empty space, as most of the alpha particles went through the foil. Rutherford also realised that the nucleus had to have a positive charge, otherwise the positively charged alpha particles wouldn't be repelled by the nucleus and wouldn't but scatter.\nThe nucleus is tiny but makes up most of the mass of an atom. It contains positively charged protons and neutrons which are neutral, giving it an overall positive charge. The rest of the atom is mostly empty space, the electrons move around outside the nucleus, giving the atom its size.\nThe electrons are kept in orbit around the nucleus by the attractive electrical force between the positive nucleus and the negative electrons. If the electrons are given enough energy they can overcome the attractive force and be removed from the atom, this is called ionisation.\nP7 \u2013 Fusion and Stellar Structure\nTwo nuclei can combine to create a larger nucleus, and this is called nuclear fusion. In the core of the sun hydrogen nuclei fuse into helium nuclei and release energy. Stars fuse other elements when the hydrogen runs out. All nuclei are positively charged because they only contain neutrons and protons. Like charges repel so there is a repulsive force between two nuclei. Nuclei can only fuse if they overcome this electrical force and get close enough for the attractive strong force to hold them together. For this, lots of energy such as a high temperature is needed.\nThe core \u2013 most of the fusion in a star takes place here. The pressure from the weight of the rest of the star makes the core hot and dense, so the nuclei in the core are close enough and have enough energy to fuse.\nThe convection zone \u2013 energy released from fusion in the core is transferred by convection and radiation. Energy is transferred to the surface of the star by convection currents in the convection zone.\nThe photosphere \u2013 is visible from earth and is constantly churning because of the constant rising and falling of material in the convection zone.\n$ D k m \u044f \u2116 \u0451 \u0453 \u0454 \u0456 \u0457 A y z \u043b \u0458 \u0455 \u0452\u044f \u0452 \u0452 \u044f\u044a \u0452\u044a \u0452 CJ mH mH CJ mH\nj UmH $ % D \/ k m n \u0081 ' \u0433 \u0430 \u044d \u044f \u2116 \u0451 \u0453 \u0454 \u0456 \u0457 \u0458\nA a z { \u009d \u00a7 \u045b \u00a7 \u0459 \u00a7 \u0456 \u0459 \u00a7 \u045b \u00a7 \u0459 \u0459 \u0459 \u0459 \u00a7 \u00a7 \u00a7 \u045b \u0453 \u00a7 \u00a7 \u045b \u00a7 \u0459 \u00a7 \u00a7 \u00a7 \u045b $ $ $ % D \/ k m n \u0081 ' \u0433 \u0430 \u044d \u044f \u2116 \u0451 \u0453 \u0454 \u0456 \u0457 \u0458\nA a z { \u009d \u017e \u043b \u0413 } \u045c\u0459\u0454\u0451\u044e\u0449\u0446\u045c\u0443\u043e\u0439\u0434\u042f\u042c\u0429\u0426\u045c\u0421\u041e\u041b\u045c\u0418\u0413\u0410\u00ad\u0429\u045c\u040a\u0405\u0402\u0178\u0153\u2122\u2013\" h\u045b\u045f\u045fi\u045b\u045f\u045fk\u045b\u045f\u045f\u045e\u045b\u045f\u045f\u0428\u045c\u045f\u045f \u00a7\u045f\u045f \u043d\u045f\u045f\u045f \u043e\u045f\u045f\u045f\u2014\u045c\u045f\u045f\u0417\u00a7\u045f\u045f \u0444\u045f\u045f\u045f \u0445\u045f\u045f\u045f\u045c\u045f\u045f\u045f\u00a7\u045f\u045f\u045f \u045f\u045f\u045f\u045f }\u045b\u045f\u045f~\u045b\u045f\u045f\u045b\u045f\u045f \u0081\u045b\u045f\u045f \u017e\u045c\u045f\u045f \u203a\u045e\u045f\u045f \u044c\u045f\u045f\u045f \u044d\u045f\u045f\u045f\u02dc\u045b\u045f\u045f \u0161\u045b\u045f\u045f \u0436\u045b\u045f\u045f\u0421\u00a7\u045f\u045f \u0440\u045f\u045f\u045f \u0441\u045f\u045f\u045f $\u009d \u017e \u043b \u0413 } \u00a7 \u045b \u00a7 \u00a7 \u00a7 \u00a7 \u00a7 \u00a7 \u00a7 0\u0410\u0428A \u0410\u0192.!\u0410 \"\u0410 #\u0090$\u0090%\u0410\n[ $ @\u0451\u045f $ N o r m a l mH <"}
{"text":"Tuesday, April 12, 2011\n\nFirst Galaxies Were Born Much Earlier Than Expected, Just 200 Million Years After Big Bang\n\nUsing the amplifying power of a cosmic gravitational lens, astronomers have discovered a distant galaxy whose stars were born unexpectedly early in cosmic history. This result sheds new light on the formation of the first galaxies, as well as on the early evolution of the Universe.\n\nJohan Richard, the lead author of a new study [1] says: \"We have discovered a distant galaxy that began forming stars just 200 million years after the Big Bang. This challenges theories of how soon galaxies formed and evolved in the first years of the Universe. It could even help solve the mystery of how the hydrogen fog that filled the early Universe was cleared.\"\n\nRichard's team spotted the galaxy in recent observations from the NASA\/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, verified it with observations from the NASA Spitzer Space Telescope and measured its distance using W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.\n\nThis illustration shows a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing, which is used by astronomers to study very distant and very faint galaxies. Note that the scale has been greatly exaggerated in this diagram. In reality, the distant galaxy is much further away and much smaller.\n\nThe distant galaxy is visible through a cluster of galaxies called Abell 383, whose powerful gravity bends the rays of light almost like a magnifying glass [2]. The chance alignment of the galaxy, the cluster and the Earth amplifies the light reaching us from this distant galaxy, allowing the astronomers to make detailed observations. Without this gravitational lens, the galaxy would have been too faint to be observed even with today's largest telescopes.\n\nAfter spotting the galaxy in Hubble and Spitzer images, the team carried out spectroscopic observations with the Keck-II telescope in Hawaii. Spectroscopy is the technique of breaking up light into its component colours. By analysing these spectra, the team was able to make detailed measurements of its redshift [3] and infer information about the properties of its component stars.\n\nThe giant cluster of elliptical galaxies in the centre of this image contains so much dark matter mass that its gravitational field bends light. This means that for very distant galaxies in the background, the cluster acts as a sort of magnifying glass, bending and concentrating the distant object's light towards Hubble. These gravitational lenses are one tool astronomers can use to extend Hubble's vision beyond what it would normally be capable of seeing.\n\nThe galaxy's redshift is 6.027, which means we see it as it was when the Universe was around 950 million years old [4]. This does not make it the most remote galaxy ever detected \u2014 several have been confirmed at redshifts of more than 8, and one has an estimated redshift of around 10 (heic1103), placing it 400 million years earlier. However the newly discovered galaxy has dramatically different features from other distant galaxies that have been observed, which generally shine brightly with only young stars.\n\n\"When we looked at the spectra, two things were clear,\" explains co-author Eiichi Egami. \"The redshift placed it very early in cosmic history, as we expected. But the Spitzer infrared detection also indicated that the galaxy was made up of surprisingly old and relatively faint stars. This told us that the galaxy was made up of stars already nearly 750 million years old \u2014 pushing back the epoch of its formation to about 200 million years after the Big Bang, much further than we had expected.\"\n\nCo-author Dan Stark continues: \"Thanks to the amplification of the galaxy's light by the gravitational lens, we have some excellent quality data. Our work confirms some earlier observations that had hinted at the presence of old stars in early galaxies. This suggests that the first galaxies have been around for a lot longer than previously thought.\"\n\nThe discovery has implications beyond the question of when galaxies first formed, and may help explain how the Universe became transparent to ultraviolet light in the first billion years after the Big Bang. In the early years of the cosmos, a diffuse fog of neutral hydrogen gas blocked ultraviolet light in the Universe. Some source of radiation must therefore have progressively ionised the diffuse gas, clearing the fog to make it transparent to ultraviolet rays as it is today \u2014 a process known as reionisation.\n\nAstronomers believe that the radiation that powered this reionisation must have come from galaxies. But so far, nowhere near enough of them have been found to provide the necessary radiation. This discovery may help solve this enigma.\n\n\"It seems probable that there are in fact far more galaxies out there in the early Universe than we previously estimated \u2014 it's just that many galaxies are older and fainter, like the one we have just discovered,\" says co-author Jean-Paul Kneib. \"If this unseen army of faint, elderly galaxies is indeed out there, they could provide the missing radiation that made the Universe transparent to ultraviolet light.\"\n\nAs of today, we can only discover these galaxies by observing through massive clusters that act as cosmic telescopes. In coming years, the NASA\/ESA\/CSA James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled for launch later this decade, will specialise in high resolution observations of distant, highly redshifted objects. It will therefore be in an ideal position to solve this mystery once and for all.\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and ESA.\n\n[1] The research will appear in a paper entitled \"Discovery of a possibly old galaxy at z=6.027, multiply imaged by the massive cluster Abell 383\", to be published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. The international team of astronomers in this study consists of Johan Richard (CRAL, Observatoire de Lyon, Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1, France and Dark Cosmology Centre, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Denmark), Jean-Paul Kneib (Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille, France), Harald Ebeling (University of Hawaii, USA), Daniel P Stark (University of Cambridge, UK), Eiichi Egami (University of Arizona, USA) and Andrew K Fiedler (University of Arizona, USA). Lead author Johan Richard is a former Marie Curie fellow. The European Union's Marie Curie research fund provides grants at post-graduate and post-doctoral level to encourage mobility among Europe's best researchers. The EU will allocate more than \u20ac4.5 billion through the scheme in 2007-2013.\n\n[2] Gravity distorts space-time, the fabric of the cosmos. This means that for extremely massive objects with very strong gravitational fields, light is visibly bent as it travels through and around them. Massive galaxy clusters like Abell 383 therefore act like an enormous lens, concentrating the light from distant objects behind them, in a process known as gravitational lensing. While the galaxies seen through gravitational lenses are typically distorted and multiply imaged (this newly discovered galaxy is actually visible twice in the Hubble observations), using these gravitational lenses multiplies a telescope's power and lets it see galaxies that would otherwise be too faint to be visible. Abell 383, the gravitational lens used in this study, was imaged as part of the CLASH survey (Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble), a Multi Cycle Treasury project to observe a sample of 25 galaxy clusters using Hubble (PI: Marc Postman). Abell 383 is also one of the 50 clusters imaged with the Spitzer Warm mission large project led by Eiichi Egami.\n\n[3] Because the Universe is expanding, the light from distant objects is stretched and reddened as it moves towards us, a phenomenon known as redshift. The further an object is away, the more heavily redshifted it is. For very remote objects, redshift can be used to quantify their distance.\n\n[4] Because light travels at a finite speed, the further away an object is, the further back in time we see it. For an object at a redshift of 6, the light has taken around 12.8 billion years to travel to Earth. Since we know that the Universe is about 13.75 billion years old, this means we are seeing the object in the state it was in less than a billion years after the Big Bang. Redshift is therefore a measure of time elapsed since the Big Bang as well as of an object's distance"}
{"text":"Young stellar clusters\n\nJan 17, 2011\n\nAn image of the young star forming region in Perseus, as seen by the infrared cameras onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. Young stars are seen as pinkish dots. Although the stellar population here differs from that seen in more massive clusters, new research indicates that the processes at work in these modest groups (and the consequent properties of the stars) are one end of a range of normal situations that includes both massive and smaller clusters. Credit: NASA and Spitzer\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Most stars are thought to form in clusters rather than in isolation, as the gas and dust in a molecular cloud coalesces under the influence of gravity until clumps develop that are dense enough to become stars. Most massive stars are also found in such groupings, rather than in isolation.\n\nThere are some nearby star-forming regions, however, that for some reason deviate from this norm: their low mass stars are found in isolation, and they have no massive stars. It is not understood whether the differences arise because there are two distinct contexts for making stars, or because normal clustering occurs across a large continuum of cloud properties with a consequent range of group characteristics.\n\nCfA astronomers Helen Kirk and Phil Myers analyzed the mass and spatial distributions of fourteen nearby, intermediate size young stellar groups looking for evidence of a sharp distinction between clustered and isolated modes of star formation. The groups were chosen because they are young (their stars have not moved very far away from their birthplaces), yet old enough that the mass of each young star can be accurately determined from its spectrum. In addition, the stars are spatially distinct, and the stellar population of each group has been well determined.\n\nThe astronomers conclude that, at least for the groups they examined, the properties are scaled-down versions of large cluster characteristics. The groups' masses span a wide range that is statistically consistent with the normal distribution seen, and moreover there is a correlation between the mass of the most massive star in each group and that of the whole group.\n\nFinally, they find that the most massive member tends to be found near the center of the cluster, just as it does in more massive examples. The results, besides quantifying the cluster properties of these nearby regions, support the conclusion that there is only one mode of star formation at work in both regimes of isolated and clustered star formation.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Most stars form in clusters. Recent studies of nearby star forming regions find that about three-quarters of their young stars are located in groups with ten or more members. The formation ...\n\nMassive stars -- those with more than about eight times the mass of the sun -- are arguably the most important actors in the universe. Much hotter and more luminous than the sun, they live only hundreds of ...Speaking as a statistician, this result looks unthinking and almost stupid. It is pretty well established that the lifetimes of these star nurseries are determined by the size of the largest star formed. (When it becomes a supernova or for Wolf-Rayet stars, almost as soon as they are created.)\n\nThis means that smaller clusters have much longer lifetimes and should be vastly overrepresented in the cluster population. (I'm ignoring globular clusters, as those seem to be remnants of small galaxies stripped of their outer stars by larger galaxies (or galaxies with larger black holes.)\n\nThere is a counter bias in favor of discovering larger star forming regions, but if we try to count all clusters within say 500 parsecs we will find that large clusters are significantly overrepresented, considering their short star-forming lifetimes.\n\nSo what gives? My guess is that smaller clusters have their gas blown out by supernovas in nearby large clusters"}

{"text":"Scientists from UC Berkley's Supernova Cosmology Project are announcing the discovery of the oldest supernova yet, having located it with the Hubble Space telescope at a distance of 10 billion light years. This discovery will provide astronomers with added data that may help them to solve one of the universe's greatest mysteries.\n\nThe glowing gas and dust remnants of a type IA supernova are seen in this false-color image.\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA (Catholic Online) - The ancient supernova occurred some 10 billion years ago, long before the formation of the Sun and Earth. However because it is so distant, it has taken 10 billion years for its light to reach us. That fact may provide astronomers with an important clue they can use to solve a perplexing mystery.\n\nAstronomers know the universe is expanding in all directions, simultaneously, much like a balloon being inflated. Edwin Hubble discovered this in the 1920s when he studied the light from distant galaxies and found they were receding from us.\n\nWhat astronomers recently discovered, and now poses one of the greatest mysteries, is that this rate of expansion is accelerating rather than slowing down or holding constant.\n\nAstronomers compare this to an explosion that become more violent as it continues, rather than slowing down. It is a counter-intuitive mystery they are yet to solve.\n\nHowever, both astronomers and physicists are working quite hard to unravel the mystery. One way astronomers can contribute is to measure distant objects. Certain types of supernovas, known as type IA supernovae, are excellent objects for astronomers to measure because they are uniformly bright.\n\nA supernova is the explosive death of a star that occurs when a star has used all of the hydrogen fuel in its core and no longer has enough fuel to continue shining. The breakdown of atomic fusion in its core causes the outer shell of the star to collapse which in turn causes a uniform explosion in all directions. Stars of different masses produce different kinds of explosions, but type IA supernovas are uniform and equally bright in all directions. This allows them to be used to make precise measurements of distance.\n\nAstronomers refer to them as \"standard candles\" since they serve as one of the several well-understood objects that can be accurately measured.\n\nWhen the Berkeley astronomers found a Type IA supernovae 10 billion light-years distant, they knew they had an incredible find. The find now allows them to measure the distance to the object which they can compare to the expansion rate of the universe to create a data point. That data point can then be used to compare various theories of expansion and evaluate which ones serve to best account for the expansion rate of the universe.\n\nIn all, it's just a little more information than they had before. The team hopes to discover and measure several other similar objects to create a database of information that may help cosmologists settle on the mathematical model which best explains the accelerating universe.\n\nFor now, the mystery remains, but today, it's one step closer to being solvedJerry N\n\n4 months ago\n\n\"...type IA supernovas are uniform and equally bright in all directions. This allows them to be used to make precise measurements of distance.\"\n\nThis \"equal brightness\" is a basic assumption on which \"precise\" (but not necessarily accurate) estimates of cosmic distances depend. Unfortunately, it is an assumption that cannot easily be proven true, and if it turns out to be false, then the \"universe expansion is accelerating \" theory gets blown out of the water. Despite all of our technological sophistication, many of today's cosmological theories still rely on unproven assumptions such as this"}

At its peak, it glowed with the luminosityluminosity, in astronomy, the rate at which energy of all types is radiated by an object in all directions. A star's luminosity depends on its size and its temperature, varying as the square of the radius and the fourth power of the absolute surface temperature. of 100 million suns. \"We had seen nothing like this since the time of [astronomers] Tycho and Kepler,\" says Stanford E. WoosleyStanford E. Woosley (born December 8, 1944) is a physicist, and Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics. He is the director of the Center for Supernova Research at UCSC. He has published over 300 papers. of the University of California, Santa Cruz The University of California, Santa Cruz, also known as UC Santa Cruz or UCSC, is a public, collegiate university, one of the ten campuses of the University of California. .\n\nIn addition to observing X rays, radio waves, and a bright dot of light briefly visible to the naked eye, astronomers in 1987 detected gamma rays from a supernova for the first time. As debris from the explosion ballooned into surrounding space, they also tracked the early stages of the supernova's evolution.\n\nNow, a decade later, 1987A has dimmed considerably in visible light; however, it brightened recently at X-ray and radio wavelengths. As astronomers look forward to 2007, when they predict the shock wave from the exploded star will generate new celestial pyrotechnicspyrotechnics(p\u012b'r\u014dt\u0115k`n\u012dks, p\u012b'r\u0259\u2013), technology of making and using fireworks. Gunpowder was used in fireworks by the Chinese as early as the 9th cent. , they continue to grapple with to enter into contest with, resolutely and courageously.\n\nSee also: Grapple two puzzles.\n\nOn the same day that photographic plates captured the first visible-light image of 1987A, a set of underground detectors recorded a handful of neutrinos from the explosion. The neutrinos arrived within 10 seconds of each other. Detection of these subatomic particles thrilled astrophysicists because it confirmed their basic theory about supernovas.\n\nAccording to the standard model, when an aging star more massive than eight suns finally succumbs to gravity, its core implodes and a shock wave racing out from the collapsed interior ejects the star's outer layers. The remaining core, which is so dense that protons and electrons are pushed together, is known as a neutron star. As it forms, a neutron star emits a brief, but intense, burst of neutrinos.\n\nSince the triumphal detection of the neutrinos, however, astronomers have seen neither hide nor hair of the neutron star. They had expected that its rapid rotation would produce radio waves or that material falling onto it would produce X rays.\n\nSuch emissions from the core of the supernova remnant couldn't have been seen directly, but they should have added to the total energy spewed out by the supernova. All of the radiation emitted by supernova 1987A, however, can be accounted for by the radioactive decay of heavy elements forged during the supernova explosion. If the neutron star exists, it's unusually silent. Some astrophysicists argue that the neutron star's emissions are hidden by dense material surrounding the body. Other researchers conjecture that gas hurled into space during the explosion fell back onto the newly forged neutron star. If the star already had the maximum amount of mass it could hold, the additional material might have transformed it into a black hole, notes Roger Chevalier of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Subsequent material falling onto a black hole might not emit significant amounts of radiation.\n\nThe other puzzling aspect of 1987A concerns a group of three rings that surround the supernova. The innermost ring, which has a radius of about 1 light-year, encircles the center of the explosion. The two outer rings, which lie on opposite sides of the inner ring, complete an hourglasshourglass, glass instrument for measuring time, usually consisting of two bulbs united by a narrow neck. One bulb is filled with fine sand that runs through the neck into the other bulb in an hour's time. shape, with the inner ring as its waist.

Evidence suggests that as recently as 20,000 years before its demise, the aging star had swollen to some 100 times its normal diameter and had become what astronomers call a red supergiant. A gentle, low-speed wind then lifted off some of the puffy star's outermostout\u00b7er\u00b7most adj.

The red supergiant shrank and became a blue supergiant, a star considerably less swollen but, at 10 times its original diameter, still far from svelte.\n\nThe blue supergiant ejected a high-speed wind that eventually caught up with the sluggish material expelled by the star in its previous, red supergiant incarnation. When the blue wind ran into the red wind, it swept the material up into dense clumps that became the three gaseous rings.\n\nSoon after the explosion, ultraviolet radiation from the supernova ionizedi\u00b7on\u00b7ize tr. & intr.v.i\u00b7on\u00b7ized, i\u00b7on\u00b7iz\u00b7ing, i\u00b7on\u00b7iz\u00b7es To convert or be converted totally or partially into ions.\n\ni gas in the rings. As the gas cooled and recombined with the electrons, it emitted the light seen as rings by .\n\nThat simple scenario works well, says Chevalier, up to a point. It explains why the shock wave from 1987A-unlike that from other supernovas-didn't light up its immediate surroundings. There simply wasn't much material there. The blue supergiant's fast wind had already cleared out a cavity. The model also explains why the supernova remnant, after fading, would start radiating more radio waves and X rays. As the expanding shock wave from the explosion ventured farther out and slammed into denser material beyond the blue supergiant's wind, it accelerated electrons to high speeds, causing them to emit radiation. The denser material, in fact, slowed the shock wave from one-tenth the speed of light to less than one-sixtieth.\n\nThis model can't explain, however, why the material swept up by the fast wind should form rings instead of a spherical shell. Researchers, including Richard McCray Boulder, suggest that the wind expelled by the red supergiant blew stronger in some directions than others. One explanation for an uneven wind is that influence of an unseen companion star may have directed it. No one has seen evidence of such a companion, but astronomers will continue to look as the supernova grows dimmerdim\u00b7mer n. 1.

Alternatively, if the red supergiant rotated rapidly, it would have forced material to be blown asymmetrically.\n\nRecent Hubble images of the supernova debris, displayed last month at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society The American Astronomical Society (AAS, sometimes pronounced \"double-A-S\") is a US society of professional astronomers and other interested individuals, headquartered in Washington, DC. in Toronto, show a dumbbell Dumbbell shape consisting of two connected blobs of debris flying apart at nearly 10 million kilometers per hour. The blobs are moving perpendicularly to the plane of the rings, suggesting that whatever property of the red supergiant created the rings may also have influenced the explosion, says Jason Pun of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center The Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is a major NASA space research laboratory established on May 1, 1959 as NASA's first space flight center. GSFC employs approximately 10,000 civil servants and contractors, and is located approximately 6.5 miles northeast of Washington, D.C. in Greenbelt, Md. Two new instruments installed Feb. 15 on Hubble should provide further details on the velocities and shapes of the blobs.\n\nAstronomers expect the supernova's fading image to experience a renaissance 10 years from now. At that time, they predict, debris from the supernova will strike the inner ring. Unlike the explosion a decade ago, this one will require a telescope in order to be seen. In colliding with the ring, says McCray, the supernova will shed light on material from its past and may help astronomers to predict its future.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 1997 Science Service, Inc.\nNo portion of this article can be reproduced without the express written permission from the copyright holder."}

This discovery has wide-ranging implications, because the dust is critical objects in scientific theories related to the formation of stars. Binary star system is located within what astronomers call a red square nebula, which is filled with gas and dust and is approximately at a distance of 2.300 light-years from Earth. One of the double star is a post \u2013 a branch of the asymptotic giant star (post-AGB), the type of star that astronomers see as a possible source of dust. These stars, in contrast to the Sun, have already burned all the hydrogen in their cores and switched to the stage of compression, burning more fuel, and helium. During the transitional period between the processes of combustion of hydrogen and helium, which last tens of thousands years, these stars lose their outer layer of the atmosphere. Dust may be formed in this cooling layer, which due to radiation pressure coming from inside the star, the dust is thrown together with a decent portion of the gas. In Binary Star Systems disk of material post-AGB stars can form around the second star, which is smaller and developed more slowly.

The metropolis of the colony used as raw materials for the agro-for cheap raw materials developing industry and metropolitan markets as a British manufactured goods in order to increase profits. Because of this parliament of England has repeatedly issued laws aimed at arresting the development of productive forces of the colonies. For example, the 1765 law on stamp duty taxed marriage documents, trade agreements, documents about the inheritance, all sorts of official documents, publications, etc. The colonies had their representatives of the British Parliament, and therefore believed that the imposition of discriminatory taxes by Parliament, taxes, tariffs, contrary to natural law \u2013 expressed through their representatives, their own attitudes to new taxation. In addition, restraining the growth of the productive forces of the colonies, the British government conducted ceaseless struggle with skvatterstvom, ie, unauthorized occupation of land.\n\nFor example, in 1763, has issued a special law on Prohibition of colonists to settle west of the Allegheny Mountains. The issue of land acquired so intense, especially in central and southern colonies. that led to armed uprisings of Free Farmers (states New York and North Carolina) against the large landowners. The situation in the colonies is further exacerbated by the fact that along with bourgeois relations continued to exist and feudal relations, which demanded the abolition of rebellious farmers. Thus, England, in which the course of the bourgeois revolution destroyed the feudal relations of production is not going to abandon them to their colonies.\n\nThe UN General Assembly discussed the issue of climate change in UN headquarters in New York on February 11-12, passed thematic debate of the General Assembly \"Addressing climate change: UN and world community.\" UNPO Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has attracted the attention of the meeting to the negative consequences of climate change, which already face the most vulnerable people and the planet will inevitably face future generations.

The project, unlike other reviews, was not intended primarily to punish the pirates (such as Francis Drake), but to build a Spanish domain geo-political and religious Europe. Felipe II, years ago, had already begun their attacks against Protestantism supporting Irish resistance and attacked Holland, a Protestant country, putting in serious trouble the role of empire in the continent. However, it was the execution of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scotland Catholic, which decided to build a special marine: La Grande and Felicissimo Spanish Armada. Preparations began in fact, two years ago.\n\nConcerned about the success of a naval and landing of troops on English soil, King Philip II consulted with various authoritative voices of the time. One of them, the most renowned seaman of his nation, alvaro de Bazan, Marques de Santa Cruz, believes that the naval project is not only feasible, but given the difficult time of the English crown, it is very easy. Unfortunately for Spain, the experienced seaman dies in the midst of preparing the project took command, inexplicably, the inexperienced and marine disqualified Duque de Medina-Sidonia, Alonso de Guzman Lord.

(3) Zombies, hooks and crazy are the bane of all auction bidders. If a zombie know who you are, he \/ she will follow his every move. Their motto is: if that person is willing to spend hundreds of dollars for a lot, I sure can afford to spend a hundred ten. Most people knows what a sham it is.\n\nHe is someone who works for the auction house or vendor who pushes up the prices artificially bidding against him. For an item to get a good price, two or more bidders should be interested in it. Hooks are especially skilled in finding out how high they are willing to go. Fools are those who absolutely must have a lot and will bid necessary to win. The best way to deal with these three young people is to hire an agent for the offer for you.\n\n(4) staff members are professionals who have developed skills in the bidding in the auction. A famous New York auction of stamp agent was adept at hiding their offerings that only the auctioneer and some people never knew how. Strange as it may seem, the payment of an auction agent 2.5% extra charge can save hundreds of dollars or more in the long term. The zombies, hooks and madmen do not know who is the offer against them. (5) Finally, one of the greatest skills important of all is the ability to recognize when the opening of the reins. Condition and rarity are the two most important determinants of prices. The extraordinary item is always worth an additional attempt or two. A customer who was looking at my stamps in a national stamp show said: \"I've been looking for this for over 40 years and has a very good copy. But I never pay more than half the catalog for anything.\" I wished him well. It was a record low and I hope we will still be watching if you live another 40 years. To summarize: knowledge is the key to success in the bidding for the auction. Second, develop your skills as a supplier and buyer. Then, learn to recognize people who will face on the floor of the auction. Crossing and using and agent. And finally, know when to pay a premium for the exceptional item. Many luck!

Thousands of years ago, forests covered much of the planet. But later the situation has changed, people have learned to grow crops and raise animals. And for all this needed new territory. In order to make room for their needs, people began cutting down trees. With increasing numbers of people of the forest is constantly shrinking, if not disappear. Scientists predict that by 2030 the number of inhabitants of the Earth close to nine billion people. Now the population of our planet is about six billion people. And if the problem is the efficiency of agriculture will not be solved any time soon, and the areas under the new agricultural land will continue to increase at the same pace, we do run the risk to remain without a forest \u2026 \u2014- Water for All is not enough according to scientists in 25 years even the most developed and rich countries may face shortages of fresh water.\n\nThis year's 'Earth Hour' was a clear example of what can be achieved inhabitants of our planet, when they unite for a common goal. According to organizers, 134 countries on seven continents, more than 4 thousand cities, including Russian, and more than 750 sites on the legendary around the world put out the lights in 'Earth Hour 2011. \" This year's activity has increased markedly among the participating countries in Asia and Africa. In addition to the city turned off the light more than 750 famous buildings and facilities around the world.

Enthusiasts of more than 20 cities of Russia and Belarus in support of 'Earth Hour' runs carried out on bikes equipped with lights and LEDs. In Moscow, 60 cyclists started from the Eco-Center on the Sparrow Hills. Following the call of UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, the UN on Saturday put out the light in their buildings, including a repaired headquarters in New York.\n\nAction 'Earth Hour' was the first time in Sydney in March 2007 on the initiative of WWF.

The CONTENTIOUS-administrative proceeding this process constitutes a category of the genus process in which given that claims are supported in rules of administrative law, specifically referring to a contentious-administrative proceeding, said Hernando Morales. With respect to those claims that can arise in the contentious-administrative proceeding, we have gone advanced from a booted objective system with the French Revolution, whereby we simply seek the annulment of the administrative act and that doctrine has denominated as process to the Act; until a subjective system built in Spain, according to which the process is full jurisdiction because it protects an individual situation with restoration of the infringed right and the repair of the damage caused.\n\nPrecisely from the validity of the law 27584, law that regulates the contentious-administrative proceeding has been established, rather than a process of judicial review is a process of full legal control of administrative action, judging and making execute deemed.

Therefore the Group of this type of organization conscious or unconsciously, in my opinion, contributes to to follow the course of the conflict by aligning with stalkers, or also in non-involvement (probably for fear that the same thing happens) thus avoiding the corrective or preventive measures. In this way the harasser allows set without sense, job changes, critical tasks unjustified, excessive amounts of work assignments; creating very low moral standards of the Organization and a lack of motivation that leads to these conflict situations.\n\nModern studies of motivation and leadership in the company show that these two factors influencing key aspects: the efficacy of teamwork, integration and sense of belonging corporate executives pictures, the assimilation of changes, innovations and complex situations, the actual capacity and growth and internationalization of an enterprise, or the productivity and competitiveness of the same. A decision is good if it is consistent with the goals that the company intends to achieve and the information potentially available. A high quality solution resolves the problem or you have great chances of achieving it. This attribute serves two functions within the model. First of all, relates to the importance of other attributes. If the quality of the decision is important, other qualities are converted to turn in criticism for a decision effective.\n\nOn behalf of that alleged security, Latin America met most indignant military dictatorships of the 20th century.

{"text":"Tag: neutron stars\n\nThe Carina nebula is a sprawling, monstrous complex of gas located a mere 7500 light years from Earth. Hundreds of light years across, it's massive enough to create thousands of stars like the Sun. Tens of thousands.\n\nAnd churn out stars it does. Embedded in the nebula are several clusters of newborn stars, and many of these stars are so massive they're nearly at the limit of how big a star can be without tearing itself apart. Stars that big explode as supernovae, and a new mosaic by the orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory indicate they've been popping off in the nebula for quite some time:\n\n[Click to enchandrasekharlimitenate.]\n\nThis image is pretty amazing: it's a mosaic of 22 separate images by Chandra, covering 1.4 square degrees (seven times the area of the full Moon on the sky), and represents an exposure time of 1.2 million seconds! Since it shows X-rays coming from astronomical objects, it's false color: red is from lower energy X-rays, green is medium energy, and blue from the highest energy photons.\n\nThe diffuse glow is from two sources: the stellar winds from those massive stars slamming into surrounding ambient gas at high speed, and from the shock waves generated when supernovae explode. Both are extremely high-energy events, and produce copious amounts of X-rays. That long, horizontal arc is probably the edge of a bubble, a shell of gas piled up from the winds of stars and supernovae like snow piled up in front of a snowplow.\n\nThat's evidence right there that Carina has been cranking out supernovae over the past few million years. Interestingly, it's what's missing that provides more proof. Read More\n\nThis really is a fantastic demonstration of how microscale weather works. Imagine: a fire starts. As the air is heated above the fire, it rises, and the upward motion can be very strong. This leaves a lower pressure spot at the fire, and the air from outside the fire rushes in to fill the gap. The air is very turbulent, and as the inward-moving air from one side hits air coming in from the other, swirls can form. These get amplified by the constant gale of air, and rotation on a larger scale can get started and sustained. The whirlwind gets pumped by the hot air rising, and the next thing you know you've got a full-blown tornado of fire. Read More\n\nIt's a (Bruce) banner moment for NASA's new Fermi satellite: it's found a pulsar that emits only gamma rays.\n\nBrief background: when a massive star explode, its core collapses. If it has enough mass, the core shrinks down into a black hole. If it doesn't have quite that much oomph (if it has about 1 \u2013 2.8 times the mass of the Sun) it forms a weird object called a neutron star. As massive as a star but only a few kilometers across, a neutron star is incredibly dense, rapidly rotating, and has a magnetic field intense enough to give you an MRI from a million kilometers away.\n\nOK, I made that last one up, but in fact it sounds about right. The point: neutron stars are seriously awesome, right on the edge of matter as we understand it.\n\nThe supercharged magnetic field channels a tremendously powerful flow of energy away from the star in twin beams like a lighthouse. And, like a lighthouse, as the star rotates these beams sweep around. If they're aimed at Earth we see a pair of pulses every time the star spins around once. So, duh, we call these special neutron stars pulsars. You can see a way cool animation of this on NASA's Conceptual Image Lab web page.\n\nUsually, the beams from these pulsars contain light from all (or nearly all) across the electromagnetic spectrum. We seem them in radio waves, visible light, ultraviolet, even X-rays and some in gamma rays. The processes that create these beams are pretty fierce and weird, and the type of light emitted depends on the process. However, in general, if we see high energy light (like X- and gamma rays) from a pulsar, we tend to see it in lower energy light (optical and radio) as well.\n\nBut Fermi found an oddball! Located about 4600 light years away in the constellation of Cepheus, CTA-1 is a supernova remnant, the expanding debris from an exploding star. But that expanding junk is only from the outer layers of the detonated star: the core collapsed down into a neutron star, and that's what Fermi detected. This newly discovered gamma-ray-only pulsar spins three times per second \u2014 think on that; an object with the mass of an entire star spinning at that rate! \u2014 and is blasting out gamma radiation with 1000 times the Sun's entire energy output.\n\nAnd all of it in super-high energy invisible gamma rays. The Hulk has nothing on this pulsar.\n\nActually, let's pause for just a sec. Is it sunny outside? Good. Go outside, and hold your hand up. Feel the warmth? That's just a bit of optical light warming your hand. Now think about how much energy is falling over the entire Earth itself, a gazillion times the size of your hand. Now think about how much energy the Sun is emitting in all directions; the entire Earth only intercepts about one-two billionths of that light. Now think about one thousand times that much energy. Now think of all that energy being only in the form of DNA-shattering gamma rays.\n\nYeah, now you're getting it. This object is seriously freaky.\n\nWe know of about 1800 pulsars, and all of them emit radio waves. All but this guy. It's a brand new category of object (well, a sub category, but still), a new character on the cosmic stage. But why does it only emit gamma rays? Hey, good question. I don't know the answer (and the press release doesn't say, in fact). I suspect the answer right now is, we don't know. This object was only discovered a little while ago, and worse, gamma rays are really difficult to study. That's why we launched Fermi in the first place! Worse even than that, without being able to look at this object in radio, optical, or any other form of light really hobbles our ability to study it.\n\nFor now, I think we'll have to rely on Fermi's observations and then look at theoretical models. I imagine there will be astronomers all over the world pouncing on this, trying to figure out how the magnetic fields of the star can be so choosy (maybe they're elitist).\n\nBut until then, as usual, I have to wonder: if we only just now found this object, what the heck else is floating around out there just waiting for us to find?"}

{"text":"News\n\n6 March 2013. New results pin down the distance to the galaxy next door. - After nearly a decade of careful observations an international team of astronomers, among them Jesper Storm, scientist at ...\n\nAstronomers survey the scale of the Universe by first measuring the distances to close-by objects and then using them as standard candles [1] to pin down distances further and further out into the cosmos. But this chain is only as accurate as its weakest link. Up to now finding an accurate distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), one of the nearest galaxies to the Milky Way, has proved elusive. As stars in this galaxy are used to fix the distance scale for more remote galaxies, it is crucially important.\n\nBut careful observations of a rare class of double star have now allowed a team of astronomers to deduce a much more precise value for the LMC distance: 163 000 light-years.\n\n\"I am very excited because astronomers have been trying for a hundred years to accurately measure the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud, and it has proved to be extremely difficult,\" says Wolfgang Gieren (Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n, Chile) and one of the leaders of the team. \"Now we have solved this problem by demonstrably having a result accurate to 2%.\"\n\nThe improvement in the measurement of the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud also gives better distances for many Cepheid variable stars [2]. These bright pulsating stars are used as standard candles to measure distances out to more remote galaxies and to determine the expansion rate of the Universe \u2014 the Hubble Constant. This in turn is the basis for surveying the Universe out to the most distant galaxies that can be seen with current telescopes. So the more accurate distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud immediately reduces the inaccuracy in current measurements of cosmological distances.\n\n\"The present result reaches a new level of accuracy but we believe that the method has the potential to reach even higher (1%) accuracy. We have initiated further investigations in an attempt to reach this goal using also the AIP robotic telescope STELLA on Tenerife in Spain.\" points out Jesper Storm (AIP).\n\nThe astronomers worked out the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud by observing rare close pairs of stars, known as eclipsing binaries [3]. As these stars orbit each other they pass in front of each other. When this happens, as seen from Earth, the total brightness drops, both when one star passes in front of the other and, by a different amount, when it passes behind [4].\n\nBy tracking these changes in brightness very carefully, and also measuring the stars' orbital speeds, it is possible to work out how big the stars are, their masses and other information about their orbits. When this is combined with careful measurements of the total brightness and colours of the stars [5] remarkably accurate distances can be found.\n\nThis method has been used before, but with hot stars. However, certain assumptions have to be made in this case and such distances are not as accurate as is desirable. But now, for the first time, eight extremely rare eclipsing binaries where both stars are cooler red giant stars have been identified [6]. These stars have been studied very carefully and yield much more accurate distance values \u2014 accurate to about 2%.\n\nPhoto composition, La Silla Observatory, Chile. (Credit: AIP)\n\n\"ESO provided the perfect suite of telescopes and instruments for the observations needed for this project: HARPS for extremely accurate radial velocities of relatively faint stars, and SOFI for precise measurements of how bright the stars appeared in the infrared,\" adds Grzegorz Pietrzy\u0144ski (Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n, Chile and Warsaw University Observatory, Poland), lead author of the new paper in Nature.\n\n(This press release was based on a release by the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere - ESO).\n\nNotes\n\n[1] Standard candles are objects of known brightness. By observing how bright such an object appears astronomers can work out the distance \u2014 more distant objects appear fainter. Examples of such standard candles are Cepheid variables [2] and Type Ia supernovae. The big difficulty is calibrating the distance scale by finding relatively close examples of such objects where the distance can be determined by other means.\n\n[2] Cepheid variables are bright unstable stars that pulsate and vary in brightness. But there is a very clear relationship between how quickly they change and how bright they are. Cepheids that pulsate more quickly are fainter than those that pulsate more slowly. This period-luminosity relation allows them to be used as standard candles to measure the distances of nearby galaxies.\n\n[3] This work is part of the long-term Araucaria Project to improve measurements of the distances to nearby galaxies.\n\n[4] The exact light variations depend on the relative sizes of the stars, their temperatures and colours and the details of the orbit.\n\n[5] The colours are measured by comparing the brightness of the stars at different near-infrared wavelengths.\n\n[6] These stars were found by searching the 35 million LMC stars that were studied by the OGLE project. February 2013. Astronomers of the international CLUES collaboration have identified \"Cosmic Web Stripping\" as a new way of explaining the famous missing dwarf problem: the lack of observed dw...\n\nHigh-precision observations over the last two decades have indicated that our Universe consists of about 75% Dark Energy, 20% Dark Matter and 5% ordinary matter. Galaxies and matter in the universe clump in an intricate network of filaments and voids, known as the Cosmic Web. Computer experiments on massive supercomputers have shown that in such a Universe a huge number of small \"dwarf\" galaxies weighing just one thousandth of the Milky Way should have formed in our cosmic neighbourhood. Yet only a handful of these galaxies are observed orbiting around the Milky Way. The observed scarcity of dwarf galaxies is a major challenge to our understanding of galaxy formation.\n\nAn international team of researchers has studied this issue within the Constrained Local UniversE Simulations project (CLUES). The CLUES simulations use the observed positions and peculiar velocities of galaxies within Tens of Millions of light years of the Milky Way to accurately simulate the local environment of the Milky Way. \"The main goal of this project is to simulate the evolution of the Local Group - the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies and their low-mass neighbours - within their observed large scale environment\", said Stefan Gottl\u00f6ber of the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam.\n\nAnalysing the CLUES simulations, the astronomers have now found that some of the far-out dwarf galaxies in the Local Group move with such high velocities with respect to the Cosmic Web that most of their gas can be stripped and effectively removed. They call this mechanism \"Cosmic Web Stripping\", since it is the pancake and filamentary structure of the cosmos that is responsible for depleting the dwarfs' gas supply.\n\n\"These dwarfs move so fast that even the weakest membranes of the Cosmic Web can rip off their gas\", explained Alejandro Ben\u00edtez LLambay, PhD student at the Instituto de Astronom\u00eda Te\u00f3rica y Experimental of the Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba in Argentina, and first author of the publication of this study. Without a large gas reservoir out of which to form stars, these dwarf galaxies should be so small and dim that they would be hardly be visible today. The missing dwarfs may simply be too faint to see.\n\nThe study of Ben\u00edtez Llambay and colleagues is published in the February issue of Astrophysical Letters.\n\nImage (2): Cosmic Web Stripping removes gas from a very fast dwarf galaxy crossing the local web.

In their search for habitable worlds, astronomers have started to consider exomoons, or those likely orbiting planets outside the solar system. In a new study, a pair of researcher...\n\nThe research, conducted by Ren\u00e9 Heller of Germany's Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam and Rory Barnes of the University of Washington and the NASA Astrobiology Institute, will appear in the January issue of Astrobiology. About 850 extrasolar planets \u2014 planets outside the solar system \u2014 are known, and most of them are sterile gas giants, similar to Jupiter. Only a few have a solid surface and orbit their host stars in the habitable zone, the circumstellar belt at the right distance to potentially allow liquid surface water and a benign environment.\n\nHeller and Barnes tackled the theoretical question whether such planets could host habitable moons. No such exomoons have yet been discovered but there's no reason to assume they don't exist.\n\nThe climatic conditions expected on extrasolar moons will likely differ from those on extrasolar planets because moons are typically tidally locked to their planet. Thus, similar to the Earth's moon, one hemisphere permanently faces the planet. Beyond that moons have two sources of light \u2014 that from the star and the planet they orbit \u2014 and are subject to eclipses that could significantly alter their climates, reducing stellar illumination. \"An observer standing on the surface of such an exomoon would experience day and night in a totally different way than we do on Earth.\" explained Heller. \"For instance stellar eclipses could lead to sudden total darkness at noon.\"\n\nHeller and Barnes also identified tidal heating as a criterion for exomoon habitability. This additional energy source is triggered by a moon's distance to its host planet; the closer the moon, the stronger tidal heating. Moons that orbit their planet too closely will undergo strong tidal heating and thus a catastrophic runaway greenhouse effect that would boil away surface water and leave them forever uninhabitable.\n\nThey also devised a theoretical model to estimate the minimum distance a moon could be from its host planet and still allow habitability, which they call the \"habitable edge.\"This concept will allow future astronomers to evaluate the habitability of extrasolar moons. \"There is a habitable zone for exomoons, it's just a little different than the habitable zone for exoplanets,\" Barnes said.\n\nThe exquisite photometric precision of NASA's Kepler space telescope now makes the detection of a Mars- to Earth-sized extrasolar moon possible, indeed imminent. Launched in 2009, the telescope enabled scientists to reveal thousands of new extrasolar planet candidates. Since 2012 the first dedicated \"Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler\" is under way.\n\nHeller and Barnes' paper, \"Exomoon Habitability Constrained by Illumination and Tidal Heating,\" will be published in the January issue of the journal Astrobiology.\n\nThe key areas of research at the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics6 December 2012. For the first time, astronomers have detected the magnetic field of a starspot\n\nResearchers at the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP) have reported the first magnetic field strength determination of a dark starspot. They have shown that starspots are indeed the locations of very strong magnetic fields, between 50-100 times stronger than the magnetic field on the rest of the surface of a star. The new tomographic iMap software, developed at the AIP, was the key to this detection. The team of researchers, led by Thorsten Carroll and Klaus G. Strassmeier, have published their results this week, as a highlight, in the Astronomy & Astrophysics journal.\n\nBy polarizing the light of stars, magnetic fields influence their radiative emission patterns. They tune the direction of oscillation in electromagnetic waves, which also changes the spectrum in a characteristic manner. The geometry of the local magnetic field on the stellar surface thus allows conclusions from its fingerprint on the spectrum in polarized light. Since starspots are very dark, and about one to two thousand degrees cooler than their surroundings, observing them is a unique challenge, requiring highly resolved spectroscopy and special analysis techniques. As Klaus G. Strassmeier says, \"We receive hardly any light from the dark spots on the surface of a star. This distorts, or even suppresses, the reconstructed magnetic field distribution.\"\n\nTomographic methods, such as the ones used in medical applications, allow for a detailed survey of the surface of a rotating star. High-quality images and spectra are obtained from the combination of many instantaneous observations. Besides the AIP, there are few institutes world-wide which have developed or made use of such tomographic methods. Additionally, the new iMap software allows for simultaneous reconstruction of temperature and magnetic field distribution along the surface of a star. This simultaneous observation of temperature and magnetic field makes magnetic fields accessible even if only very little light is available \u2013 such as in the case of observing dark starspots. These computations are very expensive. As Thorsten Carroll tells us, \"In order to be able to computationally manage this complex process at all, we have trained an artificial neural network, increasing the speed of our simulations by a factor of a thousand.\"\n\nThe first magnetic field in a starspot measured by astronomers was found in the solar-type star V410 Tauri, using data from the spectropolarimeter ESPaDOns at the 3.6 meter Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope on the Mauna Kea. The next targets for analysis will be more solar-type stars within the Milky Way. The detection of magnetic fields is especially relevant for stars hosting a planetary system, as the magnetic field has a significant influence on the development of such a system, and the possibility of it supporting life. Expectations are high for the next generation of spectropolarimeters, which will significantly increase the accessible sample of stars. The new spectropolarimeter PEPSI, developed at Potsdam, will gather high-quality data from the world's largest optical telescope, the Large Binocular Telescope on 3,200 m high Mt. Graham in Arizona, from 2014 onwards November 2012. The Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area survey (CALIFA survey) announces today its first public release of data, offering an unprecedentedly detailed view of 100 galaxies in the ...\n\nTogether with the data release, two technical publications authored by members of the CALIFA collaboration have been made publicly available, describing the data and showing some of their scientific applications.\n\n\"I am tremendously happy to see a dream come true\" says Sebasti\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez, Principal Investigator of CALIFA. \"When we first thought of CALIFA, five years ago, the perspective of releasing such wonderful data seemed far off, yet it is happening right now! We hope and expect that the scientific community will make use of the opportunity.\"\n\nGalaxies are the end products of cosmic evolution along cosmological times, and their secret history is hidden in the properties of their different components. CALIFA is an on going project running at Calar Alto Observatory, focused on characterizing the galaxies in the local universe with unprecedented detail, trying to uncover these archaeological treasures.\n\nTo this end, CALIFA uses the technique called integral field spectroscopy (IFS) to obtain data of 600 galaxies in the local universe. Traditional observational studies in extragalactic astronomy used one of two classical techniques: either imaging, which gives detailed information about the spatial extent of galaxies, or spectroscopy, which gives detailed information about many properties of galaxies, but no or very little information on the spatial distribution of them. The recent technology of IFS allows taking a multitude of simultaneous spectra at many points on each galaxy, thanks to a clever combination of fibre optics and classical techniques. CALIFA is the first IFS study to be explicitly designed as a legacy project and, upon completion, it will be the largest survey of this kind ever accomplished.\n\nThe integral field spectrograph used for the CALIFA survey at Calar Alto Observatory, PMAS (in a special configuration called PPAK) was built at AIP. It uses more than 350 optical fibres to cover a field of view of one square arcminute (equivalent to the apparent width of a 1 euro coin placed at a distance of approximately 80 metres). This way, a complete extended object, such as a galaxy, can be fully mapped in detail in just one exposure.\n\nThe delivered data allow producing maps for the different properties of galaxies, such as velocity, stellar ages or chemical composition, to mention just a few. This information will yield new insights in several key issues linked to the structure and history of galaxies in the universe. It is expected to reach results, for instance, on which processes drove galaxy evolution in time, how the chemical elements needed for life are produced inside different galaxies or at different regions inside individual galaxies, the phenomena involved in galaxy collisions. This wealth of information allows to uncover the history not only of an entire galaxy, but also of its different components.\n\n\"The amount of science we can do is simply incredible\" says Jakob Walcher, from the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP) and Project Scientist of CALIFA. \"We can study local processes that drive galaxy evolution and that happen at different places in the galaxies, such as star formation, dynamical effects etc. But we also globally characterize the properties of galaxies in the local universe in a way that was not possible before. For example we map the 2D distribution of the stellar mass and chemical elements in the galaxies. Finally, our large sample will allow us to draw comparisons between different galaxy types.\"\n\nCalar Alto Observatory is jointly operated by the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA-MPG, Heidelberg, Germany) and the Astrophysical Institute of Andalusia (IAA-CSIC, Granada, Spain). The Observatory has guaranteed 250 observing nights (distributed along three years) for the CALIFA Survey with the 3.5 m Zeiss reflector, supporting the acquisition, reduction and data storage processes. To accomplish this enormous effort the concourse of a large collaboration of astronomers is required, its composition reflecting the dual Spanish\/German heritage of the Observatory. However, it also includes participants from all over the world, comprising a total of 80 people from 13 nations spread among 25 research institutes, from so far away as Australia and Canada or the USA.\n\nAIP in particular is strongly involved in CALIFA. The instrument (PMAS) was built in Potsdam. AIP also contributed strongly to the data reduction pipeline and the project lead. Scientists at AIP will exploit the data to study the kinematics of galaxies, the abundances of the chemical elements in galaxies and the importance of AGN"}

{"text":"Black Holes: Objects of Attraction\n\nEver since Princeton physicist John Wheeler coined the term nearly 50 years ago, black holes have evoked a sense of mystery and wonder for astronomers and space enthusiasts. But unlike comets, stars and other beautiful objects in the night sky, black holes can't actually be seen \u2013 they trap light, after all. From this infinitely dark void, myths and misconceptions have taken flight, spurred by the sci-fi depictions of black holes as cold cosmic villains with a bottomless appetite for nearby planets, stars and mighty spacecrafts whizzing through the galaxy at warp speed.\n\n\"Watching sci-fi movies is fun in part because as a scientist, I like to try to find out what's wrong with it.

Mirabel.\n\nEven though black holes don't behave like the celestial monsters with insatiable appetites they're sometimes caricatured to be, there is still plenty of wonder and unanswered questions about them to satisfy astronomers for years to come. For example, scientists have distinguished between two major classes of black holes \u2013 stellar black holes (also known as stellar-mass black holes) and supermassive black holes. The former are roughly six to 30 times the mass of the sun and the latter are a whopping million to billions of times the mass of the sun. So are there intermediate-mass black holes, on the order of hundreds to thousands of times the mass of the sun?\n\nQuite possibly, yes. In August, a team from Keio University in Japan announced their discovery of a region of space 30,000 light years away which they suspect might contain young, intermediate-mass black holes. One of these black hole candidates is nearby Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole which lurks at the center of our Milky Way galaxy.\n\nBut as I mentioned in my story on black holes, simply accumulating the observational evidence to infer the existence of a black hole is a daunting and time-consuming process. It took two separate teams of astronomers years to estimate the mass of Sagittarius A* (four million times the mass of the sun) from meticulous calculations of its gravitational effects on orbiting stars.\n\nNuSTAR, a NASA telescope about the size of a large fridge which launched in June, can much more nimbly and swiftly detect the presence of black holes by viewing, with its sophisticated optics, the glow of high-energy x-rays emitted from the vicinity of black holes currently hidden behind thickets of cosmic dust and gas. Caltech's Fiona Harrison, the Principal Investigator, explained how the NuSTAR telescope will beam its observational results to the the team of astronomers, physicists and engineers who've toiled diligently to ensure the success of this low-cost, high-impact mission.\n\n\"Four times a day, NuSTAR will send its data down to a ground station, in Malindi, Kenya\u2026and the data from these surveys comes down to scientists around the world. We take this data and we turn it into images; we look in these images for pinpoints of X-ray light. Each one will be a hallmark of a black hole. NuSTAR will see hundreds and hundreds of black holes,\" she said.\n\nHarrison and her colleague, William Craig, spent ten years working on NuSTAR, in part because the technology didn't exist at the time to focus high-energy x-rays \u2013 the kind used in dental and medical offices \u2013 emitted from cosmic sources billions of light years away.\n\nTo do this, Craig and his team took 4,000 pieces of glass twice the thickness of a human hair and stacked them in a nested array which greatly increased the surface area for reflecting the high-energy x-rays onto NuSTAR's digital detector 33 feet away from its lens. But to even get the pieces of glass to reflect the x-rays was a feat of ingenuity, requiring 17 months of research and the use of nanotechnology to coat the surface of the glass with hundreds of layers of nanoparticles.\n\n\"Looking for black holes has always been kind of like looking for a needle in a haystack,\" Craig said. \"But looking with these X-rays just like a medical X-ray can look through your skin and see the bone, it's like looking through the haystack to see the needle. It's like the haystack's not there,\" he added.\n\nIn late July, the NuSTAR team announced that the telescope had successfully taken its first images of the black hole Cygnus X-1 and had participated in joint observations with the Keck and the Chandra telescopes of Sagittarius A*. In addition, NuSTAR has also made observations of the \"optically brightest quasar in the sky\", located more than two billion light years away.\n\nMore observations and excitement are sure to follow on the heels of NuSTAR's observations, from quasars to stars orbiting powerful black holes and the cosmic ashes of supernova explosions which can seed the universe with these space oddities that have perplexed and intrigued the sharpest minds in astronomy.\n\n\"NuStar is gonna find all kinds of black holes in the centers of galaxies that might be otherwise hidden from our perspective by a bunch of other gas\u2026This is gonna revolutionize the study of black holes in our universe,\" said Alex Filippenko.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about black holes and test your knowledge about these space oddities, be sure to check out this neat interactive feature produced by former QUEST content intern C.K.

There ain't nothing like mathematical calculations postulating about Earth-sized planets to get my nipples leaking mudBlack holes. I already knew they were bad ass. Turns out, they're the coldest of motherfuckers. Not only do they gobble up stars, but whilst they do so the stars are all \"Jesus Christ, stop, stop!\" screaming with little dignity and no resignation.\n\nThe cosmos is goddamn impressive for a variety of reasons. One of my favorite examples is its tremendous capacity for destruction. Marauding stars, black holes, and now this: sandstorms that rise up out of a star and friggin' end it.\n\nAs scientists have used their super-technos to discover more and more planets, they've come to notice a pattern between the distance of these planets from their stars. At first most thought it was because of an unfavorable smell the stars exuded, but it may turn out to be something more clever. The stars themselves put up barriers. Cosmic bumper bowling.\n\nCheck out Kn 61. It's a planetary nebula that looks like those soap bubbles you can blow with those magical wands they sell at convenience stores and the like. Perhaps the Omnidimensional Creator had a son or daughter who was bored and it gave them the most enormous of soap bubble matter spewing wands. And thus Kronberger 61 was born. Or maybe it's the remnants of gas that was sent into space by a dying star. I think I like my explanation more.\n\nThe Triangulum Galaxy is the second-closet spiral galaxy to our own, and yet we can barely see the son of a gun. What's the reasoning behind that? Our boy (or gal!) the Triangulum Galaxy is small, only half the size of our own Milky Way. Due to that, its light is faint, and gets washed out in the night sky.\n\nScientists have observed a proto-star shooting water from its poles. This type of righteous action may continue on for thousands of years, and could account for most of the free-floating water in our good old Universe."}
{"text":"The statistical studies based on these new perceptions continued into the early 20th century. They culminated with the analysis by the Dutch astronomer Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn who, like William Herschel before him, used number counts of stars to study their distribution in space. It can be shown for stars with an arbitrary but fixed mixture of intrinsic brightnesses that\u2014in the absence of absorption of starlight\u2014the number N of stars with apparent brightness, energy flux f, larger than a specified level f0, is given by N = Af0-3\/2, where A is a constant, if the stars are distributed uniformly in Euclidean space (space satisfying the principles of Euclidean geometry). The number N would increase with decreasing limiting apparent brightness f0, because one is sampling, on average, larger volumes of space when one counts fainter sources. Kapteyn found that the number N increased less rapidly with decreasing f0 than the hypothetical value Af0-3\/2; this indicated to him that the solar system lay near the centre of a distribution of stars, which thinned in number with increasing distance from the centre. Moreover, Kapteyn determined that the rate of thinning was more rapid in certain directions than in others. This observation, in conjunction with other arguments that set the scale, led him in the first two decades of the 20th century to depict the Milky Way Galaxy (then confused with the entire universe) as a rather small, flattened stratum of stars and gaseous nebulae in which the number of stars decreased to 10 percent of their central value at a distance in the plane of about 8,500 light-years from the galactic"}
{"text":"Media Image Resources\n\nAll of the complexity of NGC 1068 and the power of integral field spectroscopy can be seen in this animation of the emission from the 5007 Angstrom line of ionized oxygen. Each frame shows the intensity of the emission at a given velocity (shown at upper right) as we scan outwards, and therefore through, the central region of this Seyfert galaxy. The redshift of NGC 1068 is1140 km\/sec so the velocities that are lower than this represent blueshifted gas that is moving towards us.\n\nAt the beginning of the movie, we see the light from the near side of the approaching NE (10-11 O'clock position) bowshock. This appears to move towards the nucleus as the inner part of the bowshock is moving less rapidly near the center. Then, as we pass through the disk, a hint of rotation from SW to NE can be seen, and then redshifted light appears in the NE where clumps of gas in the disk are being accelerated downwards by the expanding bowshock from the jet. Finally, light from the gas associated with the receding radio lobe appears SW (4-5 O'clock position) of the nucleus.\n\nThe emission from the nucleus has a wide range of velocities due to very turbulent motions near the jet and black hole.\n\nThis illustration shows an artist's rendition of the area around the core of NGC 1068 as seen from our point of view on the earth. The large bow-shocks at the end of the jets have been colored red and blue to show where light has been blue shifted (moving toward us), and red shifted (moving away from us).\n\nThis illustration shows an artist's rendition of the central region around NGC 1068 as seen from the edge of the disk that surrounds the core's black hole.

In the diagram, the light from the image of the galaxy is transported through optical fibers to a spectrograph (indicated by prism). A spectrum is produced by each fiber and captured on a large CCD detector. In reality, Gemini's IFU has as many 1500 individual optical fibers (rather than just the 9 shown in this illustration). This many fibers produce data sets of extremely high resolution and produce a huge amount of data for very efficient observations.\n\nThis illustration shows a simplification of the basic principle behind Integral Field Spectroscopy. Here, a 3x3 array of spectroscopic data has been represented from a hypothetical galaxy. From the spectra, individual velocities can be determined to study such things the rotation of the galaxy.

{"text":"Halloween is a time of scary things like witches, ghosts and monsters. So how about a really scary monster: a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB)? I'm speaking of what could happen if the binary star WR104 were to implode in a particular type of supernova.\n\nFirst, what is a Gamma Ray Burst and why should you care? Well, think of it this way, the amount of gamma ray (X ray) energy in a GRB is more energy than our sun will produce in its entire life. Gamma Ray bursts are big enough than when a star collapses and produces one, the GRB can be seen across most of the known universe. They are a special but fortunately rare type of supernova.\n\nHow GRBs would affect Earth is subject to some speculation. However, they are thought to produce both gamma rays and cosmic rays. Some believe the combination of the two would deplete the ozone layer by at least 30% with as much as 50% depletion in some areas. Additionally, atmospheric nitrogen could be turned into nitrogen dioxide producing smog.\n\nSounds bad, right? Breathing smog and getting skin cancer.\n\nIt could get even worse. The cosmic rays, which are really subatomic particles, could hit the air and cause the generation of other sub-atomic particles called muons. Muon behavior and impacts are even more speculative than the effects of gamma ray bursts. But that speculation does include the possibility of life extinction. At least you wouldn't have to worry about skin cancer or breathing smoggy air.\n\nCool, huh?\n\nGranted, GRBs are bad and they happen. Is there a special threat to Earth of one?\n\nYes, binary start WR104. Only discovered in 2000, this is a really interesting binary system. The larger sun is a Class O, being 1 million times brighter than the Sun (Class G). It appears it will follow a normal solar life cycle and have an ordinary supernova in its future. The other star is where the problem may lie. It is called a Wolf Rayet start. Currently, about 20 times larger than the Sun, it represents what is thought to be the collapse of a special type of Class O star. (Wolf Rayet's are rare: only about 300 have been identified in the Milky Way galaxy).\n\nHere's where it gets really spooky. The monster lives close by.\n\nThe accepted distance to WR104 is only about 8,000 light years (with some other estimates as low at 5,000 light-years). So, we have a late-stage star thought to be able to produce a Gamma Ray Burst in the neighborhood. What's to worry about?\n\nThe reality is that no one knows if the Wolf Rayet has exploded already, will explode next year during the 2012 festivities, or 10,000 years in the future. Beyond that, even when it collapses, there's no certainty it would actually produce a GRB, or if it did would it hit the Earth. And we'd be safe it it was an ordinary supernova \u2013 you have to be closer than 25 light years to be at risk.\n\nAll in all, WR104 is there and could be a risk to all of us on Earth. But so could the comet or asteroid approaching Earth from the southern Hemisphere where astronomical observatories and sky searches are much fewer.\n\nIt's just that at Halloween everyone needs a monster to be scared of \u2013 if even just a little."}

That's a fallacy of thought and a failure of imagination.\n\nI think there is a tendency to idolize Sagan, which is (as usual with idolization) unfair both to him and to others who would try to communicate science.

On average people sleeping in a blue room are getting seven hours and fifty two minutes sleep per night. The other favourable bedroom d\u00e9cor colours that aid Britons in achieving a good night's sleep are certain shades of yellow, green, silver and orange. As colour has a remarkable impact upon an individual's psychological and physical well being, Travelodge looked through the keyhole of 2,000 British homes to investigate the influence of the nation's bedroom colour scheme against the quality and quantity of sleep they are getting every night. Key findings from the study revealed that households who have a blue colour scheme in their bedroom are getting the best night's sleep across the country. This is probably due to the fact that the colour blue is associated with a feeling of calmness. The colour also helps to reduce blood pressure and heart rate which are essential in achieving a good quality night's sleep. The second most favourable colour scheme for inducing a good night's sleep is certain shades of yellow. Britons who sleep in a yellow d\u00e9cor bedroom are on average getting seven hours and forty minutes shut eye per night. The colour yellow stimulates the nervous\n\nsystem which aids relaxation. It also creates a warm and cosy atmosphere which is essential when nodding off. A green themed bedroom colour scheme is the nation's third most popular sleep inducing colour palette \u2013 with sleepers getting on average seven hours and thirty six minutes of kip. The colour green creates a restful, calming environment which helps relaxation which is essential in inducing sleep. A silver bedroom d\u00e9cor is the fourth most popular sleep inducing colour scheme \u2013 with individuals getting on average seven hours and thirty three minutes sleep per night. The metallic colour silver makes a bedroom feel luxurious and glow like moonlight \u2013 this tricks the eye into believing it is night time which induces sleep. The colour silver also creates a soothing and calming environment which encourages good sleep.An orange themed bedroom colour scheme is the nation's fifth most popular sleep inducing colour palette \u2013 with sleepers getting on average seven hours and twenty eight minutes snooze time. Shades of orange add warmth to the room and help create a stable and reassuring atmosphere and can even help digestion too \u2013 especially if you have eaten a large or late evening meal. The colour orange also helps to warm and relax body muscles, which is an essential element to attain a good quality night's sleep. In contrast, the study also revealed the least favoured bedroom colour schemes for obtaining a regular good quality night's sleep are purple, brown and grey. Britons who sleep in a purple bedroom are, on average, only getting five hours and fifty six minutes sleep per night. The reason for this could be that the colour purple is a mentally stimulating colour which makes it difficult to switch off after a busy day. The other two least favoured colour schemes are brown, where sleepers obtain on average six hours and five minutes sleep per night and a grey colour scheme which results in individuals getting on average six hours and twelve\n\nminutes sleep per night. The colour brown and grey in d\u00e9cor can be dreary and depressing especially in the bedroom and make occupants feel emotionally isolated and uncomfortable \u2013 resulting in a restless sleep. Chris Idzikowski, Sleep Expert from the Edinburgh Sleep Centre commented on the study and said: \"This is an amazing result, as there are specialised receptors called ganglion cells in the retina part of our eyes, which are most sensitive to the colour blue. These receptors feed information into an area deep in our brain that controls 24 hour rhythms, and affects how we perform and feel during the day. That interaction between light, sleep and wakefulness is supremely important.\" Colour Therapy & Holistic Interior Design consultant, Suzy Chiazzari, said: \"Your bedroom d\u00e9cor can certainly impact upon your quality and quantity of sleep per night. So it is worth considering taking a close look at the colours in your bedroom d\u00e9cor.\"It's not surprising that blue came out top in the study of the best colours to promote sleep, as the colour blue is very restful to the eye. Psychologically we relate blue to calm waters and the blue sky, both of which we find very soothing. Like blue, certain shades of yellow and green, are relaxing colours too, which are known to reduce stress which aid a good night's sleep too.\"At the opposite end of the scale, although many people think purple creates a sense of luxury in the bedroom, this colour can reduce the number of hours of sleep you attain. Purple has a strong connection with the more artistic community being a colour reported to stimulate creativity and the unconscious mind. Therefore sleeping in a purple room is more likely to promote vivid dreams or even nightmares; resulting in you feeling tired in the morning.\" The sleep study also delved deeper into how the spectrum of colours impacts upon our daily psychological and physical wellbeing and revealed the following results:\u2022 Contrary to popular belief,\n\ncouples who sleep in a bedroom that is decorated in a luxurious caramel d\u00e9cor make love on average three times per week. In contrast couples who sleep in a passionate red d\u00e9cor bedroom make love just once a week. \u2022 Fifty eight percent of Britons who have a blue bedroom reported they regularly wake up feeling happy. Whilst 22% of respondents who sleep in a bedroom decorated in a shade of green reported they regularly wake up feeling upbeat and positive. \u2022 Britons who have a grey themed bedroom are the ones spend the most time shopping online in bed. \u2022 A fifth (21%) of Britons who have a silver d\u00e9cor in their bedroom reported they are more motivated to exercise in their bedroom. \u2022 Britain's workaholics who like to work in bed will have either a brown, cream or white bedroom colour scheme and will take work to bed with them at least three times during the week. The sleep study also revealed the nation's top working professions bedroom colour schemes. Interestingly bankers and estate agents opt for a colour scheme associated with wealth which is a gold d\u00e9cor in their bedroom. Whilst, builders, teachers, civil servants opt for a sleep inducing blue colour scheme in their bedroom. Shop workers are more likely to have a boring brown themed bedroom.Frances Whitley, Travelodge In-house Interior Designer said: \"Room colour does influence your mood and set the tone for your living environment. Therefore it's important to choose a bedroom d\u00e9cor that will help you relax and induce sleep. \"I have spent the last 12 months working with our customers to create a purpose built room for them. In today's modern world, Britons want a high level of co-ordination between colours, shades, patterns and features. They are no longer happy with everything being the same colour. Tastes are also moving away from dark shades; today hotel users want a clean, fresh and calming colour scheme. Therefore in our new Travelodge room, we have injected different shades of the colour blue into our room d\u00e9cor. This creates a calm relaxing environment to help customers attain a good night's sleep whilst enabling them to feel totally energised upon waking up in the morning.\" News from: Travelodge, cheap hotels throughout the UK & Ireland. - \n\n]]> See Storm System that Created Moore, Okla., Tornado.

F-4 tornadoes have sustained winds from 166 to 200 mph. This tornado was about twice as wide as the tornado that struck Moore on May 3, 1999. Moore is located 10 miles south of Oklahoma City. Before, during and after the tornado, satellites provided imagery and data to forecasters. The first tornado warning was issued around 2:40 p.m. CDT (local time). By 3:01 p.m. CDT a tornado emergency was issued for Moore, and 35 minutes later at 3:36 p.m. CDT, the tornado spun down and dissipated. NASA's Aqua satellite captured a visible-light image that provided a detailed look at the supercell thunderstorm. NOAA's GOES-13 satellite provided continuously updated satellite imagery depicting the storm's movement. After the tornado, the\n\nNASA-NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite's lightning observations showed that the thunderstorm complex was still active after nightfall.NOAA's GOES-13 satellite provided forecasters with images of the storm system every 15 minutes. One GOES-13 satellite image was captured at 19:55 UTC (2:55 p.m. CDT) as the tornado began its deadly swath. The tornado was generated near the bottom of a line of clouds resembling an exclamation mark. The GOES-13 satellite imagery from the entire day was assembled into an animation by the NASA GOES Project at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. Four minutes after the tornado dissipated (19:40 UTC \/ 3:40 p.m. EDT), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite captured a visible image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the Moore tornado. That image was created by the NASA Goddard MODIS Rapid Response Team and Adam Voiland, NASA Earth Observatory. Later as the storm system continued through the region, another satellite captured an image of the storm at night that showed it was still powerful. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite aboard Suomi NPP observed lightning in a nighttime image on May 21 at 07:27 UTC (3:27 a.m. EDT). Lightning appeared as rectangular shapes in the image. The VIIRS imagery showed the city lights in the Oklahoma City area, but there was reduced light output in Moore as a result of tornado damage.The Suomi NPP satellite carries an instrument so sensitive to low light levels that it can detect lightning in the middle of the night. The Day\/Night band on Suomi NPP produces nighttime visible imagery using illumination from natural (the moon, forest fires) and man-made sources (city lights). The data were captured by the direct broadcast antenna at University of Wisconsin.

{"text":"M81 in all its glory\n\nM81 is one of the brightest galaxies that can be seen from the Earth. It is high in the northern sky in the circumpolar constellation Ursa Major, the Great Bear. At an apparent magnitude of 6.8 it is just at the limit of naked-eye visibility. The galaxy's angular size is about the same as that of the Full Moon.\n\nPhoto by NASA, ESA, and the Hubble Heritage Team\n\nMay 29, 2007 On Monday morning, at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Honolulu, astronomers released a new Hubble Space Telescope image of the galaxy M81 in Ursa Major. The image is by far the best-ever produced of this favorite galaxy among observers the world over, sometimes called \"Bode's Galaxy\" for Johann Bode, the German astronomer who discovered it in 1774. M81 is a bright Sb-type spiral, one of the brightest galaxies in the northern sky and, at a distance of 11.6 million light-years, one of the closest prominent spirals outside the Local Group of galaxies.\n\nThe image was made by a team of astronomers and presented at the meeting by Andreas Zezas of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"The amazing detail in this image took our breath away,\" says Zezas. \"We can see individual stars like tiny grains of sand.\" Zezas says the image, at high magnification, shows many background galaxies through the arms of M81 and around it in great detail for the first time.\n\nThe image is a composite of 90 pictures taken with Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys between 2004 and 2006. Zezas described the many stunning features in the image clearly shown in unprecedented detail, including the galaxy's HII regions, O and B associations of stars, open star clusters, globular star clusters, and even individual stars within the galaxy's arms. The picture contains about 2.5 days of total exposure time.\n\nM81's spiral arms, which wind all the way down into the nucleus, contain young, hot, blue stars that turned on in the last few million years. The image shows another population of stars that formed about 600 million years ago. Regions in the image that appear slightly greenish represent bright areas of star formation. Dust lanes are also visible winding their way along the galaxy's spiral arms. \"The presence of dust lanes shows that star formation is happening all the way down into the nucleus,\" says Zezas.\n\nZezas has several goals with his M81 research, he says. First, he aims to map star-forming activity within the galaxy. Second, he wants to understand where and when star clusters formed. Third, he wants to map and study black holes and neutron stars within the galaxy. M81 appears to be undergoing a surge of star formation due to a close encounter it underwent with nearby spiral galaxy NGC 3077 and the nearby dusty, explosive galaxy M82 some 300 million years ago. Astronomers will study the new image to map the star-formation history of M81 and to correlate observations of black holes and neutron stars made with the Chandra X-ray Observatory."}
{"text":"Discovery of 2 types of neutron stars points to 2 different classes of supernovae\nNeutron stars are the last stage in the evolution of many massive stars. They represent the most extreme form of matter: the mass of a single neutron star exceeds that of the entire sun, but squeezed into a ball whose diameter is smaller than that of London.\n\nIn a paper which will be published this week in Nature, Professors Christian Knigge and Malcolm Coe from the University of Southampton worked with Philipp Podsiadlowski of Oxford University to reveal how they have discovered two distinct populations of neutron stars that appear to have formed via two different supernova channels.\n\nThis is a supernova star-field.\n\n(Photo Credit: Hubble Heritage Team (AURA\/ STScI\/ NASA))\n\n\"Theoreticians have speculated before about the possible existence of different types of neutron stars, but there has never been any clear observational evidence that there is really more than one type,\" said Professor Coe.\n\nThe astronomers analysed data on a large sample of high-mass X-ray binaries, which are double star systems in which a fast-spinning neutron star orbits a massive young companion. The neutron star in these systems also periodically siphons off material from its partner. During such phases, the neutron star becomes an X-ray pulsar: its brightness increases tremendously, but the resulting X-ray radiation is pulsed on the neutron star spin period. Such systems are very useful, because by timing their pulses, astronomers can accurately measure the neutron star spin periods.\n\nThe astronomers detected two distinct groupings in a large set of spin periods measured in this way, with one group of neutron stars typically spinning once every 10 seconds, and the other once every 5 minutes. This finding has led them to conclude that the two distinct neutron star populations formed via two different supernova channels.\n\n\"These findings take us back to the most fundamental processes of stellar evolution and lead us to question how supernovae actually work,\" Professor Knigge added. \"This opens up numerous new research areas, both on the observational and theoretical fronts"}

The images, generated by the recently upgraded European VLBI Network (EVN) are particularly valuable because they penetrate the dust that often blocks the view of even the most powerful optical telescopes.\n\nThe pioneering observations were conducted by an international team of radio\nastronomers from Europe and the USA.

Jones\/ McDonald Obs\n\nRelated links:\n\nAstronomers Discover New Type of Pulsating White Dwarf Star News story originally written on May 1, 2008\n\nMost of the stars in the universe, including the Sun, will end their lives as white dwarf stars. Two astronomers from the University of Texas at Austin, Michael H. Montgomery and Kurtis A. Williams, have discovered a new type of white dwarf star, which is called a \"pulsating carbon white dwarf.\" This is the first new class of white dwarf star discovered in more than 25 years.\n\nA white dwarf star is what is leftover of a Sun-like star that has burned all of the fuel in its core. Until recently, scientists thought there were astronomers from the University of Arizona discovered a third type of white dwarf star. These \"hot carbon white dwarfs\" have had both their hydrogen and helium shells stripped off, leaving their carbon layer exposed. Astronomers think that these could be among the most massive white dwarfs of all, the leftovers of stars that are slightly too small to end their lives in a supernova explosion.\n\nAfter these new carbon white dwarfs were announced, Dr. Montgomery thought that pulsations in these stars were possible. Astronomers are interested in pulsating stars because the changes in the light put out can show what goes on in their interiors. This is similar to the way geologists study seismic waves from earthquakes to understand what goes on in Earth's interior. In fact, this type of star-study is called \"asteroseismology.\"\n\nSo, Dr. Montgomery and Dr. Williams' team began to study carbon white dwarfs with a telescope, looking for pulsators. One of their graduate students, Steve DeGennaro, discovered that a star about 800 light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major fits the bill.\n\nStudying these stars will shed light on the unknown process that strips away their surface layers of hydrogen and helium to lay bare their carbon interiors"}
{"text":"Galactic supercrash proves rarity of antimatter\n\nThe collision of entire clusters of galaxies has helped set the strongest limit yet on the amount of antimatter in the universe. The research suggests that if antimatter exists in large amounts, it may have been pushed to the far reaches of the universe in the moments after the big bang.\n\nIn the early universe, the theory goes, matter and antimatter - which has the same mass as matter, but the opposite charge - should have been created in equal amounts. But as far as we can tell, our universe is made of matter.\n\nIn our galaxy, for instance, no primordial anti-protons or anti-helium atoms have been found by satellite or balloon-based experiments. \"It's clear to a very high level of precision that our galaxy is made of [what] we by convention call 'ordinary matter',\" says Gary Steigman of Ohio State University in Columbus.\n\nRecently, astronomers have looked for signs of antimatter on an even larger scale - galaxy clusters, which each typically contain hundreds of galaxies.\n\nIf any fraction of a cluster's gas is a mixture of matter and antimatter, then the two types of matter should annihilate on contact, producing gamma rays along with the X-rays expected from collisions between matter particles.\n\nNow, Steigman has studied X-rays and gamma rays from two galaxy clusters that collided, producing the Bullet Cluster, which was discovered in 2006.\n\nMatter bubble\n\nThe fraction of mixed matter observed is less than a few parts per million. Steigman says this excludes any significant amount of antimatter on scales up to about 65 million light years.\n\nThe research has implications for the theory of inflation, a period in which space expanded exponentially moments after the big bang. Inflation could have separated neighbouring regions of matter and antimatter before they annihilated each other.\n\nFiguring out if there is any antimatter within the observable universe could tell cosmologists about how long inflation lasted.\n\nFor instance, some models of inflation suggest that antimatter that was once adjacent to matter would now be outside the observable universe. Other models show that it might be separated on the scale of superclusters of galaxies.\n\n\"That's why there is interest in whether we have entirely excluded antimatter [from the universe] or simply forced it to a very large scale,\" says Steigman.\n\nDiego Casadei, a particle physicist at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland, says Steigman has pushed the limits of antimatter's domain. \"He goes in the direction of saying that we live in a big 'bubble' of matter,\" Casadeiakes Sense\n\nConsider this, as matter and antimatter are created moments after the big bang, they would atract each other, and consequency destory each other, IF they interacted.\n\nIt is likely that they did not interact in some large scale otherwise the universe would be destoried the moment it began (this is quite likely to have happened in other universes, in fact it is probably one of the defining fates of a universe, if the creation of the universe is violant enough to seprate matter and antimatter.)\n\nIt is likely, given Newtons 3rd Law, that matter and antimatter would have been created and fired in opersite directions... If this happens randomly, as we would expect, there is a small chance that some particles would escape and head away from the centre of the universe where the matter was being created.\n\nBecause of this, in order to for a protion of matter or antimatter to survice this stage there would have to be a relatively large portion of matter or antimatter sent in a one direction that is unlikely to interact with the opposite form of matter.\n\nSo there will be clusters of matter and clusters of antimatter dotted across the universe. But since we have no understanding of scale, the question is, are we in a realtively large cluster or a relatively small cluster?\n\nAlso, does this mean that if we can create matter from nothing that we automatically create antimatter?\n\nMakes Sense\n\nWed Sep 03 10:26:51 BST 2008 by Paul\n\nMatter and anti-matter will not necessarily attract, as not all particles have charge. For example neutrons and anti-neutrons both have zero charge, so there would be no interaction between them. Similarly whole atoms of normal matter have no charge, and the same is true for anti-matter. Effectively, there is no more interaction between matter and anti-matter than between two clumps of normal matter.\n\nVirtual Particles\n\nWed Sep 03 10:10:44 BST 2008 by Griff\n\nMy rather limited knowledge is that on the smallest scale, \"virtual\" particles are continually being produced and destroyed. If a virtual particle (of normal matter) were created in amongst anti-matter, would this not gradually remove the anti-matter?\n\nI guess the argument against this is that if there were anti-matter virtual particles created in our galaxy then we'd also see mass disappearing into energy.\n\nThe Bigga Bang\n\nThu Sep 11 14:33:39 BST 2008 by Person 2\n\nI must agree with you, why can't scientist understand that the risk for creating a black hole is not worth taking when the hole planet is at stake. Some mysteries are made to never be discovered. I'm sure of that if everyone on this planet knew about this project and it's risks no one would agree to start up the LHC ( Large Hadron Collider).\n\nA cluster of yellowish galaxies on the left and a smaller one on the right passed through one another in a collision that produced the Bullet Cluster.

{"text":"A Radio Pulsar Spinning at 716 Hz\n\nWe have discovered a 716-Hz eclipsing binary radio pulsar in the globular cluster Terzan 5 using the Green Bank Telescope. It is the fastest-spinning neutron star ever found, breaking the 23-year-old record held by the 642-Hz pulsar B1937+21. The difficulty in detecting this pulsar, due to its very low flux density and high eclipse fraction (~40% of the orbit), suggests that even faster-spinning neutron stars exist. If the pulsar has a mass less than 2 M{odot}, then its radius is constrained by the spin rate to be <16 km. The short period of this pulsar also constrains models that suggest gravitational radiation, through an r-mode instability, limits the maximum spin frequency of neutron stars.\n\nA partially dead(I think, dont exactly remember where pulsars come from) star emits light\/energy from a side while spinning.

Such studies are crucial for understanding the evolution of the universe, both in the past and the future, and for probing the nature of dark energy, one of the biggest mysteries in science.\n\nThis composite image of the Abell 3376 galaxy cluster shows X-ray data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the ROSAT telescope in gold, an optical image from the Digitized Sky Survey in red, green and blue, and a radio image from the VLA in blue.

My understanding of omatumr's NR is that it causes neutron's to split (out of heavy nuclei such as iron) and become hydrogen atoms. omatumr suggests that this proposed reaction is the primary source of energy in the sun and could be the cause of the observed spacetime expansion.

This is impotrtant for viewing two galaxies mix. Three b. . .Read More at all. After the the ionised gas that filled the universe in its very early life cleared, there was a very long period of, well, nothing. The universe was transparent, but contained no stars or galaxies for just less than 400 million years. The process that allowed stars and galaxies to eventually form is known as reionisation, and new research published in Nature last month details a discovery that may open a new window on to this time.\n\nIn the paper, Lehnert and colleagues reported detecting the most distant object physicists have ever seen: a galaxy, the light from which was emitted less than 600 million years after the Big Bang. It's the first galaxy known to have lived fully within the epoch of reionisation.\n\nThe galaxy, which goes by the catchy name UDFy-38135539, has a redshift* of z = 8.6 \u2013 the highest ever observed \u2013 and it was from this that the team were able to calculate the galaxy's age. UDFy-38135539 was first spotted by Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3, but Lehnert and colleagues made ground based observations using an instrument called SINFONI on the Very Large Telescope in Chile to look at the galaxy in more detail.\n\nThe instrument helped by splitting up the light from the galaxy in a process known as spectroscopy, allowing the team to look for a feature called the Lyman-\u03b1 line. Each photon making up the Lyman-\u03b1 line would have been emitted when an electron in a hydrogen ion dropped down from a higher energy level to a lower one. The photons that Lehnert and colleagues observed were ultraviolet when they were emitted from the galaxy, but when they reached Earth had wavelengths in the infrared region, giving the high redshift mentioned above. This stretching of the wavelength occurs because of the length of time the photons took to travel here \u2013 they were created just 600 million years after the big bang. This may sound like a long time, but if you consider that the age of the Universe is 13.7 billion years, you'll appreciate that 600 million years is actually very early on in the grand scheme of things, and certainly very, very long ago. Physicists know that reionisation started within 600 million years of the Big Bang, so Lehnert and colleagues came to the conclusion that galaxy UDFy-38135539 must have lived within the epoch of reionisation.\n\nDiagram showing the universe from the Big Bang, to now. Image: Wikipedia\n\nAt the beginning, the Universe was very hot and dense, with conditions similar to that in a particle accelerator. After three minutes, the Universe had expanded and cooled enough to have formed all of the elementary particles, as well as protons and neutrons (also in these first three minutes was the matter-antimatter annihilation that destroyed most of the antimatter in the universe). For 400,000 years after this the universe was full of ionised gas, and was opaque. Then, in a period known as recombination, the electrons and protons in the gas got together and formed atoms; this made everything a lot clearer. For around 400 million years after that, the universe remained transparent and rather empty, with no stars or galaxies. It was only when astronomical objects, possibly quasars or small galaxies, began to form due to gravitational collapse that things began to get a bit more interesting.\n\nThese objects poured radiation out into the universe, causing reionisation. During reionisation, electrons were stripped back off the hydrogen atoms that were formed when they first joined up with the protons, and the universe began to turn into an ionised gas once again. Fortunately, due to the expansion that had taken place in the time between recombination and reionisation, the universe was able to remain transparent despite these bubbles of plasma) that had begun to form all over the place. This process led to the formation of the stars and galaxies we see today, but physicists are not yet sure exactly how this all happened.\n\nBecause the galaxy UDFy-38135539 lived within the epoch of reionisation, it may be able to help us explain how reionisation started, and how these objects that formed in the cosmological dark ages were able to transform the universe from a mostly neutral one, to one filled with ionised gas.\n\nThere are already a few other faraway candidates lined up for study too, and Lehnert and colleagues have shown that such study is possible with current instruments, but astronomers will have to wait for the new wave of telescopes to really study reionisation in detail. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which is the successor to Hubble, and the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which is the successor of the VLT, are two that will allow for this more detailed investigation. Both are due to be up and running later on this decade.\n\n* Cosmological redshift is a measure of how fast an object is moving away from the Earth and is a consequence of the expanding Universe. Objects with higher redshift are moving away from the Earth faster than those with lower redshifts, and are further away too. See an earlier post of mine for an image showing redshift in action.\n\nThis is good stuff. I think a lot of the time it's hard to understand how big the universe is until you look at research like this. We can only see the data from this galaxy that was given off when it was 600 million years old and the universe is 25x older than that! That data has come a LONG way.\n\nAwesome post Kelly. I love this stuff! Man, can you imagine if life developed in that galaxy, how old it would be.. and how much potential info they have.. Plus, if they do still exist it would mean that they didnt blow themselves up and have evolved beyond that behavior, which means they are potentially friendly.. Yea, ok, I am oddly optimistic today.\n\nI find it difficult to understand just how big \/ old the universe is too... writing stuff like this helps me get it straight in my head and puts things in a bit of context for me.\n\nIt's interesting to think about the possibility of life there, Evie, but then we're talking billions of years ago... if life managed to develop there, the star that was its \"sun\" must have surely finished the main sequence part of its life by now, which would be bad news for any life relying on it... meaning that they would have had to find some way to get out of their planetary system and find somewhere else to call home, or else adapt - which i'm not even sure is possible. i think i'm thinking about this a bit too much now..."}

Overall, the diagram represents current physical properties of various types of stars. The relationship can be used to predict stellar evolution. The evolution can be implied as to how the stars will evolve, or how they have evolved since the start of their \"hydrogen burning\" process known as the zero point. The initial physical characteristics of the stars is known as the ZAMS relationship.\n\nThe study includes star clusters with stars of various age, magnitude, color and additional factors. Each cluster represents stars that have been formed around the same time and usually are quite similar in many ways. The zero age of the cluster allows astronomers to understand not only how the stars have evolved but how the entire cluster has evolved over its lifetime.\n\nThe UBVRI representation of the ZAMS project has been well developed.

{"text":"Current Global Traffic\n\nGhost Galaxies Firmly Set In Hubble's Sites\n\nThey are extremely faint and tiny. Not only are they barely detectable, but thanks to Hubble they are thought to be the oldest and most pure formation in the Universe.\n\nThey have only come to light within the last ten years and even then they had to be detected through a computer search of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. What are they? They are \"ghost galaxies\" and scientists are puzzled as to why they harbor so few stars.\n\nThanks to the Hubble Space telescope, astronomers are now able to peer into the mystery of ghost galaxies. By examining a trio of these ethereal island universes, Hubble was able to uncover their star populations all seem to share a common birth date. They began star formation approximately 13 billion years ago and then unexpectedly stopped\u2026 all within the first billion years following the Big Bang. These antique galaxies are proof a transitional phase occurred in the early Universe which put a halt to strong star-formation in small galaxies. Just how do we know what switched them off? It may be a process called \"reionization\" \u2013 where stars consume their envelope of cold hydrogen.\n\n\"These galaxies are all ancient and they're all the same age, so you know something came down like a guillotine and turned off the star formation at the same time in these galaxies,\" said Tom Brown of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md., the study's leader. \"The most likely explanation is reionization.\"\n\nSloan Digital Sky Survey telescope (Photo credit: Wikipedia)\n\nSome time during the first billion years after the Big Bang, the Universe began the process of reionization and the very first stars scattered the electrons of these primeval hydrogen atoms. This caused the cool hydrogen gas to ionize and become transparent to ultraviolet light. Oddly enough, the radiation which caused universal reionization apparently also shut-down star formation in dwarf galaxies.\n\nThese dwarfs were young at the time \u2013 only about 100 million years \u2013 and had just began to form stars in earnest. The \"ghost galaxies\" are only about 2,000 light years wide\u2026 much smaller than their stellar producing peers which reside near the Milky Way. Being of small mass, they weren't able to shield themselves from the intense ultraviolet light and their small gas supply was stripped away, leaving their stellar wombs barren.\n\nThrough this new revelation, astronomers may be able to explain the \"missing satellite problem\" \u2013 where only a few dozen dwarf galaxies have been found around the Milky Way when computer simulations predict there should be thousands. It offers a plausible explanation \u2013 one where little or no star formation makes them almost impossible to detect.\n\nThe Sloan Survey has been responsible for bringing more than a dozen of these ghost galaxies to light\u2026 tiny galaxies which are at home in the Milky Way area and only account for about a quarter of the sky surveyed. Now researchers predict there may be dozens more waiting to be discovered. These ultra-faint dwarf galaxies are proof that there may be even more where no stars formed at all.\n\n\"By measuring the star formation histories of the observed dwarfs, Hubble has confirmed earlier theoretical predictions that star formation in the smallest clumps would be shut down by reionization,\" said Jason Tumlinson of the Space Telescope Science Institute, a member of the research team.\n\n\"These are the fossils of the earliest galaxies in the universe,\" adds Dr, Brown. \"They haven't changed in billions of years. These galaxies are unlike most nearby galaxies, which have long star-formation histories.\"\n\nJust what is inside a ghost galaxy? It would appear there are anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand stars about the same mass as the Sun or smaller. While these galaxies might be starved for stars, they are certainly glutted on dark matter. Ordinary dwarf galaxies contain 10 times more dark matter than the ordinary matter that makes up gas and stars. In ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, dark matter outweighs ordinary matter by at least a factor of 100. \"The small galaxies in our study are made up mostly of dark matter because their hydrogen gas was ionized and the stars got turned off,\" Brown explained.\n\nPast History Examined\n\nOn a curious note, these \"dark matter islands\" have been here all along \u2013 coexisting with the Milky Way, but unseen. Thanks to the Sloan Sky Survey, they came to light and astronomers began to be curious as to why they contained very few stars. There have been many theories, such as internal dynamics where a supernova event cleared the gas. Others contended the galaxies just depleted their gas content naturally. Even reionization was considered, where the formation of the galaxy coincided with the epoch during the early Universe. However, no perfect explanation is forthcoming. Ground-based observations reveal the stars are incredibly old.\n\n\"Astronomers have said before that certain galaxies should be ancient, and then someone studies them hard enough and finds younger stars,\" Brown said. \"Some of us expected to uncover younger stars and prove that the galaxies are not relics from the early universe. We were surprised to find that all the stars were ancient.\"\n\nThrough the use of spectroscopy, Brown was able to determine the stars' ages. For reference, Brown compared the galaxies' stars with the stars in the ancient globular cluster M92, located 26,000 light-years away. M92 is more than 13 billion years old\u2026 one of the oldest objects in the Universe. The analysis revealed that the galaxies' stars are as old as those in M92.\n\n\"The stars in the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies are very sparse,\" Brown said. \"This is one reason why no one went after them with Hubble. However, we thought they were good targets for Hubble, given Hubble's ability to measure precise ages. You look at the Hubble images and there are almost no stars, but the ones we have are enough to give us the ages of these galaxies.\""}

{"text":"Milky Way galaxy may have hidden twin\n\nA large galaxy could be lurking unseen in our own cosmic backyard, a pair of researchers says. Such a massive object could explain a mysterious gravitational pull on the Milky Way.\n\nAstronomers know both the direction and speed of the Milky Way's motion based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background - radiation that filled all space shortly after the big bang. The wavelength of this radiation appears slightly shorter in the direction of the Milky Way's motion because of the Doppler effect.\n\nThis motion is thought to be due to the gravitational pull from surrounding galaxies and clusters of galaxies. But when the influence of all known galaxies and galaxy clusters is added up, the Milky Way's actual motion is off by about 20\u00b0.\n\nNow, new calculations suggest that the discrepancy may be due to a large galaxy hidden right on our cosmic doorstep, or a hidden cluster of galaxies somewhat farther away in the same direction. The calculations were made by Avi Loeb and Ramesh Narayan of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US.\n\nMassive neighbour\n\nThey used data from the 2 Micron Redshift Survey (2MRS) to calculate how the Milky Way should be moving if it were affected only by the galaxies observed in that survey. Then they compared that to how our galaxy actually is moving based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background.\n\nThey found that our galaxy has an extra motion of 120 kilometres per second in roughly the direction of our galaxy's centre as seen from Earth.\n\nThey found that a galaxy slightly more massive than our own could account for the motion if it were located about 3 million light years away behind our galaxy's centre. This would make it our most massive neighbour, aside from the Andromeda galaxy, which has a similar mass and is about 2.5 million light years from Earth.\n\nDust veil\n\nSuch a large, nearby galaxy could have remained hidden until now because of the thick dust that obscures the sky in the direction of the galactic centre, the researchers say.\n\nAnother possibility is that the extra pull is due to a large cluster of thousands of galaxies lying about 70 million light years from Earth in the same direction and obscured for the same reason. Alternatively, a combination of individual galaxies and galaxy clusters in this direction could be responsible, Loeb says.\n\n\"We are ignorant about our immediate neighbourhood behind the Milky Way,\" he told New Scientist. \"If we wait 100 million years, the Sun will go to the other side of the galaxy and then we can see what's on the other side. But that's a long time to wait - we want to know before that.\" Radio surveys could penetrate the dust and reveal galaxies behind the galaxy's centre, he says.\n\nPirin Erdogdu of Nottingham University in the UK, who led a similar study published in 2006, says X-ray surveys would already have spotted a cluster of galaxies like the one Loeb and Narayan suggest, ruling out that option.\n\nDistant pull\n\nBut she says it would be possible for a large individual galaxy to hide behind the dust. \"There could be a nearby spiral or even a mid-sized elliptical galaxy, which are generally much bigger, within say 10\u00b0 of the galactic centre [that] we do not know about,\" she told New Scientist.\n\nBut she says it is very difficult to make a firm conclusion about any hidden galaxies from Loeb and Narayan's study, which only considered objects within 400 million light years of our galaxy. Mass concentrations beyond this distance are likely to have a significant influence on our galaxy's motion as well, she says.\n\nBrent Tully of the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, US, agrees. He thinks the extra motion Loeb and Narayan describe may be due to a supercluster of galaxies containing more than 10,000 times as much mass as the Milky Way called the Shapley concentration.\n\nIt lies about 700 million light years from Earth in a part of the sky about 40\u00b0 from our galaxy's centre. \"We are unlikely to be missing an important local attractor's Propagation Speed\n\nIs the effect of gravity instantaneous or do the gravity wawes (not observed yet) propagate at the speed of light?\n\nIn case i someday had trouble of getting sleep i'd have then something to think about: Where are and where were the galaxies that affect our velocity now? The galaxies have moved since the light escaped them. How about gravity? If the space is not completely void then the speed of light should differ from that of the gravity. Speed difference would mean difference in observed direction...\n\nGravity's Propagation Speed\n\nGravity's Propagation Speed\n\nFri Nov 30 17:25:05 GMT 2007 by Anonymous\n\nIndeed, relativity implies a gravitational change travels at c. So if our sun suddenly vanished we wouldn't know until about 8 minutes later when the last of the light would reach us. At that point the Earth's trajectory would continue likely on a tangent to its previous orbit around the sun. At least until a large gravatational field influenced it.\n\nGravity's Propagation Speed\n\nMon Dec 03 01:32:02 GMT 2007 by Luke Andrew Marsh\n\nAt a guess The gravitation works down to an infinite speed but the speed at which its coalleses in 3 dimensions would be relative to the speeds at which a double proton spin can turn to a single spin and not the speed at which such a spin can move along it's own warp axies on a 3 dimensional plane(i'e the speed of light). Hence would be slower from such perspective.\n\nThis research is of great interest to me.\n\nPerhaps the spin of this galaxy is relative to the speed at which gravity coalleses in 4 dimensions and perhaps the galaxy there looking for is a less matured proto galaxy the other side of this galaxies warp axie and perhaps the effect even exteneds to a build up of on the 4d Z\" line then when fully energised will rip all the remaining enegy in this galaxy away and yet spawn another Quazar build.\n\nHence one might be looking for to Gravitational effects subversive of one another in calculating such a thing accuratly.\n\nIf true then our galaxy took a lot longer to form in its initial stage before fully Quazaring and should rip apart a lot sooner than expected.\n\nThat certianly is more in line with how protons progress as they move around on the Z line.\n\nPlease excuse my wild imagination.\n\nAlso i might add that blue shift research might help assertain the answer to this question of why anything spin at all which is the real issue here isn't it and it's somthing we all should have a go at because its a question we need to solve and progress with.\n\nOh and if you don't like what i've got to say \"spin on it\"\n\nNo i don't believe in the big bang, God, Quantumality,difinitve constants which in my oppinion are of a fiticious universe. I think it's all just interdeminsional energy in a state trasgression that works down to coallessent energy signitures infinitly impossible to ever see in their most simplist form. I think many an ET has had fun trying weave out such problems for years that go on longer than we can even currently express.\n\nSo year just keep spinning up thoughts and foolishly hoping we'll work everything out one day and by the time you know it you'll be dead or have lived so long you'll want to be somthing diffrent for a change.\n\nThis research is rather a good one though because it should help us to get a better grip on how things work if we're clever enough understand what our galaxy has to show us.\n\nGravity's Propagation Speed\n\nCosmology\n\nSat Dec 01 01:04:56 GMT 2007 by Micromike\n\nThis is all nonsense. The cosmos is infinite and big bangs come from black holes that have grown too large to hold their energy. The speed of light is C^2, much faster than light as evidenced by intangled particles communicating faster than light speed. The motion of our galaxy was probably imparted when our galaxy was orbiting a large black hole that blew up and our galaxy was propelled through space at its current speed.

It centers on the simple principle of triangulation. Just as the motion of the Milky Way relative to the CBR can be calculated, so too can the motions of our nearest galactic neighbors, like Andromeda, be likewise calculated. Since we know the masses of those galaxies as well as our own, and their speeds, if there are similar deviations in those galaxies in different directions than the milky way, we simply calculate the position of the unseen mass in three dimensions by triangulating back to a central mass that is affecting all galaxies local to our region. Therefore the position and mass of the unseen galaxy is easily calculated by this type of triangulation. Q.e.d.\n\nA galaxy as massive as the Andromeda galaxy, seen here in ultraviolet and infrared light, could be lurking behind a veil of dust at the centre of the Milky Way.

{"text":"MAGIC discovers variable very high energy gamma-ray emission from a\nmicroquasar\n\nToday, in Science Magazine, the Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging\nCherenkov (MAGIC) Telescope reports the discovery of variable very high\nenergy (VHE) gamma-ray emission from a microquasar.\n\nMicroquasars are binary star systems consisting of a massive ordinary star\n-- much more massive than the Sun -- and a compact object that is either a\nneutron star or a black hole (Fig. 1). The stars are gravitationally bound\nto each other, orbiting around a common center, and when they are close\nenough, the effect of the mutual tides can cause a burst of mass transfer\nfrom the normal star that falls onto the compact companion. A part of the\ngravitational energy released by this exchange is transformed into\nmechanical work, producing jets of particles that are ejected at close to\nthe speed of light along with spectacular emission of radiation.\nMicroquasars appear to be scaled-down versions of active galactic nuclei, in\nparticular quasars. These galaxies also emit jets of relativistic particles,\nbut their central engine is a supermassive black hole having millions of\nsolar masses. For quasars the formation and ejection of the jets takes many\nyears while for microquasars these changes happen in intervals of days. It\nis thus possible, on ordinary human timescales, to study the individual\nepisodes. Microquasars are also implicated as a source of the highest energy\nparticles, cosmic rays, the origin of which has remained a mystery since\ntheir discovery almost a hundred years ago.\n\nThe study of microquasars represents one of the most important additions to\nthe recently born field of VHE gamma-ray astrophysics. VHE gamma-rays are\nthe most energetic radiation observed. The emission is produced in the most\nviolent phenomena of our Universe, such as supernova explosions and quasars.\nThey can reach the Earth, albeit at a very low rate (typically less than one\ngamma-ray per square meter per week). MAGIC detects gamma-rays through the\nshort light flashes that they produce as they enter the atmosphere. With a\n17 m diameter mirror, MAGIC is the largest telescope exploiting this\nexperimental technique. It is located at the Roque de los Muchachos\nobservatory site on the Canary Island of La Palma (Spain). The MAGIC team is\ncomposed by more than 130 scientists from Germany, Spain, Italy,\nSwitzerland, Poland, Armenia, Finland, Bulgaria and USA. A second MAGIC\ntelescope is under construction at a site around 80m from the first\ntelescope (Fig. 2).\n\nBetween October 2005 and March 2006, MAGIC observed one of the approximately\n20 known microquasars, called LS I +61 303, detecting the source at a rate\nof one gamma-ray per square meter per month. More important, the MAGIC\nobservations show that LS I +61 303 varies with time (see Fig. 3). The\nbinary system was observed at different moments around the orbit and clear\nvariability has been found that is consistent with the orbital changes in\naspect of the compact object with even a hint of periodicity. This shows\nthat the VHE emission is directly related to the interaction between the two\nstars. This new discovery indicates that gamma-ray production may be a\ncommon property of microquasars.\n\nFuture observations of LS I +61 303 with MAGIC, together with theoretical\ninterpretation of the present results, will further our understanding of the\nmechanisms for gamma-ray production and absorption in microquasars and in\nother objects displaying relativistic jets.\n\nFurther information can be found at:\n\n\nand\n\n\nIMAGE CAPTIONS:\n\n[Fig. 1:\n (14KB)]\nArtist view of a microquasar.

{"text":"Chandra Discovers 'Rivers of Gravity' That Define Cosmic Landscape\n\nNASA?s Chandra X-ray Observatory has discovered part of an intergalactic web of hot gas and dark matter that contains most of the material in the universe.\n\nThe hot gas, which appears to lie like a fog in channels carved by rivers of gravity, has been hidden from view since the time galaxies formed.\n\n[Note: Further images are found in the sidebar]\n\n?The Chandra observations, together with ultraviolet observations, are a major advance in our understanding of how the universe evolved over the last 10 billion years,? said Fabrizio Nicastro of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) in Cambridge, Mass. and head of one of the teams of scientists involved in the discovery.\n\nFour independent teams of scientists, whose results appear as separate papers in The Astrophysical Journal, used Chandra to detect intergalactic gas with temperatures ranging from 300,000 to 5 million degrees Celsius. This gas forms part of a gigantic system of hot gas and dark matter that defines the cosmic landscape. The gaseous component alone contains more material than all the stars in the universe\n\n?We had strong suspicions from the Big Bang theory and observations of the early universe that this gas exists in the present era, but like a stealth aircraft it had eluded our detection,? said Claude Canizares of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who along with Taotao Fang, led of one of the teams.\n\nThe hot gas detected by Chandra can be used to trace the presence of the more massive dark matter component. The discovery of the hot gas may eventually enable astronomers to map of the distribution of dark matter in the universe and perhaps understand its origin.\n\nUltraviolet telescopes had detected cooler components of the hot gas system, but because of its high temperatures most of it is detectable only with an extremely sensitive X-ray telescope. The various groups used two techniques to probe the intergalactic gas. One method uses the absorbing effects of the gas on X-rays from distant galaxies.\n\nOn their way to Earth, the X-rays from a distant quasar dim as they pass through a cloud of the intergalactic gas. By measuring the amount of dimming due to oxygen and other elements in the cloud, astronomers were able to estimate the temperature, density and mass of the absorbing gas.\n\nObservations of the quasars PKS 2155-304 by the MIT and Harvard-Smithsonian groups, and H1821+643 by an Ohio State group, revealed various parts of the hot gas system. One of these appears to be a filament in which the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are embedded, whereas other detected portions are at distances of a few billion light years from Earth.\n\nThese results confirm earlier work by Joel Bregman and Jimmy Irvin of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who flipped the normal procedure, and used the fact that the hot gas is itself a source of X-rays. By observing the absorption of X-rays from the hot gas by a foreground galaxy, they were able to deduce presence of hot gas behind the galaxy.\n\n?Normally the doctor studies the X-ray shadow produced by your bones to learn about your bones,? said Bregman. ?In essence, we used the shadow to learn about the X-ray machine.?\n\nDuring the first few billion years of the universe, about 20 percent of the matter came together under the influence of gravity to form groups and clusters of galaxies. Theories predict that most of the remaining normal matter and dark matter formed an immense filamentary web connecting the groups and clusters of galaxies, predicted to be so hot that it would be invisible to optical, infrared, and radio telescopes.\n\n?Computer simulations have been telling us for several years that most of the ?missing? gas in the universe should be in hot filaments,? said Smita Mathur, leader of the Ohio State team. ?Most of those filaments are too faint to see, but it looks like we are finally finding their shadows.?"}
{"text":"NGC 457: ET Cluster\nJessy Buiten\n\nThe ET cluster is an open star cluster in which the stars are spread out. It has several other names such as the \"Owl Cluster\" or the more technical \"NGC 457.\" The cluster is located in the constellation Cassiopeia and has over a hundred stars. Open star clusters are located in the disk of the galaxy. This differs from globular clusters which have hundreds of stars clumped together and are located in the halo. All of these stars from the ET Cluster were created around the same time from the same particles. Therefore, these stars are relatively the same age. All of the stars within the cluster are young. We can tell that the stars are younger because they are blue. Also, we know they are younger because the stars are still so close together. Open clusters do not have enough gravity (unlike the densely packed globular clusters) and are therefore unable to hold all of its stars together for long periods of time. The stars in the ET cluster are relatively near to each other which indicates how young the cluster is. According to the SEDS web site, NGC 457 is \"rich; one of the best Cas (Cassiopeia) clusters.\"\n\nThis picture focuses on the cluster as well as the area above it. In the lower left corner are the stars which give NGC 475 the nicknames \"ET Cluster\" and \"Owl Cluster.\"The two brightest stars look like the eyes of ET or the eyes of owls. The picture also shows how open the cluster is. The stars are relatively spread out. Many of them appear to be the same color except for the one in the middle left which appears to be red. This indicates that the star is cooler than the others. From my calculations and estimations of the picture, NGC 457 is 40 by 60 light years in size."}

{"text":"\"\n\nThis is why astronomers need to use instruments that are able to see at other wavelengths of light. At submillimetre wavelengths, rather than blocking light, the dust grains shine due to their temperatures of a few tens of degrees above absolute zero.

But one of these dark clouds is not what it seems.\n\nLocated in the constellation of Orion (The Hunter), 1500 light-years away from Earth, the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex is the closest region of massive star formation to Earth, and contains a treasury of bright nebulae, dark clouds and young stars.

{"text":"Messages from the Abyss\n\nMany neutron stars are surrounded by accretion disks. The disks are often made up of matter pulled in by the neutron star's gravity from a companion star in a binary system. Over time, the neutron stars can swallow so much additional material that they collapse into black holes.\n\nRecently, research associate Bruno Giacomazzo and Fellow Rosalba Perna studied this collapse process in detail. They modeled how an accretion disk affects a neutron star's collapse into a black hole. Their model included an analysis of the kinds of signals that would be emitted by neutron stars with and without accretion disks as they collapsed into black holes.\n\nThe researchers were a little disappointed to discover that the gravitational wave signal would likely be similar for an accretion-induced collapse and the collapse of a \"naked\" neutron star. However, they were excited to find that the two kinds of collapses would send very different electromagnetic signals such as short bursts of gamma rays.\n\nThe variations in electromagnetic signals stem from differences in what happens immediately following the collapse into a black hole. When a neutron star with an accretion disk collapses, it leaves behind some of its accretion disk. The newly formed black hole voraciously swallows the surviving disk, which can launch relativistic jets and emit short bursts of gamma rays in the process of growing rapidly. Thus, accretion-induced collapse of neutron stars could be responsible for some of the short gamma-ray bursts observed in our Universe. In contrast, when a \"naked\" neutron star collapses into a black hole, almost no ordinary matter is left anywhere near the new black hole. Thus, nothing happens in this kind of collapse to generate bursts of gamma rays (or any other electromagnetic signals).\n\nBy identifying and interpreting gamma-ray \"messages from the abyss,\" researchers now have a way to locate accretion-induced collapses of neutron stars \u2014 even when they occur far outside our own Galaxy."}

(c) ESO\n\nThe star R Coronae Australis lies in one of the nearest and most spectacular star-forming regions. This portrait was taken by the Wide Field Imager (WFI) on the MPG\/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. The image is a combination of twelve separate pictures taken through red, green and blue filters.\n\nThis image shows a section of sky that spans roughly the width of the full Moon. This is equivalent to about four light-years at the distance of the nebula, which is located some 420 light-years away in the small constellation of Corona Australis (the Southern Crown). The complex is named after the star R Coronae Australis, which lies at the centre of the image. It is one of several stars in this region that belong to the class of very young stars that vary in brightness and are still surrounded by the clouds of gas and dust from which they formed.\n\nThe intense radiation given off by these hot young stars interacts with the gas surrounding them and is either reflected or re-emitted at a different wavelength. These complex processes, determined by the physics of the interstellar medium and the properties of the stars, are responsible for the magnificent colours of nebulae. The light blue nebulosity seen in this picture is mostly due to the reflection of starlight off small dust particles. The young stars in the R Coronae Australis complex are similar in mass to the Sun and do not emit enough ultraviolet light to ionise a substantial fraction of the surrounding hydrogen. This means that the cloud does not glow with the characteristic red colour seen in many star-forming regions.\n\nThe huge dust cloud in which the reflection nebula is embedded is here shown in impressively fine detail. The subtle colours and varied textures of the dust clouds make this image resemble an impressionist painting. A prominent dark lane crosses the image from the centre to the bottom left. Here the visible light emitted by the stars that are forming inside the cloud is completely absorbed by the dust. These objects could only be detected by observing at longer wavelengths, by using a camera that can detect infrared radiation.\n\nR Coronae Australis itself is not visible to the unaided eye, but the tiny, tiara-shaped constellation in which it lies is easily spotted from dark sites due to its proximity on the sky to the larger constellation of Sagittarius and the rich star clouds towards the centre of our own galaxy, the Milky Way"}

With its super-sharp images we were able to zoom right into the centre of the galaxy and observe the gas whizzing around the black hole.

{"text":"Posts Tagged 'cosmology'\n\nThe following news release from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III (SDSS-III) collaboration was first posted on Brookhaven's website.\n\nScientists from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) have created the largest ever three-dimensional map of the distant universe by using the light of the brightest objects in the cosmos to illuminate ghostly clouds of intergalactic hydrogen. The map provides an unprecedented view of what the universe looked like 11 billion years ago.\n\nA slice through the three-dimensional map of the universe. SDSS-III scientists are looking out from the Milky Way, at the bottom tip of the wedge. Distances are labeled on the right in billions of light-years. The black dots going out to about 7 billion light years are nearby galaxies. The red cross-hatched region could not be observed with the SDSS telescope, but the future BigBOSS survey, the proposed successor to BOSS, could observe it. The colored region shows the map of intergalactic hydrogen gas in the distant universe. Red areas have more gas; blue areas have less gas.\n\nThe new findings were presented on May 1 at a meeting of the American Physical Society by An\u017ee Slosar, a physicist at the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory, and described in an article posted online on the arXiv astrophysics preprint server.\n\nThe new technique used by Slosar and his colleagues turns the standard approach of astronomy on its head. \"Usually we make our maps of the universe by looking at galaxies, which emit light,\" Slosar explained. \"But here, we are looking at intergalactic hydrogen gas, which blocks light. It's like looking at the moon through clouds \u2014 you can see the shapes of the clouds by the moonlight that they block.\"\n\nInstead of the moon, the SDSS team observed quasars, brilliantly luminous beacons powered by giant black holes. Quasars are bright enough to be seen billions of light years from Earth, but at these distances they look like tiny, faint points of light. As light from a quasar travels on its long journey to Earth, it passes through clouds of intergalactic hydrogen gas that absorb light at specific wavelengths, which depend on the distances to the clouds. This patchy absorption imprints an irregular pattern on the quasar light known as the \"Lyman-alpha forest.\"\n\nAn observation of a single quasar gives a map of the hydrogen in the direction of the quasar, Slosar explained. The key to making a full, three-dimensional map is numbers. \"When we use moonlight to look at clouds in the atmosphere, we only have one moon. But if we had 14,000 moons all over the sky, we could look at the light blocked by clouds in front of all of them, much like what we can see during the day. You don't just get many small pictures \u2014 you get the big picture.\"\n\nThe big picture shown in Slosar's map contains important clues to the history of the universe. The map shows a time 11 billion years ago, when the first galaxies were just starting to come together under the force of gravity to form the first large clusters. As the galaxies moved, the intergalacitc hydrogen moved with them. Andreu Font-Ribera, a graduate student at the Institute of Space Sciences in Barcelona, created computer models of how the gas likely moved as those clusters formed. The results of his computer models matched well with the map. \"That tells us that we really do understand what we're measuring,\" Font-Ribera said. \"With that information, we can compare the universe then to the universe now, and learn how things have changed.\"\n\nA zoomed-in view of the map slice shown in the previous image. Red areas have more gas; blue areas have less gas. The black scalebar in the bottom right measures one billion light years. Image credit: A. Slosar and the SDSS-III collaboration.\n\nThe quasar observations come from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), the largest of the four surveys that make up SDSS-III. Eric Aubourg, from the University of Paris, led a team of French astronomers who visually inspected every one of the 14,000 quasars individually. \"The final analysis is done by computers,\" Aubourg said, \"but when it comes to spotting problems and finding surprises, there are still things a human can do that a computer can't.\"\n\n\"BOSS is the first time anyone has used the Lyman-alpha forest to measure the three-dimensional structure of the universe,\" said David Schlegel, a physicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California and the principal investigator of BOSS. \"With any new technique, people are nervous about whether you can really pull it off, but now we've shown that we can.\" In addition to BOSS, Schlegel noted, the new mapping technique can be applied to future, still more ambitious surveys, like its proposed successor BigBOSS.\n\nWhen BOSS observations are completed in 2014, astronomers can make a map ten times larger than the one being released today, according to Patrick McDonald of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Brookhaven National Laboratory, who pioneered techniques for measuring the universe with the Lyman-alpha forest and helped design the BOSS quasar survey. BOSS's ultimate goal is to use subtle features in maps like Slosar's to study how the expansion of the universe has changed during its history. \"By the time BOSS ends, we will be able to measure how fast the universe was expanding 11 billion years ago with an accuracy of a couple of percent. Considering that no one has ever measured the cosmic expansion rate so far back in time, that's a pretty astonishing prospect.\"\n\nQuasar expert Patrick Petitjean of the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris, a key member of Aubourg's quasar-inspecting team, is looking forward to the continuing flood of BOSS data. \"Fourteen thousand quasars down, one hundred and forty thousand to go,\" he said. \"If BOSS finds them, we'll be happy to look at them all, one by one. With that much data, we're bound to find things that we never expected.\"\n\nOne of the commenters on our very first post wanted to hear more about the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), one of the three cosmological projects that involve Brookhaven Lab. Set high on a mountaintop in Chile, LSST will be a very big and expensive ground-based telescope. Planning for the project started near the end of the 20th century and the experiment probably won't start taking data in a scientific manner until 2020.\n\nThe story is that at a decadal survey 10 years ago, the person who first proposed that the word \"synoptic\" be used in the project's name had a misunderstanding about what synoptic really means. Either way, the name has stuck. Synoptic, by the way, comes from Greek word \"synopsis\" and refers to looking at something from all possible aspects, which is precisely what LSST will do.\n\nAstronomical survey instruments fall broadly under two categories: imaging instruments that take photos of the sky, and spectroscopic instruments that take spectra (that is, distribution of light across wavelengths) of a selected few objects in the sky. LSST falls into the first category \u2014 it will take many, many images of the sky in the five bands, which are a bit like colors, from ultra-violet light to infrared light.\n\nTop left image shows SDSS-III's view of a small part of the sky, centered on the galaxy Messier 33.

It provides a stunning image and research fodder for scientists and science enthusiasts, thanks to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which has a long connection to Fermilab.\n\nOh, yeah, and the image is free.\n\nThe image, which would require 500,000 high-definition TVs to view in its full resolution, is comprised of data collected since the start of the survey in 1998.\n\n\"This image provides opportunities for many new scientific discoveries in the years to come,\" said Bob Nichol, SDSS-III scientific spokesperson and professor at University of Portsmouth.\n\nFermilab oversaw all image processing and distribution of data to researchers and the public from 1998 through 2008, for the first seven batches of data. These batches make up a large chunk of the ground-breaking more than a trillion-pixel image. The eighth batch of raw, reduced data, which was released along with the image at the 17th annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Seattle was processed by Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory. LBNL, New York University and Johns Hopkins University distributed that data. Fermilab's SDSS collaboration members now focus solely on analysis.\n\n\"This is one of the biggest bounties in the history of science,\" said Mike Blanton, professor from New York University and leader of the data archive work in SDSS-III, the third phase of SDSS. \"This data will be a legacy for the ages, as previous ambitious sky surveys like the Palomar Sky Survey of the 1950s are still being used today. We expect the SDSS data to have that sort of shelf life.\"\n\nThe release expands the sky coverage of SDSS to include a sizable view of the south galactic pole. Previously, SDSS only imaged small, spread out slivers of the southern sky. Increasing coverage of the southern sky will aid the Dark Energy Survey and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope both southern sky surveys that Fermilab participates in.\n\nComparing the two portions of the sky also will help astrophysicists pinpoint any asymmetries in the type or number of large structures, such as galaxies. Cosmic-scale solutions to Albert Einstein's equations of general\nrelativity assume that the universe is spherically symmetric, meaning that on a large enough scale, the universe would look the same in every direction.\n\nFinding asymmetry would mean the current understanding of the universe is wrong and turn the study of cosmology on its head, much as the discovery of particles not included in the Standard Model would do for collider physics.\n\n\"We would have to rethink our understanding of cosmology,\" said Brian Yanny, Fermilab's lead scientists on SDSS-III. So far the universe seems symmetric.\n\nWhether the SDSS data reveals asymmetry or not it undoubtedly will continue to provide valuable insight into our universe and fascinate amateur astronomers and researchers.\n\nEvery year since the start of the survey, at least one paper about the SDSS has made it in the list of the top 10 astronomy papers of the year. More than 200,000 people have classified galaxies from their home computers using SDSS data and projects including Galaxy Zoo and Galaxy Zoo 2.\n\nIn the three months leading up to the image's release a record number of queries, akin to click counts on a Web page, occurred on the seventh batch of data. During that time, 90 terabytes of pictures and sky catalogues were down loaded by scientists and the public. That equates to about 150,000 one-hour long CDs.\n\nScientists will continue to use the old data and produce papers from it for years to come. Early data also works as a check on the new data to make sure camera or processing flaws didn't produce data anomalies.\n\n\"We still see, for instance, data release six gets considerable hits and papers still come out on that in 100s per year,\" Yanny said.\n\nSo far, SDSS data has been used to discover nearly half a billion astronomical objects, including asteroids, stars, galaxies and distant quasars. This new eighth batch of data promises even more discoveries.\n\nFermilab passed the job of data processing and distribution on to others in 2008. The eight batch of data was processed by Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory and distributed by LBNL, New York University and Johns Hopkins University.\n\nFermilab's four remaining SDSS collaboration members now focuses solely\n\nillustration of the concept of baryon acoustic oscillations, which are imprinted in the early universe and can still be seen today in galaxy surveys like BOSS.

The group touches on all of SDSS-III's four sky surveys but focus mainly on the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, or BOSS, which will map the 3-D distribution of 1.5 million luminous red galaxies.\n\n\"BOSS is closest to our scientists' interests because its science goals are to understand dark energy and dark matter and the evolution of the universe,\" Yanny said.\n\nFor more information see the following:\n\n* Larger images of the SDSS maps in the northern and southern galactic hemispheres are available here and here.\n\nWelcome to Quantum Diaries. I'm An\u017ee Slosar, a scientist living in New York and working at Brookhaven National Laboratory. I'll also be occasionally blogging on this site. Let me tell you a little about myself.\n\nI am originally from Slovenia, a small country with population of 2 million, which was created in 1991 after the disintegration of Yugoslavia. I studied physics as an undergrad at the University of Cambridge, UK, and, in a typical Oxbridge fashion, continued my graduate studies at Cambridge. My Ph.D. thesis was on the Very Small Array, an interferometric radio telescope designed to measure fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background. After receiving my Ph.D., I spent six years doing postdocs at the University of Ljubljana (in the capital of Slovenia), Oxford University, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory before moving to Brookhaven Lab.\n\nHere, I work on a mixed salad of projects, both theoretical and experimental, but inevitably connected to the universe we live in. These days, my scientific focus is on the Lyman-alpha forest, part of a dark energy project called BOSS (Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey), a topic that takes more than a healthy amount of my time and nerves but holds promise of being truly revolutionary. I will no doubt write more about it in the coming posts.\n\nIn my spare time, I do a lot of things at a very low level: real ales, real food, yoga, classical guitar. And then I do things New Yorkers do, namely following the real estate and thinking about cunning ways of getting rich while burning cash on restaurants, theaters, clubs, galleries, and a myriad other places."}

They are laboratories for extreme galaxy evolution, as many of the processes that can change the structure of galaxies are accelerated in such a crowded environment. Clusters of galaxies also provide important constraints for cosmology: from both the way they are grouped into superclusters that trace the 'large scale structure' of Universe; and the fact that their internal properties lead to powerful confirmation for the need for dark energy.\n\nFor download and transcript versions of this lecture, please visit the event's page on the Gresham College website: Clusters of Galaxies."}
{"text":"The movements of galaxies within the clusters showed similar problems than with the rotation of stars in galaxies. This suggests the presence of dark matter between the galaxies; although nothing proves yet that these two problems are related. On a galaxy scale, the dark matter rate would be up to 10 times that of the luminous matter, but on the clusters' level, it would be much more important: up to 30 times the \"visible\" mass of these clusters.\n\nIn 1996, astrophysicist Yannick Mellier and his team decided to measure the quantity of dark matter in all the Universe and to draw up a chart of its distribution between the galaxy clusters. The method used was to make a large scale statistical study of the galaxy deformation due to gravitational interaction of dark matter existing between the Earth and these clusters. This gravitational intercation is visible as it deviates the luminous rays sent by the galaxies (their image arrives deformed). A statistical study on a very large scale (the area of the sky studied was the apparent size of the moon and on a depth of 5 billion light-years) made it possible to neglect the local deformations due to other galaxy clusters.\n\nThis study led in March 2000 to the a cartography. The dark matter takes the shape of long intersecting filaments. The quantity of matter of the universe should represent one third of that needed to reach the critical density, the remainder made up of dark energy.\n\nA new similar study is in hand, always by the team of Yannick Mellier, with this time a larger CCD camera, allowing the study of 20 times the previous field of view."}
{"text":"The Flare Star Project\n\npresented by\n\nWhat are flare stars?\n\nThe phenomenon of flare stars was discovered first by\nHertzsprung in 1924. He found that a faint star increased its\nintensity by about 2 magnitudes. In 1949 transient outbursts were\nfound on UV Cet, YZ CMi and WX UMa. UV Cet is some kind\nof prototype for all flare stars in the solar neighbourhood. Flare\nstars are stars which produce rapid optical bursts. Because all these\nstars have a relatively low luminosity, only stars in the solar\nneighbourhood can be observed. All known flare stars have spectral\nclass M and are dwarf stars. Most of them have emission-line spectra\nwith a presence of strong hydrogen emission lines in the optical\nwavelength range.\n\nIf UV Cet is compared with the Sun, its diameter is 1\/6th, its\nmass is 1\/8th, the effective temperature is 3000 K (sun 5800 K). The\ncoronae of the dwarf stars are hotter and denser. Due to the high\ntemperatures of the corona, the gas cannot be gravitationally bound to\nthe star. To a lesser degree this is true for the sun, too. In case of\nthe sun the magnetic field is assumed to confine the gas.\n\nStellar flares are qualitativly similar to solar flares, but differ\nlargely in its magnitude. Intensity changes can be observed throughout all\nwavelength, but with different amplitudes and time responses.\n\nFrom there you can get more information about flare stars and its\nobservation. To give a short introduction about these stars, in the\nfollowing paragraph we copy the information from the Galilee Astrophysical\nObservatory's home page :\n\nMore than 90 percent of the stellar population of our Galaxy are flare\nstars. The nearest star to the sun, Proxima Centauri, is a flare star.\nFlare stars are small and cold stars, in other words, red dwarfs. Each of\nthese stars is smaller than the Sun by approximately 2-5 times. The\ntemperature of such a star is around 2000-4000 degrees, while the\ntemperature of the solar surface is about 6000 degrees. The interesting\nphenomena is that in spite of the fact that such a star is so small and\nweak, every few hours their magnitude jumps during several seconds between\n10 to 600 times more than \"normal\". It has to be stressed that the\nexplosion we are speaking of doesn't only not destroy the star, but it\neven doesn't influence it. Our current knowledge about stellar stars is\nthat the energy we see during the explosions accumulates prior to the\nexplosion as a magnetic field energy over a period of time. Once the\nmagnetic field is no longer able to contain the accumulated energy there\nis an abrupt release of a vast amount of energy and we see the flare. In\nspite of the fact that this process we see in flare stars as well as on\nthe sun, the details of the process are still being extensively researched\nall over the world.\n\nIn order to register the outbursts of these stars, fast photometry is\nnecessary. For stellar occultation measurements, the European Section of\nthe International Occultation Timing Association has developed a CCD\nsystem capable to record images as fast as necessary for the flare star\nregistration. It is described in the following.\n\nCCD Photometry\n\nHigh speed CCD photometry can very well be used to measure fast intensity\nvariations in different variable stars. Flare stars are possible objects\nfor photometry with sampling frequency in the 1 to 10 second time range.\nIn contrast to standard CCD detector systems, which provide relatively\nlarge areas with many pixels, we have developed a slow scan CCD camera\nbased on a commercially available chip, the TC245 manufactured by Texas\nInstruments, which can record small images at a rate starting from 18\nimages per second. The chip is mounted in a closed thermoelectrically\ncooled environment (temperature ~-30C) and can be attached to any small or\nlarge telescope. It is directly connected with a standard PC equipped with\na 12 Bit AD converter card. An operating program can display the images in\nreal time and record the images with the exact time (obtained with a\nDCF-77 time receiver) on the computer's hard disk. The camera has been\ndeveloped by IOTA\/ES and was used before to record lunar as well as\nplanetary occultations of different stars.\n\nOur Project\n\nWe propose to compare the possibilities of visual observations with the\nresults from such a CCD system. For the observations we plan to attach the\ncamera to the brandnew 10 inch Schaer refractor of the Public Observatory\nof Munich (Volkssternwarte M\u00fcnchen) or to a portable\ninstrument.\n\nBecause we are located in the Munich area with its relatively poor weather\nconditions, we have to find a way to let you know, when the weather\nconditions are favorable here for observations.\n\nEach of the participants, who want to contribute to this project,\nshould send his\/her email address to\n\nAll subscribed participants will receive via email the exact\ncoordinates, magnitude and further informations about the flare star\n(frequency of flares, magnitude change, color change and more\nliterature references) we select for observation.\n\nWe think to be ready for observations between the 24th of November\nand the 6th of December 1996. In case of good weather conditions we\nwill inform all subscribed participants via email that we are going to\ntake CCD image sequences of the selected star. The mail will inform\nabout the exact observing time with the CCD camera system. During this\ntime period the participants should try to visually observe the\nselected star and record the UT time, estimated intensity as well as\nduration of possible flares. All data should be send as soon as\npossible to the email addresses given above with the subject\n\"Flare Project Results\". Don't forget to send informtions\nabout your telescope size, focal length, magnification, observing\nsite, weather conditions and visibility conditions (scintillation\netc.).\n\nWe will compare all results with our camera data and publish the\ncomplete evaluation in the Astronomy On-Line websites.\n\nMore information about the Public Observatory of Munich and\nthe International Occultation Timing Association (IOTA) can be\nobtained from our webservers :"}

{"text":"Astronomy team discovers nearby dwarf galaxy\n\nFeb 08, 2012\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- A team led by UCLA research astronomer Michael Rich has used a unique telescope to discover a previously unknown companion to the nearby galaxy NGC 4449, which is some 12.5 million light years from Earth. The newly discovered dwarf galaxy had escaped even the prying eyes of the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nThe research is published Feb. 9 in the journal Nature.\n\nThe larger, host galaxy, NGC 4449, may be \"something of a living fossil,\" representing what most galaxies probably looked like shortly after the Big Bang, Rich said. The galaxy is forming stars \"so furiously\" that it has giant clusters of young stars and even appears bluish \u2014 a sign of a young galaxy \u2014 to the eye in large amateur telescopes, he said.\n\nNGC 4449 has a nucleus that may someday host a black hole and an irregular structure, lacking the spiral arms characteristic of many galaxies, he said. It is surrounded by a huge complex of hydrogen gas that spans approximately 300,000 light years, which may be fueling its burst of star formation.\n\nRich collaborated with Francis Longstaff, a professor of finance at the UCLA Anderson School of Management and an amateur astronomer, in acquiring and using a specialized telescope designed to take images of wide fields of the sky. Known as the Centurion 28 (the diameter of the mirror is 28 inches), the telescope, and the observatory the astronomers used, are located at the Polaris Observatory Association near Frazier Park, in Kern County, Calif.\n\nArtist William Hurt's depiction of the Milky Way, placed alongside an artist's representation of NGC 4449B (the faint blob in the lower right). If NGC 4449B were place alongside our Milky Way, it would stretch from the center of the galaxy to the sun's position, nearly 25,000 light years away. (Courtesy of Claire C. Welsh, Nature publishing group)\n\nWith the C28 telescope, the astronomers discovered the companion dwarf galaxy, which has \"evidently experienced a close encounter with the nucleus of NGC 4449,\" Rich said. Dubbed NGC 4449B, the dwarf galaxy has been stretched into a comet-like shape by this gravitational encounter.\n\nNGC 4449B had remained undetected because it is more than 10 times fainter than the natural brightness of the night sky and some 1,000 times fainter than our own Milky Way galaxy. The dwarf galaxy is in a \"transient stage,\" Rich said, and will soon \u2014 by astronomical standards \u2014 be dissolved.\n\nThe Milky Way has a similar companion, known as the Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy, which has been wrapped around our galaxy as it orbits and which loses its stars to the Milky Way's gravitational tug.\n\nWith the help of the wide field of the C28 telescope and special image processing conducted by Christine Black, a UCLA research assistant, and David Reitzel of the Griffith Observatory, the astronomers were able to subtract the light of the sky and that of the outer parts of NGC 4449 to reveal the new galaxy.\n\nNGC 4449B is stretched into a gigantic \"S\" so large that if one end were placed at the center of the Milky Way, the other end would reach all the way to the sun's position. In fact, NGC 4449B is the largest dwarf galaxy known in the \"local group\" that also includes the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy.\n\nThe deep images of the larger NGC 4449 revealed other surprises as well: a strange arc of stars that might be an ingested galaxy, and a \"remarkable halo\" of old stars that appears to consist of two parts; the outermost part of this \"halo\" population was unexpected, and makes NGC 4449 equivalent in size to the Milky Way. The origin of these old stars is not known, but they may have been acquired when galaxies similar to NGC 4449B fell into NGC 4449 and were shredded, Rich said.\n\nAndrew Benson, a co-author and a senior research fellow in theoretical cosmology at the California Institute of Technology, said, \"Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, has a host of smaller galaxies which orbit around it. On much larger scales, we see groups and clusters of galaxies which orbit under the pull of their mutual gravitational attraction. Gravity has no preferred length scale, so we'd expect that dark matter (which interacts only through gravity) should behave in more or less the same way on all scales. For a galaxy like NGC4449, that means it should have its own system of small dark-matter satellites orbiting around it \u2014 assuming that dark matter works the way we think it does.\"\n\nThe C28 telescope used for the discovery places the CCD camera at what is known as the \"prime\" focus, in front of the light-collecting mirror. The telescope is produced by the Astro Works Corp. of Arizona, led by James Riffle. Longstaff and Rich expect to have the telescope ready for remote control later this year, perhaps this summer. Longstaff led the observatory and telescope project.\n\nThe dwarf galaxywas also independently discovered by a team of scientists led by David Martinez-Delgado of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. This team included Aaron Romanowsky of UC Santa Cruz and amateur astronomer R. Jay Gabany. Their study, accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, shows the dwarf resolved into individual stars by the 8.2-meter Subaru telescope.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nNew images of a nearby dwarf galaxy have revealed a dense stream of stars in its outer regions, the remains of an even smaller companion galaxy in the process of merging with its host.

Such facilities have aided in the investigation of important questions in star formation, such as: how is the formation and evolution of stellar clusters effected by their initial conditions and environment? what are the effects of cluster environment on the processing of circumstellar material of young stars? and more recently with Herschel, what is the relation of core mass to the initial mass function and the filamentary structure observed in molecular clouds?

Consider associating this request with a WikiProject.(August 2010)\n\nAstronomical spectroscopy is the technique of spectroscopy used in astronomy. The object of study is the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, which radiates from stars and other hot celestial objects. Spectroscopy can be used to derive many properties of distant stars and galaxies, such as their chemical composition, temperature, density, mass, distance, luminosity, and relative motion using Doppler shift measurements.\n\nContents\n\nAstronomical spectroscopy began with Isaac Newton's initial observations of the light of the Sun, dispersed by a prism. He saw a rainbow of colour, and may even have seen absorption lines.[citation needed] These dark bands which appear throughout the solar spectrum were first described in detail by Joseph von Fraunhofer. Most stellar spectra share these dominant features of the Sun's spectrum: emission at all wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum (a continuum) with many discrete absorption lines at certain wavelengths, resulting from a deficiency of observed photons at those particular wavelengths.\n\nFraunhofer's original (1817) designations of absorption lines in the solar spectrum\n\nThe absorption lines in stellar spectra can be used to determine the chemical composition of the star. Each element is responsible for a different set of absorption lines in the spectrum, at wavelengths which can be measured extremely accurately by laboratory experiments. Then, an absorption line at the given wavelength in a stellar spectrum shows that the element must be present. Of particular importance are the absorption lines of hydrogen (which is found in the atmosphere of nearly every star); the hydrogen lines within the visual spectrum are known as Balmer lines.\n\nIn 1868, Sir Norman Lockyer observed strong yellow lines in the solar spectrum which had never been seen in laboratory experiments. He deduced that they must be due to an unknown element, which he called helium, from the Greek helios (sun). Helium wasn't conclusively detected on earth until 25 years later.\n\nAlso in the 1860s, emission lines (particularly a green line) were observed in the coronal spectrum during solar eclipses that did not correspond to any known spectral lines. Again it was proposed that these were due to an unknown element, provisionally named coronium. It was not until the 1930s that it was discovered that these lines were due to highly ionised iron and nickel, the high ionisation being due to the extreme temperature of the solar corona.\n\nIn conjunction with atomic physics and models of stellar evolution, stellar spectroscopy is today used to determine a multitude of properties of stars: their distance, age, luminosity and rate of mass loss can all be estimated from spectral studies. Doppler shift studies of the spectral lines can uncover the presence of hidden companions such as black holes and exoplanets.\n\nIn the early days of telescopic astronomy, the word nebula was used to describe any fuzzy patch of light that didn't look like a star. Many of these, such as the Andromeda Nebula, had spectra that looked in many ways a lot like stellar spectra, and these turned out to be galaxies. Others, such as the Cat's Eye Nebula, had very different spectra. When William Huggins looked at the Cat's Eye, he found no continuous spectrum like that seen in the Sun, but just a few strong emission lines. These lines did not correspond to any known elements on earth, and so just as helium had been identified in the Sun, astronomers suggested that the lines were due to a new element, nebulium (occasionally nebulum or nephelium). The hypothetical nebulium that was invoked to account for certain bright lines in gaseous nebulae were shown by Ira Sprague Bowen in 1927 as due to doubly ionizedoxygen at extremely low density. As Henry Norris Russell put it, \"Nebulium has vanished into thin air.\" But nebulae are typically extremely rarefied, much less dense than the hardest vacuum ever produced on earth. In these conditions, atoms behave quite differently and lines can form which are suppressed at normal densities. These lines are known as forbidden lines, and are the strongest lines in most nebular spectra.[1]\n\nThe spectra of galaxies look somewhat similar to stellar spectra, as they consist of the light from millions of stars combined. Galactic spectroscopy has led to many fundamental discoveries. Edwin Hubble discovered in the 1920s that, apart from the nearest ones (those in what is known as the Local Group), all galaxies are receding from the Earth. The further away a galaxy, the faster it is receding (see Hubble's Law). This was the first indication that the universe originated from a single point, in a Big Bang.\n\nDoppler shift studies of clusters of galaxies by Fritz Zwicky found that most galaxies were moving much faster than seemed to be possible, from what was known about the mass of the cluster. Zwicky hypothesised that there must be a great deal of non-luminous matter in the galaxy clusters, which became known as dark matter.\n\nIn the 1950s, some strong radio sources were found to be associated with very dim objects that seemed to be very red. These were named Quasi-stellar radio sources, or quasars. When the first spectrum of one of these objects was taken, it was something of a mystery, with absorption lines at wavelengths where none were expected. It was soon realised that what was observed was a normal galactic spectrum, but highly redshifted. According to Hubble's Law, this implied that the quasar must be extremely distant in space and time, and therefore highly luminous. Quasars are now thought to be galaxies forming in the early years of our universe, with their extreme energy output powered by super-massive black holes.\n\nPlanets and asteroids shine only by the reflected light of their parent star. The reflected light contains absorption bands due to minerals in the rocks present for rocky bodies, or due to the elements and molecules present in the atmospheres of the Gas giants. Asteroids can be classified into three main types, according to their spectra: the C-types are made of carbonaceous material, S-types consist mainly of silicates, and M-types are 'metallic'. C- and S-type asteroids are the most common.\n\nThe spectra of comets consist of a reflected solar spectrum from the dusty clouds surrounding the comet, as well as emission lines from gaseous atoms and molecules excited to fluorescence by sunlight and\/or chemical reactions. Nearby comets can even be seen in X-ray as solar wind ions flying to the coma are neutralized. The cometary X-ray spectra therefore reflect the state of the solar wind rather than that of the comet. Many organic chemicals are known to exist in comets, and it has been suggested that cometary impacts provided the Earth with much of the water for its oceans and the chemicals necessary for the formation of life. It has even been suggested that life may have been brought to earth from interstellar space by comets (the Panspermia theory).\n\nStars emit light at all frequencies in the core; molecules, atoms, and ions that may be present near the surface of the star will absorb strongly at certain characteristic frequencies. Thus the observed spectrum will contain relatively dark bands at the characteristic frequencies of constituents of the outer layers. Absorption spectra of nebulae and planetary atmospheres arise simply when molecules absorb light of from the parent star and re-emit it in random directions and at different frequencies.[2][3]\n\nIt is not hard to view spectra of astronomical objects. A simple, homemade DVD spectrograph can be used to view solar spectra.[4] Note that looking at the Sun directly or by reflection can result in temporary or permanent loss of vision. Proper equipment must be used, and children should be supervised.\n\nRecently, there has been a resurgence in amateur astronomical spectroscopy.[5] It is possible to use a digital camera or telescope to easily view spectra of astronomical objects.[6]\n\nInexpensive diffraction gratings like the Paton Hawksley Star Analyser[7] or the Rainbow Optics Star Spectroscope[8] can be used to split the starlight. Software like RSpec[9] can be used to plot the curves.\n\nAn excellent introduction to amateur spectroscopy is Astronomical Spectroscopy for Amateurs, published in 2011.[10]\n\nAlso, Sky & Telescope Magazine has produced an excellent video interview that explains how to get started.[11]"}

The inset shows one of the 10 most distant and ancient Type Ia supernovae discovered by the American, Israeli and Japanese team.\n\nUC Berkeley\n\nThese stellar explosions helped astronomers conclude more than a decade ago that dark energy is accelerating the expansion of the universe, and today (Tuesday, Oct. 4) earned the discoverers \u2013 including UC Berkeley physicist Saul Perlmutter \u2013 the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. But what caused them was a mystery. Many astronomers thought white dwarf stars were pulling matter from their normal stellar companions and growing so fat they exploded.\n\nBut the new study by American, Israeli and Japanese astronomers instead suggests that many, if not most, of the Type Ia supernovae result when two white dwarf stars merge and annihilate in a thermonuclear explosion.\n\n\"The nature of these events themselves is poorly understood, and there is a fierce debate about how these explosions ignite,\" said Dovi Poznanski, one of the main authors of the paper and a post-doctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\n\"The main goal of this survey was to measure the statistics of a large population of supernovae at a very early time, to get a look at the possible star systems,\" he said. \"Two white dwarfs merging can explain well what we are seeing.\"\n\nPoznanski, Tel-Aviv University graduate student Or Graur and their colleagues will report their findings in the October 2011 issue of the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS).\n\nThe results do not place in jeopardy the conclusion that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, said coauthor Alex Filippenko, UC Berkeley professor of astronomy.\n\nThe image below shows 10% of the Subaru Deep Field. Move your cursor over the image to reveal 22 of the 150 supernovae in the sample. Each point of light in the image is a galaxy, consisting of tens of billions of stars (except for the few bright spots that are nearby Milky-Way stars). Every triplet of frames zooms in on one event, showing the galaxy before the explosion, with the supernova in progress, and in a digital \"difference image\" that isolates the light from the supernova.\n\nCredit: UC Berkeley\n\n\"As long as Type Ias explode in the same way, no matter what their origin, their intrinsic brightnesses should be the same, and the distance calibrations would remain unchanged,\" he said.\n\nEvidence that Type Ia supernovae are caused by the merger of two white dwarfs - the so-called double-degenerate theory - has been accumulating over the past two years, based on surveys by the Hubble Space Telescope and others.\n\n\"The tide is definitely turning, and these are the best data yet to support the double-degenerate theory,\" Filippenko said.\n\nOne white dwarf or two?\n\nWhite dwarfs are dense, compact stars formed from normal stars like the sun once they exhaust their nuclear fuel and compress under their own weight.\n\nThe new, largest-ever survey using the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii accumulated a sample of 150 distant supernovas that exploded between 5 and 10 billion years ago.\n\nThe finding, when combined with previous surveys of closer Type Ia supernovae, suggests that astronomers surveying Type Ia supernovae may be seeing a mixture of single- and double-degenerates.\n\n\"There are no good answers yet, and it could be that we are seeing a mix of the two types of explosions,\" Poznanski said.\n\nOut of the 150 supernovae in the sample, twelve were at redshifts over 1.5. Ten of those were classified as thermonuclear, or Type-Ia, supernovae. This is the largest sample of high-redshift Type-Ia supernovae discovered to date.\n\nEvery triplet of frames zooms in on one event, showing the galaxy before the explosion, with the supernova in progress, and in a digital \"difference image\" that isolates the light from the supernova.\n\nThe header of each triplet lists the name of the supernova and its redshift.\nCredit:\n\nThough the two-faced nature of Type Ia supernovae still allows them to be used as calibratable candles to measure cosmic distance, Filippenko said, it might affect attempts to \"quantify in detail the history of the expansion rate of the universe. The subtle differences between single- and double-degenerate models could introduce a systematic error that we'll need to account for.\"\n\nThe team also found that Type Ia supernovae were five times more common 5-10 billion years ago than today, probably because there were more young stars back then rapidly evolving into white dwarfs. Moreover, this study allowed the team to more accurately determine the production of iron over cosmic time, as Type Ia supernovae create iron through nuclear reactions when they explode.\n\nTo find their distant sample, the international team of astronomers exploited the enormous light collecting power of the Subaru Telescope's Suprime-Camera on four separate occasions. They pointed the ground-based telescope, located atop Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano, toward a single field in the sky that was approximately the size of the full moon. Each run yielded about 40 supernovae among 150,000 galaxies.\n\nThen they used the Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea to observe the galaxies where these explosions occurred. These observations were crucial for pinpointing the distance of these events.\n\nFuture observations with the Hyper Suprime-Camera, which will be mounted on the Subaru Telescope, will be able to discover even larger and more distant supernova samples to test this conclusion.\n\nOther authors on the paper include Dan Maoz, Naoki Yasuda, Tomonori Totani, Masataka Fukugita, Ryan J.

Astronomers propose that the flashes are due to material in a circumstellar disk suddenly being dumped onto the growing stars and unleashing a blast of radiation each time the stars get close to each other in their orbit.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Two of NASA's great observatories, the Spitzer and\nHubble space telescopes, have teamed up to uncover a mysterious\ninfant star that behaves like a strobe light.\n\nEvery 25.34 days, the object, designated LRLL 54361, unleashes a burst\nof light. Although a similar phenomenon has been observed in two\nother young stellar objects, this is the most powerful such beacon\nseen to date.\n\nThe heart of the fireworks is hidden behind a dense disk and envelope\nof dust. Astronomers propose the light flashes are caused by periodic\ninteractions between two newly formed stars that are binary, or\ngravitationally bound to each other. LRLL 54361 offers insights into\nthe early stages of star formation when lots of gas and dust is being\nrapidly accreted, or pulled together, to form a new binary star.\n\nAstronomers theorize the flashes are caused by material suddenly being\ndumped onto the growing stars, known as protostars. A blast of\nradiation is unleashed each time the stars get close to each other in\ntheir orbits. This phenomenon, called pulsed accretion, has been seen\nin later stages of star birth, but never in such a young system or\nwith such intensity and regularity.\n\n\"This protostar has such large brightness variations with a precise\nperiod that it is very difficult to explain,\" said James Muzerolle of\nthe Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md. His paper\nrecently was published in the science journal Nature.\n\nDiscovered by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, LRLL 54361 is a variable\nobject inside the star-forming region IC 348, located 950 light-years\nfrom Earth. Data from Spitzer revealed the presence of protostars.\nBased on statistical analysis, the two stars are estimated to be no\nmore than a few hundred thousand years old.\n\nThe Spitzer infrared data, collected repeatedly during a period of\nseven years, showed unusual outbursts in the brightness of the\nsuspected binary protostar. Surprisingly, the outbursts recurred\nevery 25.34 days, which is a very rare phenomenon.\n\nAstronomers used NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to confirm the Spitzer\nobservations and reveal the detailed stellar structure around LRLL\n54361. Hubble observed two cavities above and below a dusty disk. The\ncavities are visible by tracing light scattered off their edges. They\nlikely were blown out of the surrounding natal envelope of dust and\ngas by an outflow launched near the central stars. The disk and the\nenvelope prevent the suspected binary star pair from being observed\ndirectly. By capturing multiple images over the course of one pulse\nevent, the Hubble observations uncovered a spectacular movement of\nlight away from the center of the system, an optical illusion known\nas a light echo.\n\nMuzerolle and his team hypothesized the pair of stars in the center of\nthe dust cloud move around each other in a very eccentric orbit. As\nthe stars approach each other, dust and gas are dragged from the\ninner edge of a surrounding disk. The material ultimately crashes\nonto one or both stars, which triggers a flash of light that\nilluminates the circumstellar dust. The system is rare because close\nbinaries account for only a few percent of our galaxy's stellar\npopulation. This is likely a brief, transitory phase in the birth of\na star system.\n\nMuzerolle's team next plans to continue monitoring LRLL 54361 using\nother facilities including the European Space Agency's Herschel Space\nTelescope.

And it's a confirmation people didn't think was possible at this point.\"\n\nMany astronomers thought detecting filaments would have to wait until telescopes became significantly more advanced, but Dietrich and his colleagues benefited from the rare spatial geometry of this cluster, which allowed them to detect signs of what's called weak gravitational lensing. [Gallery: Dark Matter Throughout the Universe]\n\nA July 2012 study of the galaxy clusters Abell 222 and Abell 223 found they are connected by a dark matter filament, shown here. The blue shading and the yellow contours indicate the density of matter.\n\n\/\nSpace.com\n\nAccording to Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, massive objects warp space and time around them, causing anything traveling through it, including light, to proceed along a curved path.\n\nWhen light from a background object, such as a galaxy, passes nearby a massive cluster on its way to Earth, its image will appear bent because of the crooked path its light traveled.\n\n\"The standard wisdom is that the gravitational lensing of filaments is too weak to be detected with current telescopes,\" Dietrich told SPACE.com. \"Only when we realized this system has such a peculiar geometry did we realize we have a chance.\"\n\nAbell 222 and Abell 223 are arranged so that they appear very close together against the sky, but are farther apart along our line of sight looking away from Earth. This means that most of the mass of the system is condensed into one small area of the sky that any light arriving at Earth from behind will have to pass though, boosting the gravitational lensing signal.\n\nThe astronomers used observations from the public archive of data collected by the Japanese Subaru telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii.\n\n\"The data was observed in 2001 and just had been sitting in the archive and no one ever used it,\" Dietrich said. \"It took a while for us to realize that this data is around.\"\n\nThough the gravitational lensing was too weak to notice by eye, the team used a statistical analysis of light from more than 40,000 background galaxies to determine that unseen mass in between the two galaxy clusters was warping space-time.\n\nThe work follows up on a 2008 study Dietrich worked on, which found hot gas in the area of the filament, suggesting its existence. However, that study did not detect a signal from the dark matter directly.\n\nThe researchers would love to search for dark matter filaments around other galaxy clusters, but say they haven't yet found any good candidates that might cause lensing strong enough to be seen from Earth.\n\nEditor's Note: This article was changed to correct the percentage of all matter in the universe that is dark matter, which is 83 percent, not 98 percent.\n\nNothing has been detected.

{"text":"Grand spiral galaxies often seem to get all the glory, flaunting their young, bright, blue star clusters in beautiful, symmetric spiral arms. But small galaxies form stars too, like nearby NGC 6822, also known as Barnard's Galaxy. Beyond the rich starfields in the constellation Sagittarius, NGC 6822 is a mere 1.5 million light-years away, a member of our Local Group of galaxies. About 7,000 light-years across, the dwarf irregular galaxy is seen to be filled with young blue stars and mottled with the telltale pinkish hydrogen glow of star forming regions in the deep color composite image. Contributing to the science of LITTLE THINGS, this portrait of a small galaxy was made as part of the Lowell Amateur Research Initiative (LARI), welcoming collaborations with amateur astronomers.\n\nThis moon is shining by the light of its planet. Specifically, a large portion of Enceladus pictured above is illuminated primarily by sunlight first reflected from the planet Saturn. The result is that the normally snow-white moon appears in the gold color of Saturn's cloud tops. As most of the illumination comes from the image left, a labyrinth of ridges throws notable shadows just to the right of the image center, while the kilometer-deep canyon Labtayt Sulci is visible just below. The bright thin crescent on the far right is the only part of Enceladus directly lit by the Sun. The above image was taken last year by the robotic Cassini spacecraft during a close pass by by the enigmatic moon. Inspection of the lower part of this digitally sharpened image reveals plumes of ice crystals thought to originate in a below-surface seaFrom afar, the whole thing looks like an Eagle. A closer look at the Eagle Nebula, however, shows the bright region is actually a window into the center of a larger dark shell of dust. Through this window, a brightly-lit workshop appears where a whole open cluster of stars is being formed. In this cavity tall pillars and round globules of dark dust and cold molecular gas remain where stars are still forming. Already visible are several young bright blue stars whose light and winds are burning away and pushing back the remaining filaments and walls of gas and dust. The Eagle emission nebula, tagged M16, lies about 6500 light years away, spans about 20 light-years, and is visible with binoculars toward the constellation of the Serpent (Serpens). This picture combines three specific emitted colors and was taken with the 0.9-meter telescope on Kitt Peak, Arizona, USA.\n\nDark, smooth regions that cover the Moon's familiar face are called by Latin names for oceans and seas. The naming convention is historical, though it may seem a little ironic to denizens of the space age who recognize the Moon as a mostly dry and airless world, and the smooth, dark areas as lava-flooded impact basins. For example, this elegant lunar vista, a careful mosaic of telescopic images, looks across the expanse of the northwestern Mare Imbrium, or Sea of Rains, into the Sinus Iridum - the Bay of Rainbows. Ringed by the Jura Mountains (montes), the bay is about 250 kilometers across, bounded at the bottom of the rugged arc by Cape (promontorium) Laplace. The cape's sunlit face towers nearly 3,000 meters above the bay's surface. At the top of the arc is Cape Heraclides, at times seen as a moon maiden.\n\nThis stunning group of galaxies is far, far away - about 450 million light-years from planet Earth - cataloged as galaxy cluster Abell S0740. Dominated by the cluster's large central elliptical galaxy (ESO 325-G004), this sharp Hubble view takes in a remarkable assortment of galaxy shapes and sizes with only a few spiky foreground stars scattered through the field. The giant elliptical galaxy spans over 100,000 light years and contains about 100 billion stars, comparable in size to our own spiral Milky Way. The Hubble data reveal a wealth of detail in even these distant galaxies, including magnificent arms and dust lanes, star clusters, ring structures, and gravitational lensing arcs.\n\nSome moons wouldn't survive the collision. Tethys, one of Saturn's larger moons at about 1000 kilometers in diameter, survived the collision, but sports today the expansive impact crater Odysseus. Sometimes called the Great Basin, Odysseus occurs on the leading hemisphere of Tethys and shows its great age by the relative amount of smaller craters that occur inside its towering walls. The density of Tethys is similar to water-ice. The above digitally enhanced image was captured late last year by the robot Cassini spacecraft in orbit around Saturn as it swooped past the giant ice ball.\n\nWhat in heavens-above was that? Not everything seen on the night sky is understood. The Night Sky Live (NSL) project keeps its global array of continuously updating web cameras (CONCAMs) always watching the night sky. On the night of 2004 December 17, the fisheye CONCAM perched on top of an active volcano in Haleakala, Hawaii, saw something moving across the night sky that remains mysterious. The NSL team might have disregarded the above streak as unconfirmed, but the Mauna Kea CONCAM on the next Hawaiian island recorded the same thing. The NSL team might then have disregarded the streak as a satellite, but no record of it was found in the heavens-above.com site that usually documents bright satellite events. If you think you have a reasonable explanation for the streak, please contribute to the on-line discussion. Current candidates include a known satellite that was somehow missed by heavens-above, a recently launched rocket, and a passing space rock. Volunteers are solicited by the NSL project to help monitor the operability of each NSL CONCAM, including looking for interesting anomalies such as this. Disclosure: Robert Nemiroff collaborates on both the NSL and APOD projects supernova explosions. The red and blue hues arise from glowing gas heated by the radiation of massive nearby stars. The System.\n\nThis enhanced Hubble Space Telescope image shows in remarkable detail the inner portion of the disk of dust and gas surrounding the star AB Aurigae. Knots of material, visible here for the first time, may well represent an early stage of a process which could result in the formation of planets over the next few million years. AB Aurigae is a young star (2-4 million years old), about 469 light-years distant. Its swirling circumstellar disk is large, about 30 times the size of our solar system. Astronomers believe planet-making is just beginning in AB Aurigae's disk because known disks surrounding younger stars (less than 1 million years old) do not show such clumpy structure, while disks of slightly older stars (aged 8-10 million years) have gaps and features suggesting that planets have already been formed. Why the window pane appearance? Wide black stripes in the picture are caused by occulting bars used to block out the overwhelming starlight. The diagonal streaks are due to diffraction spikes.\n\nThe quasar known as PKS 1127-145 lies ten billion light-years from our fair planet. A Hubble Space Telescope view in the left panel shows this quasar along with other galaxies as they appear in optical light. The quasar itself is the brightest object in the lower right corner. In the right panel is a Chandra Observatory x-ray picture, exactly corresponding to the Hubble field. While the more ordinary galaxies are not seen in the Chandra image, a striking jet, nearly a million light-years long, emerges from the quasar to dominate the x-ray view. Bright in both optical and x-ray light, the quasar is thought to harbor a supermassive black hole which powers the jet and makes PKS 1127-145 visible across the spectrum -- a beacon from the distant cosmos.\n\nRadio waves, like visible light, are electromagnetic radiation and radio telescopes can \"see\" -- their signals translate into radio images of the cosmos. While individually even the largest radio telescopes have very blurry vision compared to their optical counterparts, networks of radio telescopes can combine signals to produce sharper pictures. In fact, using an NRAO supercomputer in New Mexico, USA and technique called VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry), the European network of radio telescopes (EVN) has produced pictures of distant galaxies at a resolution some three times higher than the Hubble Space Telescope. Penetrating obscuring dust, the false-color EVN radio images are inset above according to their relative location in an optical image of the famous Hubble Deep Field region of the sky. (Yellow lines superimposed on the optical image are radio intensity contours from a single telescope.) The bright cosmic radio source in the middle of each inset corresponds to a galaxy. Impressively, the radio sources appear to be so small, less than about 600 light-years across in actual size, that they are thought to be associated with massive central black holes in the distant deep field galaxies.\n\nAn unusual dust disk surrounds nearby star Beta Pictoris. Discovered in 1983, astronomers are still learning just how unusual this disk is. Recent images and computer simulations indicate that the disk contains several elliptical dust rings larger than our own Solar System. The above image taken with the Hubble Space Telescope uncovered evidence of these rings as apparent knots in the edge-on disk. The ring model naturally explains why the disk protrudes longer on one side than the other. These rings might have been formed when a nearby star passed Beta Pic about 100,000 years ago. Astronomers are searching for this intruder star, which is not the foreground star visible in the wider image. Beta Pic is only 50 light-years away and thought to harbor planets.\n\nWinds of fast particles blow out from the Sun, but why? Astronomers came a step closer to answering this question recently by making detailed observations of the high-speed wind source with the space-borne Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). Images like those shown above isolate regions of inflowing gas, shown in red, and outflowing gas, shown in blue. Particles such as electrons and protons flow out at speeds near 3 million kilometers per hour. This wind will typically enter one of the Sun's coronal holes before flowing out into the Solar System. Analysis indicates that the high-speed wind escapes at the edges of large convection cells, drawn in black. SOHO has recently been revived to run without the use of any orienting gyroscopes.\n\nThe Crab Nebula, filled with mysterious filaments, is the result of a star that exploded in 1054 AD. This spectacular supernova explosion was recorded by Chinese and (quite probably) Anasazi Indian astronomers. The filaments are mysterious because they appear to have less mass than expelled in the original supernova and higher speed than expected from a free explosion. In the above picture, the color indicates what is happening to the electrons in different parts of the Crab Nebula. Red indicates the electrons are recombining with protons to form neutral hydrogen, while green indicates the electrons are whirling around the magnetic field of the inner nebula. In the nebula's very center lies a pulsar: a neutron star rotating, in this case, 30 times a second.\n\nThe famous Sombrero galaxy (M104) is a bright nearby spiral galaxy. The prominent dust lane and halo of stars and globular clusters give this galaxy its name. Something very energetic is going on in the Sombrero's center, as much X-ray light has been detected from it. This X-ray emission coupled with unusually high central stellar velocities cause many astronomers to speculate that a black hole lies at the Sombrero's center - a black hole a billion times the mass of our Sun.\n\nGet ready for one of the most impressive but least anticipated light shows in modern astronomical history. Next month, newly discovered Comet Hyakutake will pass closer to the Earth than any recent comet. Unknown before its discovery by Yuji Hyakutake on 30 January 1996, the fuzzy spot in the above photograph is a comet now predicted to become bright enough to see without a telescope. Although comets act in such diverse ways that predictions are frequently inaccurate, even conservative estimates indicate that this comet is likely to impress. For example, even if Comet Hyakutake remains physically unchanged, its close pass near the Earth in late March 1996 should cause it to appear to brighten to about 3rd magnitude - still bright enough to see with the unaided eye. In the next two months, though, the comet will continue to approach the Sun and hence should become brighter still. Optimistic predictions include that Comet Hyakutake will change physically, develop a larger coma and tail, brighten dramatically, move noticeably in the sky during a single night, and may ultimately become known as the \"The Great Comet of 1996.\" Move over Hale-Bopp!"}

{"text":"Astronomers report unprecedented double helix nebula near center of the Milky Way\n\nAstronomers report an unprecedented elongated double helix nebula near the center of our Milky Way galaxy, using observations from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. The part of the nebula the astronomers observed stretches 80 light years in length. The research is published March 16 in the journal Nature.\n\n\"We see two intertwining strands wrapped around each other as in a DNA molecule,\" said Mark Morris, a UCLA professor of physics and astronomy, and lead author. \"Nobody has ever seen anything like that before in the cosmic realm. Most nebulae are either spiral galaxies full of stars or formless amorphous conglomerations of dust and gas -- space weather. What we see indicates a high degree of order.\"\n\nThe double helix nebula is approximately 300 light years from the enormous black hole at the center of the Milky Way. (The Earth is more than 25,000 light years from the black hole at the galactic center.)\n\nThe Spitzer Space Telescope, an infrared telescope, is imaging the sky at unprecedented sensitivity and resolution; Spitzer's sensitivity and spatial resolution were required to see the double helix nebula clearly.\n\n\"We know the galactic center has a strong magnetic field that is highly ordered and that the magnetic field lines are oriented perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy,\" Morris said. \"If you take these magnetic field lines and twist them at their base, that sends what is called a torsional wave up the magnetic field lines.\n\n\"You can regard these magnetic field lines as akin to a taut rubber band,\" Morris added. \"If you twist one end, the twist will travel up the rubber band.\"\n\nOffering another analogy, he said the wave is like what you see if you take a long loose rope attached at its far end, throw a loop, and watch the loop travel down the rope.\n\n\"That's what is being sent down the magnetic field lines of our galaxy,\" Morris said. \"We see this twisting torsional wave propagating out. We don't see it move because it takes 100,000 years to move from where we think it was launched to where we now see it, but it's moving fast -- about 1,000 kilometers per second -- because the magnetic field is so strong at the galactic center -- about 1,000 times stronger than where we are in the galaxy's suburbs.\"\n\nA strong, large-scale magnetic field can affect the galactic orbits of molecular clouds by exerting a drag on them. It can inhibit star formation, and can guide a wind of cosmic rays away from the central region; understanding this strong magnetic field is important for understanding quasars and violent phenomena in a galactic nucleus. Morris will continue to probe the magnetic field at the galactic center in future research.\n\nThis magnetic field is strong enough to cause activity that does not occur elsewhere in the galaxy; the magnetic energy near the galactic center is capable of altering the activity of our galactic nucleus and by analogy the nuclei of many galaxies, including quasars, which are among the most luminous objects in the universe. All galaxies that have a well-concentrated galactic center may also have a strong magnetic field at their center, Morris said, but so far, ours is the only galaxy where the view is good enough to study it.\n\nMorris has argued for many years that the magnetic field at the galactic center is extremely strong; the research published in Nature strongly supports that view.\n\nThe magnetic field at the galactic center, though 1,000 times weaker than the magnetic field on the sun, occupies such a large volume that it has vastly more energy than the magnetic field on the sun. It has the energy equivalent of 1,000 supernovae.\n\nWhat launches the wave, twisting the magnetic field lines near the center of the Milky Way? Morris thinks the answer is not the monstrous black hole at the galactic center, at least not directly.\n\nOrbiting the black hole like the rings of Saturn, several light years away, is a massive disk of gas called the circumnuclear disk; Morris hypothesizes that the magnetic field lines are anchored in this disk. The disk orbits the black hole approximately once every 10,000 years.\n\n\"Once every 10,000 years is exactly what we need to explain the twisting of the magnetic field lines that we see in the double helix nebula,\" Morris said.\n\nCo-authors on the Nature paper are Keven Uchida, a former UCLA graduate student and former member of Cornell University's Center for Radiophysics and Space Research; and Tuan Do, a UCLA astronomy graduate student.

{"text":"This blob of glowing gas and stars (shown in a false color image) is from roughly 13 billion years ago, a time shortly after the universe formed. In the bar shown for scale, 10 kly stands for 10,000 light-years.\n\nM. Ouchi et al., Astrophysical Journal\n\nUsing a telescope atop a Hawaiian mountain, astronomers recently caught sight of an enormous, newfound glowing object in deep, deep space. If you were an astronomer, what would you call such a thing?\n\nHow about a \"blob\"?\n\nTechnically, the object is called a Lyman-alpha blob, and scientists aren't exactly sure what it is. But they have a guess. Astronomer Masami Ouchi, of the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Pasadena, Calif led the team that identified the blob. He and his colleagues think it may be a distant galaxy \u2014 a collection of stars, gas and dust \u2014 caught in the act of a feeding frenzy.\n\nAstronomers have different theories to explain how blobs like Ouchi's came into being. Some suggest that Lyman-alpha blobs are smaller galaxies merging together into one larger galaxy. Other theories suggest cold gas streaming into the galaxy is essentially \"feeding\" it. Still other astronomers suspect that the glowing blob is a cloud of gas heated by a nearby supermassive black hole.\n\nThe galaxy is 12.9 billion light-years from Earth. Light travels at about 186,000 miles per second, so one light-year is the equivalent of about 5.9 trillion miles. The giant blob is very, very far away, about 76.1 billion trillion miles away, in case you're counting. In fact, it's so far away that it's the fourth most distant object ever observed.\n\nWhen we see light from a distant object in the sky \u2014 say, a star \u2014 we're not seeing the object as it is. We're seeing the object as it was when it emitted the light we're seeing now. For example, light takes about eight minutes to travel from the sun to Earth, so when you see the sun, you actually see it as it was eight minutes ago.\n\nIn other words, to look into space is to look back in time. Because the newly discovered blob is 12.9 billion light-years away, it is at least 12.9 billion years old. The universe itself is believed to be about 13 or 14 billion years old, so this blob came into being not long after.\n\nThe blob is about 55,000 light-years across, or about half the diameter of our own galaxy, the Milky Way. To observe the blob, Ouchi and his team used a special telescope that is able to see infrared light coming from space. Infrared light is made of waves with wavelengths that we cannot see with the naked eye. We can feel these waves, though: \"Far\" infrared radiation feels like heat.\n\nAccording to Ouchi's infrared measurements, the number of stars in the blob is equivalent to 40 billion suns. And that number is likely to keep growing since the scientists think the blob is a young galaxy in a growth spurt.\n\n\nB. Urmston\n\nEver heard of Blood Falls? It's freezing cold, far away and hard to reach \u2014 probably not where you're headed on your family vacation this summer.\n\nBlood Falls is at the tip of a giant glacier in Antarctica. As its name suggests, the icy face of Blood Falls is red \u2014 but not from blood. Instead the water gets its hue because it's rich in iron. When the water trickles out from its underground beginnings, the iron is exposed to oxygen in the air and quickly forms the red rust.\n\nIt may not be a tourist hot spot, but Blood Falls is very interesting to scientists who study living creatures. A geomicrobiologist \u2014 someone who studies how tiny organisms affect or use minerals \u2014 recently studied the rusty water and came up with some surprising results.\n\nThe water that feeds Blood Falls probably comes from a salty underground lake. It's home to microbes that surprisingly don't need oxygen to survive. Microbes are tiny organisms, usually invisible to the naked eye. The microbes found in Blood Falls are similar to other microbes that live in the ocean.\n\n\"This briny pond is a unique sort of time capsule,\" says Jill Mikucki, the Dartmouth University geomicrobiologist who led the study of the water seeping from Blood Falls. \"I don't know of any other environment quite like this on earth.\"\n\nWhen she and her team studied the water, they found no oxygen but lots of dissolved iron. They suspect that the underwater reservoir formed when a giant glacier, now 1,300 feet thick, moved over the salty lake at least 1.5 million years ago. This trapped the water and everything in it in an oxygen-free, or anoxic, environment.\n\nUnlike human beings and most other forms of life, the microbes from Blood Falls don't need oxygen to live. Instead, they are able to exist using the iron and sulfates, chemical salts also found in the water. The microbes transfer particles called electrons from the sulfates to the iron.\n\nThe microbes at Blood Falls show that life can exist in even the harshest environments. In addition to giving us more information about our own planet, the study of these \"extremophiles\" may be useful in other scientific areas \u2014 like the search for life on other planets! If scientists find organisms on Earth that live on sulfur and iron, instead of oxygen, researchers might gain a better idea of where to look for life elsewhere in the universe.\n\nPower words: (Yahoo!

She had to go to the bathroom frequently in the middle of the night. She was always thirsty. Even her vision was blurry.\n\nAfter a few tests, the doctor pulled Albright's mother aside.\n\n\"I still remember it very vividly,\" says Ann Albright, now more than 40 years later. \"My mom left the room with the doctor and came back in with tears running down her cheeks.\"\n\nThe verdict: diabetes, a disease that affects the way people process food.\n\nAt the time, the 1960s, the diagnosis meant that young Ann would never have the carefree childhood her mother wanted for her. For the rest of her life, she would have to give herself shots several times a day. She would need to be very careful about what she ate. And she might not realize all of her dreams in life.\n\n\"In the era I was diagnosed, most people were told they'd have a shorter life span,\" Albright says. \"As a little girl with diabetes moving into adulthood, I wondered would I be able to have kids? Would I be able to have a life?\"\n\nScience has come a long way since then, says Albright, partly as a result of her own efforts: She's now a doctor and diabetes researcher at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Since her diagnosis, researchers have developed better technologies, more effective medicines and a sharper understanding of how diabetes works.\n\nDespite the advances, though, scientists still can't answer a lot of basic questions about what causes diabetes. There still is no cure. And living with the disease remains difficult.\n\n\"Everything changes\" after a diabetes diagnosis, says Ali Reed, a pediatric endocrine fellow at the University of California, San Francisco. \"Life becomes more complicated.\"\n\nWhat's more, diabetes is on the rise \u2014 in both adults and kids. One version of the disease, called type 2 diabetes, is increasing at an especially alarming rate.\n\nDiabetes refers to a group of diseases, but there are two main kinds: type 1 and type 2. In both types, the trouble begins with the body's ability to deal with sugar.\n\nSugar is the body's main fuel source. When you eat, your digestive system breaks down your food into basic parts, including proteins, fats and a simple sugar called glucose. Glucose gets absorbed through the intestines. From there, it enters the bloodstream. Circulating blood delivers glucose to all the cells, which convert it into energy.\n\nAt least, that's what's supposed to happen. In people with diabetes, however, sugar can't get from the bloodstream into the cells. A hormone, or messenger molecule, called insulin is normally responsible for that transfer. But in diabetics, insulin doesn't do its job.\n\nAs a result, sugar builds up in the bloodstream. When levels of sugar in the blood stay high, the condition is called chronic. And for reasons scientists don't yet understand, chronically high blood sugar can lead to blindness, kidney damage, limb amputations, heart attacks and more.\n\n\"It's not a death sentence, but it's a very serious disease,\" Albright says.\n\nTwo types\n\nExactly how diabetes affects a patient's life depends in part on which type of diabetes a person has. There are important differences between the two main types.\n\nType 1 diabetes is the kind Albright has. In this version of the disease, the body stops producing insulin. Symptoms usually begin in kids or teenagers control blood sugar levels. So far, scientists don't know how to prevent type 1 diabetes.\n\nType 2 diabetics make insulin, but their bodies don't use the hormone properly. Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1, and most people who have type 2 are adults. These days, though, more and more kids are coming to their doctors with symptoms of type 2 diabetes.\n\nDoctors already know that adults who develop type 2 diabetes tend to be overweight or obese. And as kids have become increasingly overweight, the disease has started appearing at younger and younger ages.\n\nShorrocks\/iStockphoto\n\nAs recently as a decade ago, type 2 diabetes was called \"adult-onset\" because kids just didn't get it.\n\n\"When this disease we used to only see in adults started happening in adolescents, it was just shocking to people,\" Albright says. \"Pediatricians just didn't know what to do.\"\n\nHealthy living\n\nDoctors already knew that adults who develop type 2 diabetes tend to be overweight or obese. (Scientists can't yet explain why.) And as kids have become increasingly overweight, the disease has started appearing at younger and younger ages.\n\nIn the United States, two out of three adults are now overweight, according to the CDC. Nineteen percent of kids between the ages of 6 and 11 are overweight, compared with 7 percent just 20 years ago. Over the same period, the proportion of overweight teens rose from 5 percent to 17 percent.\n\n(You can find out whether you are overweight by plugging numbers into a calculator at an online site. Also, see the sidebar \"Understanding Body Mass Index\" at the bottom of this article.)\n\nLike their type 1 peers, type 2 diabetics have to monitor blood sugar levels. But they often rely on drugs instead of insulin shots. Frequently, they can get the disease under control by simply exercising more and eating reasonable portions of healthy foods.\n\n\"We now know that we can prevent or postpone type 2 diabetes by having [adults] at very high risk lose 5 to 7 percent of their body weight,\" Albright says.\n\nScientists don't yet know whether the same is true for overweight kids. The trend is so new that CDC researchers are still working to gather basic information about how the disease works in young people.\n\n\"There's no harm in having healthier lifestyle habits,\" Albright says. \"Get to know what's going into your body. Make it fun.\"\n\nSeeking answers\n\nWeighing more than you should doesn't mean you're doomed to develop diabetes. The disease is far more complex than that. And while research has come a long way, plenty of questions remain.\n\nDoctors don't know, for example, why certain ethnic groups have particularly high rates of diabetes, including American Indians, Hispanics and African Americans. Nor can doctors say for sure why the chances of getting diabetes go up if your parents or siblings have it.\n\nBoth relationships suggest that genes play a role in setting people up for diabetes. But something in the environment has to push those genes into action, and scientists aren't sure what those triggers are. It's also not clear which genes are involved.\n\nIf you learn you have diabetes, don't despair. There's plenty you can do to live a long and healthy life. Also, know you're not alone.\n\nReed encourages all newly diagnosed kids to go to one of the nation's many diabetes camps. It can be hugely reassuring, she says, to be surrounded by other kids who feel like you do.\n\n\"It's really amazing,\" Reed says. \"It's a very supportive and tolerating environment for kids who are often the only ones at their school with diabetes. At diabetes camp, everyone is going through it together.\"\n\nBrown fat (black) shows up in a PET-CT scan of a man after exposure to cold (right) but is not as apparent in a scan at room temperature (left).\n\nW. Van Marken Lichtenbelt\n\nThe human body hides more than one\nkind of fat. White fat cells, which we usually think of when we think of fat,\nstore energy. But brown fat is different: It's a type of fat that burns energy\nand gives off heat.\n\nWhen you were born, you had a pad\nof brown fat on your back, and it helped you control your body temperature.\nMice also have brown fat on their backs. Until now, scientists suspected human\nadults don't have brown fat \u2014 or if they do, the brown fat is not important.\n\nThree recent studies show that\nhuman adults do have brown fat, and it may be important for controlling body\nweight. And unlike babies, adults store brown fat in the neck, abdomen, above\nthe collarbone and along the spine.\n\nIn the first study, researcher Ronald Kahn of the Joslin Diabetes Center and Harvard Medical School\nin Boston looked at the medical records of nearly 2,000 people who had received a PET-CT scan. To get a PET, or\npositron emission tomography, scan, a person is injected with a chemical that\nemits particles called positrons. Inside the person's body, these positrons\ncreate radiation called gamma rays, which pass through the body and are\ndetected by special machines outside the body. This type of scan provides a three-dimensional\npicture of what's going on inside the body. PET scans are often used to\ndiagnose cancer. A CT scan uses\nX-rays to see inside a body.\n\nKahn and his team found brown fat\nin the scans of 3.1 percent of the men studied and 7.5 percent of the women.\nPeople younger than 50 and lean people were more likely to have brown fat.\n\n\"It is now without dispute that\nbrown fat is present in adult humans,\" Kahn says.\n\nWhen the researchers checked the\nscans against the weather records, they found that brown fat was more likely to\nshow up when the temperature outside was cold. This comparison suggests brown\nfat burns more energy in colder temperatures.\n\nThe connection between brown fat\nand temperature was explored in the second study. Dutch researchers took scans\nof lean and overweight men at two temperatures, 72 degrees Fahrenheit (room\ntemperature) and 61 degrees Fahrenheit. At the higher temperature, brown fat\nbarely appeared on the scans. But when the temperature dropped, brown fat\nappeared on the scans of the leaner men. The more overweight the man, the less\nbrown fat appeared. The third study, conducted by Swedish scientists, also\nfound evidence of brown fat in adults.\n\nThese studies suggest that brown\nfat may burn more energy in people who are lean. The connection between brown\nfat and being overweight is less clear. Scientists wonder: Does having less\nbrown fat cause a person to become overweight, or does being overweight reduce\nthe amount of brown fat in a person?\n\nIn other words, overweight people\nmay be overweight partially because they don't have enough brown fat to help burn\nenergy. On the other hand, their excessive amount of white fat may keep the\nbrown fat from burning energy.\n\nPower words: (from Britannica.com and the Yahoo!

Hagadorn\n\nMany modern animals, like crabs, live in shells and carry their homes around with them. Picture one of these animals in your mind, and you may have some idea of what the first land-dwelling animals looked like. After studying strange marks that accompany some sets of ancient fossil footprints, scientists recently suggested that the oldest creatures to crawl out of the ocean probably wore shells.\n\nScientists have long known that life on Earth began in the sea. The first vertebrates \u2014 animals with backbones \u2014 came crawling out of the water between 385 million and 376 million years ago. But those animals weren't the first creatures to come ashore, says paleontologist James W. Hagadorn of Amherst College in Massachussetts.\n\nHagadorn and Yale University paleontologist Adolf Seilacher say that a different group of animals, called arthropods, probably beat the first land vertebrates by more than 100 million years. Arthropods are animals that lack a backbone and have a hard exoskeleton. Examples include modern-day scorpions and insects. These ancient arthropods may have dragged themselves out of the ocean 500 million years ago.\n\nThese ancient arthropods had the right kind of bodies to survive out of the water, says Hagadorn. Their hard exoskeletons would have kept them from drying out too quickly. And though these creatures breathed through gills, which require water, a shell would have trapped humid air. This handy gear would allow the animals to keep their gills moist.\n\nThe paleontologists found evidence for the shells by studying fossilized, or preserved, tracks discovered in central Wisconsin. The tracks were left by the ancient arthropods as they walked around on soft ground. Over time, this soft ground hardened, and the tracks remained as etchings in stone.\n\nWhen the scientists looked at the fossilized tracks, they found something strange. Some of the tracks included an extra mark alongside the footprints. Whenever the tracks turned, to the right or to the left, the extra mark swung out a little wider, always to the left. The scientists realized this mark could not have been made by a tail, because a tail would swing out wider on both sides. If the animal turned left, a tail\nwould have swung right; if the animal turned right, a tail would have swung left.\n\nBecause the mark swung out on one side only, the scientists believe it was made by a shell that dragged on the ground. Furthermore, they suspect the shell was coiled, probably in a right-hand spiral.\n\n\"This is an exciting find,\" says Sally E. Walker, a paleobiologist at the University of Georgia in Athens. Now, she says, scientists can approach these ancient arthropods from a different direction. They can study ancient shells to look for scratch marks on the outside that might have been made as the shells were dragged through the sand. Or, she says, researchers can look for scratch marks on the inside \u2014 which may suggest that another animal took over a shell, after the original animal that lived there died.\n\nPower words: (from the Yahoo!

The ship dumped about 11 million gallons of crude oil into the freezing water, creating the largest spill in U.S. history \u2014 and a disaster for animals that lived in or near the water.\n\nNow, 20 years later, the area still has not fully recovered. At the time of the spill, two groups of orcas, or killer whales, were swimming in the area. One of these groups of whales appears to be headed for extinction, and the other is recovering more slowly than scientists had predicted.\n\nThe first group, called AT-1, wasn't large to begin with: When the spill happened, the group had 22 whales. Nine of these whales died during the spill, and since then, no baby whales have been born in the group. The older males \u2014 who can live to be 60 \u2014 have been dying off. Now, only seven whales remain.\n\nThese orcas may look like and live in the same areas as other killer whales, but orcas in the AT-1 group are genetically different and communicate with a different set of sounds. They are transient orcas, which have larger home ranges than the other kind of killer whales, called resident orcas. Transient orcas eat mammals, such as harbor seals, sea lions, porpoises and other whales; resident orcas eat fish. These two types of killer whales don't breed with each other.\n\nLingering effects from the oil spill are not the only threats to orcas. The whales are swimming in polluted waters, and scientists have found these pollutants in the whales' blubber (or fat). These toxic substances may keep the whales from reproducing successfully. The pollution probably originated in plumes of air that wafted across the Pacific from China and Southeast Asia, says Craig Matkin, a marine mammal biologist who studies the whales.\n\n\"I don't want to make it sound like the oil spill is solely responsible for [this group of whales'] decline,\" Matkin says. \"It just exacerbated an already bad situation.\"\n\nThis male from the AT-1 population of transient orcas exhibits a curiously stunted, or small, dorsal fin.\n\nMatkin\/NGOS\n\nThe other group of endangered whales eats fish and squid. These are resident killer whales, and their group is called AB. After the spill, 13 whales in this group died. Scientists predicted the population would recover \u2014 that is, return to its original size \u2014 within 12 years. But they were wrong. The whales that died were mostly females and juveniles. Now, 20 years later, scientists think the AB group of whales will not recover for another 10 years.\n\nThe oil spill also broke up the family structure of the whales. Groups of orcas live in matriarchal communities, where a female acts as the head of the family. The matriarch of the AB group apparently died in the oil spill, and afterward many whales left to join a different group.\n\nWhen the AB group does eventually recover, it won't be the same. And the AT-1 group may become extinct. Other scientists are finding that certain other major species affected by the oil-spill \u2014 like otters, clams, herring and certain birds \u2014 have also failed to fully recover. And in many cases, they're surprised about why, 20 years after the spill, so many effects of the Exxon Valdez disaster still persist.\n\nPower words: (from the Yahoo!

The deep black color tells researchers that the rock is rich in carbon.\n\nNature\n\nOn October 7, 2008, an asteroid the size of a car blazed through the atmosphere and crashed into the Nubian Desert in the African nation of Sudan. Eyewitnesses who were looking up at the sky at the time reported seeing a fireball over the desert when the asteroid, named 2008 TC3, exploded into pieces.\n\nSome people weren't surprised by all the fireworks though. For the first time in history, scientists were able to watch the asteroid as it flew through space, then entered Earth's atmosphere and crashed into the desert. 2008 TC3 is the first asteroid to be observed both in space and on Earth. Before this asteroid's arrival, scientists have had to rely on data from one place or the other.\n\nAsteroids the size of 2008 TC3 are not uncommon, and fragments from one usually strike Earth every year. Because they are so small, Earth-bound asteroids usually remain unseen until they enter our atmosphere. Larger asteroids are easier to see, but are more rare.\n\n\"It's like when bugs splatter on the windshield. You don't see the bug until it's too late,\" says Mark Boslough, a physicist at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., who has studied the asteroid's collision. \"You'd see a baseball coming towards the windshield much sooner.\"\n\nIn the case of 2008 TC3, the astronomers who first observed it got lucky. They didn't know they were going to see it. \"It just so happened that the asteroid was coming from the direction that the telescope was pointed in,\" says astronomer Peter Jenniskens of the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif. The astronomers first saw the asteroid on October 6, through a telescope on a mountain near Tucson, Ariz.\n\nAs they watched 2008 TC3 move across the sky, the scientists studied its mineral composition by observing how the asteroid reflected sunlight. They also used tracking equipment to correctly predict when the asteroid would impact Earth. Shortly after the collision, Jenniskens and a team of astronomers and students from Sudan headed out into the desert to look for meteorites, pieces of the asteroid that survived the fiery trip through the atmosphere and landed on Earth. The team brought back about 47 meteorites from 2008 TC3.\n\nOnce they were able to study the fragments in the laboratory, the scientists quickly realized that the 2008 TC3 meteorites were unlike anything they had seen or studied before. More research on the pieces gave the scientists new information about the characteristics of different kinds of meteorites.\n\nIn addition to helping scientists understand more about asteroids, 2008 TC3 may prove to be helpful to humankind in the future. If a larger and more dangerous asteroid ever comes crashing toward Earth, scientists might see it coming.\n\nPower words: (Adapted from the Yahoo!

Primack, anonymous\n\nIt's not just Daylight Savings Time that came early this year. All around the world, spring seems to be coming sooner than it used to. It hasn't moved up on the calendar \u2014 but many cycles in nature are telling us that spring just can't wait to be sprung.\n\nDandelions push through the soil and bloom weeks earlier than they did decades ago. Robins who migrated for the winter are shortening their stays down south. In some places, butterflies usually not seen until July have been flitting about since January. That's great, right? After all, nearly everyone looks forward to spring's arrival after a long, cold winter.\n\nNot so fast, say many scientists. A growing body of evidence suggests these shifts in timing are coming about because of climate change. And these changes might spell trouble for the countless species of plants and animals that depend on one another.\n\nTiming is everything\n\n\"The timing of life cycles in nature really matters a lot,\" says Abe Miller-Rushing, a scientist at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Crested Butte, Colo. Miller-Rushing is one of a growing number of scientists investigating how climate change affects the timing of events in nature.\n\n\"Many organisms time their life cycles with the seasons,\" he says. \"Relationships between species could be disrupted as a result of changes in timing.\"\n\nClimate change, however, is a long-term phenomenon. To confidently say that climate change affects natural cycles, such as the date when maple trees first unfurl their leaves, scientists need to document what day the event occurs over many years. Then, they need to compare those dates with climate factors such as average temperature or rainfall over long periods of time \u2014 ideally decades. Finally, they need to figure out if changes in the timing of natural events are connected to changes in climate patterns.\n\n\"One of the big limitations to understanding how climate change affects plants and animals is you need data from a long time, and there just isn't a lot of that out there,\" Miller-Rushing says.So scientists need to be creative in their hunt for data.\n\nTurning to history\n\nMiller-Rushing turned to a long-dead figure in American history and literature for help. Henry David Thoreau, a writer and naturalist who lived in suburban Boston during the mid-1800s, kept detailed diaries of the natural cycles in his surroundings. In these diaries, he recorded the flowering times of hundreds of plants in eastern Massachusetts.\n\nKids in Arizona inspect plants for hints of early flowering.\n\nD. Amber\n\nTo compare Thoreau's observations with today's cycles, Miller-Rushing and his colleague at Boston University tracked the first flowering date for 43 of those species during the years 2004, 2005 and 2006.\n\nThey found that plants like violets and buttercups are blooming on average seven days earlier than they did in Thoreau's time. And some species, such as wild blueberries, bloom three weeks earlier than they did 150 years ago.\n\nSeven days might not seem like that much time. But many plants rely on insects to move their pollen from one flower to another \u2014 a crucial step in plant reproduction. And some plants only produce flowers for about a week, says Richard Primack, a conservation biologist at Boston University.\n\n\"If flowering shifts a week or two earlier and the insects that pollinate it are not coming out, it's possible that the species won't be pollinated, and it won't set fruit,\" Primack says.\n\nThat's significant for two reasons. First, when a plant \"sets fruit,\" it makes the seeds that will become the next generation of plants. If a plant doesn't set fruit, it doesn't reproduce.\n\nSecond, many birds rely on fruit as a food source \u2014 especially in the fall when they are building up their energy stores to migrate south for the winter. If plants aren't pollinated in the spring, this food resource won't exist in the fall.\n\nBut scientists are still learning how climate change may affect communities of plants and animals. \"Right now, we only know the relationships are changing,\" Primack says. \"Now we're actively researching the effect these changing relationships will have on species.\"\n\nIt's not only wildlife that's feeling the effects of these shifting cycles, says Christine Rogers. She is a biologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who studies how pollen, fungal spores and bacteria in the air affect people. She says kids with allergies might be sniffling and sneezing earlier than ever before.\n\n\"We know that the spring seasons are coming earlier, and that means the pollen people are allergic to is coming out earlier,\" she says. \"The timing of the allergy season is shifting to an earlier time period.\n\nCitizen scientists\n\nUnderstanding how nature responds to climate change will require monitoring key life cycle events \u2014 flowering, the appearance of leaves, the first frog calls of the spring \u2014 all around the world. But ecologists can't be everywhere so they're turning to non-scientists, sometimes called citizen scientists, for help.\n\nA group of scientists and educators launched an organization last year called the National Phenology Network. \"Phenology\" is what scientists call the study of the timing of events in nature.\n\nOne of the group's first efforts relies on scientists and non-scientists alike to collect data about plant flowering and leafing every year. The program, called Project BudBurst, collects life cycle data on a variety of common plants from across the United States. People participating in the project \u2014 which is open to everyone \u2014 record their observations on the Project BudBurst website.\n\n\"People don't have to be plant experts \u2014 they just have to look around and see what's in their neighborhood,\" says Jennifer Schwartz, an education consultant with the project. \"As we collect this data, we'll be able to make projections about how plants and communities of plants and animals will respond as the climate changes.\"\n\nThat data will help scientists predict not only how natural communities may change but also how these changes will affect people, says Jake Weltzin. He's the executive director of the National Phenology Network.\n\nWeltzin says scientists monitoring lilac flowering in the western United States reported that in years when lilacs bloomed early \u2014 before May 20th \u2014 wildfires later in the summer and fall tended to be larger and more severe. Lilac blooming, then, could serve as an alarm bell, he says.\n\n\"If we had a network of people collecting this information, scientists could use that information to come up with a nationwide tool for predicting fires in the west,\" Weltzin says.\n\nDown the road, he says the National Phenology Network plans to coordinate with other monitoring programs, such as the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology's Great Backyard Bird Count, the University of Kansas' Monarch Watch or the National Wildlife Federation's FrogWatch USA. Closer coordination will help scientists recognize new patterns, such as whether a change in the timing of flowering affects insect population levels.\n\nImproved monitoring is an important step toward predicting how natural communities will respond to climate change, Miller-Rushing says.\n\n\"The best way for us to increase our knowledge of how plants and animals are responding to climate change is to increase the amount of data we have,\" he says. \"That's why we need citizen scientists to get as much information from as many places on as many species over as long a time period as we can.\"\n\n\nOne of the most important ways that scientists group stars is by size. In the early 20th century, just before World War I, astronomers began to put stars into two main size groups: dwarfs and giants.\n\n\"Once they discovered that there was a class of stars really big, called giants, they carved the universe up into dwarfs and giants,\" says Jim Holberg, a scientist who studies dwarf stars at the University of Arizona in Tucson. \"The giants are enormous stars, and dwarfs are stars like the sun.\"\n\nDespite their name, most dwarf stars are not unusually small. Or unusual at all: Most stars, in fact, are dwarfs of one kind or another. But within the large category of dwarf stars are other groups of stars. Keeping track of the different kinds of dwarfs can be difficult, but that's all in a day's work for astronomers.\n\nA brown dwarf mystery: planets, stars or neither?\n\nThe tiny dot on the right side of this picture is the first verified image of a brown dwarf. This image was taken in 1995 by a camera onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The brown dwarf shown here is orbiting a much larger, brighter star called Gliese 229\n\nS. Durrance and D. Golimowski (JHU), NASA\n\nSome objects are so strange that even astronomers aren't sure what to call them. One of these kinds of objects behaves like a star, but it's not very hot \u2014 and it's too small. Plus, through a telescope, it resembles a planet \u2014 but it's too big to be called one. What would you call it? A star-net? A planet-ar?\n\nAn American astronomer named Shiv Kumar first predicted these strange objects might exist in 1963, and he called them black dwarfs. That name didn't stick, and ten years later another astronomer suggested the name brown dwarfs. That name stuck.\n\nBut there was another problem: Even though astronomers like Kumar could use information to imagine how brown dwarfs should behave, no one had ever seen one. It wasn't until 1995 \u2014 just 14 years ago \u2014 that astronomers first saw one of these brown dwarfs. Since that first discovery, astronomers have found hundreds more brown dwarfs.\n\nThanks to more scientists looking for these stars, and better telescopes to see them with, astronomers now know more about brown dwarfs. As it turns out, they aren't even brown. They are almost totally dark in the sky, producing no visible light. Instead, they emit infrared light, which is so faint it can only be detected by sophisticated telescopes.\n\nWhen you see a star in the sky, it looks like a calm, twinkling light. Your eyes deceive you, however. A star is anything but calm: What you are really looking at it is a giant, fiery ball of burning gas. For most stars, that gas is hydrogen, the lightest element in the universe. Hydrogen is the fuel for stars, just as gasoline is the fuel for most modern cars.\n\nStars are powered by a process called fusion, where hydrogen atoms join together to form helium \u2014 and give off a lot of energy. Like stars, brown dwarfs have a lot of hydrogen. But unlike other stars, brown dwarfs don't have enough mass to start the fusion process. So instead of burning bright and hot their whole lives, brown dwarfs smolder slowly and don't technically qualify as stars.\n\nThis illustration of a brown dwarf studied by Phan Bao Ngoc and other scientists shows jets of gas shooting out. These jets tell astronomers that the brown dwarf formed more like a star than a planet.\n\nDavid A. Aguilar (Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics)\n\nIn December 2008, astronomer Phan Bao Ngoc, who studies brown dwarfs at the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics in Taiwan, and a team of scientists solved one mystery about brown dwarfs. They showed that brown dwarfs shoot out a stream of gas into space \u2014 like stars. Thus, the strange objects seem to form more like stars than like planets. But, Ngoc cautions, that doesn't make them stars. \"It is still too early to say this settles all debate. We need to observe more young brown dwarfs,\" he says. \"This opens a new window and provides an important clue for the brown dwarf formation theory.\"\n\nRed dwarf stars: the most popular stars you'll never see\n\nIn April 2007, astronomers introduced a planet circling a red dwarf called Gliese 581 c, illustrated here. The planet is only a little larger than Earth, and though it probably could not sustain life, the discovery gives hope to scientists who are looking\n\nESO\n\nObjects in space that have just a little more mass than brown dwarfs are called red dwarf stars. Red dwarfs may not be much larger than brown dwarfs, but that small increase in size makes a big difference. Red dwarf stars are massive enough to support hydrogen fusion, like the sun. And they're also technically stars.\n\nBut unlike the sun, red dwarfs don't shine in the sky. \"They're less massive, and they don't produce as much energy,\" says Holberg. \"They don't have a strong energy source, so they're burning at a low rate.\" Most of the energy red dwarfs produce is invisible to the naked eye but visible to high-powered telescopes.\n\nDespite the difficulty in finding these stars, astronomers believe that most of the stars in our galaxy are red dwarfs. The sun's nearest neighbor, Proxima Centauri, is a red dwarf more than 20 trillion miles away. Most of our nearest star neighbors are red dwarfs.\n\nAstronomers who are looking for life on distant planets are particularly interested in red dwarfs. Some of the planets that have been found outside our solar system are in orbit around red dwarfs. If the planets are enough like Earth, then they may support life. In April 2007, a planet in orbit around a red dwarf was discovered to be only slightly bigger than Earth, but astronomers later determined that life could probably not exist there.\n\nWhite dwarf stars: the end of the line\n\nThe white dwarf in this picture is not the giant star in the center \u2014 it's the tiny dot in the lower left-hand corner. Called Sirius B, it is the closest white dwarf to Earth. The star in the center is Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky\n\nNASA, ESA, H. Bond (STScI) and M. Barstow (University of Leicester)\n\nAfter a long life of burning hydrogen, a star eventually runs out of fuel. At this point, the star grows and grows and grows into something called a red giant. These giant stars can be hundreds of times as large as the sun, and when theyburn up, all that's left is the hot core of the star. This hot core is yet another kind of dwarf star.\n\n\"The star shrinks to something the size of the planet Earth,\" says Holberg. There is no more fuel to burn, but the star is so hot that it blazes as it cools down. Over billions of years, he says, the heat leaks out. \"Because the star is so small, it's like pushing all the water at a dam through a small hole.\"\n\nHolberg says that nearly all the stars in our galaxy \u2014 about 97 percent \u2014 are destined to become white dwarfs. Even among dwarfs, white dwarfs go against expectations. Oddly, the smallest white dwarfs actually have the most mass, and the largest white dwarfs have the least. So the more mass, the smaller the dwarf. For comparison, imagine that you had a magic balloon that deflatedas you blew into it. When a white dwarf cools down, it becomes a black dwarf, a dense, cold object in the sky that astronomers have never seen.\n\nMukremin Kilic, who started studying astronomy after watching a solar eclipse, says that white dwarfs can help scientists determine the age of one part of the galaxy. But there's an even more exciting reason to study these stars, says Kilic, at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. He is most interested in studying the planets that orbit white dwarfs because, he says, these planets might help scientists figure out how Earth will end.\n\nAt the end of its life, the sun will become a white dwarf. But before this happens, the sun will expand, like a balloon of fire, into its red giant phase. \"The sun will become a giant one day and swallow planets,\" he says. \"What's going to survive?\"\n\nAs a giant, the sun will absorb and disintegrate the closest planet, Mercury. Then, as the sun gets bigger, it will absorb our nearest neighbor, the planet Venus. Bye-bye, Venus. But astronomers aren't sure what happens then \u2014 will the sun finally destroy Earth before becoming a small white dwarf?\n\nDon't worry, says Holberg, we've got plenty of time to figure that out: \"The sun won't go through this phase for another 5 billion years or so.\"\n\nA recent study suggests that some children may be able to beat back their allergic reactions to peanuts by gradually introducing trace amounts of the nut into their diets.\n\nScott Bauer\/USDA-ARS\n\nPeanut allergies are among the most common and most dangerous food allergies. A tiny exposure to peanuts can mean big trouble for a person with a peanut allergy, with symptoms ranging from sneezing or coughing to the constriction, or narrowing, of airways. Some people die from the exposure.\n\nBut a tiny exposure may help scientists find a cure. A recent study suggests that some children may be able to beat back their allergic reactions to peanuts by gradually introducing trace amounts of the nut into their diets. It's too early to say for certain, so if you have a peanut allergy, do not try this at home. But the first results look promising.\n\nTwo teams of scientists have been experimenting on a group of 29 children, with an average age five years old, who are allergic to peanuts. At the beginning of the study, each kid received less than 1\/1,000th of a peanut per day. (Imagine splitting a peanut into 1,000 parts!) Over the course of the study, the children gradually increased the amount of peanuts in their diets. At home, their parents sprinkled peanut powder on their food, and in the laboratory, the children drank solutions with peanuts dissolved inside.\n\nNine of the children have been receiving the treatment for two years. Five of those nine now appear to be free of their peanut allergies, says Wesley Burks, a pediatric allergist and immunologist at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C. These five kids can eat peanuts with no problem. \"They are putting peanuts in their diet,\" Burks says.\n\nOf those nine, the other four have not benefited as much from the therapy. Burks and his team will release data from the other 20 children in the study later this year.\n\nThe two teams of scientists are now doing a follow-up study on two groups of children with the allergy. Children in one group will receive the gradual peanut therapy, and the others will not. Burks and the other researchers hope this study will help them learn if the therapy truly works or not.\n\nThe study raises many questions, both from parents of children with the allergies and from other doctors. Scott Sicherer, an allergist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, asks, \"Have we really cured the allergy, or are [the patients] just desensitized while they are getting the treatment?\"\n\nScientists don't understand why some people get peanut allergies and others don't, but they're scrambling to find a way to help people with the allergy.

Known as the Magellanic Stream, it's more than 200,000 light-years long.\n\nThe stream comes from the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds -- two fairly small galaxies that appear to be orbiting the Milky Way. The stream was discovered decades ago. And a recent study by astronomers at the University of Virginia has filled in some holes.\n\nEarlier studies indicated that there were gaps in the stream. But the Virginia astronomers found that the stream is unbroken from the Magellanic Clouds all the way to the Milky Way. They filled in the gaps by staring at that region of space for a total of about four days with the giant Green Bank radio telescope in West Virginia, then adding observations made with other telescopes.\n\nThe astronomers suggest that the stream was born when the two small galaxies passed quite close to each other about two and a half billion years ago. The encounter caused big clouds of gas and dust in each galaxy to ram together and give birth to new stars.\n\nThe hottest and heaviest of these stars produced powerful \"winds\" that blew gas away from the small galaxies. These stars later exploded as supernovae, adding more energy to the stream. The Milky Way's strong gravity pulled on the stream of gas, creating the bridge that exists today -- a bridge between galaxies"}

{"text":"Post navigation\n\nMeasuring black hole mass using molecular gases\n\nBBC: To estimate the mass of a black hole, astronomers look at the movement of the stars or plasma around it. But the method is time-consuming and inaccurate because of the random motions of the bodies being measured. Timothy Davis of the European Southern Observatory and his colleagues have developed a new technique that uses images of microwave radiation emitted by cold clouds of carbon monoxide gas. Because the gas is cold, the random, thermal motions are less vigorous, resulting in less blurring of the images. And because the images are in the microwave part of the spectrum, they are at higher resolution than previous measurements in the radio. Davis's team used California's Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy to map the movements of particles at various distances from a black hole in NGC 4526. The researchers calculated the black hole to have a mass 450 million times the mass of our sun. Davis believes that the next generation of microwave telescopes will provide even clearer measurements and will significantly reduce the time it takes to make similar calculations."}
{"text":"Finding the smallest and the largest stars in the galaxy has been one of the greatest challenge astronomers have faced. According to the latest observations, the smallest star found is the RG0050-2722. it is about one fourth the sun's diameter, and 2.5 times the diameter of Jupiter as shown in the diagram given below. If this star was to be placed at the centre of the solar system, it would shine about as brightly as the full moon.\n\nThere are many stars that are smaller than RG0050-2722 but these are not ordinarily stars. Some are white dwarfs, which are of the size of mars. Others are neutron stars, which are only a few kilometers across. Neutron stars are so dense that a pinhead of their material would weigh about a million tones. The small stars glow for thousands of millions of years.\n\nWhen we look at the sky with very powerful telescopes, even the largest stars look like tiny points of light since they are very far away from us. One of the largest stars found is Betelgeuse, the bright reddish star in Orion. The size of this star has been compared with the orbits of the inner planets.\n\nThis star is 15 to 20 times more massive than the sun. a shell of dust surrounds it. This star is receding from us at a speed of 10 kilometers per second. Other very big stars are Antares in Scorpio and Alpha Herculis in the constellation Hercules.

The astronomers are studying the galaxy with an instrument that's designed to look for dark energy. One of the things they're considering is dark matter. And one of the goals is to \"weigh\" one of the greatest darknesses in the universe: a supermassive black hole.\n\nThe subject is M87, a galaxy that's about 60 million light-years away. It's many times larger and more massive than our own galaxy, the Milky Way.\n\nA black hole sits in the center of the galaxy. Most estimates say it's about three billion times as massive as the Sun. Those estimates are based in part on the motions of stars around the galaxy's center.\n\nBut galaxies consist of more than just stars. In fact, most of their mass consists of dark matter -- matter that we can't see, but that exerts a gravitational pull on the visible matter around it.\n\nTexas astronomer Karl Gebhardt recalculated the mass of the black hole by including the galaxy's dark matter. The results showed that the black hole is more than twice as massive as previously thought -- about seven billion times the mass of the Sun.\n\nNow, Gebhardt and others are studying M87 with an instrument that's designed to look for dark energy.

{"text":"If Map 13 contains the realm of the galaxies, then this one encompasses the realm of globular clusters. Our Milky Way contains roughly 200 globular clusters, and a third of them can be found in just 3 of the 88 constellations: Scorpius, Sagittarius, and Ophiuchus. (Ophiuchus occupies a large part of Map 15. Find Scorpius and Sagittarius on Map 20.) But this region contains more than just globulars.\n\nBecause the Milky Way passes through Sagitta, Aquila, Scutum, Serpens, and part of Ophiuchus, open clusters and nebulae abound here. You won't find many galaxies, however. The reason is the composition of the Milky Way itself. In addition to stars, immense, diffuse gas clouds and dust permeate our galaxy's spiral arms (which we see at night as the Milky Way). This material blocks out light from more distant stars and galaxies. The drop-off in numbers of observable galaxies is so extreme that early 20th-century astronomers referred to this area as the Zone of Avoidance.\n\nIn Sagitta, find globular cluster M71 midway between Gamma and Delta Sagittae. This 8th-magnitude cluster looks irregular at low power because of foreground stars. Through a 6-inch scope, you can resolve a couple dozen stars, and the view doesn't improve much through a 12-inch \u2014 only 50 stars are visible within a 4' area.\n\nBelow Sagitta, Aquila provides an opportunity to view an easily recognized dark nebula. About 1\u00b0 west of Gamma Aquilae lies a complex of dark nebulae known as Barnard's E. Dark nebulae are not voids, as was once believed, but rather clouds of dust and cold gas that block out light from more distant stars. American astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard cataloged hundreds of these objects strewn across the bright background of the Milky Way.\n\nUse a low-power eyepiece to see Barnard 143, which forms a prominent C shape roughly 20' long oriented east-west. Just to the south lies Barnard 142, a \u00bd\u00b0-long stretch of dark nebulosity. Together, these two form the E, which stands out well because the background is crowded with faint stars.\n\nNot quite 4\u00b0 north-northwest of Delta Aquilae lies planetary nebula NGC 6781. Through an 8-inch telescope, this magnitude 11.4 object spans more than 1.5' and stands out well against a star-filled background. For best results, use a nebula filter, and look for NGC 6781's irregularly illuminated outer edge.\n\nNow look a bit more than 4\u00b0 southwest of Delta Aquilae for globular cluster NGC 6760. Glowing at magnitude 9.1, NGC 6760 is a concentrated globular cluster easily spotted through a 3-inch scope. Even a 12-inch telescope doesn't resolve more than a handful of the globular's stars, but this size scope does show the cluster as mottled. Southwest of Aquila lies the small constellation Scutum the Shield.\n\nAquila contains 6 times more area than Scutum, but Aquila contains no Messier objects, and Scutum has two.\n\nNearly 2\u00b0 southeast of Beta Scuti lies the Wild Duck Cluster (M11). This magnificent open cluster measures about 12' across and shines at magnitude 5.3, making it visible to your naked eyes from a dark site. M11 acquired its odd name when 19th-century observer William Henry Smyth wrote that it resembled a flock of wild ducks in flight. Smyth was referring to the cluster's triangular shape. Through a 6-inch telescope, you'll see more than 100 stars, many of them packed into the dense core. The brightest star shines at 8th magnitude and lies near M11's center.\n\nM26 is Scutum's other Messier object. M26 is also an open cluster, but fainter (magnitude 8.0) and looser than M11. An 8-inch scope reveals 25 stars within a 10' area.\n\nThe lone galaxy of note on Map 14 \u2014 Barnard's Galaxy (NGC 6822) \u2014 is also a challenge to see. The galaxy's magnitude of 8.8 is misleading because the light is spread out over an area 19' by 15'. Not many bright stars reside near NGC 6822. This object lies more than 6\u00b0 northeast of Rho1 Sagittarii. Use low power under a dark sky, and look for a roughly rectangular haze slightly brighter than the background.\n\nFor example, compare M10 and M12. Move from one to another and back again. View them at low power against a wide background. Then, view them at as high a magnification as conditions allow. By noting the similarities and differences, you'll become a better observer"}

{"text":"Newly Born Twin Stars are Far From Identical News story originally written on June 18, 2008\n\nAstronomers have always thought that twin stars, which are stars that have the same mass and orbit around each other, are identical.

These stars actually have major differences in their brightness, surface temperature, and possibly even their size.\n\nThe newly formed twin stars are about 1 million years old.

{"text":"All posts tagged 'Animals'Meet the newly named Manatee nebula. Officially known as W50, this cloud of gas and dust is the remnant of a supernova explosion that happened 10,000 years ago in the constellation Aquila.\n\nThis image, released and renamed by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory on Jan. 19 to coincide with the Florida Manatee Festival, bears witness to the correspondence that heavenly phenomena sometimes have for more familiar things on Earth. Both the NRAO staff and members of the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge, home to many endangered West Indian manatees, hope to draw attention to the 40th anniversary of the Endangered Species Act with the release. The nebula joins the ranks of other nebulas named for animals, such as the Eagle nebula, Crab nebula, and Horsehead nebula.\n\nBut that's not all. According to a press release from both organizations, manatees have a lot in common with the Manatee nebula, including the fact that:\n\nThe cloud is the remnant of a star that is impossible to spot with a common telescope; you need a telescope that can detect the low-energy radio wave light radiated by the nebula's gases. Manatees can be hard to see in murky shallow waters. Spotters detect their presence by air bubbles and wakes.\n\nThe nebula bears arc-like scars carved into it by particles blasted from the jets of the exploded star's remnant, a black hole, at its center. The scars bring to mind the scars many manatees bear from boat propellers that have gotten too close.\n\nThe nebula took more than 10,000 years to assume its manatee-like shape. Manatees also have a long gestation and infancy period \u2013 well, at least compared to other earthly creatures. Gestation lasts 12 to 14 months and infancy, two to five years.\n\nRight.\n\nStill, that got us thinking: Just how much do all those other nebulas actually resemble their biological namesakes? In this gallery, we take a side-by-side comparison of animal-shaped nebula and their animal doppelgangers. Please let us know which ones are most (or least) deserving of their titles and whether you can think of a better alternative in the comments.\n\nAbove:\n\nManatee Nebula\n\nWe have to admit that the Manatee nebula is a pretty close twin to this happy-looking manatee.\n\nIt's always fascinating to me to see how seriously other parts of the world take the issue of antibiotic use in agriculture, given the long struggle in the United States to get the Food and Drug Administration to act and to get legislation through Congress. The European Parliament has voted down any prophylactic antibiotic use, and China has banned growth promoters.\n\nAnd last week, the UK Parliament examined the issue for the first time in more than a decade, in a long debate that featured some stinging language by members of Parliament and, it must be said, some inadequate responses by a government agency time in milk in England. (And therefore probably in cows, or at least on farms.)\n\nApparently there has been an ongoing study looking for any evidence of MRSA in UK cows, possibly because of this news from last year (of which more in a minute). Between last January and July, the program tested 1,500 samples of milk from farms' bulk tanks \u2014 that's the cooler in which milk from a number of cows is collected until it can be picked up by a truck for processing \u2014 and found seven of the samples were contaminated by MRSA. All seven isolates were MRSA ST398, the livestock-associated strain. Three came from one farm, so five farms had MRSA in their tanks. According to the paper, this is the first discovery of ST398 in the UK other than one finding in horses in 2009.\n\nIn the summer of 1997, I was a newspaper reporter covering the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and I heard from a contact at the CDC that a team was headed to Hong Kong to check out an odd case. A 3-year-old boy had died of flu. That was sad, but not notable enough on its own to send premier disease detectives rocketing around the world. What was extraordinary about the boy's death was its cause: a strain of flu known as H5N1 that had never been seen in humans before, though it was common in birds and had recently killed 4,500 chickens on a Hong Kong farm. By the end of that year, 17 other Hong Kong residents would become infected, five others would die, and to shut down the epidemic, Hong Kong would slaughter every chicken in the territory, 1.4 million of them.\n\nThat worked, for a while. But in 2003, H5N1 appeared again. Since then, it has sickened 607 people around the world, killing more than half of them. It has done something else too. H5N1 and the 2009 H1N1 \"swine flu\" \u2014 a much larger epidemic whose toll of illness and death was recently revised sharply upward \u2014 introduced to many people the idea that diseases could jump from animals to humans, and be much more dangerous to their new human hosts than to the animals they came from.\n\nDiseases that jump in that manner are called \"zoonoses,\" and because their effect can be so dramatic, they are the subject of major international tracking projects, not to mention cultural fascination. (For just one example, watch last year's movie Contagion.) But a new book, \"Zoobiquity: What Animals Can Teach Us About Health and the Science of Healing\" (Knopf) argues that by viewing animals only as a source of infection, we miss a rich range of illnesses that we have in common with other species and that could broaden our understanding of what affects our health and theirs."}

{"text":"New Hubble Deep Field Images 'Wow' Just About Everyone\n\nThe venerable Hubble Space Telescope just continues to amaze nearly everyone, from the most amateur of astronomers to highly-regarded astrophysicists, and certainly the general public as the following image demonstrates.\n\nTaken from just a fraction of space far smaller than the diameter of a full moon, (which you should ponder next time you look into the night sky,) the eXtreme Deep Field or XDF contains about 5500 galaxies and is one of the deepest images ever taken of the universe. Check out the following video below for a visual representation of the XDF.\n\nOne of the most astounding facts is that these images aren't new\u2013 they were taken between 2003 and 2004, which gives us insight into how much data Hubble has managed to collect and how much further we have to go in compiling it all.\n\nThis leads us, once again, to Carolin Crawford of Gresham College, who explains why examining stars and star dust is essential to understanding how the universe continues to form and evolve."}

{"text":"First 'bone' of the Milky Way identified\n\nJan 08, 2013\n\nResearchers have identified the first \"bone\" of the Milky Way - a long tendril of dust and gas that appears dark in this infrared image from the Spitzer Space Telescope. Running horizontally along this image, the \"bone\" is more than 300 light-years long but only 1 or 2 light-years wide. It contains about 100,000 suns' worth of material. Credit: NASA\/JPL\/SSC the inside, its exact structure is difficult to determine.\n\nAstronomers have identified a new structure in the Milky Way: a long tendril of dust and gas that they are calling a \"bone.\"\n\n\"This is the first time we've seen such a delicate piece of the galactic skeleton,\" says lead author Alyssa Goodman of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA). Goodman presented the discovery today in a press conference at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Long Beach, Calif.\n\nOtherGoodman and her colleagues spotted the galactic bone while studying a dust cloud nicknamed \"Nessie.\" The central part of the \"Nessie\" bone was discovered in Spitzer Space Telescope data in 2010 by James Jackson (Boston University), who named it after the Loch Ness Monster. Goodman's team noticed that Nessie appears at least twice, and possibly as much as eight times, longer than Jackson's original claim.\n\nRadio emissions from molecular gas show that the feature is not a chance projection of material on the sky, but instead a real feature. Not only is \"Nessie\" in the galactic plane, but also it extends much longer than anyone anticipated. This slender bone of the Milky Way is more than 300 light-years long but only 1 or 2 light-years wide. It contains about 100,000 suns' worth of material, and now looks more like a cosmic snake.\n\n\"This bone is much more like a fibula - the long skinny bone in your leg - than it is like the tibia, or big thick leg bone,\" explains Goodman.\n\n\"It's possible that the 'Nessie' bone lies within a spiral arm, or that it is part of a web connecting bolder spiral features. Our hope is that we and other astronomers will find more of these features, and use them to map the skeleton of the Milky Way in 3-D,\" she adds.Actually I am not 'up' on this moder astro terminology. Is it called a 'bone' because it has an epiphysis\/metaphysis structure at the end points? Oh I get it! Is it close to Canis Major and Sirius? All sound a bit 'Humerus' to me.\n\nComputer simulations of galaxy formation show webs of filaments within spiral disks. It is very likely that the newly discovered Milky Way feature is one of these \"bone-like\" filaments.\n\nUnfortunately, the simulations are based on a theorectical model with very little basis in reality. No one has any experience of the formation of any galaxy since no one was around to record how any galaxy came into existence. Therefore, the model used here is based on pure speculation of how galaxies MIGHT have formed. One tiny little problem, for instance, would be how to account for the existence of galactic magnetic fields.\n\nHow did that arise, given the inability of the currently accepted model to account for just that small, insignificant thorn in the flesh?\n\nNever mind the other small thorn of how the first star came into being in the first place, all by itself"}

This high school student has been working with Dr. Richard Rothschild of the University of California, San Diego to learn more about exploded stars called supernovae.\n\nFor his project, Harish studied a supernova remnant called Cassiopeia A. He looked at gamma rays emitted by radioactive titanium from Cassiopeia A with the help of data collected by a NASA spacecraft called RXTE.\n\nHarish's conclusion is that the supernova produced a huge amount of radioactive titanium, about 40 times the mass of Earth. He presented this project and won many awards at the San Diego Science Fair and the Intel International Science and Technology Fair.\n\nYou may wonder how a kid on Earth got started making discoveries about supernovae. \"I'm very passionate about studying the universe,\" said Harish, who spent last summer searching for people who could help him follow his interest. \"I knocked on the doors of scientists at the Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences (CASS) at the University of California, San Diego, to ask if anyone would be kind enough to let me work in his or her laboratory,\" describes Harish.

The majority of stars in the universe are main sequence stars, including our Sun, and spend the majority of their lives in this stage.

Relics are mostly found at the periphery of galaxy clusters and appear to have magnetic fields at the microGauss level. Here we investigate the possible origins of these magnetic fields. Turbulence produced by the shock itself cannot explain the magnitude of these fields. However, we argue that if the turbulent pressure support in the ICM upstream of the merger shock is of the order of 10 to 30 percent of the total pressure on scales of a few times 100 kpc, then vorticity generated by compressive and baroclinic effects across the shock discontinuity can lead to a sufficient amplification of the magnetic field. Compressional amplification can explain the large polarisation of the radio emission more easily than dynamo turbulent amplification. Finally, clumping of the ICM is shown to have a negligible effect on magnetic field amplification"}

The business end of the camera is a set of 62 charged-coupled devices (CCDs), yielding images of 570 megapixels.

Over the next 5 years, DECam will image approximately 1\/8 of the entire sky as part of the Dark Energy Survey (DES), taking high-resolution pictures of roughly 300 million galaxies.

Tanaka\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Astron.\n\n\"Matter is not distributed uniformly in the Universe,\" says Masayuki Tanaka from ESO, who led the new study. \"In our cosmic vicinity, stars form in galaxies and galaxies usually form groups and clusters of galaxies. The most widely accepted cosmological theories predict that matter also clumps on a larger scale in the so-called 'cosmic web', in which galaxies, embedded in filaments stretching between voids, create a gigantic wispy structure.\"\n\nThese filaments are millions of light years long and constitute the skeleton of the Universe: galaxies gather around them, and immense galaxy clusters form at their intersections, lurking like giant spiders waiting for more matter to digest. Scientists are struggling to determine how they swirl into existence. Although massive filamentary structures have been often observed at relatively small distances from us, solid proof of their existence in the more distant Universe has been lacking until now.\n\nThe team led by Tanaka discovered a large structure around a distant cluster of galaxies in images they obtained earlier. They have now used two major ground-based telescopes to study this structure in greater detail, measuring the distances from Earth of over 150 galaxies, and, hence, obtaining a three-dimensional view of the structure. The spectroscopic observations were performed using the VIMOS instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope and FOCAS on the Subaru Telescope, operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.\n\nThis image, obtained with the Subaru Telescope, operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan was used by a team of astronomers, led by Masayuki Tanaka from the European Southern Observatory (ESO), to uncover a gigantic, previously unknown assembly of galaxies located almost seven billion light-years away from us. This structure was confirmed by further observations made using ESO's Very Large Telescope and Subaru. It is the first observation of such a prominent galaxy structure in the distant Universe, providing further insight into the cosmic web and how it formed. The galaxies located in the newly discovered structure are shown in red. Galaxies that are either in front or behind the structure are shown in blue.

Tanaka\n\nThanks to these and other observations, the astronomers were able to make a real demographic study of this structure, and have identified several groups of galaxies surrounding the main galaxy cluster. They could distinguish tens of such clumps, each typically ten times as massive as our own Milky Way galaxy \u2014and some as much as a thousand times more massive \u2014 while they estimate that the mass of the cluster amounts to at least ten thousand times the mass of the Milky Way. Some of the clumps are feeling the fatal gravitational pull of the cluster, and will eventually fall into it.\n\n\"This is the first time that we have observed such a rich and prominent structure in the distant Universe,\" says Tanaka. \"We can now move from demography to sociology and study how the properties of galaxies depend on their environment, at a time when the Universe was only two thirds of its present age.\"\n\nThe filament is located about 6.7 billion light-years away from us and extends over at least 60 million light-years. The newly uncovered structure does probably extend further, beyond the field probed by the team, and hence future observations have already been planned to obtain a definite measure of its size.\n\nMore information: \u2022 This research was presented in a paper published as a letter in the Astronomy & Astrophysics Journal: 'The spectroscopically confirmed huge cosmic structure at z = 0.55', by Tanaka et al.  \u2022 A first glimpse of the very early universal web, obtained with much less galaxies than here, is presented in ESO 11\/01.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nUsing massive clusters of galaxies as \"cosmic telescopes,\" a research team led by a Johns Hopkins University astronomer has found what may be infant galaxies born in the first billion years after the beginning ...\n\nHow do galaxies form? The most widely accepted answer to this fundamental question is the model of 'hierarchical formation', a step-wise process in which small galaxies merge to build larger ones.

Galaxies do appear to form on the 'surface' of large, bubble-like structures and gather into filaments and clusters at the confluence of two (or more) bubbles. A few galaxies show up in isolated 'void' regions within the bubble-like structures. But most galaxies reside on the 'surface' and confluences of these bubbles. Supercomputer simulations of cosmic structure also show similar 'bubbles', 'voids', and 'filaments'.\n\n\"Scientists are struggling to determine how they swirl into existence. Although massive filamentary structures have been often observed at relatively small distances from us, solid proof of their existence in the more distant Universe has been lacking until now.\"\n\nThe Bennett Pinch law also allows for the formation of filaments as well as accounts for plasma interactions. It would easily explain the structure of the universe from known experimental principles. It would actually be better than gravity because it also explains magnetic fields and their preferential alignment within filament structures.\n\nHow much more matter do we have to find before die-hard dark matter fans start to question that theory...\n\nMatter found 7 billion light years away does not explain why the Milky-way and other galaxies in our neighborhood are spinning much faster than what they are supposed to based on the amount of stars and gas in those galaxies.\n\nBut if we didn't notice enormous structures at that distance, isn't it reasonable to believe that we missed smaller ones in our own galaxy? There's so much matter in our galaxy alone, I find it hard to believe that we have a perfect understanding of exactly how much there is.\n\nI'm certainly not trying to disprove dark matter\/energy, just hoping for more open mindedness on the limitations of what we \"know\""}

The team then plotted all the spectra together. \"Boom \u2014 it was a perfect match,\" he recalled.\n\nThe astronomers soon determined that shifting the spectrum of SCP 06F6 similarly aligned it with the others. In the end, it turned out that all six supernovae are siblings, and that they all have spectra that are very blue \u2014 with the brightest wavelengths shining in the ultraviolet.\n\nAccording to Quimby, the two mysterious supernovae \u2014 2005ap and SCP 06F6 \u2014 had looked different from one another because 2005ap was 3 billion light-years away while SCP 06F6 was 8 billion light-years away.

What the researchers do know about them is that they are bright and hot \u2014 10,000 to 20,000 kelvins; that they are expanding rapidly at 6,000 miles per second (10,000 km\/s); that they lack hydrogen; and that they take about 50 days to fade away \u2014 much Sun to 400 \u2014 which would have remained undetected if it weren't for the supernova.\n\nThese supernovae could also reveal what ancient stars might have been like because they most likely originate from stars around a hundred times more massive than the Sun \u2014 stars that would have been very similar to the first stars in the universe.\n\n\"It is really amazing how rich the night sky continues to be,\" Kulkarni said. \"In addition to supernovae, the Palomar Transient Factory is making great advances in stellar astronomy as well.\"\n\nUser Comments\n\nBe the first to leave your comment below!\n\nOnly registered members of Astronomy.com are allowed to comment on this article.

{"text":"New Kind of Supernova Star Death Revealed\n\nby JR Minkel, SPACE.com Contributor\n\nDate: 19 May 2010 Time: 01:00 PM ET\n\nTwo faint supernovas unlike any star\nexplosions ever seen before may have exploded in the same way, or they may\ndiffer, but in either case are breaking down categories that distinguish one\ntype of stellar death from another.\n\nSupernovas\nare violent explosions that signal the death of stars, and scientists think\nsuch stars explode in two basic ways. Either the core of a star at least eight\ntimes as massive as our sun collapses violently and ejects the its outer\nenvelope, or a small and aged white dwarf star sucks in material from a nearby companion\nuntil it grows too massive and explodes.\n\nBut at least one of two newfound supernovas\nappears to have broken those molds.\n\nA partial explosion\n\nOne of the supernovas in question is SN 2005E.\nIt is unusually faint and quickly fading, but also has properties commonly\nassociated with the supernova core collapse method, such as a lack of hydrogen\nand silicon in its light spectrum. Such supernovas, called Type 1b, are thought\nto result from collapse\nof a star that has lost its hydrogen envelope.\n\nHowever, SN 2005E occurred in the halo of an\nisolated galaxy known as NGC 1032, which no longer supports star formation.\nOutside of star forming galaxies, stars generally don't get massive enough to\nsupport core collapse.\n\n\"We didn't find any trace of star\nformation,\" said study researcher Hagai Perets of the Harvard University\nCenter for Astrophysics. \"That's the basic strange thing about this\nsupernova.\"\n\nPerets and his colleagues argue that SN 2005E\nmust have occurred when a white dwarf star accreted helium-rich material from a\nnearby star and then partially exploded, as some models indicate is possible.\nBurning of helium would explain why 2005E was extremely rich in calcium \u2014\nsomething that isn't normally seen in type 1b supernovas.\n\nThe researchers estimate that 2005E ejected\nabout a third of a solar mass when it exploded, which is much less than supernovas\nof either the core collapse or regular white dwarf variety. Nearly half of that\nmaterial was calcium.\n\nCurrent models can't explain all the unusual\nfeatures of the supernova, but Perets told SPACE.com that if partial explosions\nof white dwarf stars do happen, they might explain a number of puzzling\nfacts in astronomy, such as why some stars and intergalactic dust are so\nrich in calcium and possibly even mysterious gamma rays that researchers have\nproposed might be coming from dark matter.\n\nSupernova oddity\n\nThe second newly found supernova, SN 2005cz,\nwas also relatively faint and rich in calcium for a type 1b.\n\nBut based on the pattern of light it emitted,\nJapanese researchers argue that it must have resulted from core collapse in the\nconventional way. They propose that a star of 10 to 12 times as massive of the\nsun lost its hydrogen envelope to a binary partner before\nexploding.\n\nAccording to the researchers, modeling\nindicates that such a low-mass star would produce the right ratio of calcium to\noxygen seen in the supernova.\n\n\"We can explain [it] in the context of\ntraditional core-collapse scenario,\" said Koji Kawabata of Hiroshima\nAstrophysical Science Center.\n\nA possible problem with this interpretation\nis that 2005cz occurred in an elliptical galaxy, NGC 4589, where stars of\nsufficient mass for core collapse would normally be rare. The researchers cite\nevidence that the galaxy shows signs of recent star formation.\n\nPerets said he and his colleagues found no\nevidence of star formation near 2005cz. He said the supernova is most likely\nanother partially exploded white dwarf, like 2005E.\n\nBolstering their argument, Perets and his\ncolleagues identified a total of eight supernovas that match the general\nproperties of 2005E, including faintness and high calcium content, and 2005cz\nis one of them.\n\n\"I would be surprised if '05cz turned\nout to be core collapse because of the statistical distribution of the class of\neight,\" says David Branch, an astrophysicist at the University of Oklahoma\nin Norman, who was not involved in either study.\n\nBranch says the white\ndwarf explanation is probably on the right track.\n\n\"We can't really sort this out right\nnow,\" he said. \"The main thing is it will stimulate observational and\nmodeling advances, because people will want to get to the bottom of this.\""}

{"text":"Dark energy 'imaged' in best detail yet\n\nSome had hoped it might be just an illusion. But it looks like dark energy is real and here to stay, as astronomers \"image\" the mysterious entity in action.\n\nIn 1998, astronomers found that distant supernovae were dimmer, and thus farther away, than expected. This suggested that the expansion of the universe is accelerating - and \"dark energy\" was named as the culprit.\n\nTo find an independent check on the existence of dark energy, Istv\u00e1n Szapudi at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, US, and colleagues turned to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) - relic radiation from the big bang. Detailed maps of the CMB show hot and cold spots that reflect variations in the density of the early universe.\n\nWhen dark energy was proposed, astronomers realised that it should create additional temperature bumps on the map.\n\nThis extra dark energy effect is generated because the temperature of a photon zipping across the universe can be changed depending on whether it has passed through a region of dense matter or a sparser region.\n\nShallow well\n\nA photon gains energy when it enters a dense region with enhanced gravity - such as a galaxy cluster - as though it is falling into a well. When it leaves the cluster and climbs back out of the gravitational well, it loses energy.\n\nIn a universe without dark energy, the energy gained and lost during the crossing would be equal and would cancel out. But in the presence of dark energy, the universe expands quickly enough to stretch the gravitational well while the photon is still inside. This makes the well shallower and easier for the photon to climb out.\n\nThat means that a photon travelling through a cluster gains more energy than it loses, giving it a little energy kick so that it creates a hotter spot than would be expected on images of the CMB. Similarly, a photon that has passed through a void would leave a cold spot.\n\nIt's tough to detect this effect because dark energy gives only a slight nudge to the temperature, which is easily swamped by the normal temperature variations seen in the CMB, says Szapudi.\n\nExtreme density\n\nTo get around this, his team looked at regions of extremely high and extremely low density, where you would expect to see the biggest effect.\n\nOther teams have reported signs of this effect in the past, but those have been open to alternative explanations, says Szapudi. By contrast, his calculations suggest that there is less than a 1 in 200,000 chance that the match up his team saw is down to anything other than dark energy.\n\n\"We have shown the imprint on the CMB of dark energy at work,\" says Szapudi. \"In this sense, we have imaged dark energy.\"\n\nThe finding should rule out any notion that dark energy is an illusion, he says. \"We've really attacked the dark energy question in a different way from supernovae measurements. It's difficult to argue that an illusion could be responsible for this effect.\"\n\nWarped space\n\nThomas Buchert at the University of Lyon in France, one of the physicists who suggested that dark energy may be an illusion, is impressed by the thoroughness of Szapudi's work. \"People have discussed this effect, but this is the first really clear-cut signal,\" he says.\n\nHowever, Buchert is not ready to abandon alternatives to dark energy just yet. He points out that a similar effect might be produced if space-time is significantly warped around the voids and clusters - something that isn't usually considered in standard calculations.\n\nHe also notes that Szapudi's team observed a temperature effect that was stronger than expected from dark energy. \"This could be a hint that there may be something else happening here that's worth investigatingTime Dilation\n\nSat May 24 06:06:30 BST 2008 by Charles\n\nIsn't this the same effect that is predicted by David Wiltshire? I.e. That time dilation caused by the mass distribution in clusters and voids will change the CMB photon energies and give the illusion of dark energy?\n\nUnless they can be distinguished, surely we should use Occam's razor and assume the explanation which postulates the least unknowns, i.e. Wiltshire's version, until more evidence comes in.\n\nDark Energy 'imaged' In Best Detail Yet\n\nSat May 24 17:14:52 BST 2008 by William Curry\n\nAstronomers have struggled to explain what dark energy actually is, and then explain that it should create additional temperature bumps on the map of the cosmic microwave background. If you do not know what something is, how can know what effect's it will have?\n\nDark Energy Or Aimless Agenda\n\nSat May 24 18:43:43 BST 2008 by Jason\n\nWhen are the masses going to wake up and demand that the 'old boys' club of scientific dogma worldwide STEP DOWN?\n\nOf course dark energy exists, Nikola Tesla discovered it about the same time he gave us all the electricity we know today. The fact that this debate still rages on PROVES without a doubt that a distracting, aimless agenda is at hand to keep us all dumb.\n\nSupervoids of empty space (blue) and superclusters of galaxies (red) were slightly cooler or warmer, respectively, than expected in maps of the cosmic microwave background because of dark energy (Illustration: Granett\/Neyrinck\/Szapudi\/NASA\/SDSS)"}
{"text":"A curious pair of galaxies\n\nThis color composite image of Arp 261 was created from images obtained using the FORS2 instrument on the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT), at the Paranal Observatory in Chile. Located in the mountains of the Atacama Desert, the Paranal Observatory enjoys some of the clearest and darkest skies on the whole planet. This image was created from images through blue, green, red and infrared filters, and the total exposure time was 45 minutes.\n\nPhoto by ESO\n\nMarch 16, 2009 The European Space Observatory's (ESO) Very Large Telescope (VLT) has taken the best image ever of a strange and chaotic duo of interwoven galaxies. The images also contain some surprises - interlopers both far and near.\n\nSometimes objects in the sky that appear strange, or different from normal, have a story to tell and prove rewarding scientifically. This was the idea behind Halton Arp's catalog of Peculiar Galaxies that appeared in the 1960s. One of the oddballs listed there is Arp 261, which has now been imaged in more detail than ever before using the FORS2 instrument on ESO's VLT. The image contains several surprises.\n\nArp 261 lies about 70 million light-years distant in the constellation Libra. Its chaotic and unusual structure is created by the interaction of two galaxies that are engaged in a slow motion, but highly disruptive close encounter. Although individual stars are unlikely to collide in such an event, the huge clouds of gas and dust crash into each other at high speed, leading to the formation of bright new clusters of hot stars that are seen in the picture. The paths of the existing stars in the galaxies are also disrupted, creating the faint swirls extending to the upper left and lower right of the image. Both interacting galaxies were probably dwarfs not unlike the Magellanic Clouds orbiting our own galaxy.\n\nThe images used to create this picture were not taken to study the interacting galaxies, but to investigate the properties of the inconspicuous object just to the right of the brightest part of Arp 261 and close to the center of the image. This is an unusual exploding star, called SN 1995N, that is thought to be the result of the final collapse of a massive star at the end of its life, a so-called core collapse supernova. SN 1995N is unusual because it has faded very slowly - and still shows clearly on this image more than 7 years after the explosion took place. It also is one of the few supernovae to have been observed to emit X rays. It is thought that these unusual characteristics are a result of the exploding star being in a dense region of space and that the material blasted from the supernova plows into it and creates X rays.\n\nApart from the interacting galaxy and its supernova, the image also contains several other objects at wildly different distances from us. Starting close to home, two small asteroids in our solar system between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter happened to cross the images as they were being taken and show up as the red-green-blue trails at the left and top of the picture. The trails arise as the objects are moving during the exposures and also between the exposures through different colored filters. The asteroid at the top is 14670 and the one to the left is 9735. They are probably less than 3 miles (5 kilometers) across. The reflected sunlight from these small bodies takes about 15 minutes to get to Earth.\n\nThe next closest object is probably the bright star at the bottom. It may look bright, but it is still about 100 times too faint to be seen with the unaided eye. It most likely is a Sun-like star and about 500 light-years from us - 20 million times farther away than the asteroids. Arp 261 and the supernova are about 140,000 times farther away than this star, but still in what astronomers would regard as our cosmic neighborhood. More distant still, perhaps some 50-100 times further away than Arp 261, lies the cluster of galaxies visible on the right of the picture. There is no doubt, however, that a more-remote object lies unrecognized among the faint background objects seen in this image."}

{"text":"What happens when galaxies collide?\n\nA typical galaxy has about 100 billion stars, which sounds like a lot, but they are also very big. A spiral galaxy, like ours, is 100,000 light-years across and 3000 light-years thick. That gives an average density of just one star for every 225,000 cubic light-years. So two galaxies colliding is like two swarms of bees colliding. Except that to get the scale right, there would be 6000 kilometers between each bee. If galaxies were just made of stars, they would slide through each other with hardly any interaction at all. But the space between the stars contains significant amounts of dust and gas. Gravitational effects and frictional heating distorts the shape of both galaxies as they pass and causes new stars to form. But the collision takes more than a million years"}
{"text":"Two Hawaii astronomers are part of a team that has unraveled one of the greatest mysteries of the universe: the source of most of the X-ray background.\n\nThe team found that a substantial number of galaxies have cores that shine brightly in X-rays, but not in visible light. \"They are just hidden galaxies,\" said Lennox Cowie of the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy.\n\nAlan Bunner, director of NASA's \"Structure and Evolution of the Universe\" science theme, said: \"Since it was first observed 37 years ago, understanding the source of the X-ray background has been a Holy Grail of X-ray astronomy. Now, it is within reach.\"\n\nChandra X-ray Observatory data analyzed by Cowie and Amy Barger, also of the Institute for Astronomy, led to discoveries presented yesterday at an American Astronomical Society meeting in Atlanta.\n\nPress release photo\nThis image of the Chandra X-ray Observatory was taken by astronaut\nCady Coleman following the observatory's deployment in July from\nthe space shuttle Columbia.

So the minute we knew the X-ray sources, we knew what the optical sources were.\"\n\nThe team determined that about 70 million sources -- mostly galaxies -- were sources for about 80 percent of the cosmic glow in the Hawaii field.\n\nCowie said it was \"somewhat of a shock\" to him that a substantial number of galaxies have cores that shine bright in X-rays but not in visible light.\n\nThe team reported that there may be tens of millions of these \"veiled galactic nuclei\" in the universe, saying, \"Each of these galaxies likely harbors a massive black hole at its core that produces X-rays as gas is pulled toward it at nearly the speed of light.\"\n\nMaterial and dust veil the galaxies and kill soft X-rays, but hard X-rays penetrate the shroud so the activity can be seen, Cowie said. \"These things look like normal galaxies, but they've got this stuff going on in the middle. They're normal galaxies with a twist, so to speak, that I hadn't expected at all.\"\n\nCowie said scientists were beginning to understand that most normal galaxies have fairly substantial black holes in the center, but it's been a question of why. \"Why isn't there more feeding and activity in these things in the local universe? Some people thought maybe there isn't enough gas to feed these things well. At least some are going on eating. They're just hiding it.\"\n\nThe astronomers also identified a second new class of objects, comprising about one-third of the sources, that they believe to be \"ultra-faint galaxies.\"\n\nMushotzky said the sources may emit little or no optical light, either because the dust around the galaxy blocks the light or because it is absorbed during its journey across the universe.\n\nIn the latter case, he said, these sources would be more than 14 billion light-years away--the earliest and most distant objects ever identified.\n\nCowie said resolving most of the X-ray background \"brings a level of closure and completeness to this.

{"text":"Science News\n\nOct. 16, 2005 \u2014 A new analysis that refutes challenges to the existence of dark\nmatter in certain galaxies appears in an article published this week in\nthe journal Nature. Leading author of the article is Avishai Dekel,\nprofessor of physics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nShare This:\n\nAccepted cosmological theory postulates that every observable galaxy\nin the universe (each made up of billions of stars similar to our sun)\nis embedded in a massive \"halo'' of dark matter. Though unseen, dark\nmatter can be clearly detected indirectly by observing its tremendous\ngravitational effects on visible objects.\n\nThis common understanding faced a severe challenge when a team of\nastronomers, writing in Science in 2003, reported a surprising absence\nof dark matter in one type of galaxy \u2013 \"elliptical'' (rounded)\ngalaxies. Their theory was based on observations that stars located at\ngreat distances from the center in such galaxies move at very slow\nspeeds, as opposed to the great speed one would have expected from the\nheavy gravitational pull exerted by dark matter.\n\nThe new analysis in Nature provides a simple explanation for these\nobservations. \"In fact,\" says Dekel, \"our analysis fits comfortably\nwith the standard picture in which elliptical galaxies also reside in\nmassive dark matter halos.\n\n''A dearth of dark matter in elliptical galaxies is especially\npuzzling in the context of the common theory of galaxy formation, which\nassumes that ellipticals originate from mergers of disk galaxies,''\nadded Dekel. ''Massive dark-matter halos are clearly detected in disk\ngalaxies, so where did they disappear to during the mergers?'' asks\nDekel.\n\nThe Nature article is based on simulations of galaxy mergers run on\na supercomputer by graduate student Thomas J. Cox, supervised by Joel\nPrimack, a professor of physics at the University of California, Santa\nCruz. The simulations were analyzed by Dekel and collaborators Felix\nStoehr and Gary Mamon at the Institute of Astrophysics in Paris, where\nDekel is the incumbent of the Blaise Pascal International Chair of\nResearch at the Ecole Normale Superieure.\n\nThe simulations show that the observations reported in Science are a\npredictable consequence of the violent collision and merger of the\nspiral galaxies that lead to the formation of the elliptical galaxies.\n\nEvidence for dark matter halos around spiral galaxies comes from\nstudying the circular motions of stars in these galaxies. Because most\nof the visible mass in a galaxy is concentrated in the central region,\nstars at great distances from the center would be expected to move more\nslowly than stars closer in. Instead, observations of spiral galaxies\nshow that the rotational speed of stars in the outskirts of the disk\nremains constant as far out as astronomers can measure it.\n\nThe reason for this, according to the dark matter theory, is the\npresence of an enormous halo of unseen dark matter in and around the\ngalaxy, which exerts its gravitational influence on the stars.\nAdditional support for dark matter halos has come from a variety of\nother observations.\n\nIn elliptical galaxies, however, it has been difficult to study the\nmotions of stars at great distances from the center. The scientists\nwriting in Science found a decrease in the velocities with increasing\ndistance from the center of the galaxy, which is inconsistent with\nsimple models of the gravitational effects of dark matter halos.\n\nPart of the explanation for that phenomenon, put forth in the new\nNature paper, lies in the fact that the velocities in the earlier study\nwere measured along the line of sight. ''You cannot measure the\nabsolute speeds of the stars, but you can measure their relative speeds\nalong the line of sight, because if a star is moving toward us its\nlight is shifted to shorter wave lengths, and if it is moving away from\nus its light is shifted to longer wave lengths,'' Primack explained.\n\nThis limitation would not be a problem if the orbits of the observed\nstars were randomly oriented with respect to the line of sight,\naccording to Cox's simulations, however, the stars in elliptical\ngalaxies that are farthest from the center are likely to be moving in\nelongated, eccentric orbits such that most of their motion is\nperpendicular to the line of sight. Therefore, they could be moving at\nhigh velocities without exhibiting much motion toward or away from the\nobservers.\n\nWhy this is so is traceable to the processes whereby disk galaxies\nmerge to form elliptical galaxies. ''In the merger process that\nproduces these galaxies, a lot of the stars get flung out to fairly\nlarge distances, and they end up in highly elongated orbits that take\nthem far away and then back in close to the center,'' explained Dekel.\n\n''If we see a star at a large distance from the center of the\ngalaxy, that star is going to be mostly moving either away from the\ncenter or back toward the center. Almost certainly, most of its motion\nis perpendicular to our line of sight,'' Dekel said. Under such\ncircumstances, the star would appear to be moving quite slowly, when in\nfact this is not the case, based upon the models of simulated galaxy\nmergers studied by the Hebrew University-UCSC-Paris team.\n\n''Our conclusion is that what the cosmologists described in 2003 is\nexactly what the dark matter model would predict,'' he said, \"Our\nfindings remove a problem which bothered them and make it possible to\nbetter understand the processes involved in creation of new galaxies in\nthe universe.\"\n\nRelated Stories"}

{"text":"Hot dust in galaxies\n\nGareth Wynn-Williams, University of Hawaii\n\nTo many astronomers interstellar dust is just a nuisance, since it hides many of the\nmost interesting regions of galaxies from our gaze. The infrared spectrum that is emitted\nby the interstellar matter in a galaxy, however, contains important clues about how the\ndust was heated. By examining such spectra we may be able to identify the energy sources\nthat lie deep inside molecular clouds or nuclear regions. Graduate student Chris Dudley and\nI have been measuring the 8 - 22 \u00c1m spectra of a number of galaxies using the CGS3\nspectrometer on UKIRT with a view to discovering how infrared galaxies of different types\nare powered.\n\nThe 12.8 \u00c1m emission line from singly\nionized helium. [NeII]. This spectrum line comes from gas that has been ionized by hot\nyoung stars.\n\nThe 8.6 \u00c1m and 11.3 \u00c1m PAH emission features. These are produced when polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbon molecules are heated by ultraviolet radiation in photo-dissociation\nregions in molecular clouds\n\nStrong emission from the long wavelength side of the 7.7 \u00c1m PAH emission feature (the\nshort wavelength side of the emission is cut off by the Earth's\natmosphere). The gray band\nshows the predicted strength of the 7.7 \u00c1m feature based on the more easily observed 11.3\n\u00c1m feature and a ratio of 7.7\/11.3 \u00c1m feature strengths found in parts of our Galaxy.\n\nContinuum emission from about 10 - 14 \u00c1m that can be fitted by a 145 K black body\n(solid line). At least part of this emission comes from dust heated by Lyman-alpha\nradiation from the ionized gas. This continuum emission continues to get stronger all the\nway to about 60 \u00c1m.\n\nA broad \"plateau\" of emission, probably also from PAH molecules, between 11.1\nand 12.9 \u00c1m. This is the first galaxy (apart from the Milky Way) that this feature has\nbeen seen.\n\nAll these types of emission are clues that the infrared radiation from NGC253 comes\nfrom a burst of star formation within the central 100 pc region.\n\nIRAS 08572+3915 is one of the most luminous\ngalaxies known, emitting about 2 x 1012 times the power of the Sun. Its 8 - 22 \u00c1m spectrum is quite unlike that of\nNGC 253 (above); there are no signs of the neon line nor any of the PAH emission features.\nThe spectrum is dominated by a very deep silicate absorption feature near 10 \u00c1m (rest\nwavelength) and a flat emission between 16 and 22 \u00c1m (the regions between 9 - 10 and 13 -\n16 \u00c1m are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.) A silicate absorption this deep would\ncorrespond to 75-90 mag if is were caused by a layer of cold dust in front of a star\nformation region. In our paper we present arguments against this interpretation and note\nthat the only other known objects that show such deep silicate absorption features are\ninfrared \"protostars\". In a \"protostar\" the silicate absorption\nfeature is formed as radiation is transported outwards from a central energy-generating\ncore through many layers of optically-thick dust. No external extinction is required.\n\nIn the second figure we compare\nthe measured infrared energy distributions of IRAS 08572+3915 and two other luminous\ninfrared galaxies with models that were initially calculated to explain the spectra of\ninfrared protostars. The models consist of a central compact source of power, surrounded\nby a spherical shell of dust whose density and temperature decrease away from the center.\nThe models have to be greatly scaled up to match the luminosity of these infrared\ngalaxies, but the agreement between model and data strongly suggests to us that the\ngeometry of a spherical protostar can be successfully applied to galaxies with deep\nsilicate absorption.\n\nWhen the scaling correction is applied we find that the central\nenergy source of IRAS 08572+3915 must be no more than 3 parsecs across. This small size\neffectively rules out the possibility that the power comes from a starburst. We conclude\nthat the only reasonable power source for these galaxies is some kind of obscured active\ngalaxy nucleus (AGN) such as an accretion disk around a massive black hole."}

{"text":"3. ARE STARBURSTS IMPORTANT?\n\nStarbursts are certainly fascinating, but how important are they? An\ninteresting way to frame the question is to ask: if we didn't know\nthat major starbursts existed from direct observations, would we have\ndifficulties explaining what we see in the universe? That is, are\nstarbursts a necessary inference from other phenomena? The\nanswer is an emphatic \"yes,\" and here is a tentative and incomplete\nlist of the essential fingerprints of starbursts based on issues\nraised in this conference:\n\nSuper star clusters: These very massive but compact\nsystems, ranging from very young clusters still in dust cocoons to classic\nglobular clusters, can evidently form only in a\nhigh pressure medium, with\nP \/ k ~ 108-9, over 104\u00d7\nhigher than normal for disk galaxies. This requires abnormal,\nnon-equilibrium conditions such as prevail in starbursts. Young SSC's\nare found to be mainly associated with interaction-induced starbursts.\n\nMassive bulges and E galaxies: The high stellar\ndensities found\nin the centers of nearby early type galaxies imply conversion of large\namounts of gas to stars at rates equivalent to the most extreme\nstarbursts known,\n~ 1000\nM\nyr-1, if only a single event\nwas involved. There is good statistical evidence that many, if not\nall, ETG's originate from gas-rich mergers, which are well known\nto produce violent starbursts. A few large mergers rather than a\nseries of minor mergers are favored. (The best direct evidence for\nbulge-producing starbursts at early times is probably the high\nredshift sub-mm sample - e.g. from SCUBA - with\nup to ~ 1000\nM yr-1.)\n\nCosmic mass deposition in stars: For a decade, we\nhave been able to estimate the conversion rate of gas into long-lived\nstellar mass at redshifts\nz 4. The\npresent-day mean mass density cannot\nby itself place very good constraints on the range of\nSFR\nsince over 13 Gyr have elapsed since the big bang (though, as noted\nabove, direct statistics on distant starburst progenitors can do so).\nHowever, recent deep probes to z ~ 2, such as GDDS, reveal that a\nconsiderable fraction of all stars then are in \"dead and red\"\nsystems comparable to local gE galaxies, with little star formation in\nthe preceding 1.5 Gyr. The data imply that massive galaxy assembly\nbegins early (zf 3-5) in dense\nregions and, since there is so\nlittle time for this to happen, massive starbursts with\n300 M\nyr-1 must be involved, possibly through gas-rich mergers.\n\nThe remaining items on the list involve superwinds\ngenerated by starbursts:\n\nChemical enrichment of the ICM and IGM: Although metal\nabundances at higher redshifts are generally lower than prevailing\nlocal values, much of the gas to the highest z's yet probed has been\nprocessed through stars. The primordial generations of stars\nresponsible can be explored only theoretically now, but it is clear\nthat the natural mechanism for dispersing new metals from the halos in\nwhich they form is a superwind.\n\nThe mass-metallicity relation in galaxies: The\ncorrelation\nbetween larger galaxy masses and higher metal abundances has been\nknown for about 40 years. Optical, UV, and IR observations are\ncurrently providing much better information on metallicites and dust\nabundances in both local and high-redshift samples.\nAgain, the natural explanation for the mass dependence is that starburst\nsuperwinds evacuate gas preferentially from lower mass systems.\n\nAbsence of super-supermassive black holes:\nSupermassive black\nholes (SMBH) are now thought to exist in all spheroidal systems, and\ntheir masses are linked to the surrounding stellar population. Their\ngrowth by gas accretion is self-limited to the Eddington rate.\nNonetheless, in the absence of another inhibiting mechanism, SMBH\nmasses would exponentiate with an e-folding time of about 100 Myr.\nStar formation in nuclei is often found associated with SMBH's,\nand it may be that starburst winds act to regulate SMBH\ngrowth in the same way they limit star formation itself.\n\nCosmic reionization: It is likely that massive\nstars, rather than AGN's, are responsible for cosmic re-ionization at\nredshifts\nz 7. But\nthe optical depth in typical nearby galaxies\nis such that only 3-10% of ionizing photons can escape. Superwinds\nin protogalaxies may be necessary to clear out channels for ionizing\nradiation."}

Ribbons of dust ripple through the galaxy, with significant fields of star formation noticeable in the center, center-left and top right (the brightest center-left region is called 30 Doradus, or the Tarantula Nebula, for its appearance in visible light).

{"text":"Astronomers Watch as Stars Are Born\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We are stardust, billion-year-old carbon,\" sang Joni Mitchell. Many artists have been inspired by the idea that since we are made of elements heavier than lithium, we are composed of atoms forged in stars, and any element heavier than iron must have been formed in a supernova. Supernovae are the death throes of stars and release tremendous amounts of energy, enough energy to bind lighter elements together, creating all the heavy elements like gold, platinum and uranium. Since Earth contains plenty of these elements, it has been assumed that the sun is not a first generation star and the solar system must have formed later in order to accumulate all the heavy elements we see on the earth.\n\nSupernovae may even play a more important role that previously thought. Besides providing precious metals, a supernova may have played an integral part in the creation of our sun.\n\nProf. Lee Hartman, astronomy, University of Michigan, spoke yesterday at the astronomy colloquium about a new, more fast-paced solar creation process. Supported by observational evidence from star forming regions across the galaxy and theoretical models back here on Earth, Hartman presented a plan of solar formation that explains some of the sore points in previous models.\n\nAlmost all models begin with a large cloud of hydrogen gas, which astronomers see throughout the galaxy. Gravity from the center of the cloud would pull on the edges and drag the cloud inward. Already there is a problem; if the cloud is allowed to shrink itself completely, it would form far too massive a star at the center. The star would be larger than anything seen in the galaxy today. One hypothesis says that magnetic fields create turbulence that \"fluff\" the gas, preventing all of it from falling inward.\n\nHartman disagreed with this hypothesis. The previous theory suggests that star formation occurs slowly and at speeds dictated by the magnetic turbulence rather than by the freefall associated with gravity. However, Hartman suggests that gravity was in charge and inside a large gas cloud the densest regions quickly begin falling inward immediately. Soon these regions are massive enough to be considered stars and begin fusing hydrogen at their cores.\n\nThe biggest stars are the first to go, dying because of their own giganticness. As they implode at the center, huge amounts of energy are given off as a supernova. This supernova pushes all the gas in the surrounding region outward in a giant bubble or column. These are often the most striking pictures seen by the Hubble and other telescopes. It is on the edge of these bubbles where gas again becomes dense enough to form stars, except now that the cloud has been spread out over a surface, it no longer will collapse into a single point but into many stars, one of which, we may call home."}

The massive stars and most of the small stars formed at the same time out of one dense cloud, while a process called triggered star formation later created other small stars. Intense radiation from massive stars ate away at the surrounding dusty cloud, triggering gas to expand and create shock waves that compressed nearby cold dust and gas into new stars. The red-orange filaments surrounding the center of the image show where this process occurred.\n\nBut a set of even younger small stars in the region, seen as a pinkish blob at the top of the image, couldn't be explained by this mechanism. Scientists wondered what caused this seemingly isolated group of stars to form.\n\nBy combining multi-wavelength data of NGC 346, Gouliermis says he and his team pinpointed the trigger as a very massive star that blasted apart in a supernova explosion about 50,000 years ago. According to the astronomers, this very massive star spurred the isolated young stars into existence before it died, but through a different type of triggered star formation than what occurred near the region's center. Fierce winds from the massive star, and not radiation, pushed dust and gas together, compressing it into new stars.\n\nThe finding demonstrates that both wind- and radiation-induced triggered star formation are at play in the same cloud. According to Gouliermis, \"The result shows us that star formation is a far more complicated process than we used to believe, comprising different competitive or collaborative mechanisms.\"\n\nThe new image also reveals a bubble, seen as a blue halo to the left, caused by the supernova explosion that happened 50,000 years ago. Further analysis shows that this bubble is located within a large expanding gaseous shell, possibly powered by the explosion and the winds of other bright stars in its vicinity."}

{"text":"1. HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION\n\nThe study of active galactic nuclei is one of the most rapidly growing\nsubjects in\npresent-day astrophysics. As the sites of the release of energy on the\nmost powerful\nsustained rates and compact scales we know, they clearly are of great\nintrinsic interest.\nAs the most luminous objects we know, they are the best markers we have of the\ndistant reaches of the universe. From both points of view, understanding\ntheir physical\nnature and structure, and thus how to use them to measure cosmological\ndistances\nand times are two of the most important aims of current astrophysical\nresearch. The\ngreatest difficulty in attempting to review work in this field is the\nhuge number of\npapers, covering so many different methods of research, that are being\npublished. An\nexcellent recent book on the subject is Quasar Astronomy by\nWeedman (1986).\n\nThe observational study of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) began with\nFath (1909),\nwho noted in a spectroscopic survey of the brightest spiral `nebulae'\nthat although most\nof them had absorption-line spectra, which he correctly interpreted as\nthe integrated\nlight of large numbers of stars, one, NGC 1068, also had six emission\nlines in its\nspectrum. He recognized them all as characteristic emission lines of\nplanetary nebulae; today we know them as\n[O II] 3727, [Ne III]\n3869,\nH, and [O III]\n4363, 4959, 5007. Other astronomers, especially\nSlipher (1917),\nsoon obtained much better spectra\nof NGC 1068 and of the somewhat similar NGC 4151.\nHubble (1926),\nin his epoch-making paper on the `extragalactic nebulae', emphasized the\nplanetary-nebula-like\nemission-line spectra of three AGNs (as we call them today), NGC 1068, 4051 and\n4151. Then seventeen years later\nSeyfert (1943)\nstudied these and other galaxies,\nand isolated the small fraction of them which show many relatively\nhigh-ionization\nemission lines in their nuclear spectra. These nuclei are invariably\nhighly luminous,\nand their emission lines are wider than the lower-ionization emission\nlines that occur\nin the spectra of the nuclei of many `normal' galaxies, he\nreported. These properties,\nbroad emission lines covering a wide range of ionization, arising in a\nsmall, bright\n(`semi-stellar') nucleus, became the defining characteristics of the\nclass of objects we\ncall Seyfert galaxies, the most numerous known type of AGNs.\n\nThey were very little studied, however, until after the optical\nidentification of\nseveral of the strongest radio sources with galaxies. One of the first\nof these was Cyg A = 3C 405, identified by\nBaade and Minkowski\n(1954)\nwith a cD galaxy at\nredshift z = 0.057. Its rich emission-line spectrum was observed\nto be very similar, in\nline widths and high levels of ionization, to the spectra of Seyfert\ngalaxies. Soon these\ncharacteristic features in the spectrum became the recognized signature\nby which many\n(but not all) radio galaxies could be identified. These are the next\nmost numerous type of AGNs we know, after the Seyfert galaxies.\n\nIn addition to the radio galaxies, a fraction of the early identified\nradio sources\nappeared to be stars, with no trace of a galaxy or nebula in their\nimages. Their spectra\nwere continuous, without absorption lines, but with broad emission lines\nwhich could\nnot be identified. Many attempts were made to understand these `stellar\nradio sources'\nas peculiar stars, perhaps white dwarfs or subdwarfs with highly deviant\nabundances\nof the elements, but no physically consistent interpretation was found\nalong these lines. Then\nSchmidt (1963)\nsolved the puzzle, identifying several well-known nebular\nemission lines with the then unusually large redshift z = 0.158\nin the `stellar' radio\nsource 3C 273. Immediately after this,\nGreenstein and\nMatthews (1963)\nidentified several similar emission lines in 3C 48, with redshift\nz = 0.367. This was larger\nthan the redshift of any galaxy known at the time, but 3C 48 appeared to\nbe a 14th\nmagnitude star. It was immediately clear that both these objects are\nhighly luminous,\nand could be observed to very great distances. They are not stars, but\nquasi-stellar\nradio sources, usually referred to as `quasars'. They are now understood\nto be AGNs,\nso luminous and so distant that the galaxy in which they are cannot (or\ncould not) be\ndetected on available photographic images. Now with CCDs and other high-quantum\nefficiency, linear two-dimensional imaging detectors, the quasi-stellar\nnucleus can be\nsubtracted with good accuracy, revealing the galaxies around many of the nearer\nquasars.\n\nCorresponding radio-quiet high-luminosity stellar-appearing objects were found\nsoon afterwards. At first they were called quasi-stellar objects, or\nQSOs, but gradually\nthe distinction faded out, and they are now referred to simply as\nquasars by most\nresearch workers in the field. In this review we shall often preserve\nthe distinction.\nAs a result of many systematic discovery programs, at present we know\nmany quasars\nand QSOs with redshifts up to z 4, but with a fairly strong\ncutoff around z 3.5,\nso that at the present writing only ten are known with z > 4\n(Schneider et\nal 1989).\nThey are the most distant objects we know in the universe, but there\nappears to be a\nlimit to the distance, or light-travel time, at which we can observe\nthem. They have\na wide range of luminosities. One of the chief aims of AGN research is\nto understand\nthem physically so that the luminosity of an individual object can be\nestimated from\nits spectrum with sufficient accuracy to calculate its distance.\n\nFor rough orientation purposes table 1 lists the\napproximate space densities here\nand now of the various types of AGNs we have discussed, in comparison with\nrepresentative densities of two classes of normal galaxies\n(Osterbrock 1982).\nThe quasars\nand QSOs are the rarest but most luminous types of AGNs; radio and\nSeyfert galaxies\nare more numerous in space but intrinsically less luminous. Observation\nand theory\nalike have made it more and more apparent that QSOs and Seyfert galaxies\nare not\ndifferent types of objects, but rather names we use for AGNs at the high- and\nlow-luminosity ends of a continuous sequence of physically similar\nobjects. In fact\nSchmidt and Green\n(1983)\nhave introduced the terminology that AGNs in galaxies with total\nabsolute magnitude more luminous than MB = -23 are\ncalled quasars (or QSOs),\nwhile those less luminous than MB = -23 are called\nSeyfert galaxies. Note,\nhowever, that to say QSOs and Seyfert galaxy nuclei belong to one\nphysically continuous\nsequence does not imply that they are identical except in luminosity,\nsize and other\nscales, any more than to say O stars and M dwarfs belong to one\nphysically continuous\nmain sequence implies that they are identical except in luminosity, size\nand other\nscales. The luminosities of AGNs are very high; a nucleus with\nMB = -23 has, in\norder of magnitude, L\n1012L 1045.6erg\ns-1 integrated over the ultraviolet,\noptical and infrared spectral regions 0.1 \u00b5m\n100 \u00b5m\n(Edelson and Malkan\n1986),\nor L 5 x 1012L 2 x\n1046 erg s-1 integrated over the entire `observed' range\n(including interpolations and sketches below upper limits)\n1010 Hz 1025 Hz\n(Ramaty and\nLingenfelter 1982,\nUrry 1990).\nThis is released within a very small\nvolume, typically with a dimension of less than a few tens of light\ndays, as will be\ndiscussed quantitatively in the next section. The energy release is far\nlarger than\nthat which can be derived from stars we know, or any stellar-like\nobjects operating\non thermonuclear reactions. The only energy-release process that seems\npossible is\nthe liberation of gravitational energy. The one that seems most\nplausible by far is\nthe gravitational release of energy in a rotating accretion disk around\na massive black hole, as has been well reviewed by Rees\n(1977,\n1978,\n1984).\n\nNo matter what the energy-liberation process is, radiation pressure will\nbe important,\nand any spherically symmetric object which is stable must be gravitationally\nbound against being blown apart by it. This is the Eddington condition\n\nHere T is the\nelectron-scattering cross section, and the condition has been written\nfor a pure hydrogen, completely ionized object; any larger opacity would\ncorrespond to a\nsmaller limit on the luminosity. For an AGN with L 1046 erg\ns-1, this corresponds\nto M\n108M, the\nminimum mass for a spherically symmetric situation. In more\ncomplicated geometries, for instance a roughly cylindrically symmetric\nstructure, it is\nstill useful as an order of magnitude estimate. Furthermore, if enough\nfuel is available,\nthe luminosity tends to build up too close to this self-limiting maximum value.\nThe luminosity gives the rate at which mass is converted to energy\n\nin solar masses per year, with\nthe efficiency or fraction\nof the energy which escapes\ndisappearing into the black hole and is radiated. For\n0.1, probably a high estimate\nof the efficiency, 1.8\nM yr-1\nfor an AGN with L = 1046 erg s-1.\n\nAGNs radiate their energy over a wide range of energies, from\n-ray and x-rays\nthrough the ultraviolet, optical and infrared spectral regions to the\nfar-infrared and\nradio-frequency regions. This is the reason the luminosity quoted above\nis so much\nhigher integrated over the entire energy range. Thus observations at all\nfrequencies yield important information on the structure and nature of AGNs.\n\nBecause the AGNs are so small in angular scale as to be unresolved except for\nthe very outermost parts of a few of the very nearest examples, we can\nobserve only\nthe integrated radiation of the entire object. Thus interpreting the\nmeasured data\nto deduce the structure of the AGN is far from simple. Nebulae, nova shells and\nsupernova remnants are valuable `laboratories' from which spatially\nresolved information\nis available, to suggest and also to test physical ideas that may be\nimportant in understanding AGNs."}

{"text":"Archive\n\nNew results from NASA space observatories have revealed something surprising about the Crab Nebula: This famous supernova remnant \u2014 long considered a veritable \"old faithful\" of X-ray sources for the constancy of it energy output \u2014 appears to be dimming over time. We asked Phil Evans, gogblog's on-call X-ray scientist and a member of the NASA Swift Observatory science team, to tell us why the inconstancy of the Crab is so important to astronomers.\n\nThe Crab Nebula has a prestigious history. It formed when a star exploded in a supernova, and was first observed and recorded by Chinese observers in 1054 AD. The glow of the supernova was so bright, people could see it during the day for more than 3 weeks!\n\nThe material which was blown off the star has been expanding since then in a complex structure with leg-like filaments that earned it its name. It's also a very bright source of X-rays, and \u2014 particularly usefully \u2014 its brightness and spectrum don't change; so astronomers can (and do) use it to calibrate their X-ray instruments. In fact, \"a Crab\" is an internationally recognized unit of measurement.\n\nThe problem is, these new results suggest that the Crab is not constant after all, according to a press release issued today by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The measurements taken over the last few years by the Fermi, Swift, RXTE and INTEGRAL satellites show that the Crab actually varies by a few percent every year. This is not too disastrous right now: It's pretty hard to calibrate high-energy instruments to an accuracy of 1 percent or so, and the definition of \"a Crab\" as a unit of measurement has a fixed definition. But as technology advances, we will probably find that the Crab is no longer the ideal calibration source.\n\nThis type of finding, by the way, is not unusual. It is often the case that an object described as the \"protoype\" of its class turns out to be atypical! Indeed the star Vega, long used as a standard in optical astronomy, was recently found not to be standard. The exciting thing about all of this is it shows us how much we still have to learn. The Crab is among the brightest X-ray sources in the sky, and yet it is able to jump out and surprise us.\n\nIn a related point under the same press release, recently published work from the NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and the Italian Space Agency's AGILE satellite have found large gamma-ray flares from the Crab Nebula. Investigation is ongoing, but this may indicate a really strong electric field. As study coauthor Stefan Funk said, \"The strength of the gamma-ray flares shows us they were emitted by the highest-energy particles we can associate with any discrete astrophysical object,\" which in themselves present plenty of challenges.\n\nThe Crab nebula: exciting and enigmatic? Yes! Constant and well understood? No! A fantastic natural laboratory? You betPhil Evans, an X-ray astronomer in England and frequent guest blogger for Geeked On Goddard, sends us this report on the partial solar eclipse this morning. The video above consists of 50 still shots taken by Phil over a 15-minute period. The music is Mars, Bringer of War, by Gustav Holst, brought to you in its copyright-free glory by the U.S. Air Force Band. Being a Brit and an astronomer is often no fun. The clouds know when something interesting is happening, or you've bought a new piece of equipment. Almost every lunar eclipse I've tried to watch has been clear until the moon was about 30% covered, and then I was clouded out until the moon was about 30% covered on the way out of eclipse.\n\nSo it was with extreme pessimism that I began my first working day of 2011 by trudging my way up to the 5th floor of a tall campus buiding, carrying my brand-new Canon EOS 500D (a Christmas present plus my savings!). Sure enough, as the sky began to glow, two large, banks of cloud were illuminated near the horizon. Typical!\n\nOr not.\n\nActually, there were two small, sun-size gaps: one between the horizon and the first bank, and one between the two banks. As the Sun rose (surprisingly quickly) we were treated to a fantastic view of the crescent Sun above the trees, distorted by the atmosphere, and actually accentuated by the clouds. They added depth, colour and an extra sense of anticipation as the Sun, rather than baring all, made use of the available cover to dance suggestively, keeping us on the edge of our seats.\n\n108 photos later and the cloud had taken over. But was it worth the climb up 5 floors at 8 a.m.? You bet it was. Nice one, Universe.\n\n\u2014 Phil Evans\n\nFollow Phil on Twitter to get updates on hius life and work in X-ray astronomyYou're all familiar with magnets. Well, two of my colleagues at the University of Leicester \u2014 Professor Paul O'Brien and his graduate students Antonia Rowlinson and Nicola Lyons \u2014 have announced evidence that some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powered by stars called magnetars \u2014 super-strong magnets in space, if you like.\n\nThe idea is that, when the GRB goes off, the core of the dying star may not collapse straight to a black hole but instead could live for a couple of minutes as a rapidly rotating, magnetic neutron star called a magnetar. The magnetic field acts like a brake slowing the magnetar down and pumping its energy into the GRB, until after a few minutes the star has slowed down and collapses into a black hole.\n\nUsing data from the Swift satellite, my colleagues found that some GRBs show a period of constant brightness and then suddenly get really faint: just as the magnetar model predicts.\n\n\"So what?\" you may ask. Well, GRBs are pretty much unique tools to study the early universe, and it's the deaths of massive stars, some of which die as GRBs, which gives the universe the chemicals that you are I are made from. Getting a handle on the processes by which a star dies, and how it gives off its energy, is fundamental to using GRBs to study these matters. Showing that some GRBs are powered by magnetars is a big step forward.\n\nOne note of caution though: this isn't \"the\" answer. While it seems to be the only explanation for some GRBS, in this same conference scientists from Berkeley university have shown using data from the Fermi satellite that the brightest GRBs can't be powered by magnetars, but need a black hole right from the word go. Life's never straightforward\u2026 but it's often interesting eccentric*** gogblog is happy to announce a new guest blogger: Phil Evans. He's an X-ray astronomer in England who taps into NASA's Swift satellite for data. Swift is managed, as a project, from Goddard Space Flight Center, but it was developed by scientists in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Phil works at the University of Leicester in England's East Midlands.\n\nIn an earlier post, I told the story of how Phil discovered a blindingly bright (in X-rays) gamma-ray burst. In \"Swift Universe,\" Phil will give us a backstage peek at the life of an X-ray astronomer and Swiftophile. Here's his first post, where he gives you the low-down on Swift and his role in the mission.\n\nWelcome to the first Swift Universe blog, where you'll get a (hopefully) insightful and (if you're lucky) entertaining update on what's going on in the universe, at least as far a member of the Swift satellite team is concerned.\n\nSwift is a satellite which was launched in 2004 to study gamma ray bursts. These are thought to be the most powerful explosions in the universe. A typical gamma-ray burst, or GRB, gives off in 10 seconds as much energy as you would need to run your microwave for around 400,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years, which is 30 million million million million times the age of the universe. Don't try it; the bill will be horrendous.\n\nI work in the UK branch of the Swift team, at the University of Leicester. I am part of the XRT team (that's the X-Ray Telescope on Swift) and also part of the UK Swift Science Data Centre. My day to day work involves looking at the X-ray data from Swift and producing web-based tools to help scientists use these data.\n\nJust recently I was involved in one of Swift's discoveries: finding the brightest X-ray flash from outside our own galaxy ever seen. Not only was it exciting as a scientist, but it proved to be a very educational experience for me, as I was for the first time involved in writing a press release.\n\nAlthough I've been tweeting in my role as a Swift scientist for some months now, I've never had to write more than 168 characters announcing something work-related to the public, and it was quite surprising how tough it was. All my natural instincts were to start blabbering on about pile-up, exclusion regions, correction factors, and ergs per second \u2014 most of which probably means nothing to most people.\n\nFortunately, press officers at NASA and Penn State University \u2014 and your own Geeked on Goddard blogger \u2014 were on hand, and they knew (as I now do) that \"this was so bright it dazzled our telescope\" conveys the \"wow\" factor much better than just floating numbers around does! It was a very good experience for me, and a reminder of how important it is for scientist to learn to communicate with the public. (See the Penn State press release about the X-ray GRB.)\n\nclick to see the cartoon!\n\nI am reminded of an excellent PhD Comic item lampooning \"The Science News Cycle.\" The jokes are a bit of an exaggeration, but not always so far from the truth!\n\nAnd I think in the age of the Internet, where nonsense and half-truths can spread so quickly, it's increasingly important for scientists to communicate properly. Take all of the climate change skepticism that exists at the moment for example. Why is it that so many people who are not trained scientists and without having conducted extensive research, tend not believe the scientists who really are experts?\n\n\". . . in the age of the Internet, where nonsense and half-truths can spread so quickly, it's increasingly important for scientists to communicate properly.\"\n\nI don't know the answer, but if scientists were as good at communicating their research as skeptics and conspiracy theorists are at communicating their doubts, perhaps this situation would not exist.\n\nLike a lot of us, you might be wondering WHY that GRB was so bright in X-rays, especially as it was at other wavelengths a fairly typical burst. Right now, we still don't know.\n\nI suppose you could call this the \"unsexy\" part of the science, although this can be where the real excitement comes and you just can't see it. In public we show the thrill of the discovery, and eventually the satisfaction of writing a paper explaining it. (This effort will be led by Tilan Ukwatta at Goddard Space Flight Center, who was the duty scientist with overall responsibility for this GRB).\n\nBut in between comes the real work and (for us) the real fun. It's the subtle cut and thrust duel with the universe as we try to prise open its secrets, exploiting the details of our data, battling with their limits and finding out how it all fits into the bigger picture. It probably doesn't make for exciting reading as we go along (\"Within 3-sigma we're consistent with the k=2 closures, assuming\u2026..\") but when you consider the vastness of the universe, plugging away at its mysteries is a real privilege, and the reason we're in this business.\n\nMy own current theory probably won't make it into the scientific paper: this year the University of Leicester celebrates 50 years of performing space science research. Although the GRB went off before the celebratory conference, thanks to my holiday we didn't make this discovery until the conference has started. So the cause is obvious: the universe was saying \"Happy Birthday\" to Space Science at the University of Leicester"}

As our sun (yellow dot) passes through one stream, we get a close-up view of stars born in another galaxy.\n\nDavid Law\/University of Virginia\n\nGalaxies grow by eating their own, and the Milky Way is no exception. Astronomer Steven Majewski at the University of Virginia has produced a detailed all-sky map that shows, in unprecedented detail, our galaxy shredding and consuming a neighbor just 1\/10,000 its size.\n\nUsing the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey, Majewski and his colleagues picked out the stars that belonged to the tiny Sagittarius galaxy by their distinctive chemical \"fingerprints.\" Sagittarius contains more heavy elements than the Milky Way, so its aging stars appear slightly redder.\n\nThe researchers sifted through the survey's vast database of infrared observations and found a series of distinctive ruddy stars stretched out in two great arcs that pass over and under the Milky Way's disk. Those stellar streamers are about all that is left of the small galaxy.\n\nEvery 750 million years, the oval orbit of the Sagittarius galaxy brings it close to ours, where gravitational tides pull it apart like a piece of cosmic taffy. \"Each time, many stars find themselves more attracted to the Milky Way than the Sagittarius galaxy,\" Majewski says.\n\nComputer models show that previous passes transformed Sagittarius from a dwarf spiral galaxy into a spherical blob. After the latest encounter, most of its remaining stars were no longer bound together, but they have yet to drift away and completely blend into the Milky Way's halo. By chance, Earth lies inside the stream of stars, giving us a unique perspective on the process.\n\n\"While Sagittarius has presented us with a particularly dazzling view of its dance of death, it is likely that similar events have been common in the life of the Milky Way,\" Majewski says. Sure enough, an independent team of astronomers led by Rodrigo Ibata of Strasbourg Observatory in France just found another miniature galaxy falling prey to our own. Using a similar infrared-search technique, they spotted the remains of the Canis Major dwarf galaxy wrapped around the Milky Way."}
{"text":"Messier 91-100\n\nM91 is a faint barred spiral galaxy, in fact it's the faintest object in the Messier list. M91 is a member of the Virgo Galaxy Cluster, and lies 58 million light years from us. It has a very prominent bar structure connected to two outer arms that trail stars and interstellar dust. This is one of the most difficult Messier objects and a larger instrument is needed, only the bar may be seen under average or poor conditions but on a good clear night the spiral arms can be seen. M91 is at magnitude 10.2\n\nM92 is a bright globular cluster 26,000 light years away, 109 light years across, a mass of 330,000 suns, and coming towards us at 112 km\/sec. M92 can be seen with the naked eye under good conditions. It is a bright globular but can often get overlooked because of it's famous slightly brighter neighbour M13. M92 is at magnitude 6.4\n\nM93 is an open cluster 3,600 light years away, 25 light years across, and around a 100 million years old. At least 80 stars come together in a small but bright cluster, forming a triangle shape. M93 has a magnitude of 6.0\n\nM94 is a spiral galaxy who's distance is not well known, but one of the nearer galaxies outside our local group. M94 has a very bright inner region, surrounded by a ring of frantic star formation. Around the outside of the disk is a larger region of older yellow stars. This is a very attractive galaxy, M94 is at magnitude 9.0\n\nM95 is a barred spiral galaxy 33 million light years away, is half the size of our Milky Way at 50,000 light years across, and is one of the galaxies forming the M96 Group. M95\u2032s spiral arms form nearly a complete circle around the central bar, making the whole galaxy resemble a gigantic steering wheel in this photo. The centre of M95 contains a ring of star formation that is 2,000 light years in diameter. M95 can be seen with smaller telescopes and is at magnitude 11.4\n\nM96 is a spiral galaxy 35.5 million light years away, 100,000 light years across, and is the brightest member of the M96 Group in Leo. M96 can be seen in the same field of view as M95. In 1998 a supernova was discovered in M96, this galaxy has a magnitude of 10.1\n\nM97 The Owl Nebula is a planetary nebula 10,000 light years away, and 6,000 years old. M97 is one of the fainter Messier objects. this is the result of an average mass star coming to the end of it's life and shedding it's outer layers into space. The \"holes\" in the nebula give it it's nickname as they make it resemble an owl. It's central star is of 0.7 solar mass, and the nebula is 0.15 solar mass. This is one of the more complex of the planetary nebulae in the sky. The \"eyes\" can be seen with a larger telescope under good conditions with a nebula filter. M97 is at magnitude 9.9\n\nM98 is one of the most challenging Messier objects as it is quite faint. M98 is a beautiful spiral tilted nearly edge on to our line of sight. It is in the Virgo cluster of galaxies at 60 million light years away, and is coming in our direction at 125 km\/sec. It sits with galaxies M99 and M100 in the cluster and can be easily found by locating the star 6 Comae Berenices which is east of M98. This spiral is at magnitude 10.1\n\nM99 is a face on spiral galaxy, and one of the brightest of the spirals in the Virgo Cluster. At 60 million light years away it shows off it's graceful arms. Although it appears lob sided M99\u2032s nucleus is not completely central, one of the spiral arms appears to have been pulled out of it's original position. This is almost certainly due to a close encounter with another Virgo Cluster member in the past. M99 is at magnitude 10.4\n\nM100 is a spiral galaxy in the Virgo Cluster 52 million light years away, and five supernovae have been discovered in this massive collection of stars, dust and gas. M100 is one of the so called \"grand design\" spirals, with beautiful symmetrical arms curling around. It has two main arms packed with young, massive, hot blue stars, and a few less pronounced inner arms. M100 can be seen with a moderate sized telescope under good conditions. Suggestions of the inner arm can be seen with apertures starting at 4 inches. M100 is at magnitude 9.3"}

{"text":"A half-billion stars and galaxies from NASA's WISE mission revealed \u2014 many for first time\n\nA new atlas and catalog of the entire infrared sky with more than a half-billion stars, galaxies and other objects captured by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission was unveiled by NASA Wednesday.\n\n\"Today WISE delivers the fruit of 14 years of effort to the astronomical community,\" said Edward L. (Ned) Wright, a UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and the mission's principal investigator, who began working on the mission in 1998.\n\nA 10-foot unmanned satellite weighing 1,400 pounds, WISE was launched into space on Dec. 14, 2009, and mapped the sky in 2010. Like a powerful set of night-vision goggles, WISE surveyed the cosmos with infrared detectors about 300 times more sensitive than those used in previous survey missions, said Wright, who holds UCLA's David Saxon Presidential Chair in Physics. WISE collected 15 trillion bytes of data and more than 2.7 million images taken at four infrared wavelengths of light \u2014 invisible to the unaided human eye \u2014 capturing everything from nearby asteroids to distant galaxies.\n\nThe individual WISE exposures have been combined into an atlas of more than 18,000 images and a catalog listing the infrared properties of more than 560 million objects found in the images. Most of the objects are stars and galaxies, with roughly equal numbers of each; many of them have never been seen before.\n\nWISE observations have already led to many discoveries, including elusive failed stars, or Y-dwarfs. Astronomers had been hunting for Y-dwarfs for more than a decade. Because they have been cooling since their formation, they do not shine in visible light and could not be spotted until WISE mapped the sky with its infrared vision. WISE has also found that there are significantly fewer mid-size near-Earth asteroids than astronomers had previously feared. With this data, now more than 90 percent of the largest of the asteroids have been identified.\n\nOne image released today shows a surprising view of an \"echo\" of infrared light surrounding an exploded star. The echo was etched in the clouds when a flash of light from the supernova explosion heated surrounding clouds. More discoveries are expected now that astronomers have access to the WISE images.\n\nIn another image, moving objects such as asteroids and comets were removed, but residuals of the planets Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars are visible as bright red spots off the plane of the galaxy at the 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock and 7 o'clock positions, respectively.\n\n\"With the release of the all-sky catalog and atlas, WISE joins the pantheon of great sky surveys that have led to so many remarkable discoveries about the universe,\" said Roc Cutri, who leads the WISE data processing and archiving effort at the Infrared and Processing Analysis Center at the California Institute of Technology.\n\nThe Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) manages and operates the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C.

Although the voracious billion-solar-mass monsters that power distant quasars can devour the equivalent of one sun per year, they may spit out as much as they swallow.\n\nFor decades, radio astronomers have seen narrow jets streaming out of the centers of quasars and pooling up in vast \"lobes\" that resemble the outstretched ears of an elephant. Despite intense study, however, \"jets have resisted understanding,\" says astrophysicist Jean Swank of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. What they are made of, why they form, what keeps them going--all are unsettled questions.\n\nThe problem is that quasar jets change very slowly. Although individual blobs in the otherwise smooth jet sometimes appear to travel faster than the speed of light--an optical illusion called superluminal motion, produced when an object travels toward Earth at nearly the speed of light--the jets are very long. A single lobe can be as long as the spiral arm of a galaxy. As a result, it can take decades for astronomers to notice any movement or change in the shape of a quasar jet.\n\nSo Felix Mirabel of France's Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) in Saclay and Luis Rodriguez of the Institute of Astronomy in Morelia, Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, were thrilled when, in 1994, they spotted a pair of miniature radio jets erupting from a nearby galactic black hole candidate named GRS 1915+105. Like the jets from its grandiose relatives, the newly christened microquasar emitted an occasional blob that raced down the length of the jet at superluminal speeds. In fact, the tightly focused jets were almost exact small-scale replicas of parsec-sized quasar jets, with one crucial difference: They evolved in minutes, not years.\n\n\"Microquasars are an ideal test laboratory for jet formation,\" says Cornell University astrophysicist Stephen Eikenberry. Their appetites whetted, astronomers started avidly hunting for more. Since Mirabel and Rodriguez's discovery, concerted observations from the ground and from space with radio, infrared, optical, x-ray, and gamma ray telescopes have turned up about a dozen objects with the telltale microquasar radio jets.\n\nJust how much microquasars have to say about normal-sized quasars, however, is hotly debated. Do they really hold the key that will unlock the mysteries of jet formation in quasars\u00b7 Or are the apparent similarities just a coincidence\u00b7 Answering these questions is one of the primary goals of a new generation of orbiting x-ray telescopes, including the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, and the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton and Integral satellites.\n\nSome astronomers think the family resemblance will turn out to be spurious. \"So far, nothing we know about quasars has been changed by observing microquasars,\" says Bruce Margon, an astronomer at the University of Washington, Seattle. The black hole that powers a microquasar, Margon notes, is about as massive as a star; the hole in a \"real\" quasar is a billion times larger. \"Very few physical processes scale linearly over nine orders of magnitude,\" he says. The dining habits of the two types of objects also seem to set them apart. Quasar black holes are isolated beasts that feed on hot gas dribbling in from a surrounding cloud. Microquasar black holes are more social: Every known microquasar orbits a windy gas-giant companion star that dumps material into the black hole.\n\nWhatever its source, scientists believe that as gas approaches the central black hole of either a quasar or a microquasar, it collapses into a disk that whirls around the hole in much the same way as the planets orbit the sun. Unlike the planets, however, the viscous gas in a so-called accretion disk gradually loses energy and spirals toward the hole. The lost orbital energy heats the disk, so the temperature of the gas increases the closer it gets to the black hole. As the gas prepares to drop into the black hole, its temperature skyrockets toward almost 1 billion degrees and radiates copious x-rays.\n\nThe jets of a quasar, many theorists suspect, result from the way the gas interacts with the loops of its own magnetic field. The rotating disk winds the field loops like the rubber band in a toy airplane. The magnetic tension increases as the field loops approach the black hole, weaving the loops into magnetic braids that pop out perpendicular to the disk. Hot, radiating gas flows up from the disk and through the braided field lines like water through a pipe, forming the illuminated, magnetized fountains that astronomers call jets.\n\nTheorists think similar scenarios can explain microquasars, with one key difference: Quasar jets appear to be steady and unchanging, whereas microquasar jets are anything but. In GRS 1915+105, for example, approximately every 30 minutes a new blob of radio emission materializes at the base of the jet, accelerates to superluminal speeds, and rockets outward along the jet, fading as it goes. In other microquasars, the light from the jets fluctuates wildly. By comparing radio and x-ray observations of microquasars, astronomers have found evidence that the superluminal blobs and variations in x-ray brightness both result from processes that take place when a microquasar flip-flops between two very different states.\n\n\"The x-rays from accreting black holes in our galaxy come in two distinct forms,\" explains Rob Fender, an astrophysicist at the Astronomical Institute-Anton Pannekoek (AIAP) in Amsterdam. In the so-called high\/soft state, the disk shines brightly in low-energy \"soft\" x-rays. As the microquasar enters the low\/hard state, on the other hand, the x-rays dim but their spectrum shifts to higher energy \"hard\" x-rays. Now, independent observations by Fender, Eikenberry, Mirabel, and their collaborators indicate that the superluminal radio blobs from GRS 1915+105 form as the microquasar makes that transition. And Michel Tagger, an astrophysicist at the CEA, thinks he can explain why.\n\nA theory developed by Tagger's team and confirmed by computer simulations shows that magnetized accretion disks naturally spawn spiral waves, in much the same way as the Milky Way disk generates spiral arms. In Tagger's model, a microquasar spends part of its time in the high\/soft state, during which the waves sweep the magnetic field inward toward the brink of the black hole--the so-called \"innermost stable orbit,\" a mere 100 kilometers from the hole. Closer in, the black hole's gravity grows so strong that nothing can remain in a circular orbit; the accreting gas plunges straight into the hole.\n\nThe magnetic field, however, doesn't follow the doomed matter. Instead, it piles up at the edge of the hole until the increasing tension in the twisted field suddenly snaps it like a rubber band that has been stretched too far. The explosion destroys the soft-x-ray- emitting inner part of the disk, allowing the hard x-rays to shine through and returning the microquasar to the low\/hard state. At the same time, the energy of the broken field launches a blob into the jet, as observed in some microquasars. Astrophysicists say that if the theory can be extended to quasars, it might explain the mysterious dichotomy between radio-loud quasars, which emit jets, and the more numerous radio-quiet ones, which have no jets at all. Radio-quiet quasars could simply be in the supermassive equivalent of the high\/soft state.\n\nTagger's theory rests on one big assumption. For it to work, the accretion disk must extend all the way down to the innermost stable orbit of the black hole. In the gravitational hurly-burly near a black hole, however, any number of forces could destroy or scatter the gas en route. Does it really reach the crucial 100-kilometer point\u00b7 Tiny variations in the x-ray flux from the microquasars are whispering that the answer might be yes--at least some of the time.\n\nThe gravitational pull of a microquasar black hole forces disk material to orbit the hole approximately 1000 times per second, just as the sun's gravity pulls Earth through one complete revolution every year and makes the planets in tighter orbits speed around much more quickly. A tiny clump of gas in the innermost orbit would hurtle along at nearly the speed of light, and on each pass it would shine a beam of x-rays at Earth like the headlights of a car on a circular track.\n\nIn fact, signals resembling such x-ray \"headlights\" have been detected. Astronomers studying microquasars have measured x-rays that rise and fall at a rate that wanders around a fixed central frequency--sometimes slightly higher, sometimes slightly lower. First discovered in 1985, these quasi- periodic oscillations (QPOs) have now been found in most known microquasars. The typical QPO frequencies are suggestively close to the period expected for a lump of gas in the innermost stable orbit of a black hole. The hitch, so far, is that the orbiting-gas model is only one of many possible explanations of the variations in frequency. Those variations--the \"quasi\" in quasi-periodic--make scientists wary of overinterpreting the results. \"The frequencies of these QPOs are definitely in the right ballpark, but other processes could mimic the effect,\" says AIAP astrophysicist Michiel van der Klis.\n\nAnother test of the magnetic-jet theory is to measure the speed of microquasar jets. Tagger's model predicts that the disk-hole system should spew out material at nearly the speed of light. The superluminal blobs detected in three microquasars fit that picture very well. Calculations show that to create the illusion of faster-than-light travel, those jets must be coursing along at 80% to 90% of light speed, at minimum. The velocity has been measured for only one microquasar, however. \"If we had even one more velocity, we could at least ask the fundamental question: Are all the velocities the same\u00b7\" says Margon. \"Right now, we can't even do that.\"\n\nClocking a jet's speed directly is difficult, because microquasars' distances are poorly known. In principle, exact measurements could come from the jets' light. A stationary hot gas of atoms radiates light at specific frequencies that form bright \"emission lines\" in the spectrum of light from the gas. The emission lines of two oppositely directed high-speed jets of hot gas, however, split into pairs. The same Doppler shift that raises the pitch of an approaching train whistle also increases the frequency of the emission lines from a jet pointed in our direction. The emission lines from the receding jet drop to lower frequencies. The difference in the two Doppler-shifted line frequencies is directly proportional to the jet velocity.\n\nSo far, astronomers have found the revealing line pairs in only one object: SS433. Unfortunately, that reading has just sown more confusion. SS433's emission lines show that the jet streams outward at one-quarter of the speed of light--fast, but not as fast as theory predicts. And there is another problem: Some astronomers suspect that SS433 is an anomalous object that contains not a black hole but a neutron star--\"the worst example\" of a microquasar, Margon says.\n\nHelp may come from Chandra, which has recently turned up encouraging hints of line pairs in several other microquasars. \"We found suggestive evidence for the lines in the microquasar 1E1740.7-2942,\" says astrophysicist Wei Cui of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. \"We now have 10 times more telescope time, so we should have a definitive answer next year.\"\n\nUntil that answer comes, researchers can only speculate as to whether microquasars truly are miniature quasars. Dimitrios Psaltis, for one, is beginning to suspect that the answer isn't a simple yes or no. Psaltis, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in collaboration with van der Klis and Tomaso Belloni of the AIAP, has found evidence that the pattern of QPOs varies smoothly from neutron stars to black holes. The result suggests that microquasars are not exactly the same as either neutron stars or quasars, but instead form a link in a chain of jet-producing compact objects that extends from stellar-mass neutron stars all the way to the supermassive quasars.\n\nVan der Klis acknowledges that the proposal is tentative and needs further investigation. \"Some say this is just a coincidence, and others build entire theories out of it,\" he says. \"That is just the way it is in this field right now.\""}

{"text":"Can the Tully-Fisher Relation Be the Result of Initial Conditions?\n\nCitation:\n\nAbstract:\n\nWe use Monte Carlo realizations of halo formation histories and aspherical accretion model to calculate the expected scatter in thevelocity dispersions of galactic halos of a given mass due todifferences in their formation times. Assuming that the rotationalvelocity of a spiral galaxy is determined by the velocity dispersion ofits halo and that its luminosity is related to its total baryonic mass,this scatter translates to a minimum intrinsic scatter in theTully-Fisher relation. For popular cosmological models we find that thescatter due to variations in formation histories is by itself greaterthan allowed by observations. Unless halos of spiral galaxies formed athigh redshift (z 1) and did not later accrete any significant amount ofmass, the Tully-Fisher relation is not likely to be the direct result ofcosmological initial conditions but rather a consequence of a subsequentfeedback process."}
{"text":"You Are Here\n\nPhysics Department\n\nKeeble Observatory\n\nDecember 2002 Sky from the Keeble Observatory\n\nBlack holes seem like the exotic stuff of science fiction, yet\ntoday we acknowledge them as only too real. Einstein's General Theory\nof Relativity tells us that every object with mass warps space and\ntime in its vicinity. We aren't usually aware of this, because the\ndistortion is very small except for very massive objects, like stars\nor galaxies. In 1919 it was confirmed that starlight passing near\nthe surface of the Sun is deflected a tiny amount - exactly as predicted\nby Dr. Einstein's theory. (When first told of this confirmation,\nhe was asked how he would have felt if the observations had not\nsupported his calculations. His reply, typically wry, was that It\nwould have been a pity, because the theory is correct.)\n\nThe strength of the gravitational field (i.e. the amount of curvature\nof space-time it causes) is proportional to the mass of the object,\nand inversely proportional to the square of the distance from its\ncenter. At any distance from a star or planet (or a person, for\nthat matter) we can calculate the escape speed necessary for a\nprojectile to recede forever. The more massive the object, the greater\nspeed required. (Escape from Earth's surface requires a speed of\nabout 7 miles per second. Escape from the Sun's surface takes about\n125 miles per second. Compress the Sun into an Earth-sized ball,\nand the escape speed will be 300 times greater (same mass, smaller\nradius). Compress it to a ball a few kilometers in radius, the escape\nspeed is greater still. Keep compressing, and eventually that escape\nspeed is the speed of light . the object is now a black hole!\n\nWhere do we find them? Massive black holes, in excess of a million\nsolar masses, are found at the cores of many galaxies - including\nour own Milky Way, whose core regions are about 25,000 light years\naway in the constellation Sagittarius. They are detected by observing\norbital motions of stars near the core, and by the x-ray emissions\nfrom gas heated as it falls into the black hole. (And, no, they\nare not cosmic vacuum cleaners sucking in their surroundings. Outside\nthe event horizon they are just massive gravitational centers,\nand it's possible to orbit or escape. It's from the event horizon\ninward that they represent an inescapable potential well.)\n\nAnd, now, one has been detected of far smaller mass and much closer\nto Earth. The object, with the catalog designation GRO J1655-40,\nis some 6000 - 9000 light years away, heading in our general direction\nat about 250,000 miles per hour. (Don't sell your real estate just\nyet - it will take about 15 million years to get here!) It is detected\nbecause it has a close companion star, which orbits it every 2\ufffd\ndays. Gas escaping the atmosphere of this companion is falling into\nthe black hole, emitting copious x-rays in the process. Some of\nthat gas is being ejected from the system in extremely energetic\njets of debris, streaming away at nearly the speed of light.\n\nThis find is exciting, because it seems to confirm the theoretical\nnotion that one way to make a black hole is from a supernova explosion\n- essentially compressing the core of the exploding star at the\nsame time the envelope is blasted into space. This particular black\nhole probably formed in the inner part of the Galaxy's disk, where\nstar formation proceeds at a faster rate than in our vicinity. Other\nthan a supernova, it is difficult to imagine any real phenomenon\nwhich could propel a stellar mass object to such speed.

{"text":"From left, Jack Singal, Dale Fixsen, and Philip Lubin in front of the ARCADE payload prior to launch.\n\nBy Gail Gallessich\n\nA team of NASA-funded scientists, including two from UCSB, have discovered cosmic radio noise that they find completely unexpected and exciting.\n\nThe finding came from data collected from a large helium-filled NASA balloon, big enough to fit a football field inside. The scientists discovered cosmic radio noise that is blasting six times louder than expected.\n\n\"It seems as though we live in a darkened room and every time we turn the lights on and explore, we find something new,\" said team member Philip M. Lubin, professor of physics at UCSB. \"The universe continues to amaze us and provide us with new mysteries. It is like a large puzzle that we are slowly given pieces to so that we can eventually see through the fog of our confusion.\"\n\nThe findings were presented recently at the 213th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Long Beach. The mission, named ARCADE, was to search the sky for heat from the first generation of stars. Instead, it found a cosmic puzzle.\n\nA mysterious screen of extra-loud radio noise permeates the cosmos, preventing astronomers from observing heat from the first stars. The balloon-borne ARCADE instrument discovered this cosmic static on its July 2006 flight. The noise is six times louder than expected.

{"text":"Telescopes Team to Make Sharpest Observation Ever\n\nGARCHING, Germany, July 20, 2012 \u2014 Three telescopes spaced thousands of miles apart were linked together to capture the sharpest direct observation of the center of a distant galaxy: the bright quasar 3C 279, which has a supermassive black hole at its core. The observation represents a milestone toward imaging supermassive black holes and the regions around them.\n\nAstronomers connected Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) in Chile to the Submillimeter Array (SMA) in Hawaii and the Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) in Arizona using a technique known as very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). Larger telescopes can make sharper observations, and interferometry allows multiple telescopes to function as a single telescope as large as the separation \u2014 or baseline \u2014 between them. Using VLBI, the sharpest observations can be achieved by positioning the telescopes as far apart as possible.\n\nFor their quasar observations, the team members used the three telescopes to create an interferometer with transcontinental baseline lengths of 9447 km from Chile to Hawaii, 7174 km from Chile to Arizona, and 4627 km from Arizona to Hawaii. Connecting APEX to the network was crucial because it contributed the longest baselines. The scientists were able to make the sharpest direct observation ever of the center of quasar 3C 279, which has a black hole with a mass about 1 billion times that of the sun; the quasar is so far from Earth that its light takes more than 5 billion years to reach us.\n\nThis is an artist's impression of the quasar 3C 279. For the first time, astronomers connected the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) in Chile to the Submillimeter Array (SMA) in Hawaii and the Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) in Arizona to make the sharpest observations ever of the center of a distant galaxy: the bright quasar 3C 279. Quasars are the very bright centers of distant galaxies and are powered by supermassive black holes. This quasar's black hole has a mass about 1 billion times that of the sun, and it is so far from Earth that its light takes more than 5 billion years to reach us. The team was able to probe scales of less than a light-year across the quasar \u2014 a remarkable achievement for a target that is billions of light-years away. (Image: ESO\/M. Kornmesser)\nThe observations were made in radio waves with a wavelength of 1.3 mm. This is the first time that observations at a wavelength this short have been achieved using such long baselines. The observations achieved a sharpness, or angular resolution, of just 28 microarcseconds \u2014 about 8 billionths of a degree. This represents the ability to distinguish details 2 million times sharper than human vision. This represents the capacity to probe scales of less than a light-year across the quasar \u2014 a remarkable achievement for a target that is billions of light-years away.\n\nIn the future, the astronomers plan to connect even more telescopes to create a so-called Event Horizon Telescope, which should be able to image the shadow of the supermassive black hole in the center of our Milky Way galaxy, as well as black holes in surrounding galaxies. The shadow \u2014 a dark region seen against a brighter background \u2014 is caused by the bending of light by the black hole, and would be the first direct observational evidence for the existence of a black hole's event horizon, the boundary from within which not even light can escape.\n\nThis experiment marks the first time that APEX has taken part in VLBI observations. It is the culmination of three years of work at its high-altitude site on the 5000-m plateau of Chajnantor in the Chilean Andes. Scientists from Germany and Sweden installed new digital data acquisition systems, a very precise atomic clock and pressurized data recorders capable of recording 4 Gb\/s for many hours under challenging environmental conditions. The data was shipped to Germany on hard drives and processed at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn.\n\nAPEX shares its location with the new Atacama Large Millimeter\/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescope, which will consist of 54 dishes with the same 12-m diameter as APEX, plus 12 smaller dishes with a 7-m diameter. The new telescope is currently under construction, but the possibility of connecting it to the network is being studied. With ALMA's large dishes, the observations could reach 10 times better sensitivity than these initial tests.

{"text":"milky way galaxy\n\nNew views from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope show blooming stars in our Milky Way Galaxy's more barren territories, far from its crowded core.\n\nThe images are part of the Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (Glimpse 360) project, which is mapping the celestial topography of our galaxy. The map and a full 360\u00b0 view of the Milky Way plane will be available later this year. Anyone with a computer may view the Glimpse images and help catalog features.\n\n\n\nWhile Spitzer and other telescopes have created mosaics of the galaxy's plane looking in the direction of its center before, the region behind us, with its sparse stars and dark skies, is less charted.\n\n\"We sometimes call this flyover country,\" said Barbara Whitney, an astronomer from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"We are finding all sorts of new star formation in the lesser-known areas at the outer edges of the galaxy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With Spitzer, we can see out to the edge of the galaxy better than before,\" said Benjamin. \"We are hoping this will yield some new surprises.\"\n\n\n\nGlimpse 360 already has mapped 130\u00b0 of the sky around the galactic center.\n\nMembers of the public continue scouring images from earlier Glimpse data releases in search of cosmic bubbles indicative of hot-up work by the researchers showed the smaller bubbles were spawned by a larger bubble that had been carved out by massive stars.\n\n\"This crowdsourcing approach really works,\" said Charles Kerton of Iowa State University in Ames. \"We are examining more of the hierarchical bubbles identified by the volunteers to understand the prevalence of triggered star formation in our galaxy.\"\n\n\"Prior to these images, there were relatively few UV observations of these galaxies and none at high resolution across such wide areas, so this project fills in a major missing piece of the scientific puzzle,\" said Michael Siegel from Pennsylvania State University in State College.\n\nThe LMC and SMC lie about 163,000 light-years and 200,000 light-years away, respectively, and orbit each other as well as our Milky Way Galaxy. The LMC is about one-tenth the size of the Milky Way and contains only 1 percent of the Milky Way's mass. The SMC is half the size of the LMC and contains about two-thirds of its mass.\n\nDespite their modest sizes, the galaxies loom large in the sky because they are so close to us. Both extend far beyond the Swift UVOT's field of view, which meant thousands of images were needed in order to cover both galaxies in three ultraviolet colors centered at wavelengths of 1,928 angstroms, 2,246 angstroms, and 2,600 angstroms.\n\nViewing in the ultraviolet allows astronomers to suppress the light of normal stars like the Sun, which are not very bright at such higher energies, and provides a clearer picture of the hottest stars and star-formation regions. No telescope other than the UVOT can produce such high-resolution wide-field multicolor surveys in the ultraviolet. Swift's wide-field imaging capabilities provide a powerful complement to the deeper but much narrower field imaging power of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nThat's partly because trying to observe its structure \u2014 from our vantage point two-thirds of the way out from the galactic center, at least \u2014 is akin to determining the boundaries of a thickly-populated old growth forest from one isolated ground-level spot.\n\nThe idea behind GLIMPSE was to do a deep panorama of our galaxy in the mid-infrared and to penetrate our galaxy's dark molecular clouds where at least some of our Milky Way's estimated 400 billion stars are actually still forming.\n\nAstronomers are still in the process of analyzing the data on the survey, with results expected by mid-summer. But for a preview, Forbes.com turned to Ed Churchwell, a GLIMPSE Principal Investigator and an astronomer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has been studying the Milky Way for almost a half century.\n\nWhat has GLIMPSE taught us about the plane of our galaxy?\n\nThat it's full of hot bubbles of gas around really hot luminous stars. Due to both their bright radiation and particles, these stars have blown bubbles around themselves. That tells us a lot about the evolution and impact of these stars on the galaxy and has opened a whole new field of research.\n\nWhat have you learned about the structure of the galaxy itself?\n\nWe've found that our galaxy has a fairly long bar that goes right through its center and reaches about halfway out to the sun but is tilted about 45 degrees [from the sun-galactic center direction]. As a result, the galaxy looks very lopsided. And we see a lot more stars in the Northern part of our galaxy than the South.\n\nThis bar is about 13,000 light years in radius and primarily detected by an old population of very numerous \"Red Clump Giant\" M-spectral type stars in the latter stages of their evolution. These giants have a well-determined luminosity, which makes them useful as standard galactic candles. So, we're able to determine the large scale structure of our galaxy.\n\nSo, our galaxy is now officially classified as a barred grand spiral?\n\nThat's right, with what appear to be two major arms, the Perseus arm and the Carina-Scutum arm. We have three smaller, less prominent arms, Sagittarius, Norma and the Outer arm. And there are also two minor arms near the galactic center, the Far 3kpc arm and the Near 3kpc arm, as well as our local Orion spur.\n\nThe Microsoft Research team is building an epic map of the universe using data and photographs collected from the many telescopes around the world, including NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. They call it The WorldWide Telescope.\n\nThere are roughly 300 billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy, and about the same number of galaxies in our universe (give or take a couple). With the WorldWide Telescope, scientists and developers have pieced together a detailed 3D view of the universe that lets a user do a fly by of any planet, star or galaxy known to man. You can even view the entire universe in a single frame, which makes us all seem insanely insignificant.\n\nBut the WorldWide Telescope is more than just a neat exploration tool for astronomy and physics nerds. Program Director Dan Fay hopes NASA can use it as a research tool and that students from the elementary to graduate levels can use it as an educational resource. The Microsoft Research team has made it simple to manipulate data on a touch surface or desktop. With the touch of a couple of buttons and pinch to zoom, you're off and flying through the universe. The team plans to bring this magic to mobile devices soon.\n\nMicrosoft has also released an API to allow developers to build custom tours and lessons. I was fortunate enough to be given a tour of the nebula of the Milky Way Galaxy, and admittedly it was beautiful. The lessons can be as simple as a fly by of every planet in our solar system, or as complicated as analyzing photographs of the deepest known space objects. The map also lets you look at any part of the sky in a number of light wavelengths, including infrared and X-ray.\n\nAfter the demo, I took a tour of a scale model of the James Webb Space Telescope, which is due to launch in 2018. The telescope is about 100 times more powerful than Hubble and about seven times as big. It includes a 21-foot reflective mirror and a slew of instruments to study the sky.\n\nNASA hopes to look through dust clouds surrounding the formation of stars using the onboard infrared instruments to finally see how stars are born and to look far enough through the universe that they will get a better sense of how all of this madness is shaped. It will also be able to detect water vapor in atmospheres outside our solar system, and where there is water, there's a significant chance at life.\n\nUsing new technology at the telescope and in laboratories, researchers have discovered an important pair of prebiotic molecules in interstellar space. The discoveries indicate that some basic chemicals that are key steps on the way to life may have\u2026 2\/28\/2013 11:30 AM EST\n\nNewly Discovered Clouds Found Floating High above Milky Way\n\nNew studies with the National Science Foundation's Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) have revealed a previously unknown population of discrete hydrogen clouds in the gaseous halo that surrounds the Milky Way Galaxy. 10\/19\/2002 12:00 AM EDT\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics has just been awarded to Riccardo Giacconi, President of Associated Universities, Inc., and Research Professor at Johns Hopkins University, \"for pioneering contributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of\u2026 10\/9\/2002 12:00 AM EDT\n\nAn international team of astronomers using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has found tantalizing evidence for the existence of a shell of stars that are a relic of cannibalism by our galaxy.\n\nThis image shows the disk of the Milky Way Galaxy surrounded by a faint halo of old stars (NASA \/ ESA \/ A. Field, STScI) said Dr Roeland van der Marel of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, co-author of a paper accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal (arXiv.org version, Hubblesite's version).\n\nThe astronomers used Hubble to precisely measure the sideways motions of a small sample of stars located far from the center of the Milky Way. Their unusual lateral motion is circumstantial evidence that the stars may be the remnants of a shredded galaxy that was gravitationally ripped apart by our galaxy billions of years ago. These stars support the idea that the Milky Way grew, in part, through the accretion of smaller galaxies.\n\nThe team identified 13 stars located roughly 80,000 light-years from the galaxy's center. They lie in the Milky Way's outer halo of ancient stars that date back to the formation of our galaxy.\n\nThe team was surprised to find that the stars showed more of a sideways, or tangential, amount of motion than they expected. This movement is different from what astronomers know about the halo stars near the Sun, which move predominantly in radial orbits. Stars in these orbits plunge toward the galactic center and travel back out again. The stars' tangential motion can be explained if there is an over-density of stars at 80,000 light-years, like cars backing up on an expressway. This traffic jam would form a shell-like feature, as seen around other galaxies.\n\nThe astronomers plucked the outer halo stars out of seven years' worth of archival Hubble observations of the Andromeda Galaxy. In those observations, Hubble peered through the Milky Way's halo to study the Andromeda stars, which are more than 20 times farther away. The Milky Way's halo stars were in the foreground and considered as clutter for the study of Andromeda. But to the current study they were pure gold. The observations offered a unique opportunity to look at the motion of Milky Way halo stars.\n\n\"We had to somehow find those few stars that actually belonged to the Milky Way halo,\" Dr van der Marel said. \"It was like finding needles in a haystack.\"\n\nThe astronomers identified the stars based on their colors, brightnesses, and sideways motions. The halo stars appear to move faster than the Andromeda stars because they are so much closer. They identified the halo stars and measured both the amount and direction of their slight sideways motion. The stars move on the sky only about one milliarcsecond a year, which would be like watching a golf ball on the Moon moving one foot per month. Nonetheless, this was measured with 5 percent precision, made possible in visible-light observations because of Hubble's razor-sharp view and instrument consistency.\n\nStars in the inner halo have highly radial orbits. When the team compared the tangential motion of the outer halo stars with their radial motion, they were very surprised to find that the two were equal. Computer simulations of galaxy formation normally show an increasing tendency towards radial motion if one moves further out in the halo.\n\nThese observations imply the opposite trend. The existence of a shell structure in the Milky Way halo is one plausible explanation of the findings. Such a shell can form by accretion of a satellite galaxy. This is consistent with a picture in which the Milky Way has undergone continuing evolution over its lifetime due to the accretion of satellite galaxies.\n\nShells of stars have been seen in the halos of some galaxies, and astronomers predicted that the Milky Way may contain them, too. But until now there was limited evidence for their existence. The halo stars in our galaxy are hard to see because they are dim and spread across the sky.\n\nNew data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory suggest a highly distorted supernova remnant may contain the most recent black hole formed in the Milky Way Galaxy. The remnant appears to be the product of a rare explosion in which matter is ejected at high speeds along the poles of a rotating star.\n\nThe remnant, called W49B, is about a thousand years old and located about 26,000 light-years away. \"W49B is the first of its kind to be discovered in the galaxy,\" said Laura Lopez from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge near Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz of the University of California,ae Daniel Castro from, including being jet-driven and possibly forming a black hole, that overlap with those of a GRB"}
{"text":"Red giant pulled in and consumed by huge black hole\n\nOn May 2, NASA announced that it has seen a black hole feeding on a star.\n\nThe joint team of researchers, led by Suvi Gezari of the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md., announced they caught sight of a red giant star being pulled into a black hole, millions of times larger than the Sun. The black hole in question is located in a galaxy 2.7 billion light years (distance travelled by light in one year) away from Earth.\n\nResearchers believe the red giant, a star in the last stage of stellar evolution, was about 5 billion-years-old when it was consumed. According to the Daily Mail, scientists think the black hole first consumed the red giant's helium outer shell then sucked in the star's core when it wandered too close during its elliptical orbit. The massive black hole caught and pulled in the star with its enormous gravity.\n\nA flare was caused by the star's helium-rich nucleus as it was destroyed by the black hole. Scientists observed the flare as it peaked in brightness in July then faded over the course of a year.\n\nThere have been several sightings of the aftermath of a star's destruction by a black hole. However, this is the first time the process of destruction was sighted.\n\nThis event was discovered by NASA's Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) and Pan-STARRS (Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System) in Hawaii, June 2010. The research results were first introduced in the scientific journal, Nature, May 2.\n\nA black hole also exists in our galaxy, approximately 30,000 light years away from Earth.

{"text":"Science News\n\nHubble Sees a Planetary Nebula in the Making\n\nOct. 11, 2012 \u2014 The Universe is filled with mysterious objects. Many of them are as strange as they are beautiful. Among these, planetary nebulae are probably one of the most fascinating objects to behold in the night sky. No other type of object has such a large variety of shapes and structures. The NASA\/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has provided a striking image of Hen 3-1475, a planetary nebula in the making.\n\nShare This:\n\nPlanetary nebulae -- the name arises because most of these objects resembled a planet when they were first discovered through early telescopes -- are expanding, glowing shells of gas coming from sun-like stars at the ends of their lives. They glow brightly because of the radiation that comes from a hot, compact core, which remains after the outer envelope is ejected, and is powerful enough to make these gossamer shells shine.\n\nEach planetary nebula is complex and unique. Hen 3-1475 is a great example of a planetary nebula in the making, a phase which is known to astronomers as a protoplanetary or preplanetary nebula.\n\nSince the central star has not yet blown away its complete shell, the star is not hot enough to ionize the shell of gas and so the nebula does not shine. Rather, we see the expelled gas thanks to light reflected off it. When the star's envelope is fully ejected, it will begin to glow and become a planetary nebula.\n\nHen 3-1475 is located in the constellation of Sagittarius around 18,000 light-years away from us. The central star is more than 12,000 times as luminous as our sun. Its most characteristic feature is a thick ring of dust around the central star and two S-shaped jets that are emerging from the pole regions of the central star. These jets are long outflows of fast-moving gas travelling at hundreds of kilometers per second.\n\nThe formation of these bipolar jets has puzzled astronomers for a long time. How can a spherical star form these complex structures? Recent studies suggest that the object's characteristic shape and the large velocity outflow is created by a central source that ejects streams of gas in opposite directions and precesses once every thousand years. Precession means a change in the orientation of the rotational axis of a rotating body. It is like an enormous, slowly rotating garden sprinkler in the middle of the sky. No wonder astronomers also have nicknamed this object the \"Garden-sprinkler Nebula.\"\n\nThis picture was taken with Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3, which provides significantly higher resolution than previous observations made with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2.Into The Eye Of The Helix Nebula(Mar. 4, 2009) \u2014 A deep new image of the magnificent Helix planetary nebula has been obtained using the Wide Field Imager at ESO's La Silla Observatory.

{"text":"Flowing Toward Oblivion?\n\nFlowin' out? Hundreds of galaxy clusters are rapidly moving toward one specific part of the sky (purple egg).\n\nCredit: NASA\/WMAP\/A. Kashlinsky et al.\n\nAlong with dark matter and dark energy, astronomers can now add\ndark flow to the lexicon of cosmic mysteries. Researchers have\ndiscovered that 700 distant clusters of galaxies, gas, and dust are\nall being pulled in the same direction, apparently toward something\ninvisible and possibly very large, confounding current cosmological\nmodels. So far, what that \"something\" is remains speculative, but\nit could turn out to be a vestige of the universe's earliest\ndays.\n\nShortly after the big bang occurred some 13.7 billion years ago,\ncosmologists think, the universe underwent a brief period that\ndefied current physical laws. The theory goes that during this\ntime, called inflation, space itself expanded at a rate much, much\nfaster than the speed of light. As a result, some of the matter\nformed with the big bang was pulled more than 13.7 billion\nlight-years away--so far that its light hasn't reached us yet. As a\nresult, that matter can't be observed--or at least, so cosmologists\nthought.\n\nBut now a team led by astrophysicist Alexander Kashlinsky of\nNASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, has\nunearthed what could be indirect evidence of inflation. The\nresearchers had been surveying the motion of 700 clusters of\ngalaxies to test an unrelated astronomical phenomenon when they\nmade a startling discovery: All 700 clusters are flowing basically\nin the same direction and at speeds of as much as 1000 kilometers\nper second--or more than 30 times faster than Earth revolves around\nthe sun. As the team reports in this week's online edition of\nAstrophysical Journal Letters, the clusters, which appear\nheaded toward a region of the sky where the constellation Centaurus\nresides, are moving faster than they should be if their\nacceleration were due only to dark energy, the mysterious force\ndiscovered a decade ago that is slowly ripping the cosmos\napart.\n\nIt was \"a huge surprise,\" says astrophysicist and co-author\nHarald Ebeling of the University of Hawaii, Honolulu. The big\nquestion, he says, is what is generating the flow. The volume of\ngalaxy clusters affected is much too big to be reacting to some\nsingle, massive object, Ebeling says. Instead, the team speculates\nthat the flow is moving the clusters toward an irregularity in the\nmass distribution of the universe that was already in place before\ninflation began. If so, Ebeling says, the flow should extend even\nfarther across the universe, and the researchers could have the\nanswer when they examine the motion of an even larger and deeper\ncatalog of close to 1500 galaxy clusters. \"We should know more in a\nfew years,\" he adds.\n\nIt's an \"intriguing\" finding, says astrophysicist Mike Hudson of\nthe University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. Hudson, who with\ncolleagues has submitted a related paper of his own observations to\nthe Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, says\nthe direction of the flow agrees \"very well\" with his own findings,\nthough those of Kashlinsky's team cover a greater distance and have\nfound a much greater velocity. Hudson recommends awaiting\nconfirmation of the results by other groups using other surveys,\nbut \"if this result holds up, then theorists will certainly have to\nmake some major revisions to the standard cosmological model.\""}

{"text":"This Chandra image shows two vast cavities -- each 600,000 light years in diameter -- in the hot, X-ray emitting gas that pervades the galaxy cluster MS 0735.6+7421, or MS 0735 for short. Though the cavities contain very little hot gas, they are filled with a two-sided, elongated, magnetized bubble of extremely high-energy electrons that emit radio waves.\n\nThe cavities appear on opposite sides of a large galaxy at the center of the cluster, which indicates that a gigantic eruption produced by the galaxy's supermassive black hole created the structures. The magnitude of the eruption suggests that as a large amount of gas swirled rapidly toward the central black hole, it generated intense electromagnetic fields that ejected a fraction of the gas in the form of powerful jets of high-energy particles.\n\nAs these jets blasted through the galaxy into the surrounding, multimillion-degree intergalactic gas, they pushed the hot gas aside to create the cavities. The mass of the displaced gas equals about a trillion suns, more than the mass of all the stars in the Milky Way.\n\nChandra has discovered evidence of similar outbursts in the form of other X-ray cavities in galaxy clusters, but the cavities in MS 0735 are easily the largest and most powerful seen to date. To create such an enormous eruption, the supermassive black hole must have swallowed about 300 million solar masses of gas over the last hundred million years."}

{"text":"SN 1993J\n\nSN 1993J is a supernova observed in the galaxy M81. It was discovered on 28 March 1993 by F. Garcia in Spain[1]. At the time, it was the second brightest supernova observed in the twentieth century behind SN 1987A[2].\n\nThe spectral characteristics of the supernova changed over time. Initially, it looked more like a type II supernova (a supernova formed by the explosion of a giant star) with strong hydrogen spectral line emission, but later the hydrogen lines faded and strong helium spectral lines appeared, making the supernova look more like a type Ib[2][3]. Moreover, the variations in SN 1993J's luminosity over time were not like the variations observed in other type II supernovae[4][5] but did resemble the variations observed in type Ib supernovae[6]. Hence, the supernova has been classified as a type IIb, a intermediate class between type II and type Ib[3]. The scientific results from this supernova suggested that type Ib and Ic supernovae were actually formed through the explosions of giant stars through processes similar to what takes place in type II supernovae[3][7]. The supernova was also used to estimate a distance of 8.5 \u00b1 1.3 Mly (2.6 \u00b1 0.4 Mpc) to Messier 81[2].\n\nLight echoes from the explosion have subsequently been detected. [8]\n\nThe progenitor of SN 1993J was identified in pre-explosion ground based images[9]. The progenitor was observed to be a K-supergiant star, with an excess in the ultraviolet possibly due to surrounding hot stars or a hot binary companion. While the supernova is located in a region populated by young massive stars [10], late-time photometry with the Hubble Space Telescope and spectroscopy with the Keck 10m-telescope presented by Maund and collaborators revealed the presence of the long suspected B-supergiant companion star[11].\nReferences"}

Fortunately, the system happens to be\nseen almost exactly edge-on. This geometry allows a direct\nobservation of the curvature of space-time as light from one\npulsar passes near the other one and experiences relativistic\neffects.\nread more\n\nTemperature maps of dense molecular gas in\nstarburst galaxies\n\nThe new 12 mm receiver system\ninstalled at the Compact Array in April 2003 for the first time\nallows southern-hemisphere astronomers to observe important\nspectral lines of ammonia. Ammonia is an excellent\n\"thermometer\", and observations of two 12 mm transitions of this\nmolecule allowed the mapping of the temperature of the cold,\nmolecular gas in the nearby star-burst galaxy NGC 253. Four\ndense molecular complexes were identified near the galaxy's\nstarburst core but, surprisingly, the complexes which lie\nclosest to the star forming activity are the coolest. This\nsuggests that neither the weak AGN nor the starburst dominate\nthe heating of molecules. The abundance of ammonia, however,\ndecreases towards the centre of the star-forming activity as\nexpected because the strong UV radiation dissociates the\nmolecules.\nread more\n\nWhat and where are the High-Velocity Clouds (HVCs)\naround the Milky Way?\n\nClouds of neutral hydrogen (HI)\nmoving at velocities too high for galactic rotation have been\nknown to exist for more than 40 years. However, their lack of\nstars usually prevents accurate distance, and therefore mass\ndeterminations, and so their origin remains unclear. Using the\nParkes telescope and the Compact Array, ATNF astronomers have\nsearched for such HVCs in nearby groups of galaxies that are\nsimilar to the Milky Way's Local Group. They discovered ten new\nHI-rich dwarf galaxies, but identified each of them with an\noptical counterpart, meaning that, unlike HVCs, they contain\nstars. Assuming HVCs in the observed galaxy groups have similar\nproperties than those in the Local Group, their non-detection\nplaces an upper limit on their masses. They must have less than\n400,000 solar masses and distances of less than 160,000 parsecs\nfrom the Milky Way. This finding has important consequences for\ntheories of galaxy formation.\nread more\n\nGamma-ray burst jets in type Ib\/c supernovae\n\nGamma-ray bursts are the most energetic explosions in the\nuniverse, and their nature was entirely enigmatic until a few\nyears ago. When astronomers observed the gamma-ray burst GRB\n980425, they surprisingly discovered a type Ic Supernova, SN\n1998bw, at the same coordinates, and only 40 million parsecs\naway - much closer than expected. However, the afterglow of GRB\n980425 was much weaker than was observed in many other gamma-ray\nbursts. A possible explanation is that the jet collimation axis\nwas pointing away from earth. As the jet decelerates, it is\nexpected to expand and to spread sideways, resulting in\nincreased radio emission. This increase has not yet been found,\nand so another theory postulates that GRB 980425 is a member of\na subclass of gamma-ray bursts with underluminous\nafterglows. The discovery of the next closest gamma-ray burst,\nGRB 031203, with a similar underluminous afterglow, supports\nthis explanation.\nread more\n\nHI tidal tails, bridges and clouds\n\nNeutral\nhydrogen (HI) is a major ingredient in most galaxies, but can\noccasionally be found well outside their stellar envelopes and\nbetween galaxies. This gas is stripped away from the parent\ngalaxies by tidal forces, mergers, and interactions, and the HI\nmay then form new dwarf galaxies. Observations of a sample of\nthese peculiar HI objects with the Compact Array revealed a\nplume with a mass of 2x109 solar masses stripped away\nfrom a peculiar spiral galaxy by a massive elliptical. In\nanother system, extended HI emission partly coincides with a\ndwarf galaxy which might have formed out of HI gas extracted by\ntidal forces from a nearby peculiar galaxy. Between the galaxies\nNGC 6221 and NGC 6215, a detached HI cloud with a mass of\n1.4x108 solar masses has been detected. The two\ngalaxies probably touched each other long ago. The gas close to\nthe galaxies quickly fell back, but the gas in between formed\noptically invisible, extended clouds.\nread more"}

The paper became known as the B2FH (because of their initials). It talked about nuclear reactions inside stars, showing how these reactions tear apart blocks of matter and put it together again differently. It was a similar idea to what Charles Darwin had written about 100 years earlier in the \"Origin of Species\", where he had described how creatures had evolved. Scientists saw this paper as the most important paper ever written about astrophysics.\n\nLater in his career Burbidge refused to accept the Big Bang theory which describes the start of the universe. Quasars are very bright objects with a very high redshift. The Big Bank theorists say that they come from places extremely far away in the universe. But Burbidge thought that quasars come from nearby galaxies, travelling near the speed of light, which explains their redshift. He thought they produced new matter as old matter was destroyed by reactions.\n\nAlthough many scientists disagree with Burbidge's later ideas, he is still thought of as an extremely important scientist.

{"text":"A supernova is a massive star that explodes. The explosion is a cataclysmic\nevent for a star, one that essentially ends its active (energy-generating) lifetime.\n\nSupernovas occur with stars that have masses more than five times that of our sun. As a result of their\nhuge gravitational fields, they develop extremely high pressures in their cores. This allows them\nto continue to generate energy by fusion even when their hydrogen supply has been depleted\n(remember that stars fuse hydrogen to produce helium plus huge amounts of energy). The fusion of helium produces even heavier elements and vast amounts of energy.\nThese fusion reactions continue until elements as heavy as iron are formed. It is thought\nthat fusion reactions involving iron result in the catastrophic collapse of the star's core. The outer layers of the massive star are violently blown off in a supernova explosion.\n\nFor several months, supernovas may shine 10 billion times more brightly than a normal\nstar. Supernovas are rare, occurring only about once per century in a galaxy the size of\nthe Milky Way.\n\nBlack holes are regions of space that exert incredibly powerful gravitational fields.\nAs a result, they act like gigantic cosmic vacuum cleaners that can suck in anything\nthat comes within their grasp including comets, planets, and even clouds of gas.\nNot even light can escape the intense gravitational pull of a black hole. As a result,\nthey remain black and invisible.\nWhen an object is pulled into a black hole it is crushed to infinite density and disappears forever.\n\nBlack holes are formed by the collapse of massive stars. These huge stars are\nable to maintain their normal size during most of their life time because the heat generated\nfrom thermonuclear reactions expands the star outwards and offsets the huge gravitational\npull. When the star expends its nuclear fuel, however, the star collapses under its\nhuge gravitational pull and a black hole is formed. To put the magnitude of\nthese forces into perspective, a\nstar the size of our sun, 864,950 miles ( 1,391,704 kilometers) in diameter, would have to shrink to less\nthan 1.9 miles ( 3.06 kilometers) to become a black hole!\n\nBlack holes often seem to be part of binary systems, where the black hole and a visible\nstar revolve around one another. The black hole, with its massive gravitational\nfield, pulls gas from the visible star into itself. When this happens the gas emits\nstrong X-rays which astronomers can detect.\n\nA neutron star is the core of a\nstar that remains after a supernova explosion. Neutron stars emit intense X-rays. A neutron star has a mass about equal to the sun, but has a diameter of\nonly about 10 miles (16 kilometers). Neutron stars have a density estimated\nto be about 100 million tons per cubic inch (5.5 million metric tons per cubic centimeter). At this\nhigh pressure electrons and protons combine to form the neutrons of which the star is composed.\nThe temperature of the core is as high as 10 billion degrees F and the surface temperature can be 18 million degrees F.\n\nPulsar is an abbreviation for \"pulsating radio star.\" This name was given for the obvious reason that they emit extremely regular pulses of radio waves. Some pulsars, however, emit visible light, X rays, or gamma rays.\nPulsars are thought to be rapidly spinning neutron stars that are extremely dense (a neutron star is the core of a star that remains after a supernova explosion). Most pulsars have a diameter of 6 miles (10 kilometers) or less.\n\nA pulsar behaves much like a lighthouse beacon when it emits electromagnetic radiation (radio waves, visible light, X-rays, or gamma rays). Scientists believe that charged particles (protons and electrons) released from the surface enter an intense magnetic field that surrounds the star and rotates along with it.\nThe particles give\noff electromagnet radiation as they are accelerated to near the speed of light. Hence the pulsar swings\nan electromagnetic radiation beam around the star much like a beacon. Scientists are able to detect this pulsating radiation.\n\nThe interval between pulses ranges from about 4 seconds, for the slowest, to about\n1.55 milliseconds for the fastest (the Millisecond Pulsar). It has been estimated that the Millisecond Pulsar\nis spinning at 642 times per second! Scientists believe that this is near the limit of rotation, because\nat faster speeds the pulsar would rip apart as a result of centrifugal force at the equator.\n\nQuasars, or quasi-stellar radio sources, are believed to be\nthe highly luminous cores, or nuclei, of distant galaxies. The most baffling property\nof quasars is the vast amount of energy that they produce. Many are\nare up to a thousand times as bright as an average galaxy.\n\nCalculations have indicated that many quasars are receding at greater than 90%\nof the speed of light and that their distance from the Earth is enormous. Some are estimated to\nbe 14 billion light-years away. This incredible distance makes them the most distant objects\nknown and they probably mark the horizon of the known universe.\n\nQuasars are estimated to be only one or two light-years in\ndiameter. This is surprising because they emit 10 to\n1,000 times more electromagnetic radiation than a normal galaxy which\ncan have a diameter of greater than 100,000 light years.\n\nGalaxies are enormous cluster of stars. Small galaxies may contain\nfewer than a million stars while very large galaxies may contain more than\none trillion stars. Galaxies can be up to 100,000 light-years in\ndiameter.\n\nGalaxies come in four general shapes: 1) elliptical, 2)spiral, 3) barred spiral\nand 4) irregular. Elliptical galaxies show very little structure and are flat to spherical in shape. Spiral galaxies are flat and generally have a bright nucleus, and arms that come out of the nucleus and form a giant pinwheel shape. Barred spiral galaxies are also flat and have arms that extend sideways in a short straight line before curving into a spiral shape. Irregular galaxies are usually small and have no particular shape.\n\nThe Milky Way is our Galaxy. Some astronomers estimate\nthat the Milky Way has more than 100 billion stars. The Milky Way\nis a member of a group of about 20 galaxies know as the Local Group. Farther out, there are estimated to be\nbillions of other galaxies (sometimes called the extragalactic nebulae).\n\nThe stars that occur in the Milky Way are classified as Population I stars or Population II stars.\nPopulation I stars occur primarily in the spiral arms of the galaxy and include stars ranging in age from a few hundred thousand to 10 billion years old. Population I stars are rich in heavy elements (elements heavier than helium). Population II stars occur\nprimarily in the area around the galactic nucleus. Population II stars are approximately\n12 to 15 billion years old and are very deficient in heavy elements. These stars\nare the oldest members of our galaxy.\n\nNow for some speculation. The earth and the life that occupies the planet are composed of numerous elements that are heavier than helium. It is indeed an interesting thought that the atoms that\nmake up our bodies were forged in the core of distant stars and distributed throughout\nthe galaxy by massive supernova explosions. Since Population I stars are rich\nin heavy elements, it is these stars that have the highest probability of harboring\nplanets and life. Hence, if other life is to be found in the Milky Way, the greatest\nprobability would be in the spiral arms and not in the galactic core.\n\nComets are characterized by a brilliant nucleus surrounded by a\nfuzzy coma of light. From the coma extends a less luminous tail.\nThe nucleus, or core, of a comet has a composition resembling a large, dirty snowball.\nThey are thought to consist of approximately 25 percent dust and\/or chunks of rock and about 75 percent ice. The ice consists primarily of frozen water,\nwith smaller amounts of methane, ammonia, and carbon\ndioxide radicals.\n\nSo far approximately 850 comets have been recorded. The nucleus of comets range in size from about 0.3 mile (0.5 kilometer) in diameter up to 42 miles (88 kilometers) in diameter. The tail, however, can be up to\nto 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) long. The tail of a comet always faces away from the sun\nas a result of the solar wind.\n\nWhen a comet approaches the sun its ice\nbegins to sublime (i.e. it passes from a solid to a gas form).\nThe sublimed gas also contains dust particles. The\ngas and dust spread out around the nucleus to form a large, thin atmosphere\nthat is called the coma. Sunlight causes the gas atoms in the coma to glow. The\namount of gasses present in the coma determine how bright the comet will be.\n\nAstronomers refer to comets as short-period comets or long-period comets. Short-period comets have orbital periods of less than 200 years and are usually members of the inner solar system. Long-period comets, on the other hand, can have periods on the order of millions of years and may have orbits that extend halfway to the nearest stars.\n\nStars are gigantic globes of incandescent gases (primarily hydrogen). They are\npowered by thermonuclear fusion which is the process of combining two light elements to form a heavier element plus large amounts of energy.\n\nThe brightness of a\nstar depends upon its size and temperature. Astronomers refer to the brightness\nof a star as its magnitude. Magnitude is defined in two ways, the apparent magnitude and the absolute magnitude. Apparent magnitude refers to how bright the star appears from Earth . Absolute magnitude is the value its apparent magnitude would be if the star were a distance of 10 parsecs (a parsec is equal to 3.26 light years) from Earth.\nStars can range in size from one tenth the size of our sun to more than 100 times as large.\n\nThe most common variety of stars include 1) giants and supergiants, 2) main sequence stars, and 3) white dwarfs. Giants and supergiants are generally yellow or red in color. These are very large stars that\nradiate huge amounts of energy but are generally cooler than our sun. Main sequence stars make up the majority of stars that we observe. These stars tend to radiate energy that is proportional to their surface\ntemperature. Hence, hot main sequence stars emit much more energy that cooler main sequence stars.\nWhite dwarf stars are very small in size. They are white in color and they emit more energy per unit area\nof surface than our sun. However, the TOTAL energy output from a white dwarf is much lower than our sun as a result\nof their small size."}

{"text":"Shedding light on supernovae\n\nA gigantic, so called type II supernova finishes the life of heavy stars that are about ten times larger than our sun. It is the most powerful known, yet very rare explosion in the cosmos. A supernova has penetrating influences on the universe. As a result of it, neutron stars or black holes are born, and those are assumed to produce many chemical elements heavier than iron, possibly up to uranium. They are not produced anywhere else. It is also assumed that supernovae are behind the birth of many stars and planets. Certainly, a supernova produced the Earth and all the iron inside of it.\n\nVolume-rendered snapshots from a 3D simulation of the supernova explosion of a star with 11 times the mass of our Sun. There are bubbles and plumes of hot, neutrino-heated plasma in a violently convective layer around the central neutron star (not visible). The expansion of these bubbles triggers the onset of the supernova explosion near the center of the massive star. The accelerating explosion blast wave appears as a transparent, slightly spherical enveloping surface around the plumes. Image courtesy Hans-Thomas Janka, Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics.\n\nHans-Thomas Janka, a researcher from the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany performs research on the birth mechanisms of supernovae with his team. The subjects of their studies are so called heavy stars; at the end of their life explode as supernovae and collapse into very dense neutron stars or black holes. Only recently, Janka's group have managed to develop a three-dimensional supernova simulation code from sophisticated two-dimensional models.\n\n\"Details of the mechanisms that lead to the explosion are still uncovered, but recent two-dimensional modeling suggests that the neutrinos that radiate from the hot core cause the explosion. Now we are hoping that the new three-dimensional modelling efforts shed some light on the mechanism,\" Janka said.\n\nThe research also aims to find an answer to why some stars become neutron stars while others turn into black holes. \"We hope that the modelling will bring reassurance to supernovae also being a source for the heaviest chemical elements such as gold, uranium, and platinum.\"\n\nThe birth of a supernova\n\nHeavy stars are very bright, but their life can be very short for a star, even just a few million years. While the heavy flood of neutrinos is produced and it flies from the core to the outer layers with staggering force. The outer layers explode into space as a gigantic supernova.\n\nNeutrinos have a key role\n\nVisualization of the interior structure of the convective plumes and the central neutron star in a supernova. Neutrino-heated, rising hot matter is visible in yellow, orange, and red. Cooler, in-falling plasma is shown in green and blue.Image courtesy Hans-Thomas Janka, Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics.\n\nEven though the explosions of supernovae and their impact are known quite well, what happens during the first seconds is still unclear. The neutrinos are considered to be the impetus for supernovae, but making three-dimensional models of the complex energy flows will still take a long time, even with high-performance computers.\n\nInformation about how the neutrinos move inside a core that is collapsing into a neutron star has mainly been gained through complex hydrodynamic and neutrino physics formulae, since the core of a star has been an unreachable research target. In fact, research of supernovae has only started from the point where the wave of the explosion has proceeded to the outer layers of the star.\n\nWhen the collapse begins in the layers that are closer to the core, the extremely hot neutrinos cause the stellar plasma to boil when they start to leak into the outer layers of the star, transferring energy as they pass the collapsing matter. The violent turbulent motions proceeding in the material add to the chaos.\n\nIt is almost as if the neutrinos cook the material in the outer layers of the star. The phenomenon is similar to a pot left on the stove when it starts to overflow, Janka said. At the same time a supernova produces new chemical elements or materials, such as radioactive nickel and titanium that cause the far-visible brightness of supernovae.\n\nCostly computing time\n\nThe greatest challenges now are the cost of computer time and the immense requirements of the computer's capabilities due to the physical complexity of the three-dimensional modeling.\n\nThe computers must be of the very latest generation, and adding the third dimension will make simulations at least a hundred times more expensive than the traditional two-dimensional modeling, Janka said. Two-dimensional modeling was possible with computing time grants through DECI-5 and DECI-6 projects. The allotted resources were used, first, for an explorative study of differences between models in two and three dimensions, still making radical simplifications of the crucial neutrino effects. Moreover, the DECI grant was the basis for assembling and testing the computer code to perform three-dimensional supernova simulations including an elaborate neutrino treatment with PRACE resources.\n\nRunning one full, low resolution three-dimensional model of a supernova takes half a year of 8,192 of the strongest Intel Nehalem processor cores, working in parallel. That equals a total of 36 million computing hours. Fortunately, the group's code is able to make very efficient use even of tens of thousands of processor cores.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nComments You could my website at jual lingerie, it will show you more about lingerie babydoll\n\ny flo\n\nI like the valuable information you provide in your articlesI will bookmark your weblog and check again here frequentlyI am quite sure I will learn many new stuff right here!

{"text":"Galaxies coming of age in cosmic blobs\n\nThe \"coming of age\" of galaxies and black holes has been pinpointed, thanks to new data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and other telescopes. This discovery helps resolve the true nature of gigantic blobs of gas observed around very young galaxies.\n\nAbout a decade ago, astronomers discovered immense reservoirs of hydrogen gas -- which they named \"blobs\" \u2013 while conducting surveys of young distant galaxies. The blobs are glowing brightly in optical light, but the source of immense energy required to power this glow and the nature of these objects were unclear.\n\nA long observation from Chandra has identified the source of this energy for the first time. The X-ray data show that a significant source of power within these colossal structures is from growing supermassive black holes partially obscured by dense layers of dust and gas. The fireworks of star formation in galaxies are also seen to play an important role, thanks to Spitzer Space Telescope and ground-based observations.\n\n\"For ten years the secrets of the blobs had been buried from view, but now we've uncovered their power source,\" said James Geach of Durham University in the United Kingdom, who led the study. \"Now we can settle some important arguments about what role they played in the original construction of galaxies and black holes.\"\n\nThis composite image shows one of the brightest objects observed in a study of 29 blobs located in a single field. Glowing hydrogen gas in the blob is shown by a Lyman-alpha optical image (colored yellow) from the Subaru telescope. A galaxy located in the blob is visible in a broadband optical image (white) from the Hubble Space Telescope and an infrared image from the Spitzer Space Telescope (red). Finally, the Chandra X-ray Observatory image (blue) shows evidence for a growing supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy. Radiation and outflows from this active black hole are lighting up and heating the gas in the blob.\n\nGalaxies are believed to form when gas flows inwards under the pull of gravity and cools by emitting radiation. This process should stop when the gas is heated by radiation and outflows from galaxies and their black holes. Bl The implication is that blobs represent a stage when the galaxies and black holes are just starting to switch off their rapid growth because of these heating processes. This is a crucial stage of the evolution of galaxies and black holes - known as \"feedback\" - \"Massive galaxies must go through a stage like this or they would form too many stars and so end up ridiculously large by the present day.\"\n\nChandra and a collection of other telescopes including Spitzer have observed 29 blobs in one large field in the sky dubbed \"SSA22.\" These blobs, which are several hundred thousand light years across, are seen when the Universe is only about two billion years old, or roughly 15% of its current age.\n\nThis is an of artist's representations showing what one of the galaxies inside a blob might look like if viewed at a relatively close distance. Repeated supernova explosions and strong mass loss from the stars before they are destroyed will generate powerful winds that expand outwards, illuminating and heating the surrounding gas.\n\n(Photo Credit: CXC\/M. Weiss)\n\nIn five of these blobs, the Chandra data revealed the telltale signature of growing supermassive black holes - a point-like source with luminous X-ray emission. These giant black holes are thought to reside at the centers of most galaxies today, including our own. Another three of the blobs in this field show possible evidence for such black holes. Based on further observations, including Spitzer data, the research team was able to determine that several of these galaxies are also dominated by remarkable levels of star formation.\n\nThe radiation and powerful outflows from these black holes and bursts of star formation are, according to calculations, powerful enough to light up the hydrogen gas in the blobs they inhabit. In the cases where the signatures of these black holes were not detected, the blobs are generally fainter. The authors show that black holes bright enough to power these blobs would be too dim to be detected given the length of the Chandra observations.\n\nBesides explaining the power source of the blobs, these results help explain their future. Under the heating scenario, the gas in the blobs will not cool down to form stars but will add to the hot gas found between galaxies. SSA22 itself could evolve into a massive galaxy cluster.\n\n\"In the beginning the blobs would have fed their galaxies, but what we see now are more like leftovers,\" said Geach. \"This means we'll have to look even further back in time to catch galaxies and black holes in the act of forming from blobs.\"\n\nhis is the first of a pair of artist's representations showing what one of the galaxies inside a blob might look like if viewed at a relatively close distance. The spiral arms of the galaxy are seen in yellow and white. A two-sided outflow powered by the supermassive black hole buried inside the middle of the galaxy is shown in bright yellow, above and below the galaxy. This outflow illuminates and heats gas surrounding the galaxy, enabling this blob to be seen across billions of light"}
{"text":"Gravitational waves---ripples of spacetime curvature---are poised to open a new window on the universe: the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO), scheduled for completion in 2015, is expected to detect between 1 and 1000 gravitational waveforms per year. Among the most important sources for Advanced LIGO are collisions of two black holes (which can radiate as gravitational waves more energy than a supernova) and of a black hole and a neutron star (which can radiate both gravitational and electromagnetic waves, raising the prospect of ``multi-messenger astronomy.''). Finding these gravitational waves in noisy LIGO data requires accurate predictions of the expected waveforms, but because all analytic approximations break down, the waves can only be predicted using numerical simulations. In this talk, I will discuss recent progress and challenges in supercomputer simulations of black hole-black hole and black hole-neutron star collisions, focusing on the particularly challenging case of black holes that are very rapidly rotating."}

{"text":"June 12, 2012\n\nNew evidence from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory challenges prevailing ideas about how supermassive black holes grow in the centers of galaxies. Astronomers long have thought that a supermassive black hole and the bulge of stars at the center of its host galaxy grow at the same rate -- the bigger the bulge, the bigger the black hole.\n\nA new study of Chandra data has revealed two nearby galaxies whose supermassive black holes are growing faster than the galaxies themselves. The mass of a giant black hole at the center of a galaxy typically is a tiny fraction (about 0.2 percent) of the mass contained in the bulge, or region of densely packed stars, surrounding it.\n\nThe targets of the latest Chandra study, galaxies NGC 4342 and NGC 4291, have black holes that are 10 times to 35 times more massive than they should be compared to their bulges. The new observations with Chandra show that the halos, or massive envelopes of dark matter in which these galaxies reside, also are overweight. The new study suggests the two supermassive black holes and their evolution are tied to their dark matter halos and they did not grow in tandem with the galactic bulges.\n\nIn this view, the black holes and dark matter halos are not overweight, but the total mass in the galaxies is too low. \"This gives us more evidence of a link between two of the most mysterious and darkest phenomena in astrophysics -- black holes and dark matter -- in these galaxies,\" said Akos Bogdan of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) in Cambridge, Mass, who led the new study.\n\nNGC 4342 and NGC 4291 are close to Earth in cosmic terms, at distances of 75 million and 85 million light years, respectively. Astronomers had known from previous observations that these galaxies host black holes with relatively large masses, but astronomers are not certain what is responsible for the disparity.\n\nBased on the new Chandra observations, however, they are able to rule out a phenomenon known as tidal stripping. Tidal stripping occurs when some of a galaxy's stars are stripped away by gravity during a close encounter with another galaxy. If such tidal stripping had taken place, the halos also mostly would have been missing. Because dark matter extends farther away from the galaxies, it is more loosely tied to them than the stars and is more likely to be pulled away.\n\nTo rule out tidal stripping, astronomers used Chandra to look for evidence of hot, X-ray emitting gas around the two galaxies. Because the pressure of hot gas \u2013 estimated from X-ray images -- balances the gravitational pull of all the matter in the galaxy, the new Chandra data can provide information about the dark matter halos. The hot gas was found to be widely distributed around both NGC 4342 and NGC 4291, implying that each galaxy has an unusually massive dark matter halo, and therefore that that tidal stripping is unlikely.\n\n\"This is the clearest evidence we have, in the nearby universe, for black holes growing faster than their host galaxy,\" said co-author Bill Forman, also of CfA. \"It's not that the galaxies have been compromised by close encounters, but instead they had some sort of arrested development.\"\n\nHow can the mass of a black hole grow faster than the stellar mass of its host galaxy? The study's authors suggest that a large concentration of gas spinning slowly in the galactic center is what the black hole consumes very early in its history. It grows quickly, and as it grows, the amount of gas it can accrete, or swallow, increases along with the energy output from the accretion. Once the black hole reaches a critical mass, outbursts powered by the continued consumption of gas prevent cooling and limits the production of new stars.\n\n\"It's possible that the supermassive black hole reached a hefty size before there were many stars at all in the galaxy,\" said Bogdan. \"That is a significant change in our way of thinking about how galaxies and black holes evolve together.\"\n\nComments\n\nWhat will it take for astronomers to finally bury deep that terrible term... \"black hole\"?\n\nCan't you see? Those galaxies are appearing out of nowhere! The power centers (black holes) are in fact portals that downstep energy coming from higher dimensions. They turn it into a \"slowed down\" matter and build their own galaxies around them. Like a flower budding! Galactic arms are petals. Gods are having fun! :-)\n\nSo stop thinking \"devourers of stars or anything else\" and start thinking \"creators\".\n\nA black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity prevents anything, including light, from escaping. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently ...its only a matter of time before we find the truth..\n\nA recent report by Professor Roger Penrose from Oxford University says that concentric circles discovered in the background microwaves of the universe provides evidence of events that took place before the universe came into being. Possibly meaning that the universe has expanded and contracted (against current thinking that the expansion of the universe will go on forever) upto 5 times before. Together with this report about the growth of black holes, it seems clear to me that what happens is that the SM Black holes at the heart of all galaxies will eventually consume all of the matter in its host galaxy given enough time. By which point, the mass of the SM Black holes will be so massive that they will be attracted to each other forming an unimaginably huge singularity which might well be the seed for the next big bang. Common sense suggests that things either happen only once as in some sort of freak event, or they happen an innumerable amount of times. In this vein I also think that there must be more than 1 universe in existence, multiverses, all doing exactly the same thing as our universe, expanding and contracting on and on ad infinitum."}

Credit: 2010-2012 Zooniverse\n\n(Phys.org)\u2014A new galactic game launching today lets citizen scientists identify the glowing clouds where future stars will be born. The online experience, called Clouds, is a new addition to the Milky Way Project, where everyone can help astronomers sort and measure our galaxy. Clouds features images and data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and the Herschel Space Observatory, a European Space Agency mission with important participation from NASA.\n\nIn the rapid-fire game, players gauge whether a targeted section of a presented image is a cloud, a \"hole\"\u2014an empty region of space\u2014or something in between. The cataloging of these snapshots of the local cosmos will help astronomers learn more about the architecture and character of our home galaxy, the Milky Way.\n\nThe organizers of Clouds encourage astronomy enthusiasts to start playing now, because with enough participation, important insights into the Milky Way could come as soon as early next year.\n\n\"We're really excited to launch Clouds and see results back from our giant volunteer team of amateur scientists,\" said Robert Simpson, a postdoctoral researcher in astronomy at Oxford University, England, and principal investigator of the Milky Way Project. \"We think the community can blast through all these data fairly quickly. We may even be done by the spring, and that would be an amazing result for citizen science.\"\n\nClouds joins its predecessor Milky Way Project game, Bubbles, as one of the many \"crowdsourced\" efforts underway at Zooniverse, home to the Internet's biggest and most popular online citizen science projects.\n\nThe crowdsourcing concept involves having a lot of people evaluate the same image or pieces of data. A consensus decision on some aspect of the image is then reached through the collective \"wisdom of crowds.\" Crowdsourced citizen science becomes especially important when humans can do a better job at analyzing images or objects than a computer can. The Clouds game is an example of just such an exercise in which eyeballs and brains beat out cameras and computer algorithms.\n\nThe goal of Clouds is to tag the dense, cold cores of gas and dust known as infrared dark clouds. These clouds collapse under their own gravity and then burst forth as new stars. An empty region of space, however, can look rather like one of these dark clouds and deceive a computer accordingly. \"Automated routines have tried to decide which of these objects are holes and which are true infrared dark clouds, but the task is often tricky and it takes a human eye to decide,\" said Simpson.\n\nClouds combines infrared observations from Herschel and Spitzer to reveal cool clouds and holes throughout the Milky Way's disk. The Herschel data, at a wavelength of 250 microns, appears in yellow throughout the game. The Spitzer data, at 8 microns, is rendered in blue.\n\nTogether with its companion Bubbles game, Clouds serves as another example of how Zooniverse makes cutting-edge scientific investigation freely available to the general public. \"Citizen science through Zooniverse has been a real boon to research in fields ranging from astronomy to biology to history,\" noted Simpson. \"We feel very fortunate to be able to send science work out to computer, tablet and smartphone screens and for people to collaborate with us in a quest to better understand our universe.\"\n\nMore information: For those interested in looking for infrared clouds and contributing to the Milky Way Project, visit the following link:  To learn of other citizen science-based efforts, check out the Zooniverse:  This glowing emerald nebula seen by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope is reminiscent of the glowing ring wielded by the superhero Green Lantern.

For decades, astronomers thought that cluster stars formed at the same time, in the same place, and from the same material, and have co-evolved for billions of years. Scientists now believe that they can go through several periods of intense stellar formation rather than the previously accepted single burst. Globular clusters are among the earliest settlers of our Milky Way Galaxy, born during our galaxy's formation. The stars were born within 200 million years very early in the life of the 12.5-billion-year-old massive cluster. Clusters are compact swarms of typically hundreds of thousands of stars held together by gravity. Of the about 150 known globular clusters in our Milky Way Galaxy, NGC 2808 is one of the most massive, containing more than 1 million stars.

Astronomers have unearthed secrets from the grave of the star that blasted apart in a supernova explosion long ago. The discovery, represents the first time astronomers have been able to resurrect the life history of a supernova remnant in our own galaxy. Cassiopeia A is the burnt-out corpse of a massive star that ended its life in a fiery supernova about 11,300 years ago. Because it is 11,000 light-years from Earth, the light from its explosion would have reached Earth, sweeping right past it, about 300 years ago.

The extra distance places the galaxy in the middle of a group of about 10 galaxies centered on the spiral galaxy IC 342.

Over the last 1,500 years, nearly one and a half times the mass of our Sun has been lost by the central star of the Boomerang Nebula in an ejection process known as a bipolar outflow. The nebula's name is derived from its symmetric structure as seen from ground-based telescopes.

Approximately 100 million years ago, a smaller galaxy plunged through the heart of Cartwheel galaxy, creating ripples of brief star formation. In this image, the first ripple appears as an ultraviolet-bright blue outer ring. The blue outer ring is so powerful in the GALEX observations that it indicates the Cartwheel is one of the most powerful UV-emitting galaxies in the nearby universe. Although astronomers have not identified exactly which galaxy collided with the Cartwheel, two of three candidate galaxies can be seen in this image to the bottom left of the ring, one as a neon blob and the other as a green spiral.

The three pictured galaxies -- NGC 7173, middle left, NCG 7174,middle right, and NGC 7176, lower right,-- are part of the Hickson Compact Group 90, named after astronomer Paul Hickson, who first catalogued these small clusters of galaxies in the 1980s. NGC 7173 and NGC 7176 appear to be smooth, normal elliptical galaxies without much gas and dust. In stark contrast, NGC 7174 is a mangled spiral galaxy, barely clinging to independent existence as it is ripped apart by its close neighbors. The strong tidal interaction surging through the galaxies has dragged a significant number of stars away from their home galaxies. These stars are now spread out, forming a tenuous luminous component in the galaxy group. (AP Photo\/ NASA, ESA - R.

It consists of NGC 6621, to the left, and NGC 6622, to the right. NGC 6621 is the larger of the two, and is a very disturbed spiral galaxy. The encounter has pulled a long tail out of NGC 6621 that has now wrapped behind its body. The collision has also triggered extensive star formation between the two galaxies. Scientists believe that Arp 81 has a richer collection of young massive star clusters than the notable Antennae galaxies, which are much closer than Arp 81.

You can't get a star to operate on any \"dust\". The temperatures required for fusion reactions at the core of a star would render \"dust\" completely irrelevant: dust particles would be dispersed into individual atomic NUCLEI before the most robust particles (say, the size of asteroids several kilometers across - and yes, they're \"dust particles\") substantially penetrated the SURFACE of a star!\n\nCommonman's one-word answer is correct (although he doesn't bother to explain why): NO, as the answer to part of your question, and NO, the whole assumption you bring with it."}

{"text":"Quasars Under the Lens\n\nEver since they were discovered in 1962, quasars have intrigued\nastronomers for being the size of solar systems, but brighter than\na hundred galaxies. Astronomers have theorized that only\nsupermassive black holes, lurking at their center, are dense and\npowerful enough to keep such relatively small objects glowing as\nbrightly as they do, but solid evidence was lacking. This week,\nhowever, astronomers presented the strongest evidence yet that\nblack holes do indeed power quasars.\n\nBecause quasars lie billions of light-years from Earth, even the\nmost advanced telescopes have not been able to probe them in much\ndetail. Theorists think they are fountains of radiation streaming\nfrom disks of matter that heat up to many millions of degrees as\nthey spiral in toward black holes, and preliminary data have\nsupported this assumption. Astronomers Xinyu Dai and Christopher\nKochanek, both of Ohio State University in Columbus, thought that a\nprinciple known as gravitational lensing might help shed more light\non quasars. Gravitational lensing occurs when massive objects such\nas galaxies bend and focus incoming light from more distant\nquasars, acting like giant magnifying glasses and making it easier\nfor astronomers to study them.\n\nIn a session yesterday at the American Astronomical Society\nmeeting in San Francisco, California, Xinyu described how he and\nKochanek used gravitational lensing to detect the presence of\nsupermassive black holes by comparing both optical and x-ray images\nof two quasars. Over months, they gathered data for an hour a night\nfirst using SMARTS, the Small and Medium Aperture Research\nTelescope System, and then from the orbiting Chandra X-ray\nObservatory accessed at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for\nAstrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The combined data\nrevealed unmistakable signatures of supermassives at work. The most\nenergetic wavelengths of radiation appeared closest to the center\nof the quasars--the place where, if the models were correct, matter\nwas being ripped apart most violently.\n\n\"We all fully expected that the source of the x-ray light comes\nfrom closer to the black hole, while the source of the optical\nlight comes from much farther out, and that's what they see quite\nnicely in their lensing result,\" says astrophysicist Chris Reynolds\nof the University of Maryland, College Park. Reynolds called the\ntechnique used by Xinyu and Kochanek clever because of the way it\nallows a different view inside the super bright objects. \"We can\nimagine making maps of where the light comes from around the black\nholes powering quasars, and this is the first step down that\nroad.\"\n\nFor now, even a glimpse will give astronomers a big boost in\nunderstanding what is going on. \"There are many models that try to\ndescribe what's happening inside a quasar,\" Xinyu says. \"Before,\nnone of them could be ruled out--now some of them can.\""}

Lying within the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of our own Milky Way, this region of star formation features a colossal superbubble of material expanding outwards due to the influence of the cluster of young stars at its heart that sculpts the interstellar landscape and drives forward the nebula's evolution. Credit: ESO\/Manu Mejias\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- ESO's Very Large Telescope captured this striking view of the nebula around the star cluster NGC 1929 within the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of our own Milky Way. A colossal example of what astronomers call a superbubble dominates this stellar nursery. It is being carved by the winds from bright young stars and the shockwaves from supernova explosions.\n\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud is a small neighbouring galaxy to the Milky Way. It contains many regions where clouds of gas and dust are forming new stars. One such region, surrounding the star cluster NGC 1929, is shown in close-up in this new image from ESO's Very Large Telescope. This nebula is officially known as LHA 120\u2013N 44, or just N 44 for short. Hot young stars in NGC 1929 are emitting intense ultraviolet light and causing the gas to glow. This effect highlights the aptly-named superbubble, a vast shell of material around 325 by 250 light-years across. For comparison, the nearest star to our Sun is just over four light-years distant.\n\nThe N 44 superbubble has been produced by the combination of two processes. Firstly, stellar winds \u2014 streams of charged particles from the very hot and massive stars in the central cluster \u2014 cleared out the central region. Then massive cluster stars exploded as supernovae creating shockwaves and pushing the gas out further to form the glowing bubble.\n\nThis video is not supported by your browser at this time.\n\nThis sequence starts with a wide-field view of the southern Milky Way and the two Magellanic Clouds. As we zoom in, we can see many of the clusters and star formation regions within the Large Magellanic Cloud. In the final sequence we close in on one region, around the star cluster NGC 1929, which features a huge superbubble. This detailed view was captured by the FORS instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope at the Paranal Observatory in Chile. Credit: ESO\/Digitized Sky Survey 2\/R. Gendler\/S. Brunier.

In the first discovery, U.S. Geological Survey astronomers at the Palomar Observatory in San Diego County observed bright \"pearls on a string\" near Jupiter.\n\nSometimes, astronomy is unreal. Really. Those spectacular pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope of exploding stars and nebulous gas clouds and stars emerging from dusty cocoons are all--to one extent or another--computer-enhanced. The rose-red Martian landscapes and candy-colored rings around Saturn don't reflect what you'd see in a telescope from your backyard. The images are processed, spiffed up, airbrushed and painted like so many Hollywood stars.\n\nScientists led by a Pasadena astronomer said Tuesday they have used an extraordinarily long exposure from the Hubble Space Telescope to create sharp images of a 4-billion-year-old galaxy cluster that confirms theories that the universe is evolving--\"and at a pretty rapid rate.\" At the same time, in the background of those images, the astronomers serendipitously stumbled upon what appears to be a previously unknown, 10-billion-year-old galaxy cluster.\n\nA group of U.S. astronomers has reported finding what could be dark matter, a key missing component of the universe, in a distant galaxy. The find appears to bolster a similar discovery reported last year. Scientists have been searching for years for evidence that dark matter exists.\n\nA celestial show that has delighted sky-watchers for the past 1,900 years will paint the northeastern sky with meteors this weekend in what is expected to be the best Perseid Meteor Shower in several years. The shower peaks every year on Aug. 10 or 11, when the Earth crosses a broad stream of debris left over from the passage of Comet Swift-Tuttle. But this year, for the first time since 1988, the meteors will streak through the Earth's atmosphere on moonless nights."}

It is not to be confused with Eta Carinae's Homunculus Nebula.\n\nThe Carina Nebula (also known as the Great Nebula in Carina, the Eta Carina Nebula, NGC 3372, or Caldwell 92, as well as the Grand Nebula) is a large bright nebula that has within its boundaries several related open clusters of stars. Some papers generally refer to this as the Carina Nebula, mostly because of differentiating the many paper published on this object, but the historical precedence as determined by southern observers like James Dunlop and John Herschel, who have both termed it the Eta Argus Nebula or Eta Carina Nebula.[4]..\"[dubious\u2013 discuss] John Herschel also describes \"The star \u03b7 Argus, with the Great nebula about it.\" [5], with many of his subsequent published papers supporting this. [6][7]\n\nThe nebula is one of the largest diffuse nebulae in our skies. Although it is some four times as large and even brighter than the famous Orion Nebula, the Carina Nebula is much less well known, due to its location in the southern sky. It was discovered by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1751\u201352 from the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nEta Carinae is a highly luminoushypergiantstar. Estimates of its mass range from 100 to 150 times the mass of the Sun, and its luminosity is about four million times that of the Sun.\n\nThis object is currently the most massive star that can be studied in great detail, because of its location and size still had the highest confirmed luminosity, based on data across a broad range of wavelengths.) Stars with more than 80 times the mass of the Sun produce more than a million times as much light as the Sun.

This small nebula is known as the Homunculus Nebula (from the Latin meaning Little Man), and is believed to have been ejected in an enormous outburst in 1841 which briefly made Eta Carinae the second-brightest star in the sky bright filaments of hot, fluorescing gas, silhouetted against the much brighter background nebula.

{"text":".: Dark Solar System 2006\n\nIn cosmology, dark energy is a hypothetical form of energy which\npermeates all of space and has strong negative pressure. According to\nthe theory of relativity, the effect of such a negative pressure is\nqualitatively similar to a force acting in opposition to gravity at\nlarge scales. Invoking such an effect is currently the most popular\nmethod for explaining recent observations that the universe appears to\nbe expanding at an accelerating rate, as well as accounting for a\nsignificant portion of the missing mass in the universe.\n\nTwo proposed forms for dark energy are the cosmological constant, a\nconstant energy density filling space homogeneously, and quintessence,\na dynamic field whose energy density can vary in time and space.\nDistinguishing between the alternatives requires high-precision\nmeasurements of the expansion of the universe to understand how the\nspeed of the expansion changes over time. The rate of expansion is\nparameterized by the cosmological equation of state. Measuring the\nequation of state of dark energy is one of the biggest efforts in\nobservational cosmology today.\n\nAdding a cosmological constant to the standard theory of cosmology\n(i.e. the FLRW metric) has led to a model for cosmology known as the\nLambda-CDM model. This model agrees closely with established\ncosmological observations.\n\nAs NASA reports indicate, 70 percent or more of the universe consists\nof dark energy, about which we know next to nothing.\n\nAt the beginning of March, 2006 the satellite of China National Space\nAdministration, DARKSTAR started operations, observing in neutrino the\nsolar corona.\n\nIt results a sensational information that our system also contains\ndark energy.

{"text":"Biggest Ever Cosmic Explosion Observed 7.5 Billion Light Years Away\n\nby Ian O'Neill on March 20, 2008\n\nWant to stay on top of all the space news? Follow @universetoday on Twitter\n\nA record-breaking gamma ray burst was observed yesterday (March 19th) by NASA's Swift satellite. After red-shift observations were analysed, astronomers realized they were looking at an explosion half-way across the Universe, some 7.5 billion light years away. This means that the burst occurred 7.5 billion years ago, when the Universe was only half the age it is now. This shatters the record for the most distant object that can be seen with the naked eye\u2026\nGamma ray bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful explosions observed in the Universe, and the most powerful explosions to occur since the Big Bang. A GRB is generated during the collapse of a massive star into a black hole or neutron star. The physics behind a GRB is highly complex, but the most accepted model is that as a massive star collapses to form a black hole, the in falling material is energetically converted into a blast of high energy radiation. It is thought the burst is highly collimated from the poles of the collapsing star. Any local matter downstream of the burst will be vaporized. This has led to the thought that historic terrestrial extinctions over the last hundreds of millions of years could be down to the Earth being irradiated by gamma radiation from such a blast within the Milky Way. But for now, all GRBs are observed outside our galaxy, out of harms way.\n\nThis record-breaking GRB was observed by the Swift observatory (launched into Earth orbit in 2004) which surveys the sky for GRBs. Using its Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), the initiation of an event can be relayed to Earth within 20 seconds. Once located, the spacecraft turns all its instruments toward the burst to measure the spectrum of light emitted from the afterglow. This observatory is being used to understand how GRBs are initiated and how the hot gas and dust surrounding the event evolves.\n\nThis particular GRB was observed in the constellation of Bo\u00f6tes at 2:12 a.m. (EDT), March 19th. Telescopes on the ground and in space quickly turned to Bo\u00f6tes to analyse the afterglow of the burst. Later in the day, the Very Large Telescope in Chile and the Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas measured the burst's redshift at 0.94. From this measure, scientists were able to pinpoint our distance from the explosion. This red shift corresponds to a distance of 7.5 billion light years, signifying that this huge GRB happened 7.5 billion years ago, over half the distance across the observable universeVisible to the human eye? How can we try to find it? Constellation? Hemysphere? Well\u2026 if it is south one\u2026 game over to me! But if it's north i would like to see it very much! Can someone help me?\n\nMark\n\nI witnesssed this with the naked eye. My daughter and I were star gazing and I happened to be extremely lucky to be looking right at it when it occurred. I was in my driveway in Dayton, OH area.\n\nDidn't realize what I was witnessing until reading about it later on the net.\n\nMichael\n\nTraveling 7.5 billion light years, like any light or cosmic rays, the dispersal is immense \u2013 at that distance, the gamma rays are harmless. And it will no longer be visible with the unaided eye because GRB's are relatively brief events \u2013 the afterglow barely visible with a highly specialized telescope.\nBut ponder this: with science claiming an age for the universe at about 13.7 billion years \u2013 how is it the universe supposed to be over 150 billion light years across?\nAnd with the moon about 240.000 miles distant, why did it take days, for the Apollos to reach at 25,000 mph, (instead of about 10 hours)?\n\nMichael\n\nNot being particularly religious by nature, I still ponder the beginnings of it all and the structure of matter and energy \u2013 the relationship between light, gravity and electromagnetiism \u2013 the strong and weak nuclear forces. The possibility that a grand unification theory is real \u2013 and was laid down by an omnipotent designer\/mathematician.\nOops\u2026 maybe I am religiuos, but when the religiuos begin to group, I get nervous.\n\nMichael\n\n*religious even\n\nholyavengerone\n\nMichael said: \"And with the moon about 240.000 miles distant, why did it take days, for the Apollos to reach at 25,000 mph, (instead of about 10 hours)?\"\n\nFor that one, I can tell you one thing: they didn't go there in a straight line. They did increasingly larger orbits until they reached it. So they did travel a lot more than the 240,000 miles you quote.\n\nAs for the size of the universe, not sure where you get your number from, but it can be explained by space inflation, especially in the first few moments of the universe.\n\nalphonso richardson\n\nWow, Mark, you & your daughter were very lucky \u2013 you get to talk about a possible once-in-a lifetime event.\nI is well jealous\n\nMark\n\nThanks Alphons. Yes, we were ridiculously lucky. I have checked several blogs to see if any one else has reported seeing thi sevent and so far \u2013 noone.\n\nCould it be possible we were the only ones on the planet to see this? Any one else out there know of any one that has seen this?\n\nMichael\n\nholyavengerone\nIncreasingly larger orbits? Orbiting what? Sorry, but that makes no sense, whatsoever.\nThe Apollo settled into earth orbits before increasing speed to break free and begin the journey to moon orbit, (a distance of about 240,000, possibly as much as 255,000 miles because of the moon's eliptical orbit). So why would it take days, ( I keep hearing 3 or so), at 25,000 mph?\nAnd the trajectories were very near a straight line.\n\nMichael\n\nAnd a universal, iron-clad law of physics, proposed by Einstein and endosed by the physics community, is that nothing, ever, can travel faster than the speed of light. Hence my curiosity about a universe supposedly more than 150 bliion light years across having been formed in about 13.7 billion yerars. Maybe some cosmic math that completely escapes me.\n\nMaccas\n\nMichael said: \"And with the moon about 240.000 miles distant, why did it take days, for the Apollos to reach at 25,000 mph, (instead of about 10 hours)?\"\n\u2026..Clearly the additional time was to provide for the need for long Ad breaks on TV due to the worldwide commercial interest in going to the moon\n\nre your question of the size of the Universe. I don't know where the 150B comes from but I put a related question to an online uni astronomer and was told something like (hope I got this right as was years ago now) \u2013 that the universe didn't start as a single point 13.7 billion years ago that exploded out from such that there is a \"centre\" but more of a soup that changed at the point of the big bang and expanded from that to present day. what we see as the universe continues to expand is that around us that light left 13.7B years ago, ie. it is much larger than what we see we just see the sphere around us of light just reaching us now that started 13.7B years ago. hmmm..the more I think about this the more I get screwed up\u2026help!?\n\nMaccas\n\nMark,\nback about Sept 2000 in the southerly direction of the Southern Cross (am in Australia) I saw a similar event in the sky to that you describe but which lasted for about 20sec before fading & was very bright, maybe nearly as bright as Venus if I recall correctly (long ago now). It illuminated to maximum brightness quickly, caught my attention, was steady in brightness & without motion & I remember thinking it couldn't possibly be a meteor & it didn't look as though it wasn't going to fade but then faded.\nI assumed it may have been a supernova at the time but didn't know what to do about it or who to call etc. & assumed somebody more important than a casual backyard observer would have spotted it.\nI would like to know more about what it may have been if anybody knows of such an event around that time. I think I could reconstruct more detail as the event stuck in my mind thats for sure & I made a reasonable mental note of it, time, date, approximate location in the sky. Trouble is I thought that if it was something very far away then even a small amount area of sky is still a huge area. Regret not following up at the time now but I think I started to go to the phone when it faded."}
{"text":"On the trail of cosmic bullets\n\nThis diagram shows data recorded by Pierre Auger Observatory on March 5, 2005. A cosmic ray hit the atmosphere at close to the speed of light, creating billions of secondary particles that rained down over the pampa and triggered 14 of 1500 surface detectors (colored dots.) Meanwhile, telescopes around the edge of the array watched for the faint glow of particles hitting nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere. Together these techniques allow scientists to trace the origins of the most energetic particles in the universe.\n\nSource: Pierre Auger Observatory\n\nOn the trail of cosmic bullets By Kurt Riesselmann\n\nDo the most energetic particles in the universe come from supermassive black holes? New results from the Pierre Auger Observatory make that case.\n\nArgentina's Pampa Amarilla is a rather remote place, a dry plain stretching thousands of miles against the spectacular backdrop of the rugged, snowcapped peaks of the Andes.\n\nLike every other place on Earth, the yellow pampa is bathed in a constant shower of cosmic rays\u2014protons and atomic nuclei that fly through the universe at close to the speed of light. While some are known to come from the sun, most take a meandering path that gives no clue to where they came from.\n\nOnce in a while, an unusually powerful cosmic ray strikes the Earth's atmosphere with almost as much energy as a bullet. Fortunately, such a projectile is no danger to human life. Entering the atmosphere, it loses energy and creates showers of lower-energy particles, which can spread across more than 15 square miles by the time they hit ground.\n\nWhat cosmic gun could possibly fire such a thing?\n\nHere, among the grazing cattle and gauchos on horseback, scientists of the Pierre Auger Observatory, the world's largest cosmic-ray observatory, are closing in on the answer.\n\nWorkers at one of the observatory's 1500 surface detectors draw the attention of a herd of cattle. Each detector contains 3000 gallons of water; when particles from a cosmic ray shower pass through the water, their shock waves produce Cherenkov light that is measured by photomultiplier tubes. The resulting signal is automatically transmitted via radio. Solar panels generate 20 watts of power needed to run the detector.\n\nPhoto: Pierre Auger Observatory\n\nCatching rays\n\n\"The highest-energy cosmic rays must come from some of the most violent processes in the universe,\" says the US Department of Energy's Dennis Kovar, acting associate director of the Office of Science for High Energy Physics. \"Up until now we have known very little about their source.\"\n\nBased in Argentina's Mendoza Province, near the town of Malarg\u00fce, the observatory is a model for international collaboration. Named after French physicist Pierre Auger, who discovered high-energy cosmic rays in 1938, the observatory involves 370 scientists and engineers from 17 countries. More than 40 funding agencies are sharing the US$54-million construction cost, with no country contributing more than a quarter of it.\n\nScattered across 1200 square miles of semi-arid land are what appear to be water tanks, spaced about a mile apart and painted beige to blend in with the landscape. Lined with photo sensors and sprouting solar panels and communications antennae, these Auger particle detectors have recorded about a million cosmic rays since January 2004, including about 100 ultrahigh-energy cosmic bullets\u2014more than any other observatory has seen. The bullets are so rare that only one or two might hit each square mile per century.\n\n\"This result heralds a new window to the nearby universe and the beginning of cosmic-ray astronomy.\" \u2013Alan Watson\n\nThe blue circle on this sky map shows where the cosmic ray detailed below came from. The background gamma-ray image is from the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope, one of four instruments on NASA's orbiting Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. The dotted line shows the part of the sky that can be seen from the Pierre Auger Observatory.\n\nFinding the smoking guns\n\nIn early November, the Pierre Auger team announced the first results of its effort to track cosmic bullets back to their sources. They looked at the 27 most energetic cosmic rays, those with energies of more than 57 billion billion electronvolts.\n\nRather than coming from points scattered across the sky, the tracks of most of these rays led straight back to nearby regions in space that are home to active galactic nuclei\u2014supermassive black holes at the centers of some galaxies, such as Centaurus A. While other objects could reside in the same area of the sky, the Auger findings point to these black holes as the missing guns. The black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy is not an active nucleus and is not among them.\n\nThe cover of the Nov. 9, 2007, issue of Science magazine, which shows an all-sky projection of highest-energy cosmic rays detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory (open circles) that are correlated with the positions of nearby quasars (crosses), a measure of the local galaxy distribution. The supergalactic and Milky Way planes are marked. The background shows a composite image of a nearby galaxy (M82) observed by NASA's Spitzer, Hubble, and Chandra space observatories.\n\nActive galactic nuclei are a million to billions of times as massive as our sun. They may be the products of galactic collisions or other cataclysmic disruptions in their home galaxies within the past few hundred million years.\n\nAs they devour huge amounts of gas, dust, and other matter, they create and eject prodigious amounts of energy and particles. If, as the Auger findings suggest, they are responsible for firing cosmic bullets, they are the most powerful accelerators in the universe, propelling particles to energies 100 million times higher than any earthly particle accelerator has achieved.\n\n\"We have taken a big step forward in solving the mystery of the nature and origin of the highest-energy cosmic rays,\" says Nobel Prize winner James Cronin, of the University of Chicago, who conceived the Pierre Auger Observatory with Alan Watson of the University of Leeds. \"This is a fundamental discovery.\"\n\nMost cosmic rays travel in gently curving, unpredictable lines, deflected by magnetic fields as they make their way through the universe. They also lose energy as they interact with the ever-present bath of the cosmic microwave background\u2014the afterglow of the big bang. But rays that travel at very high energy are barely deflected. Even after traveling a few hundred million light years\u2014a relatively short distance, on a cosmic scale\u2014they still point back within a few degrees of their sources.\n\n\"The challenge now is to record enough of these cosmic bullets to understand the processes that hurl them into space,\" says project manager Paul Mantsch of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois, which hosts the observatory's project management office.\n\nA world record\n\nThe mystery of the cosmic bullets dates back almost 70 years, when Pierre Auger measured the range of individual showers of cosmic rays. Based on his results he calculated that some cosmic rays must arrive with energies in excess of a million billion electronvolts. At a time when scientists had discovered neither pulsars nor black holes, no one could begin to imagine the cosmic objects that could accelerate particles to such ultrahigh energies.\n\nThe mystery behind Auger's results inspired future generations of physicists to build larger and more sophisticated air-shower detectors. In 1991, the University of Utah's Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector recorded a shower that was triggered by a cosmic ray with an energy of more than 300 billion billion electronvolts, or about 50 Joules\u2014the kinetic energy of a small bullet packed into the tiny volume of a single particle. It still holds the world record for the most energetic particle ever measured.\n\nOne of four buildings that contain a total of 24 fluorescence telescopes. Together they cover the sky over the observatory, looking for the faint glow created when billions of particles from a cosmic ray shower interact with nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere.\n\nPhoto: Pierre Auger Observatory\n\n\"In the next few years our data will permit us to identify the exact sources of these cosmic rays and how they accelerate these particles.\" \u2013James Cronin\n\nObservations made in the last 15 years have yielded a few more ultrahigh-energy events. The 40-square-mile Akeno Giant Air Shower Array in Japan, for example, recorded data from 1993 to 2004 using particle detectors filled with water. Every time a charged particle crossed through a tank, it emitted a bluish streak of light. Photo sensors inside the tanks counted the number and intensity of the streaks.\n\nThe Hi-Res observatory in Utah, which operated from 1997 to 2006, pioneered a new technology: it observed cosmic rays using two fluorescence telescopes. On moonless nights, these instruments can record the faint glow of air showers, which cause nitrogen molecules in the air to fluoresce.\n\nThe Auger collaboration took the methods used by AGASA and Hi-Res and expanded them to a larger scale. Its array of water tanks covers an area 30 times larger than the AGASA array; 24 fluorescence telescopes watch over the pampa at night.\n\nSo far, 1500 of the planned 1600 particle detectors and all the fluorescence telescopes have been installed. The collaboration expects to collect about 30 ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays per year.\n\n\"In the next few years our data will permit us to identify the exact sources of these cosmic rays and how they accelerate these particles,\" says Cronin.\n\nThe first surface detector in the Pierre Auger array, installed in 2000. More than 280 physicists from 17 countries are collaborating to build the observatory.\n\nPhoto: Pierre Auger Observatory\n\nThe dawn of cosmic-ray astronomy\n\nAlthough cosmic-ray astronomy is challenging, Auger scientists think their observatory has the potential to pave the way to many more discoveries. They're developing plans for a second, larger installation in Colorado that, together with the one in Argentina, would give them access to the entire sky.\n\n\"A northern site would let us look at more galaxies and black holes, increasing the sensitivity of our observatory,\" says Auger co-spokesperson Giorgio Matthiae, of the University of Rome. And there are even more active galactic nuclei in the northern sky than in the south.\n\nFor Watson and his colleagues, cosmic rays are a new way of looking at the universe. Scientists have relied on light (from infrared to gamma rays), radio waves, and\u2014more recently\u2014neutrinos to gather information about objects in space. If recorded in sufficient numbers, the highest-energy cosmic rays would convey information about objects, from the interiors of stars to active galactic nuclei, that is not available by any other means.\n\n\"This result heralds a new window to the nearby universe and the beginning of cosmic-ray astronomy,\" says Watson, co-founder and spokesperson for the observatory. \"As we collect more and more data, we may look at individual galaxies in a detailed and completely new way.\"\n\nA 34 by 44 mm postage stamp captures key aspects of Pierre Auger Observatory and its setting on an arid plain near the snowcapped Andes. The round tank in the foreground is one of 1500 cosmic ray detectors, while the building at left contains telescopes that detect the fluorescent glow of incoming cosmic ray showers, depicted at upper left. The numbers at top denote the energies of the most powerful rays.\n\nQ&A A cosmic-ray observatory leaves its stamps on Argentina\n\nIt's not often that an observatory is featured on a postage stamp. Rhianna Wisniewski talks with Ingo Allekotte, deputy project manager at the Pierre Auger Observatory, about a stamp recently issued by the Argentine postal service.\n\nRW: How did the idea for the stamp originate?\nIA: It all started about two years ago. One of our collaborators made contact with Correo Argentino, the official Argentine mail company, which is state-owned now, and asked them to make a stamp for Pierre Auger. We didn't hear back for some time. But then this mail company, by themselves, rediscovered this idea and came back to us proposing, \"Well, why don't we do a stamp on Auger?\" So we sent information about the Web pages of the observatory. We sent them pictures and brochures and so on. They came up with a proposal of the design for the stamp, and we made some suggestions and comments and corrections. After two interactions we had the final design.\n\nWhenever they have a stamp release, they have a small brochure with information about what the stamp is about. So they made a leaflet, which is four pages long. They also have an envelope on the first day, and they put a postmark and stamp on the envelope. This is distributed to subscribers and post offices.\n\nThe stamp was released July 14.\n\nHow much is the stamp?\n75 cents, which is the traditional cost of a letter in Argentina.\n\nWhat were those first designs the mail company brought you?\nThey had already put an image of an Auger tank on it, and the background of Malarg\u00fce. We asked them to include the fluorescence building in the back. This is also representative of the observatory, because the observatory is supposed to be hybrid. It uses two detection techniques, so you get two observatories in one location. We had to explain to them the role of the shower\u2014of the particle cascade, how cascades originate\u2014and suggested that they take the idea from our logo to get something more or less realistic.\n\nIn the first drawing, rather than having the shower coming from one common origin\u2014that is, from one primary cosmic ray that produces the shower\u2014they had drawn the shower coming from many different directions, which is not the case.\n\nWhen the US Postal Service issued a stamp featuring Enrico Fermi in 2001, it also sold stamped envelopes postmarked with the release date. The Argentine postal service did the same with the Pierre Auger stamp released on July 14.\n\nHow did you explain that to them?\nWhat we suggested was to draw the shower starting from the upper corner of the stamp, and from there, go on with lines that originate mainly from the center of the shower, crisscrossing the stamp with lines. They also added the expression 1018 eV, or 10 billion billion electronvolts, to represent the energies of the most powerful cosmic rays; we thought it would be more representative of what Auger is interested in if we put 1020 eV.\n\nSo having all three elements in this stamp\u2014the detector, the fluorescence detector building, and the cosmic rays\u2014was very important?\nGetting the complete picture. When you have a stamp you cannot put too much information on it. It is not infinite. So it is really important to have as much information as you can. A stamp like this is a unique chance\u2014there will probably be no other stamp issued by Argentina about Auger, so it was important to have it with as many elements and have it as complete as possible. We have the shower and we have the background of the Andes, the mountains, and the landscape of Malarg\u00fce, too, which is important, since it gives a reference of where the observatory is located.\n\nHow unusual is it for Argentina to release stamps on scientific projects?\n2005 was the International Year of Physics, and Argentina released a stamp with the face of Einstein and the formula E=mc2 and the first page of his famous article in the journal Annalen der Physik. They released another stamp in the same year commemorating the 50 years of our Instituto Balseiro. Sometimes when an institution has an anniversary, 50 years or 100 years, there might be a stamp about it, but there aren't that many.\n\nThe Auger stamp is part of a series that is called \"Cosmos and Science.\" There was one more stamp in this series released this year. It is about a meteorite field in the north of Argentina, and contains a meteorite.\n\nThe Argentine postal service released two stamps in 2005 in connection with the International Year of Physics. One shows Albert Einstein, his famous equation and the first page of his paper in the Annalen der Physik; the other commemorates the 50th anniversary of the Instituto Balseiro.\n\nThe observatory has a large international collaboration. How important was it to the collaboration that this stamp was made?\nEverybody liked it very much, and everyone was very enthusiastic. Many collaborators sent e-mails, saying, \"Please keep a stamp for me.\" Collaborators are really happy to see that they are on a stamp.\n\nDo you have any other outreach efforts?\nWhen people drive into the city of Malarg\u00fce, where the headquarters of the observatory are, they have to drive along 100 km where they see these detectors. What we plan to do is have a big road sign giving some very basic information, such as \"These tanks are part of the Auger Observatory, come visit us at Malarg\u00fce.\" We also plan some brochures, announcing the existence of the visitor's center and inviting people to visit; these brochures will be given to tourists who travel along the road. We are also trying to get schools to visit us and have more local people from Malarg\u00fce and from the province of Mendoza visit the observatory to find out what it is about.\n\nIs there anything else about the stamp that you think might be interesting to note?\nThe stamp is 34 x 44 mm, and they come in sheets of 20. These stamps are commemoration stamps, which are released once, and you can buy them as long as they sell them and then they are not available anymore. Of course, with all our scientists who asked for the stamps, they ran out of stamps very fast. I bought three sheets. I think I got lucky. I live in a city of 100,000 inhabitants. I went four days after the release. I got three sheets of the stamps and 20 envelopes, and that was all. They were sold out."}

{"text":"Friday, August 14, 2009 The Edge of a Black Hole The existence of black holes is one of the most amazing and bizarre predictions of Einstein's theory of gravity. Despite his original\nmisgivings about their reality, massive black hole holes are today believed to lie at the centers of most galaxies and to be the inevitable\nconsequence of the demise of massive stars. A black hole is point-like in dimension, but one of its more mysterious aspects is that it has an\n\"event horizon\": an imaginary surface, or \"edge,\" of finite size around it within which anything (except information) that ventures becomes lost forever to the rest of the universe. The existence and nature of event horizons are much less well understood than black holes themselves. Some proposed,\nvariant theories of gravity to Einstein's, for example, differ in their predicted properties of event horizons, while in some other scenarios\nevent horizons might not even exist. Since black holes are seemingly so common, astronomers want to understand these curious surfaces around them. Their findings could also help refine or suppliant Einstein's theory, and would offer clues to the fundamental nature of physical forces and particles by virtue of the extreme environment of black holes.\n\nObservations of event horizons are extraordinarily difficult because they are comparatively so small - our own galactic center's black hole has one estimated to be less than 40 astronomical units in diameter - and\nfaint because light passing through the surface is captured. Nevertheless, accretion of material onto disks or other structures near the event horizon produces radiation at all wavelengths, much of which escapes the region and can be seen, and the environment thus probed.\n\nIn the case of our galactic center, recent observations from a team including CfA astronomers with the Submillimeter Array have set some important constraints. Writing in the latest issue of the Astrophysical Journal, CfA astronomers Avi Loeb and Ramesh Narayan, together with a past post-doc of theirs, have used this and other new results to compute the implications for any putative event horizon. They show for the first time, making only a few conservative assumptions, that there is now solid evidence for one of the most exotic and fundamental predictions of general relativity: the existence of an event horizon around the galactic center black hole, and therefore around black holes in general."}
{"text":"First galaxies were born much earlier than expectedJohan Richard, the lead author of a new study [1] says: \"We have discovered a distant galaxy that began forming stars just 200 million years after the Big Bang. This challenges theories of how soon galaxies formed and evolved in the first years of the Universe. It could even help solve the mystery of how the hydrogen fog that filled the early Universe was cleared.\"\n\nRichard's team spotted the galaxy in recent observations from the NASA\/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, verified it with observations from the NASA Spitzer Space Telescope and measured its distance using W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.\n\nThe distant galaxy is visible through a cluster of galaxies called Abell 383, whose powerful gravity bends the rays of light almost like a magnifying glass [2]. The chance alignment of the galaxy, the cluster and the Earth amplifies the light reaching us from this distant galaxy, allowing the astronomers to make detailed observations. Without this gravitational lens, the galaxy would have been too faint to be observed even with today's largest telescopes.\n\nAfter spotting the galaxy in Hubble and Spitzer images, the team carried out spectroscopic observations with the Keck-II telescope in Hawaii. Spectroscopy is the technique of breaking up light into its component colours. By analysing these spectra, the team was able to make detailed measurements of its redshift [3] and infer information about the properties of its component stars.\n\nThe galaxy's redshift is 6.027, which means we see it as it was when the Universe was around 950 million years old [4]. This does not make it the most remote galaxy ever detected \u2014 several have been confirmed at redshifts of more than 8, and one has an estimated redshift of around 10 (heic1103), placing it 400 million years earlier. However the newly discovered galaxy has dramatically different features from other distant galaxies that have been observed, which generally shine brightly with only young stars.\n\nThe giant cluster of elliptical galaxies in the centre of this image contains so much dark matter mass that its gravity bends light. This means that for very distant galaxies in the background, the cluster's gravitational field acts as a sort of magnifying glass, bending and concentrating the distant object's light towards Hubble. These gravitational lenses are one tool astronomers can use to extend Hubble's vision beyond what it would normally be capable of observing.\n\nUsing Abell 383, a team of astronomers have identified and studied a galaxy so far away we see it as it was less than a billion years after the Big Bang. Viewing this galaxy through the gravitational lens meant that the scientists were able to discern many intriguing features that would otherwise have remained hidden, including that its stars were unexpectedly old for a galaxy this close in time to the beginning of the Universe. This has profound implications for our understanding of how and when the first galaxies formed, and how the diffuse fog of neutral hydrogen that filled the early Universe was cleared.\n\n\"When we looked at the spectra, two things were clear,\" explains co-author Eiichi Egami. \"The redshift placed it very early in cosmic history, as we expected. But the Spitzer infrared detection also indicated that the galaxy was made up of surprisingly old and relatively faint stars. This told us that the galaxy was made up of stars already nearly 750 million years old \u2014 pushing back the epoch of its formation to about 200 million years after the Big Bang, much further than we had expected.\"\n\nCo-author Dan Stark continues: \"Thanks to the amplification of the galaxy's light by the gravitational lens, we have some excellent quality data. Our work confirms some earlier observations that had hinted at the presence of old stars in early galaxies. This suggests that the first galaxies have been around for a lot longer than previously thought.\"\n\nThe discovery has implications beyond the question of when galaxies first formed, and may help explain how the Universe became transparent to ultraviolet light in the first billion years after the Big Bang. In the early years of the cosmos, a diffuse fog of neutral hydrogen gas blocked ultraviolet light in the Universe. Some source of radiation must therefore have progressively ionised the diffuse gas, clearing the fog to make it transparent to ultraviolet rays as it is today \u2014 a process known as reionisation.\n\nAstronomers believe that the radiation that powered this reionisation must have come from galaxies. But so far, nowhere near enough of them have been found to provide the necessary radiation. This discovery may help solve this enigma.\n\n\"It seems probable that there are in fact far more galaxies out there in the early Universe than we previously estimated \u2014 it's just that many galaxies are older and fainter, like the one we have just discovered,\" says co-author Jean-Paul Kneib. \"If this unseen army of faint, elderly galaxies is indeed out there, they could provide the missing radiation that made the Universe transparent to ultraviolet light.\"\n\nAs of today, we can only discover these galaxies by observing through massive clusters that act as cosmic telescopes. In coming years, the NASA\/ESA\/CSA James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled for launch later this decade, will specialise in high resolution observations of distant, highly redshifted objects. It will therefore be in an ideal position to solve this mystery once and for all"}
{"text":"\"Liberator\" Link to Original SourceSternisheFan writes \"The Christian Science Monitor: Pete Spotts reports:\nNew observations of a bridge of tenuous hydrogen gas stretching between two nearby galaxies may help solve a longstanding puzzle: Billions of years after star formation peaked in the universe, what continues to fuel the formation of new stars in spiral galaxies like the Milky Way.\n\nNewly published radiotelescope observations of this segment of what researchers have dubbed the \"cosmic web\" reveal that about half of the neutral hydrogen gas in the bridge is contained in rotating clumps the size of dwarf galaxies. Neutral hydrogen \u2013 atoms with one proton and one electron \u2013 represents the raw material for new stars.\n\n\"If this gas is being accreted by the galaxies, then we need to understand how they're doing that. That information could, in principle, help us understand how galaxies like Andromeda, like our own Milky Way, can acquire gas to form new stars,\" says Spencer Wolfe, a PhD candidate in astronomy at West Virginia University and the lead scientist on the project.\n\nOver the past decade, astronomers have come to appreciate the potential of gas between galaxies to provide fresh fuel for making stars in spiral galaxies.\n\nStar formation in the universe appears to have peaked some 10 billion to 11 billion years ago. Stellar birthrates these days are less than 10 percent of what they were then, notes Robert Braun, an astronomer at the Australia Telescope National Facility in Epping, New South Wales.\n\nLeft to their own devices, galaxies have on average about 1 billion to 2 billion years worth of gas in the cosmic tank, a condition that has existed throughout most of the universe's history, Dr. Braun writes in an e-mail. Many of them, therefore, should have stopped forming stars billions of years ago. Moreover, the total mass of stars in the universe today is about five times higher than the amount of neutral hydrogen available 12 billion years ago, suggesting that the universe's larger inventory of ionized hydrogen kept star formation going in some way.\n\nResearchers have identified other mechanisms for the galactic equivalent of in-flight refueling. For instance, gas gets recycled for a time through successive generations of stars. Collisions, mergers, and even near-misses between galaxies can trigger bursts of star formation. But filaments of ionized hydrogen appear to be the only features persistent enough to keep galaxies stocked with stars over billions of years of cosmic history. Somehow, within those filaments, enough of the ionized gas condenses into the neutral form to serve as new stellar nurseries.\n\nThe filament or bridge Mr. Wolfe and his team studied appears between the Milky Way's nearest neighbor, the Andromeda Galaxy, and the Triangulum Galaxy. Andromeda is some 2.5 million light-years from Earth, while the Triangulum is roughly 3 million light-years away.\n\nThe presence of neutral hydrogen in the bridge was first reported in 2004 and confirmed in follow-up observations published last year. But it's fiendishly difficult to detect. One way neutral hydrogen betrays its presence is via radio waves, with a tell-tale signal at about the same frequency that a typical cell-phone uses. But the clumps are so wispy that their radio emissions were too faint for detailed studies with the radio telescopes used in the early workOnce again, prison is to isolate dangerous people from the rest of society, not for harmless fraudsters.\n\nharmless fraudsters?\n\nIn Dante's Inferno, Fraud is the 2nd most serious sin:\n\nCircle 1: Limbo\n\nCircle 2: Lust\n\nCircle 3: Gluttony\n\nCircle 4: Greed\n\nCircle 5: Anger\n\nCircle 6: Heresy\n\nCircle 7: Violence\n\nCircle 8: Fraud\n\nCircle 9: Treachery\n\nIt's worthwhile considering why he thought that way. Who does more harm to society: a mugger or a corrupt banker? How many people do you know who have been mugged? How many people do you know who have been hurt by corruption?\n\nFiber optic is pretty fragile - far more so than a copper cable. Can't bend it past a certain radius, much less kink it.\n\nMost copper data cables, including UTP, STP and co-ax react very poorly to sharp bends or kinking. If you take a Cat5 cable and kink it or stretch it, it's not going to work any more, at least not at Gbps rates.\n\nOptical's main benefit is distance, not speed...\n\nTOSlink and all that jazz worked because you connect stuff and that's it- the cable rarely gets disturbed. Think of your average business traveler - they'd go through optical cables like candy.\n\nGood point, though I think the problem would more likely be the connector than the cable. Optical does not cope well with dust, grime etc.\n\nThis 100w power standard is pretty stupid, though. We're talking power levels where fires will definitely be possible from damaged USB cables.\n\nUnless (and I have no idea if such is being implemented) a smart, bidirectional power protocol is in place that monitors the power sent vs the power received and shuts it down if there is a discrepancy---sort of like a super RCD.\n\nSo which weighs more, a pound of lead or a pound of aerogel?\nWho cares, my question is how did you fit an entire pound of aerogel in that room?\n\nA pound of lead. No, really, unless you are weighing in a vacuum.\n\nThink of weighing a pound of lead and a pound of wood underwater. The lower density of the wood and the weight of the water displaced makes for the difference. The same holds for air, but for most substances the difference is undetectable. However, lead vs aerogel is easily detectable. By my rough calculations, at room temperature, 1lb of lead weighs 0.99989418lb allowing for air displacement and 1lb of aerogel (at 1.9kg\/m^3) weighs 0.368421053lb (and occupies 0.238732632m^3, so it'll fit in the room quite easily)\n\nWell, since the purpose of a name is to interact with other people, it is more accurate to say that your name is what other people call you. If 'Bud' is what everybody calls you every day in 'real life', then that is you real name.\n\nor about 50K. Still below the magic 77K of liquid Nitrogen at which point things become economically interesting---and I can't see any statement in the article that the substance is even as good as, never mind better than 50K, although there is an implication that it is.\n\nJavascript is not too bad, but I suspect that it won't help in this case because the problem is not merely the language but the mind-rottingly horrible object model.\n\nIf you can keep it to rslt = function(cell1, cell2, cell3) then it's OK, but in practice it seems to involve rslt = use.of.some.object.you.didnt.expect where goat.sacrifice(was.successful) [but.I.lied.to.you]\n\nBagpipes were given by the Irish to the Scots---who haven't gotten the joke yet.\n\nI'd suggest taking up the Bodhran. Don't worry too much about learning to play it---most people can't, so that doesn't matter, and if anyone gives you grief just explain that you made it yourself and that the skin is wearing out, which should ensure isolation.\n\nSo, they do understand that means the Chinese government can install rootkits on their servers, because they bought kit with chips made in China, and packets passing through them need to be investigated to ensure there are no dissidents using them, in violation of Chinese law (that would be the contravention of the laws of a foreign state mentioned)?"}

Original image by the Integral SPI team . Image processing by ESA\/ECF.\n\nDescription\n\nOne of the most important 'quantities' an astronomer can know about a celestial object is the amount of energy it emits at different wavelengths. Wavelengths are like colours and, just as the different wavelengths of optical light are distinguished as colours by our eyes and brains, Integral will use the Spectrometer on Integral (SPI) to split the gamma rays it captures into gamma-ray 'colours'. Here, SPI has captured gamma rays from the black hole, Cygnus X-1 and from the neutron star system, Cygnus X-3 in an observation that took place during 21-22 November 2002. The gamma rays do not come from the black hole but are emitted by a swirling disc of ultra-hot gas that surrounds the black hole. This is created as the black hole's gravitational field pulls matter from its companion star, HDE 226868. SPI's unique capabilities will investigate whether a cloud of antimatter envelops Cygnus X-1, as some astronomers believe.\n\nCygnus X-1 is about 10 000 light years from Earth and one of the brightest high-energy emitters in the sky. It was discovered in the 1960s and is thought to be a black hole, ripping its companion star to pieces. The companion star, HDE 226868, is a blue supergiant with a surface temperature of around 31 000K. It orbits the black hole once every 5.6 days."}

This is a compact star forming region in the constellation Cygnus (The Swan). The image was released on Dec. 15, 2011. CREDIT: NASA\/ESA\n\nJust in time for the holidays, the Hubble Space Telescope has snapped a spectacular view of a star-forming region in our Milky Way galaxy that looks like a snow angel in deep space.\n\nThis region, called Sharples 2-106 (or S106 for short) is located nearly 2,000 light-years away in the direction of the constellation of Cygnus (The Swan). The nebula is found in a relatively isolated part of the Milky Way, researchers said.\n\nThe S106 nebula measures several light-years across, and contains vast clouds of gas that resemble outstretched wings amidst an hourglass shape. The light from the glowing gas is colored blue in this image. A video and photo of the \"snow angel\" based on Hubble's observations reveals a spectacular view of the cosmic sight.\n\nHubble's view captures furious activity in the nebula, with ridges and ripples of super-hot gas mixing with the cooler interstellar medium. A massive young star, called Infrared Source 4 or IRS 4, is responsible for this turbulence, scientists said.\n\nRadiation from IRS 4 makes the lobes of gas glow bright blue in the image, as they stretch outward from the central star. Luminous red veins also appear throughout the nebula creating intricate patterns.\n\nA ring of dust and gas around the star squeezes the expanding nebula into its apparent hourglass shape. Faint light from the central star reflects off tiny dust particles, making the surrounding environment glow, and revealing darker filaments of dust beneath the blue dust clouds, the researchers said.\n\nAstronomers have studied S106 and found several hundred brown dwarfs, which are cool, failed stars. When the nebula is viewed in infrared wavelengths, more than 600 of these misfit stars appear, scientists said.\n\nBrown dwarfs weigh less than a tenth of our sun, and because of this low mass, they are unable to trigger enough energy through nuclear fusion. These cosmic objects encompass the S106 nebula in a small cluster, the researchers said.\n\nS106 was the 106th object to be catalogued by astronomer Stewart Sharpless in the 1950s, the researchers said.\n\nThe newly released image was taken by Hubble in February. The composite picture was created by stitching together two images taken in infrared light.\n\nFollow SPACE.com for the latest in space science and exploration news on Twitter @Spacedotcom and on Facebook."}

This map shows most of the stars visible to the unaided eye under good conditions and the galaxy itself is marked as a red oval in a circle. Through a moderate-sized amateur telescope this galaxy appears quite large, but dim, and needs a dark sky to be seen well. ESO\/IAU\/S&T\n\nThis image of NGC 247, taken by the Wide Field Imager on the MPG\/ESO 2.2-meter telescope at the European Southern Observatory's (ESO)The spiral galaxy NGC 247 is one of the closest spiral galaxies of the southern sky. In this new view from the Wide Field Imager on the MPG\/ESO 2.2-meter telescope in Chile, large numbers of the galaxy's component stars are clearly resolved, and many glowing pink clouds of hydrogen, marking regions of active star formation, can be made out in the loose and ragged spiral arms.\n\nNGC 247 is part of the Sculptor Group, a collection of galaxies associated with the Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253). This is the nearest group of galaxies to our Local Group, which includes the Milky Way, but putting a precise value on such celestial distances is inherently difficult.\n\nTo measure the distance from Earth to a nearby galaxy, astronomers have to rely on a type of variable star called a Cepheid to act as a distance marker. C\nAnother problem arises from the fact that some of the light from a Cepheid may be absorbed by dust en route to Earth, making it appear fainter, and therefore farther away than it really is. This is a particular problem for NGC 247 with its highly inclined orientation, as the line of sight to the Cepheids passes through the galaxy's dusty disk.\n\nHowever, a team of astronomers is currently looking into the factors that influence these celestial distance markers. The team has already reported that NGC 247 is more than a million light-years closer to the Milky Way than was previously thought, bringing its distance down to just over 11 million light-years.\n\nApart from the main galaxy itself, this view also reveals numerous galaxies shining far beyond NGC 247. In the upper right of the picture, three prominent spirals form a line, and still farther out, far behind them, many more galaxies can be seen, some shining right through the disk of NGC 247.\n\nThis color image was created from a large number of monochrome exposures taken through blue, yellow\/green, and red filters taken over many years. In addition exposures through a filter that isolates the glow from hydrogen gas have also been included and colored red. The total exposure times per filter were 20 hours, 19 hours, 25 minutes, and 35 minutes, respectively.\n\nThis sequence gives us a close-up view of the spiral galaxy NGC 247 and its rich backdrop. This picture was taken using the Wide Field Imager (WFI) at ESO's La Silla Observatory in Chile. NGC 247 is about 11 million light-years away in the constellation Cetus the Whale.

{"text":"Stars, including the Sun, transform matter into energy in nuclear reactions. Whenhydrogen nuclei fuse to form helium, a small amount of matter is converted toenergy. These and other processes in stars have led to the formation of all theother chemical elements. There is a wide range of stellar objects of different sizesand temperatures. Stars have varying life histories based on these parameters.\n\n2.\n\nNarrative\n\n:\n\nLike humans, stars pass through different stages in their lives. They are born, they matureand, eventually, they die. However, unlike humans, the typical star may last for millions orbillions of years. While we cannot witness the complete life cycle of any one star, the nightsky does reveal stars in various stages of stellar development. In some ways we've got atime machine that enables us to look back and out into the future. In so doing we canglimpse aspects of our own star's past and destiny.Like all stars, our Sun was formed from a cloud of hydrogen gas and dust that almostcertainly included the ashes from an earlier star gone supernova. In its death throes, itcreated elements heavier than iron that our solar system inherited. Gravity pulled the cloudtogether into a giant ball. When enough gas and dust had gathered, enormous pressures atthe center forced hydrogen atoms to begin fusing into helium, thereby releasing energy andraising the temperature at the core to over 15 million degrees. Another star was born, andthe Sun began to glow.The birth of all stars is much like that of the Sun, but the mass of the gas and dustcomprising the star will determine its precise destiny. Medium-sized stars like our Suneventually use up their hydrogen fuel, cool and expand into red giants. Later they shed theirouter layers and appear as a diffuse cloud called a\n\nplanetary nebula\n\n(which, confusingly, hasnothing to do with planets!), lose more gas, shrink down to become\n\nwhite dwarf\n\nstars, andeventually even smaller stellar corpses called\n\nblack dwarfs\n\n. At this stage they may be only afew thousand miles in diameter.In general, the smaller the mass of a star, the longer its life. Our Sun is now near the mid-point of its estimated 10 billion year life. Stars that are many times more massive than ourSun experience dramatic and sometimes explosive endings. Following the\n\nred giant\n\nstagethey may continue to expand into\n\nsupergiants\n\n. The core then shrinks and grows hotter anddenser. Eventually internal forces erupt to cause the star to explode as a\n\nsupernova\n\n. Thestellar remnants become either extremely dense\n\nneutron stars\n\nor mysterious\n\nblack holes\n\n,objects with such a strong gravitational pull that not even light can escape. Matter ejectedfrom a supernova is blown out into interstellar space and may enter a kind of cosmicrecycling program, seeding new solar systems of stars, planets, and moons with the goldand iron of the earlier generation of stars.Stars come in several colors\u2014red, orange, yellow, white and blue. The color of a star offersus a clue to its surface temperature. Red stars are the coolest and blue stars are thehottest. Our Sun is classified as a medium-sized, yellow dwarf star. Astronomers use starcolor and actual brightness to determine the stage in a star's life cycle.\n\n1\n\n3.\n\nActivity Title: Comparing Star Color\n\nContent Expectation:\n\nE5.2f\n\nExplain how you can infer the temperature, life span, and massof a star from its color.

With the lamp turned down to aminimum, the filament glows a dim red color. The filament glows because itis hot, but it can get much hotter and glow much more brightly. As the lampis turned up the filament receives more power. It gets hotter and glowsbrighter. Its color progresses from dim red to orange to yellow to white. As itgets hotter it glows brighter. There is a relationship between the temperature\n\n2\n\nand the color of the glowing filament. If the filament could be made to gloweven hotter, it would progress from white to blue in color.Many students have seen the color progression from red through yellow toblue in the flame of a camp fire. The cool flame is red or orange and thehottest flame is blue. Explain that the color of the flame near the wick of thecandle is bluish in color and hottest in temperature. The outside edge of theflame is yellow or red and is the coolest part of the flame. The same colorprogression holds true for stars. Scientists use color to help determine thetemperature of a star. The coolest stars at 3,000 degrees Celsius glow red.The hottest stars have surface temperatures in the tens of thousands of degrees and glow with a fierce blue light. Such stars are extremely bright,powerful, and easy to see at great distances.The white and blue stars burn their fuel at the highest temperatures. Theyproduce the most energy and so they are the most powerful stars. Thesestars are also the biggest stars.The bigger a star is, the more mass it has. More mass means the starpresses in on itself more strongly. It gets hotter in the core than a smallerstar, so it burns faster and at a much higher temperature. Because it burnshotter it also gives off more energy than a smaller, cooler star.\n\nSafety Concerns\n\nDo not touch the light bulb, the light bulb will become very hot.Care should be taken when using matches. Students should wear safetygoggles and be reminded of fire safety in the classroom."}
{"text":"Magnetic fields are natural for transmitting the energy from the central compact object to the small amount of baryons required for a GRB. If dissipation of the flux of magnetic energy by reconnection inside the flow is taken into account, the magnetic model has several more convincing properties. For baryon loading typical of observed GRB, most of the dissipation takes place just outside photosphere, so that prompt emission is produced efficiently, and the magnetic field strength in this region is high, resulting in efficient synchrotron emission. The dissipation also causes remarkably efficient acceleration of the bulk flow. In this context, an interpretation of the Poynting flux as a 'magnetic enthalpy flux' is illuminating.

This energetic, slow-evolving and helium-rich explosion provides a golden link between the emerging class of \"super-luminous\" supernovae and other more seemingly normal supernovae that are far less bright.\n\nSome observations of the supernova were obtained by two generations of Astro 100 students in 2012 and 2013 as part of the department's annual Spring Break trip to Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in Arizona. Students were the first to classify the new supernova in 2012 with the FLWO 1.5m telescope within just hours of its discovery by the Catalina Sky Survey. A year later, the next group of students used the FLWO 1.2m telescope to show that SN2012au is still shining bright and thus evolving slowly. A paper led by postdoc, Dan Milisavljevic, has been submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters with details on this unusual stellar explosion (link).Each year undergraduate students enrolled in Astronomy 100 hone their practical astronomy knowledge by using the 48-inch and 60-inch telescopes at the Fred L.

{"text":"Milky Way Versus Andromeda As Seen from Earth\n\nFrom HubbleCast. Scientists have been using Hubble observations to predict the future of the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way, and how the collision will look from Earth. Projecting the motion of Andromeda's stars over the next 8 billion years, the astronomers now know the path that galaxy is taking through space. And it's heading straight for us! Computer simulations based on Hubble observations show how the two galaxies will crash together in around 4 billion years' time.\n\nThe Andromeda Galaxy, some 2.2 million light-years away, is the closest spiral galaxy to our home, the Milky Way. For around a century, astronomers have known it is moving towards us, but whether or not the two galaxies would actually collide, or simply fly past each other, remained unclear. Now, a team of astronomers has used the Hubble Space Telescope to shed light on this question, by looking at the motion stars in the Andromeda Galaxy.\n\nWe wanted to figure out how Andromeda was moving through space. So in order to do that we measured the location of the Andromeda stars relative to the background galaxies. In 2002 they were in one place, and in 2010 they were in a slightly different place. And that allowed us to measure the motion over a period of eight years.\n\nThe motion is actually incredibly subtle, and not obvious to the human eye, even when looking at Hubble's sharp images. However, sophisticated image analysis revealed tiny movements that the scientists were able to project into the future.\n\nBased on these findings, it is finally possible to show what will happen to the Milky Way over the next eight billion years, as the galaxies drift closer, then collide and gradually merge into a single, larger, elliptical galaxy with reddish stars. And yet the Solar System should in fact survive this huge crash.\n\nThe reason we think that our Solar System will not be much affected by this collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda is that galaxies are mostly empty space.\nEven though our galaxy,"}

{"text":"Description: As astronomers we use light to unravel the mysteries of the universe.\nRen\u00e9e Hlozek discusses 'The light fantastic' and provides some links to telescopes which operate across the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nBio: Ren\u00e9e is a South African cosmologist working at Princeton University. She studies light originating from shortly after the Big Bang, and light from distant exploding stars. She is amazed daily at how amazing it is that we can decipher the universe using light (and physics, maths and reasoning of course!)Hi, my name is Ren\u00e9e Hlozek, and I'm a Lyman Spitzer Jr. Fellow in Astrophysics at Princeton University. I study cosmology, and I want to talk to you today just about a fact that you may not have thought about if you don't follow astronomy news. This is actually something that I often think about and something that amazes me about astronomy and about our observations of astronomy.\n\nAll we use to infer everything we know about the universe at large: is light. That sounds like a really simple statement, but if you think about the way we typically think of science being done, we measure something, and often the idea is that there is something that you can repeat, but of course with light, all we get of course are the photons that come to the telescope at a particular time, and all our inferences on the temperature, mass, large scale structure and distribution of the universe, are made from those observations. So based on that, I thought that I would just briefly summarise a few facts about light and point you to some links and interesting thoughts so that you can think about these things yourself.\n\nFirst of all, we know the electromagnetic spectrum covers a range of energies\/frequencies and temperature. The first thing to think about is what a blackbody is, which is an 'idealised' body, like a black box, that absorbs all radiation, regardless of the frequency of that radiation. So if you turn that onto its head (so to speak), a black body that is radiating in thermal equilibrium radiates electromagnetic radiation that is only defined by the temperature of the body itself. So the spectrum, or the change of intensity of the light as a function of frequency, is uniquely determined by the temperature of the body. And we use this term 'black body' to describe different objects in the universe in terms of their temperature.\n\nWe measure light in a range of frequencies and with a range of instruments, and I'm just going to briefly go through a list of these so that you can investigate further. So if we start at the energetic end, gamma rays are very, very energetic rays, and they have a wavelength of 10^{-12} m, so very short wavelength and very high energy. One of the telescopes used to probe this radiation is called the Fermi Telescope, and this probes supermassive black holes, neutron stars and accelerated jets of gas, so anything that has a lot of energy output in the universe \u2013 we use gamma rays to probe.\n\nMoving slightly further down the spectrum, we have X-rays. X-rays also measure hot, energetic particles in the universe. An example of something that we would study with X-rays are galaxy clusters and specifically the distribution of hot electron gas inside the centre of these dense galaxy clusters. For example, telescopes such as the Chandra X-ray observatory or XMM-Newton will probe this radiation. Typically gamma ray and X-ray telescopes are space-based telescopes.\n\nOn the UV side, currently (to my knowledge) there isn't a UV telescope, but ROSAT, that is short for the R\u00f6ntgensatellit is a telescope that measured X-ray but also UV radiation, again to look at hot objects, and energetic objects in the universe.\n\nAs we move down to the visible regime, we have optical telescopes. A key example of an optical telescope of course is the Hubble telescope, but also the South African Large Telescope (SALT) measures optical light. Telescopes in the optical regime take pictures (or measurements) in the way that we see with our eyes, although telescopes can of course \"see\" much fainter.\n\nBut the (EM) spectrum continues and if we move to longer wavelengths we have infrared (IR) telescopes such as the Herschel telescope, which measures wavelengths of about 10^{-5} m. Now, the key idea with infrared telescopes is that they are typically used to measure dusty regions in the universe, which we can't see with optical telescopes because they block out visible light, just as a smoke stack blocks out the view. IR telescopes measure re-emitted radiation from these dust particles, and so images that previously look dark in the optical bands glow in the IR. Herschel was launched a few years ago, and is really changing the field of IR astronomy by providing us with high-resolution images.\n\nIn microwaves, my favourite telescope to talk about is one that I work on, which is the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), which works at cm wavelengths. ACT measures the temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background, which is light that has been travelling towards us since shortly after the big bang, a few hundred thousand years after the big bang. ACT measures the temperature of that radiation as a function of position on the sky.\n\nFinally, as you move down to longer radio wavelengths, these are wavelengths which are very long (up to 1000 m), projects like the Arecibo telescope, interferometric arrays that we have around the world (VLA, VLBA, VLTI, ALMA etc.) and of course everyone is looking to the future with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). The reason why you can use an interferometer array is because the signals from these radio telescopes are actually measured as electronic signals rather than light images in an optical telescope. So you can connect different telescopes together and use signal processing techniques to make images of the sky.\n\nNow, you have heard me talk about resolution. The way we measure the (possible) resolution of the telescope is by taking that wavelength of the light that is going to be measured and dividing it by the\ndiameter of the telescope. A similar thing also works for radio telescopes where you divide it by the baseline between two telescopes. And so, in this way you can measure (determine) what kind of objects you will be able to distinguish, for example with a low resolution you won't be able to make out the centre of a galaxy, rather you will see one blob where the galaxy is, however with a finer resolution you would start to make out structure, filaments and parts of the galaxy.\n\nI recommend you take a look at the websites of the telescopes I discussed (given below), as they contain a lot of information on the science case of the telescopes, and information on how you can look at the images and press releases on new astronomical data.\n\nAnother thing that is really important is the fact that as we look at fainter and fainter objects, we are actually looking back in time. We know that light takes a finite time to travel towards us, it travels with the speed of light, of course. And so, we are actually looking into the past \u2013 stars that we are looking at today are no longer there, because we are looking at them as they were billions of years ago.\nThere is always a continuous race to find the oldest galaxies, one of the oldest galaxies in the universe, UDFY38135539, is a galaxy that has been found at a redshift (z) of 8.6, so light has taken 13.1 billion years to reach us.\n\nYou heard me mention the term redshift. Redshift (z) is a concept in General Relativity, that we use to describe objects. It is an observational quantity that we measure by comparing the wavelength of an observed feature, such as a Hydrogen line in the spectrum of a galaxy to the frequency or wavelength that we know that feature must happen at. For example, Hydrogen emits lines (radiation at characteristic frequencies\/wavelengths) at a very specific wavelength in the rest frame on earth, and so that's what we use to determine the change in wavelength: we divide that by the wavelength itself and we come up with a quantity called redshift.\n\n[The equation is z = (WL_observed - WL_emitted)\/WL_emitted ]\nRedshift is connected to distance (in the universe) and connected to time, and so as I said the oldest galaxy that has been measured is roughly at a redshift of 8.6, the oldest object that we have observed is of course the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, which is at a redshift of roughly 1000: 1089, which means that we are looking at light that has been travelling to us from very shortly after the big bang.\n\nI hope I interested and excited you about the fact that we only get light, and all our observations are made using light and its properties and that we spend all our time trying to observe as many photons as we can. I hope you will think about that the next time you point you camera at a friend, or look up at the night sky.\n\nThank you"}

{"text":"OTHER GALAXIES\n\nThe infrared emission from galaxies comes primarily from three sources:\nstars, interstellar gas, and dust. The emission from stars peaks in the\nnear-infrared (1-3 microns).\nEmission from atoms and molecules in interstellar\ngas makes up only a few percent of the infrared output of galaxies.\nThe primary source of infrared radiation beyond 3 microns is thermal emission\nfrom dust grains heated by starlight.\n\nAn infrared image of the spiral galaxy M83\n(European Southern Observatory) showing the\ninfrared glow of stars in the spiral arms.\n\nThe brightest infrared galaxies are\nusually the ones which have a lot of dust (in star-forming regions\nfor example).\nAstronomers using the\nIRAS satellite observed 20,000 galaxies in the infrared.\nMany of these were starburst galaxies - galaxies which are\nforming enormous numbers of new stars, and are thus extremely bright in the\ninfrared. Further infrared studies of these galaxies may find\nthe cause of this star-forming frenzy. At the left is an infrared image of\nthe starburst galaxy M83.\nSpiral galaxies, which are rich in gas and dust, are strong infrared sources\nand are still forming new stars. About half of the luminosity of an average\nspiral galaxy is radiated at far-infrared\nwavelengths. Elliptical galaxies are faint in the infrared because they no\nlonger have much gas and dust.\n\nBelow are infrared images of three galaxies.

The eclipse occurs once every 27.1 years and happens when a F-type star is obscured by a B-type star that is enshrouded in a large disk of opaque material.

The November 2009 observation (center) shows the shadow of the disk (outlined in a white ellipse) around second contact and the December 2009 observations (right) show that nearly 50% of the stellar surface is obscured by the eclipsing object.\n\nPhoto by John D. Monnier, University of Michigan\n\nApril 8, 2010 For the first time, a team of astronomers has imaged the eclipse of the star Epsilon Aurigae by its mysterious, less luminous companion star. Scientists have known since 1821 that Epsilon Aurigae is an eclipsing double star system, but astronomers have struggled for many decades trying to decipher the clues as to what is causing the eclipses, which happen every 27 years. The new image largely settles the matter \u2014 the eclipse is caused by a disk of material, probably similar to the state of our solar system 4.5 billion years ago as the planets began to form around our own infant Sun.\n\nSeeing this eclipse in detail has only now become possible. \"Having studied this star on and off since my postdoctoral days in the 1980s during its last eclipse,\" said Robert Stencel from the University of Denver, \"it is very satisfying to finally resolve some of the long-standing questions associated with this famous star.\"\n\nThe image was obtained using the interferometric technique, an old idea that incorporates computer control and laser connections among multiple telescopes to achieve a signal equivalent to one giant telescope.\n\n\"To capture the detail on Epsilon Aurigae, we've made use of the biggest optical telescope on Earth, the 1,083-foot (330 meters) diameter CHARA Array atop Mount Wilson, California,\" said Stencel. To comprehend its size, note that 328 feet (100 meters) is roughly the length of a football field.\n\nThe CHARA Array is a collection of six telescopes, spread out over the grounds of Mount Wilson Observatory, in which individual beams of light are brought together using extraordinarily precise beam combiners to synthesize a giant telescope hundreds of meters across. In routine operations since 2005, the CHARA Array has already produced a number of astronomical \"firsts\" through its ability to produce images of unprecedented resolution.\n\n\"The size of Epsilon Aurigae in these amazing new images is equivalent to the angular size of an 11-point font letter 'o' seen from a distance of more than 93 miles (150 kilometers),\" said Harold McAlister, CHARA director.\n\nKey to the imaging success of the CHARA Array is the Michigan Infrared Combiner (MIRC). MIRC enables the type of multi-telescope linkage that is required to produce such images and enables more of the potential of CHARA to be used in parallel for image reconstruction. The combination of MIRC at CHARA has already produced the first image made of a normal star, other than the Sun, as well as the first images of a double star system in which one component is shedding matter to its companion star.\n\nThe images of Epsilon Aurigae show the intrusion of an apparently wedge-shaped structure across the face of a huge star, nearly 150 times the size of our Sun. The images of the star and wedge-shaped structure show the direct motion over a month, yielding a measurement of the relative masses of the components. The primary star itself is thought to be in a very interesting phase of its own evolution, turning out to be less massive than the eclipsing disk and the star hidden at the center of that disk.\n\nIndependently, Stencel and collaborators from the California Institute of Technology and Kitt Peak National Observatory have assembled data to show the disk contains a large, hot star known as a B5V object, describing its mass and temperature. This prior work set the stage to then evaluate the mass of the disk itself based on the CHARA images.\n\nIt turns out the disk is as wide as the orbit of Jupiter, nearly as tall as the orbit of Earth, but contains a little less than the mass of Earth. \"This is a fairly direct measurement of characteristics of a disk in contrast to the usual disk studies where indirect evidence and lots of assumptions are the only means of characterization available,\" Stencel said. \"With some luck, we can obtain more CHARA images this year and develop the equivalent of an MRI scan of the entire disk through eclipse,\" said Stencel.\n\nBecause astronomers haven't observed much light from the faint companion, the prevailing opinion labeled it a smaller star orbited edge-on by a thick disk of dust. The theory held that the disk's orbit must be in precisely the same plane as the dark object's orbit around the brighter star, and all of this had to be occurring in the same plane as Earth's vantage point. This would be an unlikely alignment, but it explained observations. The new images show this is indeed the case. A geometrically thin, dark, dense, but partially translucent cloud can be seen passing in front of Epsilon Aurigae.\n\n\"This really shows that the basic paradigm was right, despite the slim probability,\" Monnier said. \"It kind of blows my mind that we could capture this. There's no other system like this known. On top of that, it seems to be in a rare phase of stellar life, and it happens to be so close to us! It's extremely fortuitous.\""}

{"text":"Neutron Star With a Tail Like a Comet\n\nby Fraser Cain on June 2, 2006\n\nWant to stay on top of all the space news? Follow @universetoday on Twitter\n\nSupernova remnant IC 443. Image credit: Chandra X-ray. Click to enlarge\nThis beautiful image shows the supernova remnant IC 443. The area in the box contains what looks like a tiny comet with a tail, but it's actually a neutron star, moving quickly through the nebula. Neutron stars have been seen moving away from supernova remnants before, but in this case, it's moving perpendicular. One possibility is that the former star was moving quickly through the galaxy before it exploded. The gas and dust in the nebula have slowed down and drifted away from the neutron star.\n\nThe pullout, also a composite with a Chandra X-ray close-up, shows a neutron star that is spewing out a comet-like wake of high-energy particles as it races through space.\n\nBased on an analysis of the swept-back shape of the wake, astronomers deduced that the neutron star known as CXOU J061705.3+222127, or J0617 for short, is moving through the multimillion degree Celsius gas in the remnant. However, this conclusion poses a mystery.\n\nAlthough there are other examples where neutron stars have been located far away from the center of the supernova remnant, these neutron stars appear to be moving radially away from the center of the remnant. In contrast, the wake of J0617 seems to indicate it is moving almost perpendicularly to that direction.\n\nOne possible explanation is that the doomed progenitor star was moving at a high speed before it exploded, so that the explosion site was not at the observed center of the supernova remnant. Fast-moving gusts of gas inside the supernova remnant may have further pushed the pulsar's wake out of alignment. An analogous situation is observed for comets, where a wind of particles from the Sun pushes the comet tail away from the Sun, out of alignment with the comet's motion.\n\nIf this is what is happening, then observations of the neutron star with Chandra in the next 10 years should show a detectable motion away from the center of the supernova remnant."}
{"text":"The Milky Way's first light\n\nIn its youngest days, our galaxy may have favored producing stars like Vega and Regulus.\n\nBy\nKen Croswell \u2014\nPublished:\nJanuary 6, 2005\n\nThe stars in M15 are estimated to be about 12 billion years old. They were among the first generations of stars to have formed in the Milky Way.\n\nPhoto by AURA \/ STScI \/ NASA\n\nJanuary 6, 2005 The ancient Milky Way abounded with stars a few times more massive than the Sun, say astronomers in Italy and the United States. These stars left their mark by showering their stellar companions with carbon, barium, and other elements.\n\nThe stars in M15 in Pegasus are estimated to be about 12 billion years old. The Milky Way has no globular clusters more iron-poor than M15 or M92 in Hercules. Extremely iron-poor clusters probably disrupted quickly.\n\nPhoto by AURA \/ STScI \/ NASA\n\nToday, most stars are born with less mass than the Sun. But theorists have long speculated the ancient Milky Way gave birth to stars with a different distribution of masses, or initial mass function. In particular, the ancient Milky Way's initial mass function may have favored the birth of stars more massive than the Sun.\n\nTheorists reason as follows. Stars form from clouds of cold gas. Carbon and oxygen cool the gas, allowing it to fragment into smaller clouds that create smaller stars. However, the ancient galaxy had little carbon or oxygen. Thus, the gas did not easily fragment, so the ancient Milky Way gave birth to a greater proportion of massive stars.\n\nUnfortunately, observational evidence in support of this idea has been scant. That's because the galactic halo \u2014 the Milky Way's oldest component \u2014 is about 13 billion years old, and stars more massive than the Sun don't live that long. So any such stars that arose in the halo are dead and gone.\n\nNow, Sara Lucatello, Raffaele Gratton, and Eugenio Carretta of the Astronomical Observatory of Padova and Timothy Beers of Michigan State University have studied the stars that orbited some of those deceased halo stars. They report what they call \"the first direct observational evidence that the IMF [initial mass function] of stars is not universal over time.\" The astronomers will publish their work in an upcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal.\n\nLucatello and her colleagues studied stars in the galactic halo with extremely low abundances of iron \u2014 less than 1\/300 the Sun's abundance. These stars formed long ago, before supernovae had contributed much iron to the Milky Way. As a result, the stars acquired little iron at birth.\n\nHowever, about 20 percent of these extremely iron-poor stars have high levels of carbon and barium relative to iron. As Lucatello and her colleagues report in another paper to appear in The Astrophysical Journal, these carbon- and barium-rich stars are double, orbited by white dwarf stars.\n\nThe white dwarfs were once more massive stars, probably born with 1.5 to 6 times the Sun's mass. Modern examples of such stars include Vega and Regulus. As they age, these stars expand into red giants.\n\nRed giants create most of the universe's carbon. They also manufacture weightier elements, such as barium (atomic number 56), by releasing a slow flux of neutrons that transforms iron nuclei into heavier ones. In addition to barium, this so-called s-process (\"s\" for \"slow\") forges many other elements, including strontium (atomic number 38), yttrium (atomic number 39), zirconium (atomic number 40), and lead (atomic number 82).\n\nRed giants do not explode. Instead, they die by casting off their outer atmospheres, which enrich companion stars with carbon and s-process elements. These companions are the iron-poor but carbon- and barium-rich stars that Lucatello's team studied in the galactic halo.\n\nStars with high abundances of carbon and s-process elements relative to iron are much more common in the galactic halo than in the galactic disk. Thus, the astronomers say, the ancient Milky Way formed a much greater proportion of its stars with masses between 1.5 and 6 times the Sun's. About 5 percent of all modern stars are born in this mass range \u2014 but for the ancient Milky Way, the fraction was roughly 40 percent.\n\n\"It's certainly a fundamental problem: What was the mass function of the very metal-poor stars \u2014 the earliest stars to form?\" asks halo-star expert Bruce Carney of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"We don't have any witnesses to that particular event \u2014 all we have are clues and circumstantial evidence \u2014 and frankly, I think this is one of the more novel approaches to the whole issue.\"\n\nThe new work may explain a long-standing puzzle. Most of the Milky Way's globular clusters belong to the halo, but while astronomers know of 1,000 halo stars with iron abundances less than 1\/300 that of the Sun, there's not a single globular cluster so iron-poor. In fact, M15 in Pegasus and M92 in Hercules, both with 1\/200 of the Sun's iron abundance, are two of the most extreme globulars.\n\nWhy don't clusters with lower iron abundances exist? Lucatello and her colleagues say it's because the clusters destroyed themselves. Extremely iron-poor clusters contained lots of stars with 1.5 to 6 solar masses. When these stars shed their outer atmospheres, most of the gas escaped the clusters, robbing the clusters of mass \u2014 and thus of the gravity that held them together. As a result, the clusters split apart, spilling their stars into the galaxy at large. That's why, at very low iron abundances, the Milky Way has stars but no clusters.\n\nKen Croswell earned his Ph.D. from Harvard University, where he studied the galactic halo. He is the author of a book about the Milky Way, The Alchemy of the Heavens."}
{"text":"Astronomers Say Milky Way Not As Unique As Once Thought\n\nA new sky survey has revealed that our Milky Way galaxy may not be as special as scientists had previously thought.\n\nThe Milky Way is a fairly common type of galaxy, but being paired up with neighbors like the Magellanic Clouds makes it stick out above the rest, so much so that astronomers thought it could be a one of a kind occurrence.\n\nHowever, astronomer Dr. Aaron Robotham burst everyone's bubble when searching for groups of galaxies similar to ours using the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey (GAMA).Simulations of how galaxies form do not produce many examples similar to the Milky Way and its neighbors, making them a rare sight to see.\n\nAstronomers haven't quite known exactly how rare they are until now, with the discovery of not just one but two exact matches among the hundreds of thousands of galaxies that were a part of the survey Dr Robotham said.\n\nThe Milky Way sits next to the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, which are visible in the southern hemisphere night sky. Many galaxies have smaller galaxies in orbit next to them, but few have two that are as large as the Magellanic Clouds.\n\nThe astronomers found that although the Magellanic Clouds are rare, when they are found they are usually near a galaxy like the Milky Way.\n\n\"The galaxy we live in is perfectly typical, but the nearby Magellanic Clouds are a rare, and possibly short-lived, occurrence.

{"text":"Andrew Hamilton -- the man who hangs out in black holes\n\nJun 07, 2012\n\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder Professor Andrew Hamilton, doggedly determined to go where no man has gone before, continues to fascinate the public with his stunning and scientifically sound visualizations that take viewers into the guts of black holes.\n\nHamilton, a fellow at JILA, a joint institute of CU-Boulder and the National Institute of Standards and Technology and CU-Boulder, said his fascination with black holes began in the late 1990s. Hamilton's research on the compelling stellar objects since has led him to create a number of riveting and popular video animations and visualizations.\n\nIn 2006, \"Black Holes, the Other Side of Infinity,\" for which Hamilton was the science director, made its debut at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. Funded in part by NOVA, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, NASA and the National Science Foundation, the show features sophisticated and surprising virtual journeys inside black holes and has gone on to be one of the most popular programs of its kind of all time \u2013 it has been translated into at least 10 languages around the world.\n\nThe 2006 companion piece shown on the PBS show NOVA, titled \"Monster of the Milky Way,\" takes the viewer inside supermassive black holes believed to dwell in the center of virtually all galaxies, including our own. In addition to being a co-science advisor, and creating most of the visualizations with his Black Hole Flight Simulator, Hamilton was the key on-air expert, exuding his British charm.\n\nA professor in CU-Boulder's astrophysical and planetary sciences department, Hamilton said supermassive black holes, which contain millions to billions of times the mass of Earth's sun and appear to be at the center of virtually every galaxy, act pretty much the same as an ordinary black hole only two or three times the mass of our sun, he says. Both are voracious regions so powerful that nothing, not even light, can escape.\n\nMore recently, Hamilton produced a visualization that takes travelers into and through a Reissner-Nordstrum black hole -- an object with mass and electric charge but no spin. After free falling over the outer horizon, you reach the black hole's inner horizon (which theoretically would vaporize you). But Hamilton's visualization lets you survive the trip and be greeted by an infinitely bright and energetic burst of light \"containing the entire history of the universe,\" he says.\n\nEven more mind-blowing, the traveler then enters a wormhole --a hypothetical tunnel connecting two widely separated regions of space-time -- inside the black hole's inner horizon, a place where Hamilton says \"space slows down, and accelerates you back out again towards the radius of the inner horizon.\" Once there, you see a second infinitely bright, energetic flash of light, where you see the entire future of the universe go by.\n\nStill there? Then you are deposited at the entrance of a white hole, a \"time-reversed\" version of a black hole where space falls outward at a speed faster than light. As you pass through the outer horizon of the white hole, you see a third infinitely bright, energetic burst of light containing the entire past history of a new universe.\n\nTurning around and looking back at the white hole, you see the light from your original universe that has traversed the same journey as you -- through the black hole, through the wormhole, through the white hole, into a new universe. Whew.\n\nAlthough Hamilton's visualizations are accurate renderings of an exact mathematical solution according to the fundamental laws of general relativity, that solution is known to be violently unstable at its inner horizon -\u00ad the entrance to the wormhole -\u00ad and would not occur in reality, he points out. And he does lace his black hole video creations projects with scientific caveats, including this one: \"Warning: If you fall in a black hole you will die. You will not go through a wormhole to another time and place.\"\n\n\"It's been a merry ride,\" says Hamilton, who teaches a popular undergraduate class at CU-Boulder for non-science majors titled \"Black Holes\" and still does regular interviews, including a recent one with a curious Denver middle-schooler. \"This black hole stuff is something society seems to want, and at my advanced age I'm obligated to give it,\" he says. But don't let him fool you: The athletic, 60-year-old Hamilton is anything but geezer.

{"text":"Secondary links\n\nOn October 10, the Atacama Large Millimeter\/submillimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope of the European Space Observatory released an interesting image, which featured an unanticipated spiral structure that astronomers have identified in the material around the old red star called R Sculptoris.\n\nThe picture released by the observatory marks the first ever 3D illustration of such a spiral; and clearly shows not only an outer circular ring which points to the shell around the star, but also a noticeably lucid spiral structure in the inner material.\n\nAbout the mystifying spiral of gas and dust which astronomers have spotted as winding outward from the gigantic R Sculptoris star, the European Space Observatory said that it is for the first time that the baffling structure has been seen. The observatory further added that the possible underlying cause behind the formation of the structure is the likely presence \"a hidden companion star orbiting the star.\"\n\nAccording to European Southern Observatory's astronomer Matthias Maercker, who headed the team which spotted the mysterious spiral structure using the ALMA, the spiral was probably formed due to a previously undetected companion star which orbits around R Sculptoris and impacts the way it sheds material.\n\nNoting that R Sculptoris' thermal pulse processes and interior structure can be studied in detail by calculating the amount of gas and dust in different parts of the spiral, Maercker said: \"We can walk along the spiral toward the star \u2014 it's sort of like a clock that can tell us what happened when"}

Galaxy NGC4258 in the constellation Canes Venatici is 7.2 \u00b1 0.3 megaparsecs away according to measurements of the orbital motions of gas clouds around the centre of the galaxy centre (Nature400 539). The result could have implications for the age, geometry and fate of the universe.\n\nThe team were able to measure the distance because NGC4258 is one of 22 nearby galaxies that have active nuclei consisting of a supermassive black hole (over 100 million solar masses) surrounded by a thin rotating cloud of gas and dust. As the cloud rotates, friction heats the dust and gas, exciting the molecules in the cloud. This eventually causes the molecules to act as masers (the microwave equivalent of a laser) and release microwave radiation. By assuming that the masers rotate around the disk, the astronomers could plot their position with a network of radio telescopes known as the Very Long Baseline Array. From three years of observations and computer simulations they were able to calculate the absolute distance to the galaxy.\n\nThe next step, they say, is to use the Hubble Space Telescope to look for a Cepheid variable - one of the 'standard candles' of galactic measurements - in NGC4258. Once a Cepheid has been found, its real and apparent brightness can be calculated. This will enable astronomers to recalibrate all their extragalactic distances and hence refine estimates of the age of the universe."}

These distant clouds are likely part of a predicted diffuse web-like system of hot gas clouds - the cosmic web - from which galaxies and clusters of galaxies are thought to have formed.

A newly proposed cosmic GPS system can track a spacecraft's location to within five kilometers anywhere in the galaxy.\n\nThe secrets to this system are pulsars, a special type of neutron star that rotate at short, extremely regular intervals. That last bit is crucial - because we can count on pulsars to always rotate at the exact same speed, which makes them useful timekeepers across even the vast reaches of space. Indeed, some pulsars that rotate every few milliseconds are actually comparable to atomic clocks in terms of precision and dependability.\n\nImaged Above: The slow-spinning X-ray pulsar SXP 1062 shines brightly from within the shell of gas and dust rushing away from the supernova that formed it. Image Credit:ESA\/XMM-Newton\/ L.Oskinova\/ M.Guerrero; CTIO\/R.Gruendl\/Y.H.Chu\n\nAstronomers have discovered a strange spinning star that appears to be older than the explosion that gave birth to it, scientists say.\n\nThe star is a pulsar, a rotating, super-dense core left behind after a massive star goes supernova. This pulsar, known as SXP 1062, is spinning quite slowly, suggesting an advanced age.\n\nBut the pulsar can't be as old as it looks, because the star probably exploded less than 40,000 years ago, researchers said. They've just now begun delving into this newly discovered cosmic mystery.\n\nFermi finds super-energetic millisecond pulsar\n\nIn three years, NASA's Fermi has detected more than 100 gamma-ray pulsars, but something new has appeared. Among a type of pulsar with ages typically numbering a billion years or more, Fermi has found one that appears to have been born only millions of years ago.\n\nWhen astronomers detected intense radiation pumping out of the Crab Nebula, one of the most studied objects in space, at higher energies than anyone thought possible, they were nothing short of stunned.\n\nThe inexplicably powerful gamma-rays came from the very heart of the Crab Nebula, where an extreme object called a pulsar resides.\n\n\"It was totally not expected \u2014 it was absolutely jaw-dropping,\" Andrew McCann, a Ph.D. candidate at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and a co-author of the new study, told SPACE.com. \"This is one of the hottest targets in the sky, so people have been looking at the Crab Nebula for a long time. Now there's a twist in the tale. High-energy rays coming from the nebula are well-known, but coming from the pulsar is something nobody expected.\"\n\nPulsars are the products of colossal star explosions. When a star about ten times the size of our Sun dies, it undergoes an ejection of its \"mantle\" in a great supernova explosion, leaving the highly magnetized and compressed nucleus of the star behind. The nucleus left behind may become what you see above\u2014a pulsar; a rotating neutron star.\n\nAlthough pulsars are only about the size of a city, pulsars are incredibly dense, possibly having as much material as our Sun. Pulsars don't actually \"pulse\", rather, they appear to pulse due to what is known as the \"lighthouse effect\". Huge beams of radiation are ejected from the magnetic axis of the pulsar. These glaring emissions are only visible to us when they are pointed straight at the earth, giving the pulsar an appearance of pulsation.\n\nOne of the most impressive facts about pulsars is that, because of their incredible density, their rotational periods are extremely swift and extremely precise. Most pulsar rotational periods are anywhere from a few seconds to a few milliseconds!"}

The black hole is about 2 million miles across, and according to theHarvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics reporthas a surface spinning at nearly the speed of light. \"We can trace matter as it swirls into a black hole using X-rays emitted from regions very close to the black hole,\" explans NuSTAR principal investigator Fiona Harrison. \"The radiation we see is warped and distorted by the motions of particles and the black hole's incredibly strong gravity. Learning about the spin rates of supermassive black holes is intended to help scientists understand the origins of the universe.\n\n\"These monsters, with masses from millions to billions of times that of the sun, are formed as small seeds in the early universe and grow by swallowing stars and gas in their host galaxies, merging with other giant black holes when galaxies collide, or both,\" said study lead author Guido Risaliti. Supermassive black holes are surrounded by accretion disks of matter being pulled inward, which emit X-rays due to the high rate of friction. In theory, the faster the hole spins, the closer the accretion disk should be to the hole. The closer the disk, the more gravity will warp X-ray light from the disk. ESA's XMM-Newton proved that light was being warped, and NASA's NuSTAR higher energy X-ray showed that gravity must be causing the warping.\"\n\nSo Ive been thinking about this picture.

The existence of dark matter is inferred from the behavior of faraway galaxies, which move in ways that can only be explained by a gravitational pull caused by more mass than can be seen. They estimate dark matter represents around 20 percent of the universe, with the other 75 percent made up of dark energy, a repulsive force that is causing the universe to expand at an ever-quickening pace.\n\nAt the heart of Abancens' team's detector, which is called a scintillating bolometer and resembles a prop from The Golden Compass, is a crystal so pure it can conduct the energy ostensibly generated when a particle of dark matter strikes the nucleus of one of its atoms.\n\nTo prevent interference by cosmic rays, the bolometer is sheathed in lead and kept underground, under half a mile of rock.

Astronomers focused on those protostars with the infrared-sensitive cameras of NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and the European Space Agency's Herschel space telescope.\n\nThis color-coded image shows the scene as observed by Spitzer in one set of infrared wavelengths (8.0 and 24 microns, shown here in shades of blue), and by Herschel in somewhat longer wavelengths (70 and 160 microns, shown in green and red, respectively). Herschel monitored the emissions from cold dust particles once a week for six weeks, while Spitzer kept track of the emissions from the warmer dust, filling out the infrared rainbow.\n\nAstronomers found that the stars' brightness in infrared wavelengths varied by more than 20 percent during the observational time frame. That's surprising, because the astronomers expected variations in brightness to play out over a time frame measured in years or even centuries rather than weeks.\n\nWhat could cause the short-term twinkling? The astronomers theorized that lumpy filaments of gas might be streaming inward from a star's outer environs, temporarily warming up the dusty disk of material surrounding the star. An alternative hypothesis would be that material occasionally piles up on the inner edge of the disk, casting 'shadows\" that temporarily darken the outer disk. In any case, the observations from Herschel and Spitzer show that the birth process for baby stars is a rough-and-tumble affair, with significant ups and downs.\n\nMembers of the Herschel science team, led by Nicolas Billot, an astronomer at the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimetrique in Grenada, Spain, are preparing a paper about their findings.\n\n\"Herschel's exquisite sensitivity opens up new possibilities for astronomers to study star formation, and we are very excited to have witnessed short-term variability in Orion protostars,\" Billot said today in a photo advisory. \"Follow-up observations with Herschel will help us identify the physical processes responsible for the variability.\"\n\nA picture from Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys, captured in 2006, shows the globular cluster NGC 1846.

This result sheds new light on the formation of the first galaxies, as well as on the early evolution of the Universe.\n\nGravitational lensing by Abell 383 allows study of the newly discovered distant galaxy that began forming stars just 200 million years after the Big Bang.\n\nJohan Richard, the lead author of a new study [1] says: \"We have discovered a distant galaxy that began forming stars just 200 million years after the Big Bang. This challenges theories of how soon galaxies formed and evolved in the first years of the Universe. It could even help solve the mystery of how the hydrogen fog that filled the early Universe was cleared.\"\n\nRichard's team spotted the galaxy in recent observations from the NASA\/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, verified it with observations from the NASA Spitzer Space Telescope and measured its distance using W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.\n\nThe distant galaxy is visible through a cluster of galaxies called Abell 383, whose powerful gravity bends the rays of light almost like a magnifying glass [2]. The chance alignment of the galaxy, the cluster and the Earth amplifies the light reaching us from this distant galaxy, allowing the astronomers to make detailed observations. Without this gravitational lens, the galaxy would have been too faint to be observed even with today's largest telescopes.\n\nAfter spotting the galaxy in Hubble and Spitzer images, the team carried out spectroscopic observations with the Keck-II telescope in Hawaii. Spectroscopy is the technique of breaking up light into its component colours. By analysing these spectra, the team was able to make detailed measurements of its redshift [3] and infer information about the properties of its component stars.\n\nThe galaxy's redshift is 6.027, which means we see it as it was when the Universe was around 950 million years old [4]. This does not make it the most remote galaxy ever detected - several have been confirmed at redshifts of more than 8, and one has an estimated redshift of around 10 (heic1103), placing it 400 million years earlier. However the newly discovered galaxy has dramatically different features from other distant galaxies that have been observed, which generally shine brightly with only young stars.\n\n\"When we looked at the spectra, two things were clear,\" explains co-author Eiichi Egami. \"The redshift placed it very early in cosmic history, as we expected. But the Spitzer infrared detection also indicated that the galaxy was made up of surprisingly old and relatively faint stars. This told us that the galaxy was made up of stars already nearly 750 million years old - pushing back the epoch of its formation to about 200 million years after the Big Bang, much further than we had expected.\"\n\nCo-author Dan Stark continues: \"Thanks to the amplification of the galaxy's light by the gravitational lens, we have some excellent quality data. Our work confirms some earlier observations that had hinted at the presence of old stars in early galaxies. This suggests that the first galaxies have been around for a lot longer than previously thought.\"\n\nThe discovery has implications beyond the question of when galaxies first formed, and may help explain how the Universe became transparent to ultraviolet light in the first thousand million years after the Big Bang. In the early years of the cosmos, a diffuse fog of neutral hydrogen gas blocked ultraviolet light in the Universe. Some source of radiation must therefore have progressively ionised the diffuse gas, clearing the fog to make it transparent to ultraviolet rays as it is today - a process known as reionisation.\n\nAstronomers believe that the radiation that powered this reionisation must have come from galaxies. But so far, nowhere near enough of them have been found to provide the necessary radiation. This discovery may help solve this enigma.\n\n\"It seems probable that there are in fact far more galaxies out there in the early Universe than we previously estimated - it's just that many galaxies are older and fainter, like the one we have just discovered,\" says co-author Jean-Paul Kneib. \"If this unseen army of faint, elderly galaxies is indeed out there, they could provide the missing radiation that made the Universe transparent to ultraviolet light.\"\n\nAs of today, we can only discover these galaxies by observing through massive clusters that act as cosmic telescopes. In coming years, the NASA\/ESA\/CSA James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled for launch later this decade, will specialise in high resolution observations of distant, highly redshifted objects. It will therefore be in an ideal position to solve this mystery once and for all.\n\nNotes\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and ESA.\n\n[1] The research will appear in a paper entitled \"Discovery of a possibly old galaxy at z=6.027, multiply imaged by the massive cluster Abell 383\", to be published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. The international team of astronomers in this study consists of Johan Richard (CRAL, Observatoire de Lyon, Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1, France and Dark Cosmology Centre, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Denmark), Jean-Paul Kneib (Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille, France), Harald Ebeling (University of Hawaii, USA), Daniel P Stark (University of Cambridge, UK), Eiichi Egami (University of Arizona, USA) and Andrew K Fiedler (University of Arizona, USA)\n\n[2] Gravity distorts space-time, the fabric of the cosmos. This means that for extremely massive objects with very strong gravitational fields, light is visibly bent as it travels through and around them. Massive galaxy clusters like Abell 383 therefore act like an enormous lens, concentrating the light from distant objects behind them, in a process known as gravitational lensing. While the galaxies seen through gravitational lenses are typically distorted and multiply imaged (this newly discovered galaxy is actually visible twice in the Hubble observations), using these gravitational lenses multiplies a telescope's power and lets it see galaxies that would otherwise be too faint to be visible. Abell 383, the gravitational lens used in this study, was imaged as part of the CLASH survey (Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble), a Multi Cycle Treasury project to observe a sample of 25 galaxy clusters using Hubble (PI: Marc Postman). Abell 383 is also one of the 50 clusters imaged with the Spitzer Warm mission large project led by Eiichi Egami.\n\n[3] Because the Universe is expanding, the light from distant objects is stretched and reddened as it moves towards us, a phenomenon known as redshift. The further an object is away, the more heavily redshifted it is. For very remote objects, redshift can be used to quantify their distance.\n\n[4] Because light travels at a finite speed, the further away an object is, the further back in time we see it. For an object at a redshift of 6, the light has taken around 12.8 thousand million years to travel to Earth. Since we know that the Universe is about 13.75 thousand million years old, this means we are seeing the object in the state it was in less than a thousand million years after the Big Bang. Redshift is therefore a measure of time elapsed since the Big Bang as well as of an object's distance."}
{"text":"'Cosmic ghost' discovered by volunteer astronomer\n\nAug 05, 2008\n\nWhen Yale astrophysicist Kevin Schawinski and his colleagues at Oxford University enlisted public support in cataloguing galaxies, they never envisioned the strange object Hanny van Arkel found in archived images of the night sky.\n\nThe Dutch school teacher, a volunteer in the Galaxy Zoo project that allows members of the public to take part in astronomy research online, discovered a mysterious and unique object some observers are calling a \"cosmic ghost.\"\n\nvan Arkel came across the image of a strange, gaseous object with a hole in the center while using the  website to classify images of galaxies.\n\nWhen she posted about the image that quickly became known as \"Hanny's Voorwerp\" (Dutch for \"object\") on the Galaxy Zoo forum, astronomers who run the site began to investigate and soon realized van Arkel might have found a new class of astronomical object.\n\n\"At first, we had no idea what it was. It could have been in our solar system, or at the edge of the universe,\" said Schawinski, a member and co-founder of the Galaxy Zoo team.\n\nScientists working at telescopes around the world and with satellites in space were asked to take a look at the mysterious Voorwerp. \"What we saw was really a mystery,\" said Schawinski. \"The Voorwerp didn't contain any stars.\" Rather, it was made entirely of gas so hot \u2014 about 10,000 Celsius \u2014 that the astronomers felt it had to be illuminated by something powerful. They will soon use the Hubble Space Telescope to get a closer look.\n\nSince there was no obvious source at hand in the Voorwerp itself, the team looked to find the source of illumination around the Voorwerp, and soon turned to the nearby galaxy IC 2497.\n\n\"We think that in the recent past the galaxy IC 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar,\" Schawinski explains. \"Because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the Voorwerp, light from that past still lights up the nearby Voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100,000 years, and the galaxy's black hole itself has gone quiet.\"\n\n\"From the point of view of the Voorwerp, the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned off \u2013 it's this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe,\" said Chris Lintott, a co-organizer of Galaxy Zoo at Oxford University, UK. \"It's rather like examining the scene of a crime where, although we can't see them, we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows.\" Similar light echoes have been seen around supernovae that exploded decades or centuries ago.\n\nQuasars are very unusual, highly luminous objects, powered by supermassive black holes, and most are extremely distant. \"The strange 'Hanny's Voorwerp' looks like it could be the nearest example of a luminous quasar,\" said C. Megan Urry, Israel Munson Professor of Physics & Astronomy and Chair of the Physics Department at Yale, who was not involved in the research.\"This discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the Internet world,\" commented Professor Bill Keel of the University of Alabama, a galaxyzoo.org team member. \"Hanny's attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object, but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise. Trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge, involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond. This has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy I've done in years!\"\n\nThe Galaxy Zoo project was imagined and begun by Schawinski and his colleague Chris Lintott at Oxford. While working on his PhD thesis, Schawinski classified and catalogued nearly 50,000 galaxies. Knowing that the human eye is sometimes more sensitive than a computer at picking out unusual patterns, he mused that it would be wonderful if there were amateur astronomers who were interested in doing some of the \"scanning.\"\n\n\"When we launched Galaxy Zoo we were overwhelmed \u2014 as was the internet portal, initially \u2014 with the outpouring of public interest and volunteer input,\" said Schawinski. During the last year, over 150,000 armchair astronomers from all over the world volunteered their time and submitted over 50 million classifications for a set of one million images online. They then could follow the progress of the science they made possible at  .\n\n\"It's amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online,\" said Hanny van Arkel. \"It was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the Hubble Space Telescope to follow-up this discovery.\"\n\nThe next stage of Galaxy Zoo will ask volunteers to search for more unusual astronomical objects. But, \"Hanny's Voorwerp\" remains a mystery. It's huge central hole is over 16,000 light years across and Galaxy Zoo astronomers are still puzzling over what caused it.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- While sorting through hundreds of galaxy images as part of the Galaxy Zoo citizen science project two years ago, Dutch schoolteacher and volunteer astronomer Hanny van Arkel stumbled uponSo please tell...

The left image taken August 22 shows the event before it exploded supernova, approximately 1 million times fainter than the human eye can detect. The center image taken August 23 shows the supernova at about 10,000 times fainter than the human eye can detect. The right image taken August 24 shows that the event is 6 times brighter than the previous day. In 2 weeks time it should be visible with a good pair of binoculars. Credit: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\n\nA supernova discovered Wednesday is closer to Earth \u2014 approximately 21 million light-years away \u2014 than any other of its kind in a generation. Astronomers believe they caught the supernova within hours of its explosion, a rare feat made possible with a specialized survey telescope and state-of-the-art computational tools.\n\nThe finding of such a supernova so early and so close has energized the astronomical community as they are scrambling to observe it with as many telescopes as possible, including the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nRelated blog:Get all the observing details for this new supernova at  Joshua Bloom from the University of California (UC), Berkeley, called it \"the supernova of a generation.\" Astronomers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and UC Berkeley who made the discovery predict that it will be a target for research for the next decade, making it one of the most-studied supernovae in history.\n\nThe supernova, dubbed PTF 11kly, occurred in the Pinwheel Galaxy (M101) located in the Big Dipper. It was discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) survey, which is designed to observe and uncover astronomical events as they happen.\n\n\"We caught this supernova very soon after explosion,\" said Peter Nugent from Berkeley Lab, who first spotted the supernova. \"PTF 11kly is getting brighter by the minute. It's already 20 times brighter than it was yesterday. Observing PTF 11kly unfold should be a wild ride. It is an instant cosmic classic.\"\n\nHe credits supercomputers at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), a Department of Energy supercomputing center at Berkeley Lab, as well as high-speed networks with uncovering this rare event in the nick of time.\n\nThe PTF survey uses a robotic telescope mounted on the 48-inch Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar Observatory in Southern California to scan the sky nightly. As soon as the observations are taken, the data travels more than 400 miles (600 kilometers) to NERSC via the National Science Foundation's High Performance Wireless Research and Education Network and DOE's Energy Sciences Network (ESnet). At NERSC, computers running machine-learning algorithms in the Real-time Transient Detection Pipeline scan through the data and identify events to follow up on. Within hours of identifying PTF 11kly, this automated system sent the coordinates to telescopes around the world for follow-up observations.\n\nThree hours after the automated PTF pipeline identified this supernova candidate, telescopes in the Canary Islands in Spain had captured unique \"light signatures,\" or spectra, of the event. Twelve hours later, Nugent's team had observed the event with a suite of telescopes, including the Lick Observatory in California and Keck Observatory in Hawaii, and determined the supernova belongs to a special category, called type Ia. Nugent notes that this is the earliest spectrum ever taken of a type Ia supernova.\n\n\"Type Ia supernovae are the kind we use to measure the expansion of the universe,\" said Mark Sullivan from Oxford University, United Kingdom, who was among the first to follow up on this detection. \"Seeing one explode so close by allows us to study these events in unprecedented detail.\"\n\n\"We still do not know for sure what causes such explosions,\" said Weidong Li from UC Berkeley. \"We are using images from the Hubble Space Telescope, taken fortuitously years before an explosion, to search for clues to the event's origin.\"\n\nThe team will be watching carefully over the next few weeks, and an urgent request to NASA yesterday means the Hubble Space Telescope will begin studying the supernova's chemistry and physics this weekend.\n\nCatching supernovae so early allows a rare glimpse at the outer layers of the supernova, which contain hints about what kind of star exploded. \"When you catch them this early, mixed in with the explosion, you can actually see unburned bits from star that exploded! It is remarkable,\" said Andrew Howell of UC Santa Barbara. \"We are finding new clues to solving the mystery of the origin of these supernovae that has perplexed us for 70 years. Despite looking at thousands of supernovae, I've never seen anything like this before.\"\n\n\"The ability to process all of this data in near real-time and share our results with collaborators around the globe through the Science Gateway at NERSC is an invaluable tool for following up on supernova events,\" said Nugent. \"We wouldn't have been able to detect and observe this candidate as soon as we did without the resources at NERSC.\"\n\nAt a mere 21 million light-years from Earth, a relatively small distance by astronomical standards, the supernova is still getting brighter and might even be visible with good binoculars in 10 days' time, appearing brighter than any other supernova of its type in the past 30 years.\n\n\"The best time to see this exploding star will be just after evening twilight in the Northern Hemisphere in a week or so,\" said Sullivan. \"You'll need dark skies and a good pair of binoculars, although a small telescope would be even better.\"\n\n.\n\n'\"Before that, you'd have to go back to 1972, 1937 and 1572 to find more nearby Type Ia supernovae,\" said Nugent.\n\nHurray for the Type Ia supernovae! White dwarfs explode when they amass matter from a companion star that allows them to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 solar masses.

And nothing can do that, as far as anyone knows. As matter falls into a black hole's gaping maw, it superheats to millions of degrees, screaming a final cry of X-rays as it is torn apart. At a specific point called an event horizon, the matter disappears and is never heard from again.<\/p>\n<p>A pair of X-ray telescopes recently watched some of these X-ray death gasps and were able to figure out <a href=\" target=\"_blank\">how fast a black hole is spinning<\/a>. This is <a href=\" target=\"_blank\">\"hugely important\"<\/a> for black hole science, according to researchers working with NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuSTAR space telescope. One particularly cool finding: The black hole is spinning almost as fast as Einstein's theory of gravity says it possibly could. It's spinning at almost the speed of light.<\/p>\n<p>The galaxy in question is called NGC 1365, which is about twice the size of the Milky Way and located about 60 million light years away. The black hole is about 2 million times more massive than the sun. Scientists using NuSTAR and the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton satellite wanted to measure how fast it is spinning. This is a key feature of black holes that is related to their size and the way they gobble up stars, gas and even other black holes.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is that black holes are <a href=\" to study<\/a>, because, you know, not even light can escape them. To measure them, you have to measure their effect on their surroundings--like the X-rays emitted by dying matter. This is hard to do because objects between us and them can get in the way, however, making the X-rays look distorted. There have been two competing models explaining why the X-rays look warped: Either gravitational distortion caused by black hole gravity, or distortion caused by intervening clouds of gas and dust.<\/p>\n<p>In this new study, NuSTAR and XMM-Newton set out to determine which one is right. The telescopes carefully traced the X-rays emitted at the very, very edge of the black hole, right near the event horizon, or the point of no return. By combining their distinct viewing abilities, the two telescopes were able to see a wide range of X-ray energies, and figure out that the X-rays are not actually distorted by intervening gas clouds. They look distorted because the black hole is spinning, and its immense gravity warps spacetime as it swirls around. This information was used to tell just how fast the black hole is spinning: Just below the universal speed limit. <\/p>\n<p>Along with new information about this particular black hole, this study suggests that black hole observations can remove a little bit of ambiguity.

The team calculated that the quasar is spewing an annual 400 suns worth of gas and dust, at a velocity of nearly 5000 miles per second. <\/p>\n<p>Giant outflows like this one may be able to answer some big cosmic mysteries, like how the black hole at the center of each galaxy affects its size, and why there are so few big galaxies in the Universe. <\/p>\n<\/div>Scienceblack holesgalaxiespretty space picsquasarsSpaceWed, 28 Nov 2012 20:48:10 +0000Emily Elert67753 at  Black Hole Discovered [Video]\n<div class=\"center-image\"><img src=\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"imagecache imagecache-article_image_large\" \/><div><strong>New Black Hole<\/strong> <em><p>NASA\/Goddard Space Flight Center<\/p>\n<\/em><\/div><\/div><div>An X-ray nova lit up the sky enough for NASA's Swift satellite to spot it.\n<!--paging_filter--><p><!--break-->We could say NASA has just discovered a never-before-seen black hole, but it might also be true to say a new black hole just threw up signal flares and shouted at us to discover it. <\/p>\n<p>A rare X-ray nova--a release of X-ray energy--was first caught by NASA's Swift telescope in September.

The story: Powerful crime organizations in the late 21st century can't off their foes without getting caught, so they illegally send victims back in time to the year 2044 to be disposed of by hitmen called \"loopers.\" <em>Looper<\/em>'s time travel, in short, is a futuristic version of the East River.<\/p>\n<p>Though gunning down folks from the future is profitable, it comes at steep personal cost. Thirty years after Joe the looper (played by both Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt with some Bruce-Willis-like makeup) signs up, crime bosses nab him, send him into the past, and force his past self to kill his future self -- an attempt to close his \"loop.\" This is the standard for loopers: live well, but live fast, and when your time comes, your younger self will be your killer. (Nothing could possibly go wrong with this scenario, nor introduce a series of mind-melting time travel paradoxes, right? Oh, wait.)<\/p>\n<p>Moviemakers often turn to scientists to boost the plausibility of their plots, even when the plot involves a drug-addicted time-traveling hitman, but Johnson says he didn't consult with any researchers while making <em>Looper<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>\"The science of real life time travel was less important than the science of using time travel in a story,\" Johnson wrote in an email to Popular Science. \"I studied other time travel movies to see how they put it at the service of the characters and story, and not the other way around.\" Johnson has previously cited <em>La Jet\u00e9e<\/em> as an influence, for example.<\/p>\n<p>But the movie got us thinking about where the science of time travel stands. So we spoke with <a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Edward Farhi<\/a>, a theoretical physicist at MIT who has both seen the movie and intimately studied time travel.<\/p>\n<h3>INTO THE FUTURE<\/h3>\n<p>One of time travel's best-known facts is that going forward -- way, way forward -- is technically possible. Albert Einstein realized this as early as 1905, when he deduced the special theory of relativity.<\/p>\n<p>\"Einstein argued time is not an ever-flowing and immutable thing, but that an interval of time between events depends on the observer,\" Farhi says. In short, the faster you travel compared to some other object, the slower your clock ticks relative to the other object's.<\/p>\n<p>For example, riding a rocket into space that's traveling close to light-speed -- then returning to Earth months or years later, according to your clock -- would elapse hundreds or even thousands of years on the planet. \"You may meet your children's children's children's children and be younger than them, and that's weird,\" Farhi says. \"But there's actually nothing paradoxical about this.\"<\/p>\n<p>Einstein later developed the general theory of relativity, which argues intense gravitational fields are another way to skip ahead in time. Hanging around a black hole's point-of-no-return, where gravity warps space-time, the fabric of the universe, to an extreme degree, could make someone's clock run far slower than that of an observer near the gravity well's edge.<\/p>\n<p>\"If I hung you down there and you looked up at me, you'd see me in fast-motion and I'd see you in slow-motion,\" Farhi says. \"That makes people wonder, could you build a gravity field strong enough to bend space-time to go backward? It's a pretty tempting idea.\"<br \/>\n<\/p>\n<h3>BACK TO THE PAST?<\/h3>\n<p><em>Looper<\/em> doesn't propel characters into the future, except through cinematic montage sequences. But the movie does transport people into the past. <\/p>\n<p>Farhi say most researchers discounted the possibility of backward time travel until the early 1990s, when astrophysicist J. Richard Gott published an intriguing study on theoretical warpings of spacetime called \"closed timelike curves.\" <\/p>\n<p>Gott solved for Einstein's equations in an imaginary 2-D universe to create the curves. Even accounting for the known laws of physics, <a href=\" target=\"_blank\">the solution seemed to allow backward time travel<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Skeptical of this on-paper feat, Farhi and two other physicists then posed the question: <a href=\" target=\"_blank\">what would it take to build this time machine<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p>The trio assumed they'd have infinite technology at their disposal, both to corral the necessary matter to warp 2-D space-time and fuel a spaceship to travel near the speed of light.<\/p>\n<p>\"In Gott's idealized universe, you could turn on the machine around [a dense piece of matter] and come back before you left,\" Farhi says.<\/p>\n<p>After crunching their equations, the implausibility of the machine became clear. To warp space-time enough to create a closed timelike curve as well as power the spaceship would demand half of the fake universe's matter and energy. (Farhi noted that a similarly ridiculous requirement would also extend to such a machine in our own universe.)<\/p>\n<p>That snag notwithstanding, theoretical physicist Gerard 't Hooft and his colleagues also pointed out that <a href=\" target=\"_blank\">the extreme density would collapse the universe in a big crunch<\/a> before the machine could begin to function.<\/p>\n<p>\"Einstein's theory of general relativity seems to conspire to end the universe before you're able to travel back in time and kill your grandfather before your parents were born,\" Farhi said. \"This convinced me that traveling back in time is not possible.\"<br \/>\n<\/p>\n<h3>TIME TRAVEL TODAY<\/h3>\n<p>Farhi has since moved on to study quantum computing, yet other ambitious researchers continue to probe the arrow of time. A group of researches in 2011, for example, suggested that <a href=\" target=\"_blank\">quantum particles can be entangled across time<\/a>, potentially allowing people to send data instantly into the future. Such a feat -- while impractical for now, as it may need to involve black holes to work -- might safeguard data important to humanity.<\/p>\n<p>Another potentially helpful development is the proposed existence of <a href=\" crystals<\/a>. Such perpetually vibrating molecules might be key to the universe's most reliable clocks. Even in the coldest depths of space, which can halt atomic movement, magnetic forces within a properly assembled crystal would keep its atoms moving.<\/p>\n<p>Most recently, physicists studying the decay of particles revealed that <a href=\" target=\"_blank\">time's preferred direction -- forward -- really isn't a fluke<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Although Farhi's work in 1992 convinced him that paradoxes will always prevent backward time travel, contrary to <em>Looper<\/em>'s worrisome depiction of the universe, he gave the possibility one last shot on May 7, 2005.<\/p>\n<p>\"The students [at MIT] decided to host a time traveler's convention. We advertised the event, put out milk and cookies for time travelers, and waited for some to show up. Maybe they were clever enough to remain incognito, but none came,\" Farhi says.<\/p>\n<p>\"So, as far as we know, reverse time travel can only exist in the movies.\"<br \/>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>ScienceDave Mosherblack holesmoviesphysicsspacetimetime travelThu, 27 Sep 2012 17:05:00 +0000Dave Mosher65489 at  From the Void\n<div class=\"center-image\"><img src=\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"imagecache imagecache-article_image_large\" \/><div><strong>Signals From the Void<\/strong> <em><p>Mark Garlick<\/p>\n<\/em><\/div><\/div><div>Scientists are trying to get the first direct look at the black hole at the center of our galaxy.

Down there, people are doing what people come to Hawaii to do: hiking to waterfalls, lying in the sand, exposing their skin to tropical solar radiation. Up here, there is no vegetation, no warmth and very little atmosphere. And as the sun sets over the parabolic aluminum dishes of the Submillimeter Array observatory, it's time to work.<\/p>\n<p>Sheperd Doeleman, the 45-year-old MIT researcher in charge of tonight's experiment, is setting up a piece of the radio telescope that, if all goes well, will synchronize with other radio telescopes in California and Arizona to observe matter on the verge of disappearing into a black hole. Doeleman and his counterparts on the mainland are using a technique called very long baseline interferometry to simulate a much larger instrument, which they call the Event Horizon Telescope. The longer the baseline, the higher the resolution, so these astronomers have for the past decade or so been hauling their delicate and expensive hand-built equipment to remote sites around the world, installing it anew for each observation. The work is highly improvisational, but to see what they want to see, there is no other way.<\/p>\n<p>Outside the Submillimeter Array's control-room windows, patches of snow speckle the summit. The storm that deposited them several days ago has since traveled 2,500 miles east, where it has been blocking all observation at the station in California, thus delaying the whole observing run. Things are going better tonight. Or at least they're starting to. \"It looks like we're actually recording something,\" Doeleman says. \"Which is nice.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"The Mark 5Bs are recording,\" says Nicolas Pradel, a post\u00addoctoral researcher from Taiwan's Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics. The Mark 5B recorders are connected to the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope next door, which is contributing its 15-meter dish to tonight's effort. \"The Mark 5Cs\"-the newest, highest-bandwidth recorders, and the ones hooked up to the Submillimeter Array-\"are not.\" <\/p>\n<p>Doeleman, a slight man with a runner's build, sprints out of the room and runs downstairs, where the recorders are installed. A few minutes later, he darts back into the control room, panting in the thin mountain air. He sits back down at his computer, pounds out a few keystrokes and mumbles something technical and reassuring to the postdocs and telescope operators. The recorders appear to be working black hole should cast a shadow. The goal is to capture an image of that shadow.<\/span>Three arrays is just a start. Doeleman and his cohort have been operating this same network of radio telescopes since 2007, when they pointed the array at the galactic center and detected \"structure on the event-horizon scale,\" a deeply obscured blip in space whose dimensions match the predicted size of <a href= \" A*<\/a> (pronounced \"A-star\"), the four-million-solar-mass black hole at the center of the Milky Way. After that, with encouragement from colleagues, Doeleman decided that peering deeper into the galactic center, deep enough to actually take a picture of the very edge of Sagittarius A*, was not as implausible as it sounds. Detectors were becoming more sensitive every year; data storage and processing power had never been so cheap. If he could add the right telescopes to his network, taking a picture of Sagittarius A* should be, as Doeleman puts it, \"eminently doable.\"<\/p>\n<p>Over the next few years, Doeleman says, he and his group will combine as many as a dozen of the world's most sophisticated radio-astronomy installations to create \"the biggest telescope in the history of humanity\"-a virtual dish the size of Earth, with 2,000 times the resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope. Tonight the Event Horizon Telescope astronomers have a more limited goal: They want to catch as much light from Sagittarius A* as possible and study its polarization to learn about the black hole's magnetic field. But eventually (if all goes well) astronomers using the fully scaled-up Event Horizon Telescope-a machine with resolution high enough to read the date on a quarter from 3,000 miles away-will see the silhouette of an object that is, in itself, unseeable.<dme:page\/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nImmediately after Albert Einstein published his general theory of relativity in 1915, physicists began trying to figure out what his equations said about the actual operation of the universe. One of them was a German astrophysicist-turned-soldier named Karl Schwarzschild. Working from a trench during World War I, he found a way to calculate the curvature of space-time around a highly idealized, perfectly spherical star. He mailed his equations to Einstein, who presented them in Schwarzschild's stead at a January 1916 conference in Berlin. Four months later, Schwarzschild died of illness on the eastern front.<\/dme:page\/><\/p>\n<p>Einstein was impressed by Schwarzschild's math, but he rejected one of his predictions-that a dense enough star would collapse under its own gravity into an infinitely small, infinitely dense point. Einstein insisted that some force of nature that Schwarzschild had ignored would prevent this implosion. The most prominent physicists of the era agreed with Einstein. Black holes, as we now call them, violated so many intuitive ideas about how the universe should work that they met with what the California Institute of Technology theorist Kip Thorne called \"widespread and almost universal 20th-century resistance.\"<\/p>\n<p>Yet in the following decades, physicists became increasingly convinced that Schwarzschild was right. In 1939 Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who would later lead the Manhattan Project, built on Schwarzschild's work (plus two additional decades of research on general relativity) to develop the most persuasive case yet that certain stars, upon exhaustion of their nuclear fuel, would collapse under their own gravity. In the 1950s, using computer models coded to simulate the detonation of hydrogen bombs, both American and Soviet physicists independently generated the most sophisticated mathematical arguments yet that when sufficiently massive stars die, implosion is inevitable.<\/p>\n<p>In the 1960s astronomers started finding empirical evidence, however indirect, that black holes weren't merely mathematical constructs, but that they actually existed. Nothing but enormous black holes, for example, could power quasars-points of light, some of them at the edge of the observable universe, that shine with the luminosity of hundreds of galaxies. In the 1990s astronomers found that stars near the center of galaxies were orbiting at millions of miles per hour. Such speeds made sense only if those stars were orbiting black holes.<\/p>\n<p>Most physicists now accept the existence of black holes-regions of space where gravity becomes infinitely powerful, matter becomes infinitely dense, time freezes and light becomes trapped. Black holes come in two main varieties: stellar-mass holes, which remain after a star collapses, and supermassive ones, which scientists now say sit at the core of all galaxies. At the center of every black hole is a singularity, a point at which our understanding of the laws of physics breaks down. At the edge of every black hole is a boundary called the event horizon, which separates the hole from the rest of the universe. The event horizon is, as Doeleman says, \"a one-way membrane in space-time\" that leads to \"someplace causally distinct from where we are now.\" It's an exit door from the universe with a strict reentry policy: What passes through can never come back.<\/p>\n<p>No one has ever seen an event horizon, but they should be seeable. Theorists predict that the extreme warping of time and space around a black hole's event horizon should create a telltale shadow, a pitch-black circle surrounded by a blazing ring of light. The ultimate goal of the Event Horizon Telescope is to capture an image of that shadow.<\/p>\n<p>The project's success would make it possible to see how the theory of general relativity holds up at the edge of a black hole, the most extreme environment in the universe. It would also provide unequivocal evidence that black holes exist-something often taken for granted but not yet proven. \"Now we can ask the question,\" says Avery Broderick, a theorist at the University of Waterloo and an EHT collaborator. \"That really will motivate a discussion. There's no point arguing about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin until you can find an angel dancing on the head of a pin.\"<\/p>\n<p><center><strong>* * *<\/strong><\/center><\/p>\n<p>One hundred fifty thousand trillion miles from Mauna Kea, Sagittarius A* is spinning radiation into the cosmos. Electrons and ions that once belonged to dust clouds and stars orbit the black hole at nearly the speed of light, whirling around its 140-million-mile circumference once every 24 minutes and along the way throwing off radiation that spans the electromagnetic spectrum. A tiny fraction of the radiation that fled Sagittarius A* 26,000 years ago will tonight make its way to Earth. An even tinier fraction of that radiation will fall on the summit of Mauna Kea, some of it striking the collecting dishes of the mountain's radio-telescope antennas.<\/p>\n<p>If everything works properly, the collecting dishes will funnel the arriving radio waves into helium-cooled receivers, which will beam them to the control room through buried fiber-optic cables. The signals will be amplified, digitized and time-stamped by a <a href= \" maser<\/a>, a $300,000 air-conditioner-size atomic clock that loses only one second every 10 million years. Next, the signals will be recorded on 8-terabyte hard-drive packs, which the astronomers will then FedEx back to the EHT's \"lens\"-a supercomputer-powered correlator at MIT's Haystack Observatory outside Boston.<\/p>\n<p>At Haystack, a technician will take the data packs from all three sites involved in the observation-the Submillimeter Array and James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii, the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) in California, and the Submillimeter Telescope (SMTO) in Arizona-and attempt to sort the signal from the noise. Despite being cooled to four degrees above absolute zero, telescope receivers produce a steady thrum of noise 100,000 times as powerful as the signal from the cosmos. \"Riding on top of the noise is a little bit of a signal that-except for a time difference and a bit of a frequency shift-is the same from station to station,\" explains Jonathan Weintroub, the astronomer and electrical engineer who is in charge of the EHT's instrumentation at the Submillimeter Array. \"The signal that is the same from station to station is the signal from the source.\"<\/p>\n<p>For maximum clarity, all of this has to work properly at every station. And at the Submillimeter Array, at least, everything does appear to be running properly. A little after 7 p.m., with the software cross-checked, the antennas phased up and the recorders finally working, the 12-hour observation sequence begins. Doeleman passes around a duffel bag filled with snacks from Trader Joe's. (\"You have to try the mission figs!\") I sit down next to Ryan Howie, a 20-something telescope operator who's been working at the Submillimeter Array since this group's first observations in 2007, and ask whether tonight's warm-up was abnormally chaotic. Not at all, he says. \"Things are actually going much more smoothly than they did on the first couple of runs.\"<dme:page\/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe weather tonight is immaculate. To put it in radio astronomer-speak, the tau is 0.028. Tau is the central variable in the equation astronomers use to measure the obscuring effect of atmospheric water vapor. And even on this mountain, a spot chosen for its anomalously sweet average figures for tau, nights this clear come only 10 or 15 times a year. Weather like this, Doeleman says, is \"like being in space.\"<\/dme:page\/><\/p>\n<p>The conditions at the other sites are far from ideal. The tau at CARMA is disturbingly high. The tau at SMTO is excellent, but so far, airborne ice crystals have prevented the telescope operators from opening the dome and exposing the satellite dish to the atmosphere. Passable weather at those sites will have to do, though. The snowstorms in California and Arizona over the past three days have forced Doeleman and crew to cede their telescope time to other astronomers and spend their nights brooding 5,000 feet below at Hale Pohaku, the dorm where astronomers sleep and eat and prepare for their observations.<\/p>\n<p>Tonight is the second-to-last chance the Event Horizon Telescope will have this year to do its work. Telescope time is a scarce resource; the time-allocation committees at the various observatories have given Doeleman and his group three nights for this run. To increase the probability of getting good weather at all three sites, they can pick any three nights during an eight-night window. They could, in theory, observe more than once a year, but that would require more money, more travel and more logistical wrangling. They could also, in theory, get a longer observation window (and they have in the past), but it would require everyone to spend even longer on this mountain, waiting for the spheres to align Event Horizon Telescope could provide the first unequivocal evidence that black holes do, in fact, exist.<\/span>Each day around noon, Doeleman gets the weather forecasts for all three sites and makes the call for the night: Go or no go? \"It drives Shep crazy,\" Weintroub says. They're working on ways to make this decision less painful. A crucial step will be to permanently install the EHT's custom digital equipment at every station in the array, so that when the weather is good at all sites, they could trigger an observation remotely, on short notice. This is mostly a matter of securing cooperation from the committees that control the telescopes and raising the money to install the equipment. Better weather forecasts would also help. On Mauna Kea, getting accurate weather information is not a problem. Because the mountain is home to 11 observatories, many of them the most powerful instruments of their kind, Mauna Kea has its own dedicated weather station. That's not the case at smaller observatories such as SMTO and CARMA, and that makes it hard for Doeleman to know when to observe. <\/p>\n<p>Around midnight, the Submillimeter Array has its dishes trained on the black hole at the center of the nearby galaxy M87, which rises four hours before Sagittarius A*. Doeleman picks up a landline phone (cellphones are forbidden because they would interfere with the instruments) and calls the telescope operator in Arizona to find out when they'll be opening the dome. After a few seconds, he hangs up. \"Yes!\" he says. \"SMTO's opening the dome and should be observing in about 30 minutes.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"Just in time to get two scans on M87,\" says Rurik Primiani, the 25-year-old MIT graduate monitoring the Submillimeter Array's antennas. <\/p>\n<p>The good news has Doeleman feeling talkative. He spends a little time telling the postdocs about the technological impediments he faced 15 or 20 years ago as a grad student being introduced to the laborious art of very long baseline interferometry. The fieldwork is what attracted Doeleman to astronomy. He was never, as he puts it, the kid who played with telescopes. But he was the kind of kid who thought that spending the winter in Antarctica sounded like fun. At the age of 22, after graduating from Reed College in his hometown of Portland, Oregon, he joined a yearlong expedition to Antarctica to study cosmic rays. Afterward, he enrolled in graduate school at MIT. He chose to focus on very long baseline interferometry in part because of the high probability of spending weeks on top of cold, dry mountains in remote places.<dme:page\/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nThirty minutes have passed since Doeleman last spoke to the station at Arizona, so he walks over to a phone and calls them back, just to confirm that the dome is open and the station is online. He's quiet for several moments. \"You're lying,\" he says. \"No, you're lying.\" It does not seem as if the person on the other end of the line is lying.<\/dme:page\/><\/p>\n<p>\"What did I break?\" Weintroub says from across the room.<\/p>\n<p>Doeleman hangs up the phone and explains that for some reason, the SMTO is not yet working. Details are sketchy. But we're already on the 12th scan of the night, and the conditions in Arizona are fantastic-the tau there has now dropped to 0.05, as good as it gets in the continental U.S.-so after pacing around the control room for a few minutes, Doeleman calls back for an update. \"Now it's what?\" he asks. \"'Going crazy'? Is that a technical term?\" A muted, guilty snicker spreads among the postdocsSheperd Doeleman collapses into a folding aluminum chair. \"As you can see,\" he says, \"this is hard.\"<\/span>Two hours from now, Sagittarius A* rises. The stakes tonight are higher than usual: NASA's Chandra satellite is joining in, watching Sagittarius A* for x-ray flares that, when combined with the data from the EHT, could provide information about how the black hole changes by the hour. Such a finding would at least be enough for a paper in a major journal, and certainly enough to justify the money and man-hours spent conducting this observing run. So Doeleman exercises all the control he possibly can. He asks the telescope operator to call the chief faculty member at the University of Arizona in the middle of the night and ask him to get there immediately. \"Tell him, 'Shep threatened my life unless I called you.'\"<\/p>\n<p>Half an hour later, Doeleman receives an e-mail from Arizona and reads aloud: \"There is 'no chance whatsoever' \" that they will be back online tonight. The group now faces a decision. It's still relatively early. They could cede the remainder of tonight to other astronomers. Or they could continue with the two-station array. They weigh the options. <\/p>\n<p>Weintroub swivels away from his laptop and says to Doeleman, \"You've got the satellite coverage tonight from Chandra.\" Doeleman nods. Satellite coverage is not something to squander. After a moment Doeleman says, \"If Chandra detects a flare, we could do some very interesting science.\"<\/p>\n<p>And after all, they are here. The station in California is observing. They're running out of nights. And so the observation continues, with the first scan of Sagittarius A* scheduled for 2:05 a.m. Decision made, Doeleman collapses into a folding aluminum chair and says to me, \"As you can see, this is hard.\"<dme:page\/><\/dme:page\/><\/p>\n<p><br \/>\nEven on the clearest nights under the clearest skies on Earth, the galactic center and the dense cluster of stars around it are all but invisible to the human eye. Visible light can't make it through the clouds of dust and plasma that clog the Milky Way's glowing central globe. But radio waves can. That much became known in 1932, when a Bell Telephone Laboratories physicist named Karl Jansky noticed that whenever the galactic plane rose above the horizon, the sky exploded with radio transmissions. Since then, radio astronomers have discovered several means by which to bring the galactic center into increasingly sharp focus.<\/p>\n<p>The first and most important method was the same one the Event Horizon Telescope uses today-connecting multiple geographically distant radio telescopes to form an interferometer, which adds together waves collected at different telescopes to produce a new, stronger wave. In the early 1960s, almost as soon as the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, was completed, astronomers started pointing its two-station interferometer at the galactic center. Then in 1966, observing relatively low-frequency radio waves, astronomers there detected the first signs of what we now know as Sagittarius A*. The resolution was far too low to yield a definitive observation, but eight years later, Green Bank astronomers using an upgraded interferometer capable of capturing higher-frequency waves proved that something extremely dense and bright existed at the center of the galaxy. Something was sitting at the core like a gyroscope, hovering in place while the rest of the Milky Way churned around it. Eight years later, one of the astronomers named the object-which, when viewed from Earth, appears to lie in the constellation Sagittarius-Sagittarius A*.<\/p>\n<p>Since then, increasingly sensitive detectors and more powerful computers have enabled radio astronomers to observe at ever-higher frequencies and peer deeper into the center of the galaxy with greater clarity. Higher frequency radiation, which consists of shorter wavelengths, provides finer resolution. More important, the radiation that comes from the most extreme environment in the galactic center-the very edge of the event horizon-tends to be very high-frequency. At wavelengths longer than two millimeters, observing the galactic center is \"like looking through frosted glass in the bathroom,\" Doeleman says. At wavelengths of one millimeter and below, the frosted glass \"magically clarifies.\"<\/p>\n<p>To capture those one-millimeter waves, astronomers have to travel. Atmospheric water vapor blocks waves in the one-millimeter range, which is why high-frequency radio telescopes are built in places where the atmosphere is thin and arid enough to let the one-millimeter light in. High, dry places like Mauna Kea. Places like the 17,000-foot plateau in Chile's Atacama Desert (the world's driest) where the Atacama Large Millimeter Array is under construction. <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"border-top: 5px solid black; margin: 5px 0.5em 0.25em; float: left telescope should see a disc of darkness surrounded by a glowing halo.<\/span><a href= \" soon to become the world's most powerful radio-telescope array, is expected to join the Event Horizon Telescope array in 2015. Once it does, it will become the critical station in Doeleman's planet-spanning array. With ALMA on board, the EHT needs to add two, maybe three more key telescopes to approach the data-gathering capacity it will take to see Sagittarius A*'s event horizon. The EHT crew will also need to install their most advanced equipment-including the new recorders currently under development at Haystack, which should record data eight times as fast as the ones they use today-at every station. But once that's done, their virtual telescope should be able to gather enough data to make an image.<\/p>\n<p>Like all radio-telescope images, the picture will be an encoded map of a small patch of sky-a map of the immediate vicinity of Sagittarius A* in which the brightness of each pixel represents the intensity of radiation coming from that speck of space.

But at the end of some observing run, there will be a picture.<\/p>\n<p>Theorists have used supercomputers to predict what the picture should look like. If the black hole is calm, the telescope should see a disc of darkness surrounded by a glowing halo, like an eclipse. One side of the disc may contain a fat blob of light. That's a hotspot, a clumped-up cloud of accreting matter orbiting the event horizon. If Sagittarius A* is caught consuming some giant cloud of matter, the black hole may look like a ball of fire. <\/p>\n<p>Doeleman is quick to emphasize that the EHT will be gathering data years before and after Sagittarius A*'s shadow first comes into focus. The more telescopes Doeleman can add, the finer the detail they'll be able to resolve. Yet some theorists argue that, scientifically, the picture is almost beside the point. \"I don't think the end-all and be-all of this is producing an image,\" Broderick says. \"Eventually there will be an image, but it won't tell us much more.\" Viewed this way, the image is candy. Viewed this way, the Event Horizon Telescope is a science project designed to generate, almost by accident, a work of art.<dme:page\/><\/dme:page\/><\/p>\n<p><br \/>\nBy 2:30 a.m. local time, two-thirds of the Event Horizon Telescope is recording transmissions from Sagittarius A*, which now hangs low over the horizon. Primiani reads the data streaming in over his terminal and breaks the silence: \"Man, Sag A Star is <i>bright<\/i> tonight.\"<\/p>\n<p>The news is almost painful. Sure, if the data from tonight turns out decent <i>and<\/i> Chandra detects a flare, then the night could yield interesting findings, despite the failure of the telescope in Arizona. And there's always tomorrow. But for now, the crew appears to be treating the night's observation as an exercise in perseverance.<\/p>\n<p>Doeleman leans back in an office chair and closes his eyes. Weintroub lies down on the floor and promptly falls asleep. Everyone else continues monitoring their computers. Two and a half hours pass in which nothing happens, which is really the way these things are supposed to go. Boring is good for radio astronomy. In his 1987 book <a href= \" Light<\/i><\/a>, the writer Richard Preston describes sitting in the control room at the Palomar Mountain observatory in California with some of the greatest astronomers of the age, watching dozens of galaxies never before seen by human eyes scroll across the observation screen. It doesn't work like that here. For now, the EHT is like a half-built long-exposure camera that yields clues and promises rather than actual pictures. <\/p>\n<p>By 5 a.m., everyone is awake, and Rurik Primiani, still sitting behind his control monitors, is getting restless. \"Think we have enough data now?\" he asks Doeleman. \"The question is whether we're getting <i>any<\/i> data,\" Doeleman replies. \"Who knows what CARMA's doing. Pretty sure we know what SMTO's doing.\"<\/p>\n<p>Things become very still. Inspired by the witching hour, I ask Doeleman a question I had asked him before: Why black holes? \"A black hole is the only place in the universe where you can go but you can't come back,\" he says. \"In theory, if you could build the right spaceship, you could go to the center of the sun and come back. You could go to the center of a neutron star. You'd be like, 'Whoa, it's so <i>dense<\/i> in here!'\" he says, waving his arms in a mime's struggle to escape from a neutron-star box. \"But you could come back,\" he says. \"You could never come back from a black hole. And that's creepy. It creeps me out.\"<\/p>\n<p>A little after 6 a.m., as Doeleman rouses the postdocs and prepares to power down the machine, Weintroub and I decide to go watch the sun rise. \"That was frustrating as hell,\" he says, as we drive up the paved road to the true summit. All this preparation, perfect weather in Hawaii-all crippled by a broken drive motor on the telescope in Arizona. But, then, if the SMTO group can get their telescope fixed, and the weather holds at all three stations, tomorrow night could be good. \"One good night makes it all worthwhile,\" he says.<\/p>\n<p><center><strong>* * *<\/strong><\/center><\/p>\n<p>Scientists estimate that the Milky Way alone could contain millions of black holes. The ubiquity of something so violent, so absurd, so incomprehensible is enough to needle at our sense of existential unease. Black holes <i>are<\/i> creepy. They remind us, as philosophers have been reminding us for centuries, that we never see the world in itself. We only see its shadows.<\/p>\n<p>The following night, Doeleman later told me, went quite well. Technicians fixed the malfunctioning motor at SMTO. The weather held at all the sites. And our picture of the black hole at the center of the galaxy grew a little sharper.<\/p>\n<p>A few weeks later, looking for perspective on the Event Horizon Telescope's prospects for success, I called Fred Lo, the director emeritus of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and a participant in the early hunt for Sagittarius A*. He said that what Doeleman and his team are trying to do is difficult but not without precedent. During the Cold War, he said, American astronomers coordinated with their Soviet counterparts on very long baseline interferometry observations. The American scientists would stop in Washington, D.C., to calibrate their atomic clocks and receive security clearance and then fly to Moscow, atomic clock in tow. Doeleman and company have plenty of problems to solve, but crossing the Iron Curtain is not one of them. \"This is the sort of thing this community has always done,\" Lo said. \"It will get done.\"<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><b>1.

Einstein's theory of general relativity says it is there, and other observations of nearby galactic structures strongly hint at its existence as well. Einstein even told us what it should look like. But actually seeing it for the first time will tell us all kinds of things about the very nature of spacetime itself, and it will also tell us if relativity is breaking down at the core of our universe. Essentially, capturing an image of a black hole is a test of general relativity itself--a test of modern physics as we know it.<\/p>\n<p>\"Black holes are still theoretical constructs, they're kind of like the unicorns of the cosmological world,\" Doeleman says. \"There's very good evidence they exist, and our best test case is at the center of our galaxy where it's fairly certain there's a 4-million-solar-mass black hole lurking. But we haven't seen it yet. To ask whether Einstein is right, you have to go to the most extreme environment in the universe, which is the boundary of the black hole.\"<\/p>\n<p>Getting there will require a blend of new technology, old tricks, and the anointing of a brand-new radio telescope array that will come online over the next few years. But Doeleman and the various collaborators building the EHT are now confident that what wasn't even thinkable just a few years ago is now within reach, as technology has turned a time-tested astronomical technique into a tool that should give us our first glimpse of Einstein's vision of gravity's most violent manifestation.<\/p>\n<p>That technique is <a href=\" long baseline interferometry (VLBI)<\/a>, and it's what allows the EHT team to build a telescope the size of Earth without actually building anything at all. By feeding data from radio telescopes around the world into a supercomputer, they can create a telescope with an imaging area the size of the entire planet, allowing them to capture images in radio wavelengths at resolutions that should let them see straight to the heart of the Milky Way.<\/p>\n<p>Think of VLBI like this: You're standing at the center of the galaxy, looking at Earth, which is way out at the Milky Way's fringe. Now, imagine Earth as a mirror, but only the places where there are radio telescope arrays on its surface are polished--the rest of this planet-sized mirror is blacked out. These polished spots are the only places on the mirror that can collect data. This sparse mirror wouldn't provide a very complete picture to someone peering through the other end.<\/p>\n<p>But now imagine the Earth rotating. The polished portions of the lens--the parts collecting data--begin to slowly move across the blacked-out areas of the mirror, collecting data from different points on its surface as rotation and the seasonal tilt of the planet continue. Eventually, the telescopes--and there are many scattered all over the globe--have collected data from positions all over this lens, just not all at the same time. Over months and years, this data is sufficient to stitch together a rather thorough view roughly equivalent to that captured by an Earth-sized telescope mirror.<\/p>\n<p>That's VLBI. By linking the data from many telescopes together, the EHT can generate a virtual telescope, with a data-gathering surface the size of the planet. Their data is time-stamped by a hydrogen maser atomic clock, ensuring that given enough computing power, all the radio data can be neatly stitched together into a single picture. And given enough time, and as more radio telescopes come online, that picture grows clearer and clearer.<\/p>\n<p>Up to a point, at least. VLBI has been employed by astronomers for decades, but an undertaking like the EHT wasn't possible previously. The technology simply wasn't there yet. It's really not even there now, but it's so close that Doeleman and his EHT colleagues can begin gathering data.<\/p>\n<p>\"We have the opportunity to make measurements that weren't possible five years ago,\" Doeleman says. \"In the last five years, we've developed instrumentation to carry out VLBI at the highest frequencies where you get very good resolution. We can also now swallow large swaths of bandwidth. Instead of a couple of hundred megahertz, we can now swallow many gigahertz. You can think of that as being more energy, more photons from the black hole itself. That means our sensitivity goes way up. So it's a combination of higher sensitivity and more telescopes around the Earth that's letting us do what we couldn't five years ago. The technology is at a point now that it's a matter of implementation rather than building new systems.\"<\/p>\n<p>A big piece of this technological advance is the new <a href=\" Large Millimeter\/submillimeter Array (ALMA)<\/a> coming online in northern Chile over the next few years. ALMA's 66 precision antennas will be tied together into one huge radio telescope--a sort of microcosm of VLBI--that will be the most sensitive submillimeter facility on the planet.<\/p>\n<p>\"That, in one stroke, is going to increase the sensitivity of the Event Horizon Telescope by a factor of ten,\" Doeleman says. \"And it's going to increase our ability to see very small detail by a factor of two.\"<\/p>\n<p>But when observing a black hole, which allows no light to escape, what will the EHT be observing? How can it image something that seemingly cannot be imaged? Einstein has an answer for this too.<\/p>\n<p>\"The black hole's gravitational field is so intense that it draws all this dust and gas and matter to it,\" Doeleman says. \"But it's trying to force all that matter into such a small space that it gets very, very hot and begins to radiate--in X-rays, in the optical, and in the radio. It's a very bright source of emission across the spectrum.\"<\/p>\n<p>In other words, Doeleman says, we'll see the black hole because it is a messy eater--it will be ringed in radiating matter, a \"luminous soup\" that hasn't yet fallen into the black hole but is glowing at the event horizon. But exactly what this will look like is uncertain, and this will be the exciting check on relativity because relativity tells us exactly what it <i>should<\/i> look like. At a black hole, the gravitational force should be so intense that it lenses light around it, Einstein theorized. So while some of the light we see from that luminous soup will come to us naturally from the front side of the black hole, it will also bend light around itself, exposing us to light from the backside that, under normal circumstances, would be going the opposite direction.<\/p>\n<p>If relativity is correct, the image produced should show a perfectly circular ring of light--a halo of lensed light bending around the black hole--wrapped around a dim space in the middle. Einstein called this dark spot in the center the \"shadow.\" At a recent meeting of EHT partners in Tucson, all the physicists and theorists present concurred that finding that shadow--and verifying or disproving Einstein's prediction--should be a top scientific priority, Doeleman says. After all, with one image we could not only finally prove the existence of black holes, but could confirm or completely upend everything we theoretically know about what takes place at the heart of our galaxy and galaxies elsewhere in the universe.<\/p>\n<p>\"We're after an image that will show these strong gravity effects, we're after this shadow,\" Doeleman says. \"When we finally do take a picture, if we see this shadow, it will be an amazing, mind-altering result.\"<\/p>\n<\/div>TechnologyFeatureClay Dillowastronomyblack holesevent horizonevent horizon telescopegeneral relativitySpaceThu, 16 Feb 2012 19:25:46 +0000Clay Dillow60615 at  X-Ray Telescope Will Balloon Into the Stratosphere To Look At Black Holes \n<div class=\"center-image\"><img src=\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"imagecache imagecache-article_image_large\" \/><div><strong>Cygnus X-1<\/strong> <p>Artist's view of the binary system Cygnus X-1, which will be one of the targets for the X-ray polarization instrument X-Calibur, scheduled to be in the air in fall 2013 or spring 2014.<\/p>\n<em><p>ESO\/M.

At first, astronomers thought it was a gamma-ray burst from a collapsing star, but when it kept shining in a variable pattern (brightening and fading) scientists realized it wasn't your average GRB.<\/p>\n<p>Astronomer Joshua Bloom at the University of California-Berkeley suspected it was a high-energy jet produced as a sun-sized star fell into a black hole and was torn to pieces. Bloom and researchers from several other institutions in the US and UK started analyzing data from the Swift Gamma Burst Mission, which first spotted the blaze of glory, as well as the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Keck Observatory. Their analysis confirmed the theory, and was published Thursday in Science Express.<\/p>\n<p>As tidal forces tear the star to pieces, some of the star's mass is turned into energy. Some of that energy radiates as x-rays and gamma ray jets that spew from the swirling disk of star guts. The variable brightness is the result of new flares that occurred as more chunks of the destroyed star fell into the black hole, <a href=\" target=\"_blank\">researchers said<\/a>. Earth happened to be directly in the path of one of those gamma ray jets, which is why it looked so incredibly bright, scientists said.<\/p>\n<p>By the way, this is still going on, more than two months later. Most star-death events last a matter of hours or maybe days, not weeks or months. (This star really died about 3.8 billion years ago.)<\/p>\n<p>The black hole in question has a mass about six or seven times that of the sun, but that's not really that big in terms of active galactic nuclei. Massive black holes, as compared to supermassive black holes, can quietly munch on gas for long periods of time, and roar to life when something wanders too close. That seems to be what happened here, Bloom said in a Cal <a href=\" target=\"_blank\">news release<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\"Here, you have a black hole sitting quiescently, not gobbling up matter, and all of a sudden something sets it off,\" he said. \"This could happen in our own galaxy, where a black hole sits at the center living in quiescence, and occasionally burbles or hiccups as it swallows a little bit of gas. From a distance, it would appear dormant, until a star randomly wanders too close and is shredded.\"<\/p>\n<p>This is a very rare event, and it's even more unlikely that Earth would get such a great view, Bloom said - probably once in 100 million years in any given galaxy.<\/p>\n<p>[<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">ScienceDaily<\/a>]<\/p>\n<\/div>ScienceRebecca Boyleastronomyblack holeblack holesgamma-ray burstsjetsnasastarsswift observatoryFri, 17 Jun 2011 20:06:42 +0000Rebecca Boyle55005 at  Supermassive Black Holes Found At Nearby Galaxy's Heart \n<div class=\"center-image\"><img src=\" 8_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"imagecache imagecache-article_image_large\" \/><div><strong>Markarian 739<\/strong> <p>In visible light, Markarian 739 resembles a smiling face, with a pair of bright cores underscored by an arcing spiral arm.

These black holes sometimes radiate so much that they're considered active galactic nuclei, but that type is very rare, comprising only about one percent of galaxies. It's even more unusual, then, to find a galaxy with twin AGN. This is only the second one ever found. <\/p>\n<p>Astronomers think stupendously disruptive events like galaxy collisions could spur AGNs to switch on, by sending huge amounts of gas spiraling toward the pre-existing black holes. The gas gets superheated as it falls toward the event horizon, radiating X-ray energy. It stands to reason, then, that some galaxies would have two AGNs - two products of a merger that occurred some time in the past. But astronomers weren't finding any. <\/p>\n<p>Researchers from the University of Maryland, the University of Hawaii and Yale University used the Burst Alert Telescope on NASA's Swift satellite, which maps sources of intense radiation, to sniff out a possible twin.

{"text":"30 Doradus is better known as the Tarantula nebula and is located 170,000 light years away within the Milky Way's largest satellite galaxy the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).\n\nThe image shows a region of space approximately 650 light years across with several million stars present within. Combined, the sum total of the stars' masses shown in this image would be well over a million times the mass of our own Sun.\n\nThe stars are grouped into smaller clusters ranging in age from about 2 million \u2013 25 million years old, whilst this may sound ancient in human terms as far as the universe is concerned even the oldest star in the region is a newcommer.\n\nThe brightest cluster is NGC 2070 being one of the youngest (between 2 and 3 million years old) and most actively starforming regions with the larger structure Astronomers find it an attractive region to study. Recently in fact, it was revealed that at the heart of the cluster (which contains upwards of half a million stars) there is a dense clump of stars designated RMC 136 where the largest stars yet discovered reside. Indeed several of these monsters are more than 100 times the mass of our own sun, truly cosmic giants.\n\nThe fierce output of the regions hot stars sculpts the regions gas and just into the fantastic arcs and bubbles we can see in the image. The fierce radiation bombardment of radiation is also exciting the gas and dust molecules of the nebula making them glow in their own right and classing the region as an emission nebula.\n\nThe image is composed of data from both Hubble and the ESO's MPG\/ESO 2.2-metre telescope and represents the one of the largest such mosaics in existence today. The data was captured by both telescopes during an observing run in October 2011.\n\nThe region is a nebula composed mainly of hydrogen and it is using this hydrogen to create new stars of all masses.\n\nNot long ago, (by astronomical terms of course!) the nebula would have been cold and dark as the newly forming stars had yet to break out of their gaseous progenitors. The most massive and thus hottest newborn stars have now blasted through the clouds of dust and gas that surrounded them, subjecting the surrounding nebula to a fierce stream of ultraviolet radiation that is eroding the larger structure and making it fluoresce in response. This fluorescence makes the nebula an emission nebula as it is emitting its own light rather than just reflecting that of the stars it contains.\n\nAnalysis of the data indicates that the majority of this radiation comes from one star. It is the bright star visible near the centre of the image.\n\nOnly the largest stars have currently emerged from their nurseries with many smaller, perhaps more sun like stars remain hidden within their denser pockets of the nebula.\n\nNGC 2467 is like many other star forming regions including the more famous Orion Nebula. NGC 2467 is located around 13,000 light years from Earth with the Orion Nebula around 10,000 light years away.\n\nThe Nebula is located in the constellation Puppis which is completely visible to residents of the southern hemisphere (those in the northern hemisphere can observe the northern section of the constellation however it sits close to the horizon)\n\nThe image is a combination of several taken with the HST's Wide Field Channel in several filters. The images where collected by the telescope all the way back in 2004As we prepare to announce the results of this year's competition tomorrow it seems fitting that last year's results are published now.\n\nSo lets take a fond look back at some of the many wondrous astronomical images 2010 brought us -\n\nThe best image of a body within our Solar System 2010 was-\n\nEnceladus Credit: NASA Cassini\n\nEnceladus captured by NASA's Cassini Orbiter.\n\nIt captures the beauty of Saturn's moon Enceladus. Despite being only 500 kilometres in diameter Enceladus is a dynamic world with cryovolcanic processes in action that create huge geysers spouting high above the moon wherever they can find a weak point in the frozen surface.\n\nSeveral of these geysers have been captured in this image, and it is these features that exposed Enceladus to be more than a ball of ice.\n\nThis stunning galaxy is a face on spiral, located around 68 million light years from us here on Earth. It lies within the Northern constellation Ursa Major (The Great Bear).\n\nThe galaxy displays beautiful clouds of active hydrogen gas (pink spots), new formed star clusters (blue spots) and lashings of dust lanes which will one day collapse to form the next generation of stars.These features, combined with the galaxy's beautiful spiral arms, make the galaxy a stunning sight.\n\nDespite its beauty the galaxy is somewhat petit being a 'mere' 30,000 light years across which makes it 1\/3 the size of our our galaxy the Milky Way.\n\nThe image was created using exposures obtained between 2000 and 2009 by Hubble's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2), the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3).\n\nFinally the one you have all been waiting for the best image outside our Solar System though within the Milky Way, which is also the best image overall 2010 is -\n\nLagoon Nebula Credit: NASA; ESA\n\nThe Lagoon Nebula as seen by Hubble.\n\nThe nebula is located somewhere between 4,000 and 5,000 light years from the Earth and lies in the constellation Sagittarius (meaning it is in the direction of the centre of our galaxy).\n\nThe image is a close up of the gas and dust near the centre of the nebula. It is being illuminated by the fierce ultraviolet light of young, high mass stars nearby making the gas and dust glow and emit their own light allowing the nebula to be classed as an emission nebula rather than a reflection nebula like DC 129. The nebula is a huge star producing factory(over 100 light years across) with its clouds slowly collapsing into the next generation of stars.\n\nSome of these new stars are trying to absorb more material than they can stomach and the result is a stream of material being blown out at their poles (by bi-polar outflow for those interested), called Herbig-Haro objects. Several new such objects have been discovered in the nebula in recent years allowing astronomers to gain a deeper insight into how young stars form and interact with their environment.\n\nThis image carries spectacular detail showing 'tiny' ripples in the nebula making its maritime name seem fitting. Unlike the patterns on the surface of the sea, these are not caused by tides or the wind, but by the immense power of ultraviolet radiation blowing away the gas and dust that forms the nebula. The patterns result from tiny differences in the density of the gas making some sections harder to blow away than others.\n\nIf you are lucky enough to live away from light pollution and have clear skies it is possible to see the Lagoon nebula with your own eyes as a fuzzy grey patch in the Milky Way, though it takes a reasonable sized telescope to make out any details.\n\nThe image was captured by Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and shows hydrogen in red. Light from ionised nitrogen in green and light through a yellow filter in blue.\n\nTo make up for the long gap between the recent images of the week, here is another!\n\nLambda Centauri Credit: ESO\n\nThe Lambda Centauri nebula is more commonly known as the Running Chicken nebula (or IC 2944) thanks to the fluke alignment of gas within.\n\nIt is an emission nebula glowing from the harsh bombardment of the ultraviolet light produced by the hot young stars that have been birthed by the nebula's dusty clouds. The red glow indicates the familiar presence of excited hydrogen, a feature common in and around such star forming emission nebulae.\n\nStar formation is evidenced further by the presence of Bok Globules \u2013 the dark black objects in the image particularly concentrated in the top right corner around the cluster of bright blue stars. These are small dense regions of gas and dust that are collapsing to form the next generation of stars.\n\nThese particular Bok Globules have received particular attention. They are known as Thackeray's Globules in homage to their discoverer Andrew David Thackeray, a South American astronomer who identified the globules in 1950 and famously observed by the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nThackeray's Globules Credit: NASA\/ESA and The Hubble Heritage Team STScI\/AURA)\n\nEventually the stars within these globules will erode the cocoon of surrounding material and will reveal themselves to the universe.\n\nUnfortunately, such beautiful emission nebulae are short lived in astronomical terms, lasting just a few million years before their gas has either been used to forge stars or blown out from the area by fierce stellar winds. The most massive of stars will burn out in flashes as they rapidly chew through their supply of hydrogen briefly lighting up the area again as a supernova and glowing remnant.\n\nThe main image was produced using data from the Wide Field Imager on the MPG\/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at ESO's La Silla Observatory."}

{"text":"Bright galaxies like to stick together\n\nThe Herschel Space Observatory has been able to see thousands of galaxies and identify their locations, showing for the first time that they are packed closely together in the center of large galaxy clusters. Provided by the Science and Technology Facilities Council, United Kingdom\n\nPublished:\nMay 28, 2010\n\nImage of the distant universe as seen by Herschel's SPIRE instrument. Every small spot of light is a distant galaxy, seen between 10 and 12 billion years ago. On close examination, the distribution is not uniform, with some areas containing more galaxies than others.\n\nPhoto by ESA\/SPIRE and HerMES consortia\n\nMay 28, 2010 Astronomers using the European Space Agency's Herschel telescope have discovered that the brightest galaxies tend to be in the busiest parts of the universe. This crucial piece of information will enable theorists to revise their theories of galaxy formation.\n\nFor more than a decade, astronomers have been puzzled by some strange bright galaxies in the distant universe that appear to be forming stars at phenomenal rates, making them very hard to explain with conventional theories of galaxy formation. One important question has been the environments in which they are located, such as their closeness. The Herschel Space Observatory, with its ability for sensitive mapping over wide areas, has been able to see thousands of these galaxies and identify their locations, showing for the first time that they are packed closely together in the center of large galaxy clusters.\n\nA project using the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) instrument aboard Herschel has been surveying large areas of the sky, currently totaling 15 square degrees \u2014 around 60 times the apparent size of the Full Moon. The two regions mapped so far are in the constellations of Ursa Major and Draco, well away from the confusion of our own galaxy. Galaxies that are brightest at Herschel's far-infrared wavelengths are typically seen as they were around 10 billion years ago, the light having traveled toward us since then.\n\nThe image shows a false-color view of a small portion of the sky observed by Herschel. Almost every point of light is an entire galaxy, each containing billions of stars. The colors represent the far-infrared wavelengths measured by Herschel, with redder galaxies either being farther away or containing colder dust, while brighter galaxies are forming stars more vigorously. While at a first glance the galaxies look to be scattered randomly over the image, they are not. A closer look reveals there are regions that have more galaxies and regions that have fewer. This clustering of galaxies through space provides information about the way they have interacted over the history of the universe.\n\n\"These amazing new results from Herschel are just a taste of things to come as Herschel continues to unlock the secrets of the early stages of star birth and galaxy formation in our universe,\" said David Parker, director of Space Science and Exploration at the United Kingdom Space Agency. \"We're immensely proud of our United Kingdom scientists who are playing key roles in this highly successful space mission.\"\n\nHerschel sees material that cannot be seen at visible wavelengths, namely cold gas and dust between the stars. This is well-illustrated by looking at much closer galaxies that can be seen in more detail. The Antennae Galaxies, lying a mere 50 million light-years away, are actually two galaxies that are in the process of colliding, and were observed as part of a different observing program. Herschel does not see the light from stars, but the clouds of dust within which new stars are forming. The collision of these galaxies has caused a surge in star formation, but such collisions are relatively rare in the universe today. Billions of years ago, however, when galaxies were more tightly packed, such events were more common.\n\nDespite the new window to the universe afforded by the far-infrared light, Herschel is still not seeing the full picture. Three-quarters of the matter in our universe is made up of mysterious \"dark matter\" that does not shine at all. Because we cannot see dark matter, we do not know what it is made of, but we can measure its effect on the matter around it. Although it does not emit or absorb light, dark matter does interact with the rest of the universe through gravity, gradually pulling groups of galaxies together into huge clusters over the course of billions of years. While many computer simulations exist of how this occurs, the ability to measure this at different times through the history of the universe allows astronomers to compare the simulations with real measurements.\n\nThese latest results from Herschel, part of the \"HerMES\" key program, show that the bright galaxies detected with the SPIRE instrument preferentially occupy regions of the universe that contain more dark matter. This seems to be especially true about 10 billion years ago when these galaxies were forming stars at a higher rate than most galaxies are today.\n\nOur Milky Way Galaxy resides in the suburbs of a large supercluster centered about 60 million light-years away. The neighboring supercluster of galaxies to us is around 300 million light-years away. By comparison, 10 billion years ago galaxies were only 20 to 30 million light-years apart on average. Their proximity means that many of the galaxies will eventually collide with one another. It is these collisions that stir up the gas and dust in the galaxies and cause the rapid bouts of star formation. \"Thanks to the superb resolution and sensitivity of the SPIRE instrument on Herschel, we managed to map in detail the spatial distribution of massively star-forming galaxies in the early universe,\" said Asantha Cooray of the University of California, Irvine. \"All indications are that these galaxies are busy. They are crashing, merging, and possibly settling down at centers of large dark matter halos.\"\n\nIt has required the sensitivity and resolution of Herschel to be able to identify the brightest galaxies and establish the way in which they are clustering. \"We have known for a long time that environment plays an important role in shaping galaxies' evolution,\" said Lingyu Wang of the University of Sussex in England. \"With Herschel, we are able to pierce through huge amounts of dust and study the impact of the environment right from the birth of these massive galaxies forming stars at colossal rates. This is allowing us to witness the active past of today's dead elliptical galaxies at times when they were in rich environments.\"\n\n\"This result from Asantha's team is fantastic; it is just the kind of thing we were hoping for from Herschel and was only possible because we can see so many thousands of galaxies,\" said Seb Oliver from the University of Sussex. It will certainly give the theoreticians something to chew over.\""}

The halo is the spherical space around the flatter disk of the galaxy, which contains dense clusters of stars called globular clusters and older stars.\n\nKalirai's technique makes use of newly formed white dwarf stars to determine the age of their parent stars in the halo to within 0.7 billion years. This is much more precise than the two other techniques available to measure stellar ages in the halo, which are accurate to between 1 and 3 billion years, depending on the technique.\n\nSo why do we want to know how old stars in the Milky Way's halo are? The more precisely astronomers can determine those stars' ages, the more precisely they can determine the age of the galaxy itself, which in turn informs the theories of our galaxy's formation and evolution"}
{"text":"NEWS CENTER\n\nUT Arlington researchers try new approach for simulating supernovas\n\nTwo\nUniversity of Texas at Arlington researchers want to bridge the gap between\nwhat is known about exploding stars and the remnants left behind thousands of\nyears later. So they're trying something new \u2013 using SNSPH, a complex computer\ncode developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n\nOn\nTuesday, Carola I. Ellinger, a post-doctoral researcher at UT Arlington, and\nSangwook Park, an assistant professor in the College\nof Science's physics\ndepartment, were scheduled to present their research on \"3D Simulations of Supernovae\ninto the Young Remnant Phase\" at the national meeting of the American\nAstronomical Society in\nLong Beach, Calif. Their oral presentation focuses on first efforts to use\nSNSPH, a parallel 3-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics code written\nin 2005, to create 3D simulations of a core-collapse supernova evolving into\nremnants.\n\n\"There\nare a lot of numerical simulations for the explosion of the supernova and a lot\nof simulations of the blast wave expanding into interstellar medium, but there\nwas no useful work connecting the two, even though the physics are connected,\"\nsaid Park. \"Now, we are using the most appropriate program we know to do that.\"\n\nBesides Ellinger and Park, co-authors\nof the abstract include: Gabriel Rockefeller and Chris Fryer, of the Computer, Computational,\nand Statistical Sciences division at Los Alamos National Laboratory; and\nPatrick Young, of the Arizona State University School of Earth and Space\nExploration.\n\nCore collapse supernovas make up\nnearly three-quarters of all supernovas and they are the type of star\nexplosions that create black holes and neutron stars. Scientists study them to\nlearn more about the history and landscape of the universe, including how\nminerals were distributed and planets formed. Typically, individual researchers\nfocus on either the blast or the remnants.\n\nThough\ntheir\nproject is in its initial stages, the researchers hope their new models will\nhelp reveal the detailed nature of the two features of a supernova remnant -\ncharacteristics that arose in instabilities during the explosion and those that\nwere created in the interaction with surrounding medium. Ellinger said she\nhopes the simulations will eventually be used to interpret X-ray data from\nNASA's Chandra space telescope as well as other missions, such as the Nuclear\nSpectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuSTAR, launched in 2012.\n\n\"Dr. Park\nand Dr. Ellinger are taking existing tools, looking at the rapidly expanding\nfield of astronomy data and finding new ways to use the two together. This kind\nof creative thinking is a model for UT Arlington students and fellow\nscientists,\" said Pamela Jansma, dean of the UT Arlington College of Science.\n\nPark said the new work with SNSPH\ncan be traced back to increases in data about the composition of supernova\nremnants, much of which has been brought about by the Chandra X-ray Observatory.\nChandra, launched in 1999,\nis NASA's flagship mission for X-ray astronomy.\n\nWith\nincreasingly detailed data, scientists studying supernova\nremnants in the Milky Way are now able to differentiate between debris that was\nejected from the exploded star, also called the progenitor, and the\npre-existing ambient material that was swept up in\nthe blast wave. This gives researchers some of the parameters they need to\ntrace the history of the remnant, according to Park and Ellinger.\n\nThe UT\nArlington team's work on supernovas is supported by Chandra grants from the Smithsonian\nAstrophysical Society.\n\nPark and Ellinger are two of the\ninnovative researchers at The University of Texas at Arlington, a comprehensive\nresearch institution of more than 33,200 students and more than 2,200 faculty\nmembers in the heart of North"}
{"text":"Filaments in the Cygnus Loop\n\nSubtle and delicate in appearance, these are filaments of shocked interstellar gas -- part of the expanding blast wave from a violent stellar explosion. Recorded in November 1997 with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 on board the Hubble Space Telescope, the picture is a closeup of a supernova remnant known as the Cygnus Loop. The nearly edge-on view shows a small portion of the immense shock front moving toward the top of the frame at about 170 kilometers per second while glowing in light emitted by atoms of excited hydrogen gas. Not just another pretty picture, this particular image has provided some dramatic scientific results. Now determined to lie only 1,440 light-years away, the Cygnus Loop is thought to have been expanding for 5 - 10 thousand years."}
{"text":"Remember that a stellar black hole was once a star. Most stars have a\ncompanion star to which they are bound in a binary system. This nearby\ncompanion can be a source of material on which the black hole \"feeds\".\nMatter can be pulled off the companion in large swirling streams of hot\ngas that spiral toward the black hole as a fast moving incandescent\nwhirlpool known as an accretion disk. As the matter in the disk falls\ncloser to the black hole, it heats up and gives off radiation such as\nX-rays. By measuring the motion and radiation from an accretion disk,\nastronomers are able to infer the presence and mass of the black hole.\nWhen all of the material in the accretion disk has been consumed, the\ndisk disappears and the black hole is virtually undetectable. Stars and\nplanets at a safe distance from the black hole's event horizon will not\nbe pulled in toward the black hole. They will instead orbit the black\nhole just as the planets orbit the Sun in our solar system. The\ngravitational force on stars and planets orbiting a black hole is the\nsame as when the black hole was a normal star.\n\nSupermassive black holes have masses comparable to those of a typical\ngalaxy. These masses range anywhere from 10 billion to 100 billion of\nour Suns. Supermassive black holes tend to be in the centers of\ngalaxies, creating what are called Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). An AGN\nemits more energy than would be expected from a typical galactic\nnucleus. The answer as to why this is so lies in the presence of the\nsupermassive black hole in the galactic center. In some AGN, the massive\nblack hole and its accretion disk somehow produce outward-moving streams\nof particles that are projected away perpendicular to the disk. These\nstreams are known as jets and have the power to accelerate electrons\nalmost to the speed of light. This produces gamma-rays that can be\ndetected by gamma-ray observatories. The most powerful AGNs in our\nUniverse are called quasars. We have been able to detect quasars that\nreside 15 billion light-years away. Scientists believe that the study of\nquasars will provide information about the Universe during the time of\nearly galaxy formation"}

{"text":"The name black\nhole gives the impression that there's a hole in space. This isn't true by any\nmeans. The definition of hole is an empty void. Black holes are exactly the\nopposite of a hole. Black holes are objects made of large amounts of matter\npacked into a very dense, compact state. A black hole has so much gravity that\nlight can't even escape its pull. This is why a black hole is black.\n\nHow can you pack such a large amount of matter into such a tiny\nspace, you ask? The answer's simple. This occurs out of violence on a stellar\nscale. A star is formed, and pops out of a cloud of gas and dust. The gases\nheat up because gravity causes contraction of the cloud. The star is\nborn in a great burst of light. The star shines brightly and warmly for\nbillions of years. Then, one day it uses up all its fuel, entering its death\nthroes. This is otherwise known as stellar collapse. A bunch of\ndifferent types of superdense objects can\nform. Then, some of these objects can lead to black holes.\n\nStars\n\nThere are\nthree types of black holes: supermassive, stellar, and\nmini.\n\nA supermassive\nblack hole sits in the center of galactic nuclei and quasars.\nThese black holes gather in millions of stars, dust, and gases.

{"text":"A member of Parliament to Disraeli: \"Sir, you will either die on the gallows or of some unspeakable disease.\"\n\"I have never killed a man, but I have read many obituaries with great pleasure.\" Clarence Darrow\"I am enclosing two tickets to the first night of my new play; bring a friend.... if you have one.\" - George Bernard Shaw to Winston Churchill\n\"Cannot possibly attend first night, will attend second... if there is one.\" - Winston Churchill, in response.\n\n\"I feel so miserable without you; it's almost like having you here.\" - Stephen Bishop\n\n1. How faint are the farthest objects?\nThe Hubble observations detected objects as faint as 30th magnitude. The faintest objects the human eye can see are at sixth magnitude. Ground-based telescopes also can detect 30th-magnitude objects. Those objects, however, are so dim they are lost in the glare of brighter, nearby galaxies.\nSearching for the faintest objects in the Ultra Deep Field is like trying to find a firefly on the Moon. Light from the farthest objects reached the Hubble telescope in trickles rather than gushers. The orbiting observatory collected one photon of light per minute from the dimmest objects. Normally, the telescope collects millions of photons per minute from nearby galaxies.\n\n2. How many orbits did it take to make the observations?\nIt took 400 orbits to make the observations.\n\n3. How many exposures were needed to make the observations?\nThe Hubble telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys' wide-field camera snapped 800 exposures, which equals two exposures per orbit. The exposures were taken over four months, from Sept. 24, 2003 to Jan. 16, 2004.\n\n4. How much viewing time was needed to make all the exposures?\nThe 800 exposures amounted to about 1 million seconds or 11.3 days of viewing time. The average exposure time was 21 minutes.\n\n5. How many galaxies are in the image?\nThe image yields a rich harvest of about 10,000 galaxies.\n\n6. How many colors (filters) were used to make the observations?\nThe colors used were blue, green, red, and near-infrared. The observations were taken in visible to near-infrared light.\n\n7. If astronomers made the Hubble Ultra Deep Field observation over the entire sky, how long would it take?\nThe whole sky contains 12.7 million times more area than the Ultra Deep Field. To observe the entire sky would take almost 1 million years of uninterrupted observing.\n\n8. How wide is the Ultra Deep Field's slice of the heavens?\nThe Hubble Ultra Deep Field is called a \"pencil beam\" survey because the observations encompass a narrow, yet \"deep\" piece of sky. Astronomers compare the Ultra Deep Field view to looking through an eight-foot-long soda straw.\nThe Ultra Deep Field's patch of sky is so tiny it would fit inside the largest impact basin that makes up the face on the Moon. Astronomers would need about 50 Ultra Deep Fields to cover the entire Moon.\n\n9. How sharp is Hubble's resolution in pinpointing far-flung galaxies in the Ultra Deep Field?\nHubble's keen vision (0.085 arc seconds.) is equivalent to standing at the U.S. Capitol and seeing the date on a quarter a mile away at the Washington monument.\n\nIn PGA Tour circles, it's called the Prize. The Prize, the Tour's version of the Scarlet Letter, is what a player gets for being timed for slow play on 10 occasions in a season. A player \u2014 along with everyone he's playing with \u2014 gets timed when his group falls behind either the pace of play (a.k.a. Time Par) or the group ahead of them. Getting timed is called being on the clock, and a player who takes too long to play a shot while he is on the clock is in danger of being fined and possibly penalized, although the latter is rare.\nThe Prize is actually a $20,000 fine and was first levied against Brent Geiberger in 2004. Tour rules officials decline to provide other details, but the Prize is believed to have been handed out to more than 10 but fewer than 20 other players since '04. The guilty include more than one major champion, and last year a player allegedly earned the Prize by the Memorial Tournament, in early June. After a player is given the Prize, each additional timing in a calendar year draws an additional $5,000 fine.\nThe Prize is based on the assumption that the threat of a fine increases peer pressure on slow players because pros paired with a known snail run the risk of becoming a Prize winner by association. Players who have had multiple timings tend to become *speedier \u2014 and testier \u2014 when they're paired with a known slow-baller. \"I don't care who you are, nobody wants to write a check for 20 grand,\" says Mark Russell, the Tour's vice president of rules and competitions.\nSlow play is a longtime problem as well as an inevitable source of frustration on the PGA Tour. \"Nobody ever does anything about it,\" gripes rapid-playing Rory Sabbatini, who brought up the topic, again, at a recent players meeting. Says Brian Claar, a rules official and former Tour player, \"The fast guys all say we don't do anything, and the slow guys all say we pick on them.\"\nThe reality is that slow play is almost unavoidable on Tour. Half of a tournament field of 144 players (some have fields up to 156) tees off on the 1st and 10th tees in the morning; the other half does likewise in the afternoon. \"With 156 players on a course \u2014 that's 26 threesomes on 18 holes in each wave \u2014 you don't need a degree from MIT to know those numbers don't work,\" says Russell. \"We try to keep a flow going. If a player never had to wait to play a shot, he'd never say a word about pace of play. It's the stand-around-and-wait part that's the problem.\"\nPace-of-play rally-killers include requests for rulings, lost balls, taking drops and bad play, among other variables. Rules officials felt a little like Maytag repairmen last week during the Players Championship. Until Sunday there was only light wind, and scores were low. When Spencer Levin tapped in a 17-inch putt to conclude first-round play at 7:30 p.m., it meant that the entire field was off the course in under five hours. O.K., it was close \u2014 four hours, 59 minutes \u2014 and on Friday the pace was 10 minutes slower, but breaking the five-hour barrier is an uncommon feat at the demanding TPC Sawgrass Stadium course.\nOn Saturday, with only 70 players making the cut and the field playing in twosomes, play went ridiculously smoothly and the final twosome finished in 4:10. Only five groups were timed for being out of position through three rounds, compared with an estimated 30 timings at last year's Players. Being a golf cop is a thankless job, but last week wasn't so bad. \"We're like airline pilots \u2014 hours of boredom followed by moments of terror,\" Russell says.\nHere's your PGA Tour Slow Far, Slow Good Handbook: Everything You Need to Know About Slow Play but Took Too Long to Ask. (And let's pick it up, people, you're taking forever to read this.) Clockblocked Forget Greenwich Mean Time. On the PGA Tour, Time Par (no relation to Old Man Par) is what matters. Time Par is the time it should take to play each hole, as determined by the rules crew after careful study. At the Players, for instance, Time Par was two hours, 14 minutes for the front nine and 2:15 for the back, plus five minutes to make the turn. Time Par for the entire round by a threesome was 4:34, 3:58 for a twosome. The 40 Time How cool would it be if golf, like basketball, had a shot clock? It would be handy too, because once a group has been alerted that it's on the clock, a player has 40 seconds to hit his shot once it's his turn. The first to play the tee shot on a par-3, a second shot on a par-4 or par-5, a third shot on a par-5 or a stroke near or on the green, gets an additional 20 seconds. If a player exceeds his allotted time, he receives a bad timing. Penalty Box A player's first bad timing is a freebie. He gets a mulligan. The second offense in the same round results in a one-shot penalty. The third offense is two penalty strokes, and the fourth is disqualification. But multiple offenses simply don't happen. \"The system is beatable, and everybody knows how to beat it,\" says Tour veteran Fred Funk. \"If a guy gets fined or penalized, he has a serious problem.\"\nTiming a group is usually effective for as long as it lasts. \"If I told you there's a traffic cop running a speed trap and you went through it and got a ticket, to go through it again and get another ticket would be pretty dumb,\" says rules official Jon Brendle. \"Once I tell you you're on the clock, you're not going to go over the time.\" Once the group is off the clock, the offending player is free to resume his tortoiselike ways.\nThere is a lifetime-achievement-type aspect to bad timings, however. The second time a player gets a bad timing in the same calendar year results in a $5,000 fine. Each subsequent bad timing earns a $10,000 hit. Major championships, World Golf Championships and Nationwide tour events are included. The last Tour player who unintentionally drew a one-shot penalty for slow play (a few players have purposely done so in protest over rulings) was Dillard Pruitt at the 1992 Byron Nelson Classic. Pruitt is now a Tour rules official. Speedier Play Secret No. 1 Walk faster. Is that too obvious? Apparently not. Carl Pettersson was first off in the final round of the recent Quail Hollow Championship as a single. He played in 2:15 because he walked briskly. \"Jack Nicklaus got a hard time because he could be slow over the ball,\" Brendle says, \"but he always walked fast so he could afford to be slow over the ball. It's a pretty simple fix for slow play \u2014 walk faster, get there sooner.\" Speedier Play Secret No. 2 The lost art of the tap-in annoys Claar. \"You don't see anybody knock it up there and tap it in,\" he says. \"These guys all have to line up their putt with the line they drew on the ball. If everybody marks and waits, it's another minute and a half per hole. It adds up.\" Speedier Play Secret No. 3 When it's your turn to play, go ahead and play. \"I tell guys, 'You don't hit balls on the range like this, and you hit 'em pretty good,'?\" says Russell. \"You don't wait two minutes to hit every seven-iron shot.\" The Race for the Cure Richard Johnson is no longer among the Tour's slowpokes. \"We had a tight TV window at Reno and had to start at daybreak,\" Russell says. \"The lead guy was Richard Johnson, the slowest player you could imagine. I went on the 1st tee and said, 'Richard, you're leading off,' and he said, 'Mark, you don't have to say another word. I have an 11 o'clock flight and have to be on it.' He shot 64 that day and finished in the top 10. I saw him a few weeks later and asked what he learned. 'Unbelievable,' is all he said, and we've never had another problem with him.\" Slowtime One nominee for the latest Slowest Player on Tour, a label held by Ben Crane ever since Sabbatini finished a hole at Congressional in 2005 while Crane fiddled with his shot from the fairway, is Kevin Na, a fidgety player who can't seem to pull the trigger. He was paired with \u00c1ngel *Cabrera, one of the game's fastest golfers, at last year's Players. \"I watched Kevin play a shot from under the trees, just a layup shot, and it took him five full minutes,\" Brendle says. \"\u00c1ngel was 200 yards ahead, waiting, so I drove up there. He looked at me and said, 'Gringo. Me play with Kevin Na. Painful.' I broke up, I couldn't help it.\" The Slo-Mo Magnificent Seven Rules officials refused to name names on who's holding up play, so I took an unofficial survey of players, caddies and media. The winners are Na, definitely; Fredrik Jacobson (\"Killer slow,\" one poll subject says); Masters champs Trevor Immelman and Zach Johnson (\"Major slow\"); J.B. *Holmes (\"He likes to visualize the shot first \u2014 apparently in super slo-mo\"); Michael Letzig (\"He's lucky he plays in the back of the pack or he'd be getting timed every round\"); and Sean O'Hair. Honorable mention: Crane (\"Most improved\"), Padraig Harrington, Stewart Cink, D.A. Points, Sergio Garc\u00eda, Omar Uresti (\"The O-Man is Slow-Man\"), Jeff Overton and Bob Estes. Alltime Slow-baller Nick Faldo (\"Bernhard Langer got a bad rap. Nick was way worse\"). Notable Nonexempt Snails Colt Knost and Casey Wittenberg, now back on the Nationwide after a year as the PGA Tour's slowest new faces. Knost had decision-making issues, especially reading putts, while Witten*berg has a laborious preshot routine, including one ninjalike pose with his club straight up in the air as he painstakingly takes his grip. Hall of Blame The sports psychologists who tell golfers to visualize the shot and never hit until they're ready. \"They started all this,\" Claar says. Best Place to Hide If You're Slow Late-in-the-day tee times, where play usually bogs down anyway. Worst Place to Hide If You're Slow One of the first three groups off the tee. Time Par was effectively invented for them because they're pacesetters for the field and, as such, are closely monitored (and prodded when necessary) by their friendly neighborhood golf cops."}

{"text":"Messier 77 (M77, NGC 1068) is a conspicuous spiral galaxy situated in\nconstellation Cetus. With its bright Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), it is\nthe prototype of an active galaxy, and a famous group of these objects\ncalled \"Seyfert Galaxies,\" after their discoverer.\n\nWhen\nPierre M\u00e9chain discovered this object on October 29, 1780, he described\nit as a nebula.\nCharles Messier included it\nas\nNo. 77 in his catalog on December 17, 1780, and misclassified it a\ncluster with nebulosity, perhaps because of foreground stars, or possibly\nmistaking some of its knots for faint stars. M77 is one of the first\nrecognized spiral galaxies, and listed by\nLord Rosse\nas one of 14 \"spiral nebulae\" discovered to 1850.\n\nThis magnificient galaxy is one of the biggest galaxies in Messier's\ncatalog, its bright part measuring about 120,000 light years, but its faint\nextensions (which are well visible e.g. in the\nDSSM image) going\nperhaps out to nearly 170,000 light years. Its appearance is that of a\nmagnificient spiral with broad structured arms, which in the inner region\nshow a quite young stellar population, but more away from the center, are\ndominated by a smooth yellowish older stellar population.\n\nM77 is about 60 million light years distant, approximately the same\ndistance but another direction as the\nVirgo Cluster,\nand is receding from us at about 1100 km\/sec, as was first measured by\nVesto M. Slipher of Lowell Observatory in 1914; it was the second galaxy\nwith a large measured redshift after the\nSombrero galaxy, M104\n(R. Brent Tully's Nearby Galaxies Catalog gives a somewhat\nsmaller value for the distance, 47 million light years, and values in other\nsources are spread both below and above the Virgo Cluster value; the higher\nvalues would make M77 the most remote Messier object).\n\nFrom investigations of the inner disk's rotational velocities,\nE.M.\nBurbidge, G.R. Burbidge and K.H. Prendergast (1959) found that M77's\ninner disk in inclined against the line of sight by 51 degrees. They\nestimated the inner disk's mass at 27 billion solar masses, while the total\nmass of this galaxy must be of the order of 1 trillion solar masses.\n\nThis galaxy is unique and peculiar because of several reasons. First of\nall, its spectrum shows peculiar features in the form of broad emission\nlines, indicating that giant gas clouds are rapidly moving out of this\ngalaxy's core, at several 100 km\/sec. This feature was first discovered by\nEdward A. Fath of Lick Observatory in 1908 (Fath\n1909) who identified six \"Planetary Nebula type\" emission lines (H Beta,\n[O II] 3727, [N III] 3869, [O III] 4363, 4959, 5007), confirmed by Vesto M.\nSlipher at Lowell Observatory in a much better spectrum in 1917 (Slipher\n1917) and particularly mentioned by Edwin P.\nHubble in his historic paper on \"extragalactic nebulae\" of 1926 (Hubble,\n1926). It classifies M77 as a Seyfert galaxy of type II (type I Seyfert\ngalaxies exhibit an even larger expansion velocity of several 1000 km\/sec);\nit is the nearest and brightest representative of this class of active\ngalaxies. This remarkable class of galaxies is named after its discoverer,\nCarl K.\nSeyfert, who described them first in 1943 (Seyfert\n1943).\n\nAn enormous energy source is required to generate this velocity, which\nmust sit in the galaxy's core or nucleus. This core was found to be a strong\nradio source, which was discovered by Berbard Yarnton Mills in 1952 and\ndesignated Cetus A, and listed as 3C 71 in the Third Cambridge\nCatalogue of Radio Sources. It was investigated optically with the\nHubble Space\nTelescope. Infrared investigations with the 10-meter Keck telescope by\nCaltech astronomers have revealed a strong pointlike source, less than 12\nlight-years in diameter, and surrounded by an elongated structure of 100\nlight years extension (a concentration of stars or interstellar matter);\nthese structures were not apparent in the Hubble images in the visible\nlight. M77, as well as other Seyfert galaxies, has been known to be bright\ninfrared radiators since some time.\n\nIt were Donald E. Osterbrook and R.A.R. Parker in 1965 who\nbrought up the hypothesis that the active nuclei of Seyfert galaxies might\nbe thought of as miniature quasars (quasi-stellar radio sources), according\nto Burnham. This view has been confirmed now by decade-long research:\nProbably all types of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), including Seyfert\nnuclei, radio galaxies, quasars, BL Lacertae objects, and others, are caused\nby the same physical reason, a central supermassive object which accumulates\ngaseous matter from its surrounding neighborhood. The variety of observed\nphenomena is simply a consequence of different viewing angles and different\nrates of matter supply falling into the objects.\n\nIn case of M77, the central object which is responsible for the Seyfert\nactivity has been found to have a mass of about 10 million solar masses, via\nIR observations from Caltech. Radio astronomers of the National Radio\nAstronomy Observatory (NRAO) and the 100-meter-diameter radio telescope of\nthe Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy at Effelsberg, Germany found a\ngiant disk of some 5 light-years diameter orbiting this object, which\ncontains water molecules (NRAO\nPR of January 15, 2000).\n\nIn the inner disk of M77 surrounding the active nucleus, near the active\ncenter, M.F. Walker has found emission nabulae with considerable expansion\nvelocities. Intense star forming activity in an inner bar was found to take\nplace by the\nUltraviolet Imaging Telescope on its Astro-1 Space Shuttle mission.\nThese star formation regions are among the brightest known, and perhaps the\nmost luminous within a distance of 100 million light years from us.\n\nM77 is the dominating member of a small physical group of galaxies, which\nincludes NGC\n1055 (type Sb) and NGC 1073 (type SABc), as well as UGC 2161 (DDO 27,\ntype Im), UGC 2275 (DDO 28, type Sm - designating a morphological type\nbetween spirals and irregulars) and UGC 2302 (DDO 29, type Sm), and the\nirregular galaxy UGCA 44 and the SBc barred spiral Markarian 600. NGC 1087\n(Sc), NGC 1090 (S-), and NGC 1094 (SABb-) are nearby background galaxies, as\ntheir much higher redshift indicates (Info from Burnham, Tully, and the Sky\nCatalogue 2000.0).\n\nM77 can be easily found 0.7 degrees ESE from the 4-th mag star Delta\nCeti. Its central 2 arc minutes dominate the view of this almost face-on\nspiral galaxy in amateur telescopes, and shows remarkable detail with higher\nmagnification in larger instruments. NGC 1055 is situated about 0.5 deg NNW\nof M77, and visible as a 3' long edge-on spindle, aligned about east to\nwest, of about mag 10.6. 11th-mag NGC 1073 is about 1 deg NNE of M77, a\nface-on disk of 5' diameter, with a prominent 2x1' bar elongated at about\nposition angle 60 deg."}
{"text":"rendering of a colliding wind binary. Credit: Credit: NASA\/C. Reed\n\nThe hottest and most massive stars don't live long enough to disperse throughout the galaxy. Instead, they can be found near the clouds of gas and dust where they formed -- and where they will explode as supernovae after a few million years. They huddle in tight clusters with other young stars or in looser groupings called OB associations, a name reflecting their impressive populations of rare O- and B-type stars.\n\nOne of the nearest and richest OB associations in our galaxy is Cygnus OB2, which is located about 4,700 light-years away and hosts some 3,000 hot stars, including about 100 in the O class. Weighing in at more than a dozen times the sun's mass and sporting surface temperatures five to 10 times hotter, these ginormous blue-white stars blast their surroundings with intense ultraviolet light and powerful outflows called stellar winds.\n\nTwo of these stars can be found in the intriguing binary system known as Cygnus OB2 #9. In 2011, NASA's Swift satellite, the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton observatory and several ground-based facilities took part in a campaign to monitor the system as the giant stars raced toward their closest approach.\n\nNow, a paperpublished in the October issue of the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics provides the campaign's first results and gives a more detailed picture of the stars, their orbits and the interaction of their stellar winds.\n\nAn O-type star is so luminous that the pressure of its starlight actually drives material from its surface, creating particle outflows with speeds of several million miles an hour. Put two of these humongous stars in the same system and their winds can collide during all or part of the orbit, creating both radio emission and X-rays.\n\nIn 2008, research showed that Cygnus OB2 #9 emitted radio signals that varied every 2.355 years. In parallel, Yael Naz\u00e9, an astronomer at the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium, detected for the first time a signature in the system's optical spectrum that indicated the presence of two stars. The binary nature of Cygnus OB2 #9 provided a natural explanation for the periodic radio changes.\n\nTo maximize their chances of catching X-rays from colliding winds, the researchers needed to monitor the system as the stars raced toward their closest approach, or periastron.\n\n\"Our first opportunity came in 2009, but we couldn't perform all of the necessary observations because the sun was in the same part of the sky,\" Naz\u00e9 explained. \"That meant waiting for the next close approach, on June 28, 2011.\"\n\nNASA's Swift made five sets of X-ray observations during the 10 months around the date of periastron, and XMM-Newton carried out one high-resolution observation near the predicted time of closest approach. In addition, the Expanded Very Large Array in New Mexico monitored radio emissions, and observations to better refine the orbit were made by the CHARA optical and infrared telescope array on Mount Wilson in California, the Wyoming Infrared Observatory, and the Haute-Provence Observatory in France.\n\nThe new data indicate that Cygnus OB2 #9 is a massive binary with components of similar mass and luminosity following long, highly eccentric orbits. The most massive star in the system has about 50 times the sun's mass, and its companion is slightly smaller, with about 45 solar masses. At periastron, these stellar titans are separated by less than three times Earth's average distance from the sun.\n\nTwo sets of measurements taken 5.5 days apart near the time of periastron -- one in late June by XMM-Newton and one in early July by Swift -- show that the X-ray flux increased by four times when the stars were closest together. This is compelling evidence for the interaction of fierce stellar winds.\n\nMost massive star binaries lack this feature, and the few that exhibit it tend to show more complex behavior. For example, the wind-wind collision zone may crash onto one of the stars. But in Cygnus OB2 #9, this region remains the same throughout the stars' orbits, a fact that will help astronomers unravel the various physical processes at work.\n\nMassive stars dramatically shape their environment when they explode as supernovae, but their powerful winds dominate the space around them for millions of years, altering star-formation regions throughout their energy-producing lives.\n\n\"There is much we don't know on how stars form and how galaxies evolve, and Cygnus OB2 #9 gives important new data on the role played by stellar winds from massive stars,\" said Neil Gehrels, the principal investigator for Swift"}

{"text":"Friday, November 05, 2010 Cosmic Radio Beacons Because all cosmic objects evolve with time, astronomers sometimes have a difficult time deciding if two sources that seem different are actually related but just in different stages of life. A case in point: galaxies that emit strong radio emission. Since they were first studied over fifty years ago, it has been known that, broadly speaking, they tend to fall into two groups distinguished by their radio luminosities, either modest or very bright. The problems are in deciding whether they are intrinsically similar, but observed with differences due to their ages or perhaps to our viewing angle (since they are disk-shaped, obscuring material in the plane can block emission), and how they might be related to other, more famous, optically luminous galaxies like quasars.\n\nCfA astronomer Aneta Siemiginowska teamed with three colleagues to analyze a new sample of forty-four radio galaxies, selected from recent radio surveys, whose luminosity and other characteristics make them appear part of a uniform class of low luminosity radio sources. The sizes of the radio sources are all smaller than that of the host galaxy. By correlating the physical sizes with their luminosities, and by building on previous studies of classical radio galaxies, the astronomers find that as a group the new sources are faint for their sizes, and they argue this indicate that the emission is short-lived, and is the result of a interim period of activity.\n\nThe scientists argue that active events like these are characteristic of an early stage in the evolution of radio galaxies as they fragment -- but the reasons for fragmentation are still not clear. The fragments in turn, they suggest, evolve into the classical bright group of radio sources. The reasons this happens is still unclear, but the new work provides a large, homogeneous new sample of objects to probe the early stages in the development of these cosmic radio beacons. The relatively large sample size makes it possible to reach credible general conclusions even though the character of any one of the new radio sources might be ambiguous."}
{"text":"Two new Durham-led programmes on Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nDurham researchers lead two successful proposals for NASA's Hubble Space\nTelescope in the recently announced proposal round. Together these projects\nwill provide 42 orbits of spacecraft time to pursue two science programmes\non this world-leading facility, representing an investment of around $US 4-M\nin Durham research.\n\nThe first programme, led\nby Durham graduate student Nicolas Tejos, will use the far\nUltra-Violet (UV) spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope to detect\nthe inter-galactic medium (IGM) associated with large-scale structure\nof the Universe. Astronomers believe that galaxies roughly trace the\nfilamentary structure of matter in the Universe predicted by\ncosmological simulations, but very little is known about the actual\nmaterial within this 'cosmic web'. Given the extremely low densities\nof the IGM, the only way to observe it is by looking at the absorption\nfrom this material in the spectra of bright, background sources such\nas distant Quasars. We have carefully chosen a single Quasar whose\nline-of-sight intersects six cosmological filaments. Such filaments\ncan only be accurately traced in the local Universe, but the resulting\nabsorption features then fall in the UV, where the Earth's atmosphere\nis opaque, requiring the use of a space-based observatory to detect\nthem. We will use 12 orbits with Hubble to observe the absorption\nsignatures of the IGM associated to these filaments. We also expect to\nobserve portions of the warm-hot IGM, which has been very hard to\ndetect, but is expected to account for a significant fraction of all\nthe normal matter in the local Universe.\n\nThe second programme, a survey led by STFC Fellow Mark Swinbank at Durham,\nwill study the nature and morphologies of distant sub-millimetre galaxies\nwith the Wide Field Camera 3 instrument on Hubble. Discovered by\nastronomers in Durham over a decade ago, sub-millimetre galaxies represent\nan important population in the young Universe.

{"text":"John Wheeler once summarized General Relativity as \"Matter tells space how to curve, and space tells matter how to move.\" While that is a handy description, and while there have been many textbooks written, lectures given and websitesconstructed to explain this, the quote itself doesn't address what happens to the light streaming through the universe as it encounters the warped space curved by matter.\n\nThe simple answer is: it curves too, and Einstein's equations provide predictions for exactly how it works. In fact, observations of the bending of starlight around the Sun were one of the first implemented tests of General Relativity, and it passed with flying colors. On the scale of the Universe, the Sun isn't that massive, but it's massive enough to bend the light just a little, and by exactly the amount the equations predicted.\n\nThose equations say that more matter in the same place is more likely to produce a strong lens effect, distorting and magnifying a background source. So what happens when you have a *lot* of matter, say, in a big galaxy or a cluster of galaxies?\n\nFrom left to right: a) an Einstein cross (credit: NASA\/ESA); b) an example from the Space Warps dataset; c) a known lens in CANDELS that Galaxy Zoo users spotted.\n\nSome pretty impressive configurations, which are rare but which humans are best at finding \u2014 hence Space Warps, the Zooniverse's newest project and our astronomical project sibling. Co-lens-experts Phil Marshall and Aprajita Verma joined us during this hangout to describe how they use gravitational lenses to weigh galaxies. In particular, they can tell the difference between Dark Matter and \"matter that's dark\" \u2014 the former being the exotic particles that are very different from stars and gas and planets and people, and the latter being normal matter that isn't bright, such as brown dwarf \"stars\" that never actually ignited.\n\nNote: Google+ was feeling a bit out of sorts, so the first minute or so of the broadcast was cut off, during which time Bill Keel showed us the first known image of a gravitational lens, from 1903. We went on to talk about all of the above, and more besides, including the importance of simulated lenses, why the images Space Warps uses are specially tuned to help us find lenses, and how the science team (which includes citizen scientists from Galaxy Zoo!) plan to turn our clicks into discoveries.\n\nNotice my swapping of pronouns to \"we\" \u2014 I'm not on the Space Warps science team, but I've done nearly 100 classifications now myself! I can't wait to see the results start to come in from this project\n\nIt seems that finding our Milky Way's twin has become a bit of an industry these days.\n\nNASA\/ESA have got in on the act today, releasing a press release about their favourite twin of the Milky Way, NGC 1073 and the below absolutely gorgeous Hubble Space Telescope image they've taken of it: Classic Portrait of a Barred Spiral.\n\nYou might remember, back in September I posted a guest blog by a Lexington Law A-level student, Tim Buckman, who spent his summer with us at Portsmouth finding the Galaxy Zoo galaxy we thought was most like the Milky Way: \"A Summer Spent Finding our Galactic Twin\". His project in turn was inspired in part by an ESO press release about spiral galaxy NGC 6744 which was claimed to be a twin for the Milky Way (A Postcard from Extragalactic Space).\n\nNGC 6744 \u2013 the previously proposed clone. Credit: ESO.\n\nNGC 6744 is quite a lot more massive than our Milky Way however, so I thought we could do better with SDSS and Galaxy Zoo. Tim applied some mass cuts, then used your classifications to find a face-on 4 armed spiral which he thought matched the maps of the Milky Way (which has a bar, but perhaps a rather weak one which might not be obvious in the types of images we used for Galaxy Zoo).\n\nFor Galaxy Zoo people, it should be of interest that the press release also says:\n\nSome astronomers have suggested that the formation of a central bar-like structure might signal a spiral galaxy's passage from intense star-formation into adulthood, as the bars turn up more often in galaxies full of older, red stars than younger, blue stars.\n\nWell those astronomers are us \u2013 Galaxy Zoo results on bars, based on your classifications have shown that bars are more common in redder discs. Thanks again for the classifications which allowed us to do that work.\n\nWe're happy to report that we have once again used your (now public) GZ1 classifications to find an interesting result.\n\nWe use the classifications in a study we just submitted to MNRAS (or see the arXiv entry for a copy) looking at the observed fractions of early-type galaxies (and spiral galaxies), in groups and clusters of galaxies.\n\nRecent work (De Lucia et al. (2011), which posted to the arxiv in September), used sophisticated semi\nanalytic models to determine the properties of galaxies found in massive\nclusters in the Millennium Simulation. They identified elliptical galaxies\n(or more accurately early-type galaxies) in the simulation, and found that the fraction these\ngalaxies, remained constant with cluster halo mass, over the range 10^14 to\n10^14.8 solar masses. They compared their results with previous\nobservational studies which each contained less than 100 clusters.\n\nWith GZ1 we realised we could put together a much larger sample. We\nused galaxies with GZ1 classifications, cross matched with cluster and\ngroup catalogues, to compare the above results with almost 10 thousand\nclusters. We found that the fraction of early-type galaxies is indeed\nconstant with cluster mass (see the included figure), and over a much larger range of 10^13 to 10^15\nsolar masses (with covers small groups of galaxies to rich clusters), than previously studied. We also found the well known result (to astronomers) that outside of groups and clusters, the fraction of early-type galaxies is\nlower than inside of groups and clusters.\n\nPlot showing the fraction of early-type galaxies (red lines) as a function of halo mass. We used two different halo mass catalogues, and the agreement between them is excellent. We also examine the fraction of spiral galaxies with halo mass (blue lines)\n\nThis work suggests that galaxies change from spiral to early-type when individual\ngalaxies join together to form small groups of galaxies, but that going from groups to rich clusters does not significantly change the morphologies of galaxies.\n\nWithout the GZ1 results at our finger-tips, this work, which was devised,\nimplemented, and written up in less than 2 months, would have taken much\nlonger to complete.\n\nI think I won't get in too much trouble if I say that in my opinion the event of summer 2011 for extragalactic astronomers was a massive international conference which took place in Durham, July 18th-22nd Galaxy Formation. You'll be happy to know that Galaxy Zoo scientists were represented, with myself, Kevin, Ramin Skibba (who wrote one of the first Galaxy Zoo papers back in 2009), Vardha Bennert (who has done some HST followup for us, she's profiled in the \"She's an Astronomer\" series from 2009) and Boris Haussleur (see his blog posts about Hubble Zoo) all present.\n\n400 Extragalactic Astronomers in Durham. That's me circled in orange, Ramin in pink and Boris in blue. Kevin and Vardha might be there somewhere but I've yet to spot them!\n\nThe moment of the conference for me was the first mention of Galaxy Zoo in the plenary talks \u2013 my work on the Galaxy Zoo 2 bars (see many blog posts!) was mentioned in a talk on the influence of internal evolution on galaxies (something we call \"secular evolution\" which bascially means the slow transformation of galaxies by material being moved around by the bars and\/or spirals) which was given by Francoise Combes. I got so excited I took a picture of her slide, which you can also see in her talk pdf.\n\nFrancoise Combes talking about Galaxy Zoo results on bars\n\nAnd here's the slide so you can actually read it.\n\nFrancoise Combes's slide so you can actually read it\n\nThe red spirals also got a mention in a talk on gas in galaxies (by Luca Cortese \u2013 pdf unfortunately not uploaded at time of writing) where it was shown that at least half of them have very low NUV (near ultra-violet) emission for spiral galaxies. This is expected if as we think they are truly passive spirals with very little current star formation (which created NUV light).\n\nMany of the slides for the talks, as well as the posters are available online (including mine, which for once wasn't about my Galaxy Zoo work, but work with the new SDSS survey which is imaging 1.5 million galaxies at intermediate redshifts \u2013 unfortunately as fuzzy blobs, so no new objects for the Zoo from them!). There is also a plan to make video of the talks available. I'll post an update about that when it happens.\n\nUnfortunately I had to leave before Kevin and Vardha gave their talks on the Friday. Neither of them have posted their pdfs yet either."}

The study shows that our galaxy's journey\nthrough space is not entirely due to the pull of nearby galaxies, but is\nalso affected by much farther regions of the Universe than previously thought.\n\nIfA graduate student Dale D. Kocevski spearheaded the study. He worked\nwith IfA astronomers Harald Ebeling and Brent Tully, and with Chris Mullis,\nan IfA alumnus who is now a research fellow at the University of Michigan.\n\nAstronomers have long known that the Milky Way is moving toward the constellation\nCentaurus at a speed of 1.4 million mph, but the reason for the movement\nremained a topic of debate. Over 20 years ago, it was suggested that the\nmotion was due to the gravitational pull of a nearby large concentration\nof matter dubbed the Great Attractor. The Great Attractor is what is known\nas a supercluster, that is, a group of clusters of galaxies, and was estimated\nto contain matter equal to more than over 10 million billion times the\nmass of the Sun.\n\nUntil now, efforts to find the Great Attractor were hampered by its location\nin the \"zone of avoidance,\" an area behind the plane of the Milky\nWay where gas and dust within our galaxy block much of the visible light\nfrom objects outside it. The new survey, Clusters in the Zone of Avoidance\n(CIZA), is the first to search for the X-ray signatures of galaxy clusters\nbehind the Milky Way and investigate the nature of the Great Attractor.\nDue to the difficulty of observing through the Milky Way, this region was\nthe final portion of the sky in which the cluster population had yet to\nbe mapped.\n\n\"X-rays can penetrate even regions that are extremely obscured by\ngas and dust, and galaxy clusters are sources of X-rays. This is what prompted\nus to attempt to map the distribution of galaxy clusters behind the plane\nof the Milky Way using X-ray observations,\" explains Ebeling, who\ninitiated the survey in 1998.\n\nKocevski and collaborators found far fewer massive cluster systems near\nthe Great Attractor than would be expected given the region's proposed\nmass. \"One of our goals was to uncover the true mass of the Great\nAttractor. What we found is that it is not that great after all,\" says\nKocevski.\n\nInstead, a significant concentration of galaxies behind the Great Attractor\nis tugging on our galaxy. This distant area, which is four times more distant\nthan the Great Attractor region, is dominated by the Shapley Supercluster,\nthe most massive association of galaxies in the observable Universe. Kocevski\nhas determined that only 44 percent of our galaxy's motion through space\nis due to the pull of galaxies in the Great Attractor region. The rest\nis the result of a large-scale flow in which much of the local Universe,\nincluding perhaps the Great Attractor itself, is being pulled toward the\nShapley Supercluster."}

The observations also rule out previously popular models of what the second 'companion' star might look like.\n\nThe supernova (SN 2011fe), which was first spotted on 24 August 2011 by scientists from Oxford University and the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) collaboration, appeared in the Pinwheel Galaxy, M101, 21 million light years distant. The discovery was particularly important because it was a type 1a supernova \u2013 the kind used by scientists to measure the accelerating expansion of the Universe and dark energy.\n\nBy studying how the supernova's brightness evolved, and the light spectra it emitted, the team were able to calculate the size of the exploding star, what it was made of, and what kind of stellar system it originated from.\n\n'This is the first direct confirmation that this very important type of supernova is triggered by a white dwarf star made of carbon and oxygen,' said Dr Mark Sullivan of Oxford University's Department of Physics, who led the Oxford team and is an author of both Nature papers.\n\nProfessor Peter Nugent, of the US Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said: 'We caught the supernova just 11 hours after it exploded, so soon that we were later able to calculate the actual moment of the explosion to within 20 minutes. Our early observations confirmed some assumptions about the physics of Type Ia supernovae, and we ruled out a number of possible models. But with this close-up look, we also found things nobody had dreamed of.'\n\nthese supernovae are a major source of iron in the Universe, so we are all made of bits of exploding stars\n\nDr Mark Sullivan\n\nThe star that caused the supernova started out life as a star not\nunlike our Sun. Over a lifetime of tens to hundreds of millions of years\nits hydrogen fuel began to run out and it bloated to become a giant red\nstar. While the core of the star remained hot enough to burn helium\ninto carbon and then oxygen, the upper layers were eventually stripped\naway so that only the core remained \u2013 forming a roughly Earth-sized\ncarbon-oxygen white dwarf.\n\n'The key to the supernova explosion is\nthat the white dwarf star did not live alone in space, but with a second\nstar in a binary system,' said Dr Sullivan. 'As the white dwarf orbited\nit Hoovered up additional material from its companion and began to\ngrow, but there is a limit to how massive a white dwarf can get \u2013 about\n1.4 times the mass of our Sun \u2013 before it can no longer support itself.\nAs it nears this limit it becomes hot enough to trigger a thermonuclear\nexplosion.\n\n'This creates a gigantic expanding fireball in space\nwith a brightness powered by radioactive decay \u2013 the supernova that was\nvisible from Earth. Spotting this supernova so early, and being able to\nexamine it with modern instruments, ensures that it will become the\nbest-studied supernova in history: we suspected carbon-oxygen white\ndwarf stars were responsible for type 1a supernova but for the first\ntime we've got a close-up of one in the act of blowing up.'\n\nEven more information can be gleaned from how the supernova's\nbrightness changes over time: if material ejected from the initial\nexplosion collides with the companion star it changes the appearance of\nthe supernova (its light curve) shortly after the explosion.\n\n'Because\nwe caught this supernova very early, our observations are able to rule\nout some types of companion to the white dwarf,' said Dr Sullivan. 'For\nexample, we can rule out a companion red giant star; the second star\ncannot have been much bigger than the Sun.'\n\nA separate analysis of\nHubble Space Telescope images taken before the explosion, conducted by\nthe team, has provided additional evidence that the companion star\ncannot have been a red giant star.\n\nWhilst the observations support\nexisting models of supernovae formation they have thrown up some\nsurprises: in particular the uneven or 'clumpy' way in which oxygen was\ndistributed within the explosion and the high degree of mixing of\nmaterials, such as radioactive nickel, throughout the fireball.\n\nDr\nSullivan added: 'Understanding how these giant explosions create\nand mix materials is important because supernovae are where we get most\nof the elements that make up the Earth and even our own bodies \u2013 for\ninstance these supernovae are a major source of iron in the Universe, so\nwe are all made of bits of exploding stars.'\n\nThe\nPalomar Transient Factory is an international collaboration of\nscientists and engineers from the California Institute of Technology,\nDOE's National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center at Lawrence\nBerkeley National Laboratory, NASA's Infrared Processing and Analysis\nCenter, the University of California at Berkeley, Las Cumbres\nObservatory Global Telescope Network, the University of Oxford, Columbia\nUniversity, the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, and\nPennsylvania State University.\n\nTwo\nreports of the research, entitled 'Supernova SN 2011fe from an exploding\ncarbon-oxygen white dwarf star' and 'Exclusion of a luminous red giant\nas a companion star to the progenitor of supernova SN 2011fe', are\npublished in this week's Nature."}
{"text":"Science News\n\nGamma-Ray Bursts Active Longer Than Thought\n\nMay 24, 2007 \u2014 Using NASA's Swift satellite, astronomers have discovered that energetic flares seen after gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are not just hiccups, they appear to be a continuation of the burst itself.\n\nShare This:\n\nGRBs release in seconds the same amount of energy our Sun will emit over its expected 10 billion-year lifetime. The staggering energy of a long-duration GRB (lasting more than a few seconds) comes from the core of a massive star collapsing to form a black hole or neutron star. In current theory, inrushing gas forms a disk around the central object. Magnetic fields channel some of that material into two jets moving at near-light speed. Collisions between shells of ejected material within the jet trigger the actual GRB.\n\nEarly in the mission, Swift's X-ray Telescope (XRT) discovered that the initial pulse of gamma-rays, known as prompt emission, is often followed minutes to hours later by short-lived but powerful X-ray flares. The flares suggested \u2014 but did not prove \u2014 that GRB central engines remain active long after the prompt emission.\n\nAfter analyzing GRB 060714, named for its detection date of July 14, 2006, Hans Krimm of Universities Space Research Association, Columbia, Md. and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and eight colleagues, have demonstrated that X-ray flares are indeed a continuation of the prompt emission, showing that GRB central engines are active much longer than previously thought.\n\nSwift's Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) picked up the initial GRB in the constellation Libra. Then, from about 70 to 200 seconds after the initial burst, the BAT and XRT registered five flares. Each flare exhibited rapid and large-scale variability in intensity, but the overall energy steadily diminished from flare to flare. Moreover, the peak photon energy of each flare \"softened\" by progressing from gamma-rays to X-rays (from higher to lower energy).\n\nThe prompt gamma-ray emission and the subsequent X-ray flares appear to form a continuously connected and evolving succession of events. \"This pattern points to a continuous injection of energy from the central engine, perhaps fueled by sporadic infall of material onto a black hole. The black hole just keeps gobbling up gas and the engine keeps spewing out energy,\" says Krimm, whose paper is scheduled for publication in the August 10 Astrophysical Journal.\n\nThe rapid and large-scale variability of the X-ray flares argues strongly against the idea that they come from jets sweeping up the surrounding gas. Since the observed emission comes from a wide region, the afterglow should vary smoothly with time. Nobody has come up with a viable explanation for why the surrounding material would be so lumpy to lead to such rapid variability. \"This particular GRB had a series of flares over a wide range in time that were bright enough that we could study their properties in detail,\" says study coauthor Jonathan Granot of the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at Stanford University, Stanford, Calif. \"It clearly shows a gradual evolution with time in the properties of the flares within the same GRB, while in other GRBs there are typically only one or two flares that are bright enough to be studied in detail, making it very hard to reach a similar conclusion.\" \"This is a very important result,\" adds Swift principal investigator and study coauthor Neil Gehrels of NASA Goddard. \"By chance, if you look at enough bursts you'll find the one that opens the door. GRB 060714 shows that everything happening in the first few minutes is driven by the central engine.\"\n\nSwift is managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and was built and is operated in collaboration with Penn State University, the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and General Dynamics in the US; the University of Leicester and Mullard Space Sciences Laboratory in the UK; Brera Observatory and the Italian Space Agency in Italy; plus partners in Germany and Japan artwork depicts the central engine of a gamma-ray burst. A powerful jet of radiation and fast-moving particles blasts its way out of the central region of a dying star. The jet is presumably powered by material spiraling into a black hole or neutron star. Multiple episodes of infall provides fuel for the engine, leading to the burst and later X-ray flares.

{"text":"Science News\n\nGamma Ray Bursts To Take Center Stage At American Astronomical Society Meeting\n\nJan. 7, 1998 \u2014\n\nShare This:\n\nPerhaps no other area of astronomy has experienced such an explosive revolution in our understanding over the past year as that of gamma-ray bursts. These powerful explosions in space that are detected on a daily basis have been shown conclusively within the past 12 months to come from the most distant reaches of the Universe. Each one releases more energy in 10 seconds than our Sun will emit in its entire 10-billion-year lifetime. On January 7, 1998, Dr. Chryssa Kouveliotou, a USRA scientist at NASA\/Marshall, and Sir Martin Rees, Astronomer Royal of Great Britain, will present an invited lecture to the 191st meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington DC, to summarize what has been an unparalleled year of discovery in the area of cosmic gamma-ray bursts.\n\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs) were discovered by accident 30 years ago from data taken by the Vela satellite series. Since then, GRB detectors on US and international spacecraft have amassed a wealth of information on this enigmatic phenomenon. Currently, the Burst And Transient Source Experiment (BATSE), designed, built, and operated by scientists at NASA\/Marshall, is the most sensitive GRB experiment. Launched on April 5, 1991, aboard NASA's Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO), BATSE has detected over 2,000 cosmic bursts, more than all other experiments combined.\n\nIn early 1996, an Italian-Dutch satellite, BeppoSAX, which is equipped with X-ray Cameras that have a wide field of view, obtained images of an X-ray glow immediately following a GRB. This detection opened a new era in GRB research. These images taken shortly after the burst occurred provided a very precise location in the sky which enabled optical, X-ray and radio telescopes to quickly follow up the emission region and detect the first GRB counterparts in these other wavelengths. Since then, two additional optical counterparts have been found for gamma-ray bursts, the most recent discovery coming only in the third week of December 1997.\n\nDuring the invited lecture, Dr. Kouveliotou will review the main observational results of the last 7 years obtained with BATSE on the temporal, spectral, and spatial characteristics of GRBs, together with the recent optical, X-ray and radio follow-up results that have made crucial steps towards the solution of the GRB mystery.\n\nRelated Topics\n\nRelated Stories\n\nSpacetime: A Smoother Brew Than We Knew(Aug. 23, 2012) \u2014 Spacetime may be less like beer and more like sipping whiskey.

{"text":"A universal heavyweight champion was crowned this morning at the 217th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Seattle: A giant black hole weighing a staggering 6.6 billion suns accepted the title of the most massive black hole for which a precise mass has been determined.\n\nThat's not to say it's necessarily the largest black hole in the universe by any means, but in this neck of the cosmic woods we haven't measured a bigger one. Located at the heart of the galaxy M87 some 50 million light years away in the direction of Virgo, the black hole is so big it could swallow our solar system hole easily. Its event horizon--the boundary at which nothing, not even light, can escape the monster's gravitational pull--is four times as large as the orbit of Neptune, our sun's outermost planetary satellite.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTags\n\nPrevious estimates of M87's black hole mass registered at some 3 billion suns, still 1,000 times the size of the Milky Way's welterweight black hole. The new measurements were acquired using the adaptive optics capabilities on the 26.6-foot Frederick C. Gillett Gemini Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, which can compensate for the distorting effects of Earth's atmosphere. This allowed astronomers to gauge just how fast the stars in M87 are orbiting the black hole, and from that they could determine the mass.\n\nIf one simply compares the old measurements of M87's black hole to it's current massive size, it might beg the question: Is M87 juicing? Indeed, astronomers think the black hole did get some outside help beefing up over the course of its lifetime.

Over the next decade astronomers plan to hook up telescopes all over the world to create a whole Earth submillimeter array that will vastly increase their ability to locate event horizons and characterize the size of black holes throughout the universe.\n\nWe'd be surprised if there wasn't some young black hole out there right now devouring its surroundings and merging with smaller counterparts in hopes of one day unseating the champ"}
{"text":"Hubble telescope unmasks ghost galaxies\n\nJul 10, 2012\n\nAstronomers used the NASA\/ESA Hubble Space Telescope to unmask the dim, star-starved dwarf galaxy Leo IV. This Hubble image demonstrates why astronomers had a tough time spotting this small-fry galaxy: It is practically invisible. The image shows how the handful of stars from the sparse galaxy are virtually indistinguishable from the background. Residing 500 000 light-years from Earth, Leo IV is one of more than a dozen ultra-faint dwarf galaxies found lurking around our Milky Way galaxy. These galaxies are dominated by dark matter, an invisible substance that makes up the bulk of the Universe's mass. Credit: NASA, ESA, and T. Brown (STScI)\n\n(Phys.org) -- Astronomers have used\n\nAstronomers have puzzled over why some extremely faint dwarf galaxies spotted in our Milky Way galaxy's backyard contain so few stars. The galaxies are thought to be some of the tiniest, oldest, and most pristine galaxies in the Universe. They have been discovered over the past decade by astronomers using automated computer techniques to search through the images of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. But an international team of astronomers needed the NASA\/ESA Hubble Space Telescope to help solve the mystery of why these galaxies are starved of stars, and why so few of them have been found.\n\nHubble views of three of these small galaxies, the Hercules, Leo IV and Ursa Major dwarf galaxies, reveal that they all started forming stars more than 13 billion years ago -- and then abruptly stopped -- all in the first billion years after the Universe was born in the Big Bang. In fact, the extreme age of their stars is similar to Messier 92, the oldest known globular cluster in the Milky Way.\n\n\"These galaxies are all ancient and they're all the same age, so you know something came down like a guillotine and turned off the star formation at the same time in these galaxies,\" said Tom Brown of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, USA, the study's leader. \"The most likely explanation is a process called reionisation.\"\n\nThese Hubble images show the dim, star-starved dwarf galaxy Leo IV. The image at left shows part of the galaxy, outlined by the white rectangular box. The box measures 83 light-years wide by 163 light-years long. The few stars in Leo IV are lost amid neighboring stars and distant galaxies. A close-up view of the background galaxies within the box is shown in the middle image. The image at right shows only the stars in Leo IV. The galaxy, which contains several thousand stars, is composed of sun-like stars, fainter, red dwarf stars, and some red giant stars brighter than the sun. Credit: NASA, ESA, and T. Brown (STScI)\n\nThe relic galaxies are evidence for a transitional phase in the early Universe that shut down star-making factories in tiny galaxies. This phase seems to coincide with the time when the first stars burned off a fog of cold hydrogen, a process called reionisation. In this period, which began in the first billion years after the Big Bang, radiation from the first stars knocked electrons off primeval hydrogen atoms, ionising the Universe's cool hydrogen gas.\n\nThe same radiation that sparked universal reionisation also appears to have squelched star-making activities in dwarf galaxies, such as those in Brown's study. The small irregular galaxies were born about 100 million years before reionisation began and had just started to churn out stars at that time. Roughly 2000 light-years wide, these galaxies are the lightweight cousins of the more luminous and higher-mass star-making dwarf galaxies near our Milky Way. Unlike their higher-mass relatives, the puny galaxies were not massive enough to shield themselves from the harsh ultraviolet light. What little gas they had was stripped away as the flood of ultraviolet light rushed through them. Their gas supply depleted, the galaxies could not make new stars.\n\nThe discovery could help explain the so-called \"missing satellite problem,\" where only a few dozen dwarf galaxies have been observed around the Milky Way while the computer simulations predict that thousands should exist. One possible explanation for the low number discovered to date is that there has been very little, or even no star formation in the smallest of these dwarf galaxies, leaving them virtually invisible.\n\nThese computer simulations show a swarm of dark matter clumps around our Milky Way galaxy. Some of the dark-matter concentrations are massive enough to spark star formation. Thousands of clumps of dark matter coexist with our Milky Way galaxy, shown in the center of the top panel. The green blobs in the middle panel are those dark-matter chunks massive enough to obtain gas from the intergalactic medium and trigger ongoing star formation, eventually creating dwarf galaxies. In the bottom panel, the red blobs are ultra-faint dwarf galaxies that stopped forming stars long ago. Credit: NASA, ESA, and T. Brown and J. Tumlinson (STScI)\n\nThe Sloan survey recently uncovered more than a dozen of these galaxies in our cosmic neighbourhood. These have very few stars -- only a few hundred or thousand -- but a great deal of dark matter, the underlying scaffolding upon which galaxies are built. Normal dwarf galaxies near the Milky Way contain 10 times more dark matter than the ordinary matter that makes up gas and stars, while in these so-called ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, dark matter outweighs ordinary matter by at least a factor of 100. Astronomers think the rest of the sky should contain dozens more of these ultra-faint dwarf galaxies with few stars, and the evidence for squelched star formation in the smallest of these dwarfs suggests that there may be still thousands more with essentially no stars at all.\n\n\"By measuring the star formation histories of the observed dwarfs, Hubble has supported the theoretical explanation for the paucity of such objects, according to which star formation in the smaller clumps would be shut down by reionisation,\" said Jason Tumlinson of the Space Telescope Science Institute, a member of the research team.\n\nThe results are published in the 1 July issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

{"text":"Sunday, December 05, 2010\n\nGlobal warming and galactic superwaves\n\nCfA astronomer Doug Finkbeiner, together with two of his students, Meng Su and Tracy Slatyer, used NASA's Fermi Gamma Ray Telescope to study the diffuse gamma ray emission. They revealed humongous bubbles of high energy emission protruding about 50,000 light-years above and below the galaxy, and centered on its nucleus. Recently, it was confirmed independently from IBEX observations, the Sun going to enter soon a million-degree galactic cloud of interstellar gas.\n\nAt the time of this prediction, astronomers believed that the cores of galaxies, including our own, become active (\"explode\") about every 10 to 100 million years and stay active for about a million years. Since our own Galactic core presently appears quiescent, they believed it would likely remain inactive for many tens of millions of years. Although in 1977, astronomer Jan Oort cited evidence that our Galactic core has been active within the past 10,000 years. In Ph.D. dissertation, Paul LaViolette hypothesized that galactic core explosions recur about every 10,000 years and last for several hundred to a few thousand years. He was the first to suggest such a short recurrence time for galactic core explosions and that our own Galactic core undergoes Seyfert-like explosions with similar frequency. In 1983 Paul LaViolette presented evidence to the scientific community indicating that galactic core explosions actually occur about every 13,000 - 26,000 years for major outbursts and more frequently for lesser events. The emitted cosmic rays escape from the core virtually unimpeded. As they travel radially outward through the Galaxy, they form a spherical shell that advances at a velocity approaching the speed of light.\n\nLaViolette's research suggests that the Sun also became highly active as dust and gas falling onto its surface induced extreme flaring activity. Together with the radiation influx from the Sun's dust cocoon, this caused the Sun's corona and photosphere to inflate, much as is observed today in dust-choked stars called \"T Tauri stars.\" These various solar effects caused atmospheric warming and inversion conditions that facilitated glacial growth which brought on ice age conditions. On occasions when the solar radiation influx to the Earth became particularly high, the ice age climate warmed, initiating episodes of rapid glacial melting and continental flooding. There is evidence that one particularly tragic solar flare event occurred around 12,900 years ago during a period when the Sun was particularly active. This involved the release of an immense coronal mass ejection which engulfed the Earth and induced a mass animal extinction. Details of this scenario are described in Paul LaViolette's book Earth Under Fire as well as in a series of journal articles he has published. Astronomical observations show the last major Galactic core explosion occurred as recently as 10,000 to 15,000 years ago.\n\nLaViolette has an analysis of this evidence of a superwave event on his blog (YT video). The geometry of the bubbles coincide with a superwave event occuring approximately 26000 years ago, which is supported by evidence in the ice core record. Data obtained from polar ice core samples show evidence of this cosmic ray event as well as other cosmic ray intensity peaks from earlier times.\n\nI'm not saying that the dynamic processes, claimed by the authors, were wrong. I'd only like to say that these phenomenon have nothing to do with the global warming because the GW has been invented by communism-ecologist people to attack the free market. Zephir, unfortunately in our world there are many enemies of freedom. The GW has nothing to do with science. It's only a political problem made by criminals but with the aid of the freedom fighters we'll achieve the victory. I don't blame you for writing such things. Your problem is due to the education received, i.e, your brain has been washed by the communism system that you have suffered. But look at Lubos, undoubtedly he's a very smart guy. Smart enough to learn that these ideas are very bad and imposed by dictators.\n\nOf course there is no global warming relation with these superwaves. However, what could be the origin of these superwaves? In my humble opinion, these waves are related to the electric polarity between the positive charged Galaxy nucleus and the negative charged GABHs (or Galaxy Anchor Black holes.) see: \n\nMonckton Myth #1: Cooling oceans (more debunking of Christopher Monckton - the same Monckton that falsely claimed to be a Nobel laureate and maintained that he has invented a cure for HIV, multiple sclerosis, influenza and other diseases)\n\n\"The storm began on Dec 13th and ended on the 22nd,\" says Karl Battams of the Naval Research Lab in Washington, DC. \"During that time, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) detected 25 comets diving into the sun. It was crazy!\" Researchers say this could herald a much larger comet still to come.\n\nSorry Zephir for my late reaction. I must reject my 'of course not\". It should be \"of course yes\" Planets are puffed up by the Mini Black hole nuclei of former Comets which crashed into these planets and even moons.\n\nWhile the influence of human to global warming in undeniable (compare the rainy weekends phenomena, for example), I don't think the recent development of global warming is of atropocentric origin. IMO solar system is facing dense cloud of dark matter (consisting of mostly antinetrinos), which are shifting center of mass of solar system, thus breaking solar cycles driven with Jupiter planet. Evidence of global warming accross solar system: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. The antineutrinos are supposedly slowing nuclear fusion, but they're accelerating the decay of heavy elements (the electron capture of K-40 in particular) which are the sources of geothermal heat as the Earth and another planets of solar system. The geothermal flux from the Earth core to the bottom of the ocean can be quite negiglible (~ 0,5 W\/m\u00b2 with compare to 1600 W\/m\u00b2 of solar constant). Most of heat is generated with decay of K-40 directly at the water. The total activity of ocean water exceeds 3.8 x 10E+11 Ci (14000 EBq) - for comparison 100 million Ci has been released in ninety atmospheric tests at the Nevada Test Site. The hypothesis is supported with heat content anomaly and with recent finding of the hidden circumantartic current, As the another indicia of this hypothesis can increased geovolcanic activity (observable for example at Vesuvius and Yellowstone calderas), increased frequency and intensity of earthquakes, the increased frequency of comet impacts observed at Jupiter and Sun, the swelling of kilogram and meter prototypes in dense vacuum, the shift of speed of light and\/or gravity constant toward lower values, etc. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23)\n\nStuart Freedman: \"One thing we can say with near certainty is that radioactive decay alone is not enough to account for Earth's heat energy. Whether the rest is primordial heat or comes from some other source is an unanswered question\". Ms. Riofrio thinks a black hole has breached our planet's core and may be about to release literal hell on Earth.\n\nWhat a great piece to write on! Such wild new information we're compiling now in regards to the astro-geophysical model of climate variation. I have written bits and pieces about the same topic(s) within many of my blog articles, but I usually subsume them into anthropological research and theories. Even the origin of musical frequency timing is perhaps strikingly relative to the 26,000 (25,920 really) year-long precession of equinoxes, a timeframe somewhat referred to in this piece of yours. Anywho - glad to link up! Keep 'em coming.\n\nOne paper claims the heat is real, but it's deep in the oceans. Spencer's work, published (pdf) in the journal Remote Sensing, concludes that more energy is radiated back to space than previously thought, and it is released earlier, too.\n\nBoth uranium-238 and thorium-232 together contribute 20 TW to Earth's heat flux. The neutrinos emitted from the decay of potassium-40 are below the limits of detection in Borexino and [url= experiments[\/url], but are known to contribute 4 TW. IMO radioactive decay of the potassium-40 (which is concentrated in the oceans) accelerated with neutrinos from dark matter is the main factor contributing to the global warming and [url= content anomaly[\/url] (and increased geovolcanic activity, shift of magnetic poles and many other effects).\n\n[url= could be heating the Earth's core[\/url] too. Geophysicists have found much less potassium in the Earth's crust and mantle than would be expected based on the composition of rocky meteors that supposedly formed the Earth. They've shown that at the high pressures and temperatures in the Earth's interior, potassium can form an alloy with iron never before observed. During the planet's formation, this potassium-iron alloy could have sunk to the core, depleting potassium in the overlying mantle and crust and providing a radioactive potassium heat source in addition to that supplied by uranium and thorium in the core."}

{"text":"And then the universe said 'Hah!' NASA's Swift satellite can't believe its eyes when it spots the brightest X-ray glow from a gamma ray burst outside our galaxy\n\nJuly 14th, 2010\n\nThree weeks ago, a distant point in space in another galaxy released a blast of X-rays so bright even the satellite that saw it first didn't believe its eyes. Then Phil Evans came home from vacation and got very, very lucky.\n\n\"One of the things I personally like most about doing research,\" he says, \"is when you discover something brand new \u2014 even if it's 'just' the brightest X-ray object that we think we've ever seen \u2014 there's a moment when there is only one person in the universe who knows about this. And sometimes you get to be that one person.\"\n\nIt went down this way: On June 21, NASA's orbiting Swift observatory was on sentry duty for Earth's astronomers, watching the universe for Gamma ray bursts. A GRB went off on June 21, later catalogued GRB 100621A. (GRBs are violent eruptions of energy from the explosion of a massive star turning into a black hole.)\n\nGamma ray bursts announce their appearance as, well, a burst of gamma rays. Since gammas are the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation, GRBs are the most powerful beacons in the universe.\n\nWhen Swift detects a burst, it radios the coordinates to Earth. Astronomers and robotic observatories scramble to aim their instruments at the GRB. Swift also slews its instruments, such as the X-Ray Telescope (XRT), to the target.\n\nSwift's X-Ray Telescope captured this image of GRB 100621A\n\nIdeally, astronomers want to observe both the immediate or \"prompt\" emissions and, as time passes, the fading afterglow of X-rays, ultraviolet light, and (rarely) visible light.\n\nSwift beams to Earth a record of when it detected each photon, and then software on the ground turns this into a \"light curve\" \u2014 literally a record of how the GRB's brightness changes over time in various wavelengths.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the lab\u2026\nOK, enough about Swift; back to Phil. He's is a post-doctoral research assistant in the X-ray and Observational Astronomy group at the University of Leicester in England, and part of the Swift team. He wrote the software that converts the photo detections from Swift into light curves.\n\nSo he got home from holiday on June 29. The next morning, he examined the light curves that his software had created while he was in the Lake District in North West England, camping with his wife and two young sons.\n\nAnd he saw something very puzzling: For one event, GRB 100621A, the record of its earliest X-ray emission was missing. He'd also received an email from another astronomer who had also noticed the gap.\n\n\"I looked at this and thought that's odd, I'll have to come back to it. I was looking at it and thinking, this is very strange.\"\n\nBy noon, he had the data gap plugged. It took him a few more hours to check it, and to appreciate what had actually happened. The next day he announced it to the rest of the Swift community around the globe.\n\nIt turned out that GRB 100621A had been so bright early on, it had temporarily blinded Swift's detectors. At the center of the image, which is the brightest part of the image, X-rays streamed in at a peak rate of 143,000 per second \u2014 well, for 0.2 seconds, anyway! But the X-ray camera literally could not count that fast. It was like a lone soccer goalkeeper being fired at by a dozen World Cup strikers.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong\nPhil's light-curve-making software has a way of dealing with this situation. It counts the X-ray photons streaming in around the edges of the image, where it's not so bright and intense. Then it multiplies that by a correction factor to estimate how bright it must be in the glaring center of the image.\n\nThis correction was used in the famous \"naked eye\" GRB 080319B of 2008, which was so bright you could have seen it without a telescope, briefly, in a dark location on Earth. The correction: 32 times.\n\nCorrection for the June 21 GRB: 168!\n\nPhil designed the software so that if the correction factor exceeds a certain expected threshold, the software just doesn't report the data to astronomers on the ground. In a sense, Swift didn't believe its own eyes.\n\n\"When it did the correction, it saw the size of it and said, no, that's got to be nonsense, there's got to be some sort of mistake,\" Phil explains. \"It just said, 'This can't be real. I'm not publishing this to the world because I'm going to look like an idiot.\"\n\nOr to put it more politely, Phil's software refuses to report what it determines to be bad data. But it wasn't bad; it was spot-on correct. A new (X-ray) world record\n\"I didn't totally register at first how bright it is, and then I mentioned it to a few people, and they went 'What!' And then we started to get a better feel for the fact that this was something to put in your record books.\"\n\nWhat kind of record are we talking about?\n\nWhen the system was designed, astronomers weren't expecting to see anything as bright as what Swift saw on June 21. The next brightest such object in X-rays was 2008\u2032s naked-eye GRB 080319B.\n\nThis GRB was seven times fainter but twice as far away as the June 21 event. But move the new record holder to the same distance, and it would still be 1.5 times as bright as GRB 080319B.\n\nBoth of these events happened outside our Milky Way Galaxy. For example, the June 21 GRB happened 5 billion light years away, which means the light from it left about the time our solar system formed. There are brighter X-ray sources in our own galaxy, but that's like comparing your next-door neighbor's porch light to the blinking aircraft beacon atop a radio tower 10 miles away.\n\nRelative to Swift, the latest GRB is a clear record-breaker. It is definitely the brightest thing, GRB or otherwise, Swift's X-ray eye has ever seen.\n\nAnd that is, perhaps, the most striking thing about this whole episode: the way in which this latest GRB has confounded expectations.\n\nBarbara Kennedy said it best recently on a teleconference with Phil and a couple of other scientists, including Dave Burrows of Penn State University (PSU), the lead scientist for Swift's X-ray telescope. Barbara is a press officer for PSU, which has issued a release about the event.\n\nWe \u2014 the scientists, Barbara, and a couple other media people who cover Swift \u2014 were discussing what approach to use to explain this GRB to the public. Biggest? Brightest? First?\n\nI thought Barbara nailed it when she said: \"The best scientists in the world thought 'We'll never see anything that bright, so we don't have to design the software to handle it.' And then the universe said 'Hah! Look what I can throw at you!'\"\n\n_______\n\nFollow Phil Evans in his role as a Swift Scientist on Twitter: @Swift_Phil, where news of this discovery was first announced!]\n\nSee Barbara Kennedy's press release on the X-ray GRB on the PSU website.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________ OH AND DID I MENTION?All opinions and opinionlike objects in this blog are mine alone and NOT those of NASA or Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\nHi Terry,\nThe tweaks I made to tell the code to process these data should avoid a recurrence of the \"false negative\", while also maintaining the (important), safety checks to avoid publishing genuinely bad data."}

{"text":"This month marks the tenth anniversary of one of the best ideas to come out of modern astronomy: the Hubble Heritage project. Astronomers at the Space Telescope Science Institute knew that Hubble was taking fantastic images that the public weren't seeing, because Hubble was taking them faster than they could release to the press. So they decided that on the first Thursday of each month they would release a gorgeous picture online.\n\nFor their tenth anniversary*, they present this beautiful image of detail in the nebula NGC 3324:\n\nCooool. But what is it?\n\nIt's a cavity several light years across, carved out by the fierce light and intense stellar winds from a group of young, massive, hot stars that are out of the frame (\"up\", if you will). This whole part of the sky, in the direction of Carina, is lousy with dust and gas. There are star-forming regions all over the place. Stars of all masses are born, from dinky brown dwarfs with less than 1\/10th the Sun's mass, up to bruising monsters 80 times the mass of the Sun. The massive stars are incredibly hot, and blow off a dense and fast wind of material which pushes against their nursery cocoon.\n\nThe fingers of NGC 3324\n\nThe result is a sharp-edged bubble of material. Inside is thin hot gas (colored blue in this image), and outside is thicker dust and gas (reds and browns). See the little pseudopods sticking in around the edges? Those are formed where you get denser blobs just inside the cavity edge. Note that the winds and light are streaming \"down\" in this image. When that flows past the blobs you get those finger-like sandbars. When you zoom in on them, they look a lot like the trunks in the Pillars of Creation Hubble image or the Spitzer image of nebula W5. If you look carefully in that zoom above, you can see lots of these features scattered around the cavity's edge.\n\nThe whole NGC 3324 complex. See? It's a bubble!\n\nZooming out is useful, too. In the picture to the right you can see the overall bubble shape to the nebula, and the stars near the center that are sculpting this vast cavern. The Hubble image is of the section to the upper right of the cavity, from about 1:00 to 3:00 if the circle were a clock face. But you can see amazing features all around the edges.\n\nHubble is having its woes right now, and even if it gets fixed its own clock is ticking. It was launched in April 1990 \u2014 I still remember it well, as I had just signed up to use it for my PhD project \u2014 and nothing lasts forever. But Hubble has taken thousands upon thousands of observations, all of which have been stored away. And while Hubble may eventually be shut off, the images, spectra, and other data it's taken will live on. Astronomers a century from now will be digging through the archives, looking for an elusive supernova, a feature of a nebula that's changed in the intervening years, the positions of stars in globular clusters, and the colors of galaxies so far away that when the light Hubble detected left them, the Earth was still a cooling ball of molten rock.\n\nDiamond anniversaries come and go, but the treasures Hubble has unveiled will still be around a long, long time. Congratulations to my friends at the Hubble Heritage Project. Thanks for bringing us these jewels in the sky.\n\n*Technically and traditionally, the tenth anniversary gift should be tin, but in modern times it's common to give diamondsIt's also neat to realize why it's not just round. It's not just because there are variations in the density of the interstellar medium \u2013 there's a fluid-dynamical process (the \"Rayleigh-Taylor instability\") that you can demonstrate at home that ensures that small irregularities balloon into the wonderful exotic shapes we seeAlthough you might see it as a fuzzy cloud, it is unlikely for the fine detail we see in this image to be visible to the unaided eye. This is because the gas, while relatively dense, is still very, very rarefied. Some nebulae have a lower gas density than what would be considered a fairly hard vacuum in a lab on Earth. Hubble images almost all result from quite long exposures \u2013 this one was probably at least several minutes, if not over an hour.\n\nCelestial objects such as this nebula are faint. Even through a medium-sized telescope, most nebulae appear to the human eye as no more than a little faint fuzzy patch.\n\nA very big thankyou to the folks who designed, built and are using the Hubble Space telscope, a big thankyou to the people at NASA and their astronauts for fixing and updating it (several times over) and thankyou Dr Phil Plait for telling us about it so clearly and so well."}

It contains about 20,000 stars, most of which are hot, young blue stars.\n\nAstronomers had known about the star cluster before, but it was only recently that they confirmed the number of stars it held.\n\nIn the late 1990's, several observatories detected very high-energy X-rays and gamma rays coming from the region but astronomers were uncertain about their source. It was thought the blasts might have originated from distant galaxies or from pulsating stars known as pulsars, which typically emit radio waves but can send out other wavelengths of energy as well.\n\nA team of researchers is now proposing that the blasts are the result of massive stars known as red supergiants in the cluster that exploded cataclysmically as supernovae.\n\nSupergiants\n\nSupporting their hypothesis is the presence of 14 red supergiants within the cluster. Red supergiants are massive stars at the ends of their lives that can bloat up to about 100 times their normal size before exploding.\n\nBecause the red supergiant phase for stars lasts only about half a million to a million years--very short in astronomical terms--only a few red supergiants have ever been seen. Supernovae are even more difficult to detect, because even though they are billions of times brighter than normal stars when they explode, they remain visible only for several weeks or months.\n\n\"This observation is a rare chance to study huge stars just before they explode,\" said Don Figer, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore who led the study. \"Normally, we don't get to see stars before they pop off.\"\n\nOnly about 200 red supergiants have been spotted in the Milky Way and these are typically scattered far apart, so finding more than a dozen clustered together is highly unusual. Previous to this discovery, the record-holder for the star cluster containing the most red supergiants was NGC 7419, which had five.\n\nStars that become red supergiants are typically between 6 million to 15 million years old and about 8 to 25 times more massive than our Sun.\n\n\"If a red supergiant were situated where our Sun is, it would envelop Jupiter,\" Figer said.\n\nBecause the red supergiants in this cluster are still relatively bright, Figer's team estimates that the star cluster is relatively young, between 8 and 10 million years old. The idea is that stars in the cluster have to be young enough for astronomers to see them before they go supernova, yet old enough for some of them to have evolved to the red supergiant phase in the first place.\n\nHiding place\n\nThe reason the cluster has been largely overlooked until now is because of the interstellar dust that blankets much of the Milky Way.\n\n\"This cluster isn't too far away but there's a certain amount of dust between us and it,\" Figer said. \"At optical wavelengths, the stars are so faint that no telescope can see them.\"\n\nBut using NASA's infrared Spitzer Space Telescope, the researchers were able to pierce through the dust cover and see the cluster in detail for the first time.\n\nThe cluster is the first in a survey of 130 potential massive star clusters in our galaxy that the team has targeted for study over the next five years.\n\nThe findings were presented last week at the 207th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, DC."}

{"text":"1.2. Thermal history of the Universe and the CMBR\n\nThe origins of the CMBR lie in an early hot phase of the expansion of\nthe Universe, where the details of its generation are erased by the\nclose coupling of radiation and matter. Later energy\nreleases, interactions with matter at different temperatures,\nand other effects can modify the spectrum and brightness distribution\nof the CMBR. Cosmological data on the gross properties of the\nUniverse are contained in the integrated properties of the CMBR, such\nas the spectrum and the large-scale brightness structure. Detailed\ninformation about the properties and formation of present-day objects,\nsuch as clusters of galaxies, is encoded in the small-scale\nstructures in the brightness.\n\nA critical stage in the development of the CMBR occurs when the\nexpansion of the Universe causes the temperature to drop to about\n3000 K. At earlier times (higher redshifts), matter and\nradiation were in good thermal contact because of the abundance of\nfree electrons. But at this stage the number of free electrons drops\nrapidly as matter becomes neutral, and the radiation and matter become\nthermally decoupled, so that the temperatures of the photon and matter\nfluids evolve almost independently. We can distinguish three events\nthat occur at almost the same time: the non-relativistic and\nrelativistic (photon plus neutrino) mass densities\nare equal at redshift\n\n(3)\n\nmost electrons have become bound to ions at the redshift of\nrecombination,\n\n(4)\n\nand the interaction length of photons and electrons exceeds the scale\nof the Universe at the redshift of decoupling\n\n(5)\n\n(approximate forms taken from\nKolb & Turner 1990).\nIn these relations, 0\nis the present-day mass density of the Universe,\nand B is the\npresent-day baryon density, both in units\nof the critical density, crit (equation 2). The\nredshifts of recombination and decoupling are similar, and neither\nphenomenon is sharply-defined, so that there was\na moderately broad redshift range from 1500 to 1000\n(about 1.6 x 105 (0h1002)-1\/2\nyears after the Big Bang) when the Universe was becoming\nneutral, matter-dominated, and transparent to radiation. At some time\nabout then, most of the photons that are now in the\ncosmic background radiation were scattered by electrons for the last\ntime, and we often refer to a sphere of last scattering or\nredshift of last scattering at this epoch.\n\nOne of the important changes that occurred during this period, because\nof the change in the interactions of photons and electrons, was that\nthe length scale on which gravitational collapse can occur dropped\ndramatically, so that fluctuations in the mass density that were\nstabilized by the radiation field before recombination became unstable\nafter recombination, and were able to collapse (slowly - the\nexpansion of the Universe causes the collapse of gravitationally bound\nobjects to be power-law rather than exponential in time:\nLandau & Lifshitz 1962;\nsee descriptions in\nKolb & Turner 1990).\nMatter\nover-densities and under-densities present at recombination, and which\nlater became the large-scale objects that we see in the present-day\nUniverse, such as clusters of galaxies,\ncaused fluctuations in the intensity of the radiation field through\ntheir gravitational perturbations (the Sachs-Wolfe effect;\nSachs & Wolfe 1967),\nthrough thermodynamic fluctuations in the density of\nradiation coupled to the matter, and through Doppler shifts due to\nmotions of the surface of last scattering. Recent reviews of the\nintroduction of primordial structure in the CMBR by objects near\nrecombination are given by\nBond (1995) and\nWhite et al. (1994)."}

{"text":"There are many similarities between this process and that which results in recurrent novae. For an X-ray burst, the compact object is a neutron star which accretes a surface layer of helium that undergoes explosive burning to produce the outburst. For recurrent novae, the compact object is a white dwarf which accretes a surface layer of hydrogen that undergoes explosive burning to produce the outburst.\n\nX-ray bursts generally occur at regular intervals separated by several hours or days. They have durations ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes, with the burst profile showing a rapid rise (0.3 - 10 seconds) followed by a slower decline (5 - 100 seconds). The rapid rise reflects the sudden increase in temperature brought about by explosive helium ignition, while the slower decline arises due to the slower cooling of the surface of the star.\n\nAll of the above refers to Type I X-ray bursts which make up the vast majority of this class of object. In fact, there are only two Type II X-ray bursts known, one of which also shows Type I outbursts. A Type II burst is thought to be due to an increase in the rate of accretion from the companion star and is distinguished from a Type I burst through its burst profile. While Type I bursts have a rapid rise followed by a slow decline, Type II bursts start and stop abruptly with no gradual decay from peak. They can also show rapid successions of bursts separated by a few minutes."}

And its picture of the Rosette cloud, 5,000 light-years away in the constellation Monoceros, shows off the spacecraft's strengths.

{"text":"Revolutionary New Camera Reveals the Dark Side of the Universe\n\nA new camera that will revolutionise the field of submillimetre astronomy has been unveiled on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) in Hawaii.\n\nSCUBA-2 (Superconducting Sub-mm Camera) is the most powerful instrument of its type ever built; able to detect light at \"sub-mm\" wavelengths that are 1,000 times longer than those which can be seen by the human eye. It is far more sensitive and powerful than previous instruments, mapping areas of the sky hundreds of times faster and providing unprecedented information on the early life of stars \u2013 normally obscured by the remains of the very dust and gas cloud that collapsed under its own gravity to form the star.\n\nResearchers involved with the project; led by STFC's UK Astronomy Technology Centre (UKATC) at the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh in collaboration with a world-wide consortium of laboratories, believe that the camera will help lay bare one of the most exciting phases in the whole history of the Universe. \"The Milky Way Galaxy today only produces maybe two suns a year amid a population of 100 billion suns,\" explains Prof James Dunlop from the University of Edinburgh. \"We are looking back 10 billion years in time to see galaxies when they produced stars a thousand times faster than anything in the local cosmos today.\"\n\nThe data obtained by these surveys will allow a new and precise understanding of star formation throughout the history of the universe, and complements research being carried out on other telescopes such as the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA), undergoing commissioning in Chile.\n\n\"Looking up at the stars, you only see the light they are emitting in the visible part of the spectrum,\" explains Professor Gary Davis, Director of the JCMT. \"Many galaxies, including our own Milky Way, contain huge amounts of cold dust that absorbs visible light and these dusty regions just look black when seen through an optical telescope. The absorbed energy is then re-radiated by the dust at longer, submillimetre, wavelengths.\"\n\n\"SCUBA-2 has been designed to detect extremely low energy radiation in the submillimetre region of the spectrum. To do this, the instrument itself needs to be even colder. The SCUBA-2 detectors are cooled to only 0.1 degree above absolute zero (\u2013273.05\u00b0C), making the interior of SCUBA-2 colder than anything in the Universe that we know of\".\n\nCryoconnect, a division of Tekdata interconnections Limited, manufactured the original SCUBA cryogenic harnesses and subsequently were selected to meet the challenge of providing the cryogenic harnesses for the SCUBA-2 Instrument. The harnesses were constructed in a planar form with Niobium Titanium (NbTi) alloys and introducing a very significant cost and mass saving by designing hermetic connectorless feedthroughs at the vacuum wall (1).\n\nTo be able to terminate the ultra fine tracks, pre-heaters were used at the cold end ceramic PCBs (2).\n\nThe detectors on SCUBA-2 are Transition Edge Sensor (TES) arrays developed by NIST and there are four 32\u00d740 of these, each of 850 and 450 micron; in total 10240 detectors.\n\nCommenting on the performance of the new instrument, Professor Wayne Holland of the UKATC, and the SCUBA-2 Project Scientist, said, \"Cryoconnect's support was critical to be able to have the full complement of eight arrays on the instrument. With SCUBA, it typically took 20 nights to image an area about the size of the full Moon. SCUBA-2 will be able to cover the same area in a couple of hours and go much deeper, allowing us to detect faint objects that have never been seen before.\"\n\nThe increased mapping speed and sensitivity of SCUBA-2 make it ideal for large-scale surveys; no other instrument will be able to survey the submillimetre sky in such exquisite detail. Dr Antonio Chrysostomou, Associate Director of the JCMT said, \"SCUBA-2\u2032s first task is carrying out a series of surveys right across the heavens, mapping sites of star formation within our Galaxy, as well as planet formation around nearby stars. It will also survey our galactic neighbours and crucially, will look deep into space and sample the youngest galaxies in the Universe, which will be critical to understanding how galaxies have evolved since the Big Bang.\"\n\nA composite image of the Whirlpool Galaxy (also known as M51).

One \"top-down\" idea is that all of space was somehow left with a slight magnetic field soon after the Big Bang \u2013 around the end of inflation, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, or decoupling of baryonic matter and radiation \u2013 and this field grew in strength as stars and galaxies amassed and amplified its intensity. Another, \"bottom-up\" possibility is that magnetic fields formed initially by the motion of plasma in small objects in the primordial universe, such as stars, and then propagated outward into space.\n\nSo how do you estimate the strength of a magnetic field, tens or hundreds of millions of light-years away, in regions of space a looong way from any galaxies (much less clusters of galaxies)? And how do you do this when you expect these fields to be much less than a nanoGauss (nG), perhaps as small as a femtoGauss (fG, which is a millionth of a nanoGauss)? What trick can you use??\n\nA very neat one, one that relies on physics not directly tested in any laboratory, here on Earth, and unlikely to be so tested during the lifetime of anyone reading this today \u2013 the production of positron-electron pairs when a high energy gamma ray photon collides with an infrared or microwave one (this can't be tested in any laboratory, today, because we can't make gamma rays of sufficiently high energy, and even if we could, they'd collide so rarely with infrared light or microwaves we'd have to wait centuries to see such a pair produced). But blazars produce copious quantities of TeV gamma rays, and in intergalactic space microwave photons are plentiful (that's what the cosmic microwave background \u2013 CMB \u2013 is!), and so too are far infrared ones.\n\nMAGIC telescope (Credit: Robert Wagner)\n\nHaving been produced, the positron and electron will interact with the CMB, local magnetic fields, other electrons and positrons, etc (the details are rather messy, but were basically worked out some time ago), with the net result that observations of distant, bright sources of TeV gamma rays can set lower limits on the strength of the IGM and ICM through which they travel. Severalrecentpapers report results of such observations, using the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, and the MAGIC telescope.\n\nSo how strong are these magnetic fields? The various papers give different numbers, from greater than a few tenths of a femtoGauss to greater than a few femtoGauss.\n\n\"The fact that they've put a lower bound on magnetic fields far out in intergalactic space, not associated with any galaxy or clusters, suggests that there really was some process that acted on very wide scales throughout the universe,\" Zweibel says. And that process would have occurred in the early universe, not long after the Big Bang. \"These magnetic fields could not have formed recently and would have to have formed in the primordial universe,\" says Ruth Durrer, a theoretical physicist at the University of Geneva.\n\nSo, perhaps we have yet one more window into the physics of the early universe; hooray!\n\nDarn, too late for the fun stuff! Indeed, magnetic fields are felt by local sissies (materials) not classical devil-may-care far traveling photons as they rip through the vacuum with utter abandon.\n\nThe easiest way to see that is (again, classically) to realize that if they don't completely separate from effects of the near field that creates them, such as E, M and coupled EM fields, they would have a durn difficult time to freely go to infinity (as r^-2) in the far field. (And, as LBC points out, this is low energy behavior in space. No guarantees for, say, black holes!)\n\nBut I appreciate all the funny effects I haven't been aware of before. Thanks!\n\nTorbjorn Larsson OM\n\nChucks, this is before my first coffee. I'm not making myself clear.\n\nOf course it is the other way around, as it is the coupling EM near field that doesn't go to infinity. Which means that photons, that does, are separated from such coupling behavior and its components E and M. (Except in the sense that photons themselves are already fully coupled.)\n\nI'm fairly certain a better analysis would be to look at energy, as suggested by the different radius behavior \u2013 but I lack it (energy) right now.\n\nDrFlimmer\n\nCONFUSION!\n\nSo, I was somehow not entirely wrong in the first place.\n\nI don't know, if my following description is correct. If not, please correct it anyone!\nI just thought of a \"semi-classical\" approach to make myself clear, why \"weak\" magnetic fields do not interact with photons. IIRC, the transmitter of the \"electromagnetic force\" (or the fields) is the photon. So, an interaction between a magnetic field and a photon would actually be an interaction between two photons. And we've learned from this post that photons do not interact with each other at low energies (again, assuming not too strong magnetic field strength). Therefore, there should be no interaction between a magnetic field and a photon (neglecting media\u2026).\n\nAs I said before, I don't know if this simple picture is correct, because it mixes quantum mechanical and classical views (\"semi-classical\"). But I think it gives an idea.\n\nCONFUSION mode off!\n\nLawrence B. Crowell\n\nMy comment with potential interactions between photons and huge magnetic fields is a \"I wonder if\" sort of thing. In a quantum setting this might induce nonlinear QED effects, maybe similar to parametric amplification. As for other presumed effects presented here by others, these do involve photons in media subjected to magnetic fields. Ultimately there are electrons in these media which act as an intemediate actors.\n\nI should check out whether there is anything on nonlinear QED with hyper-magnetic fields."}
{"text":"Astronomical distancesAstronomers use special equations and measuring methods to determine distances in the universe and our solar system. Calculations in meters or kilometers will always result in very large figures, for example the nearest galaxy is the Andromeda galaxy, which is located at a distance of 21 quintillion km (21.000.000.000.000.000.000 km) away. Such a large figure is difficult to comprehend, when expressed in lightyears, the distance is 2.2 million lightyears, which is much easier to read.\n\nA Lightyear. The speed of light is the universal maximum\nvelocity, approximately 300,000 km\/second.\n\nTo comprehend how fast this is, just image that ifyou were to travel around the Earth at the speed of light, you would make 7.5 complete rotations in only one second.\n\nDistances in the universe are incredibly large, to make calculations easier distances are measured in lightyears. This is the distance traveled at the speed of light in one year, approximately 9.5 trillion kilometers (9,500,000,000,000 km).\n\nParallax. In astronomy the apparent shift in position of (nearby) stars against the background of more distant stars is used to determine the distance of a star. As a result of the motion of Earth in its orbit around the Sun, a star, observed from Earth, will shift against its background. This is called a parallax, which is the angle of shift and is measured in distance.\n\nBy measuring twice, with an interval of six months (exactly half an orbit around the Sun) the distance can be measured in arc seconds.\n\nA full circle is 360 degrees, one degree is subdivided in 60 minutes, and one minute is subdivided in 60 arc seconds, so a circle is divided into 1,296,000 arc seconds.\n\nThis is a standard measure, which is often used is the parsec, which is the distance were a star's parallax is equal to 1 arc second. This distance equals 3.26 lightyears, so approximately 31 trillion kilometer (31,000,000,000,000 km). A parsec also equals approximately 206,000 Astronomical Units.\n\nAstronomical Unit. Making calculations in lightyears within our own solar system is not that handy. These distances are too small, for examle the Sun is positioned only 8 lightminutes away from Earth.\nFor easy calculations within our solar system a much smaller unit is used: the Astronomical Unit or AU.\nThis is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, about 150\nmillion km (150,000,000 km). Pluto for instance is placed at 40 AE from the Sun.\n\nOn the image below the position of a comet\nis indicated against the Sun and Earth. By means of the Astronomical Unit we can determine the length of its tail.\n\nThe distance between Earth and Sun (SE) is by definition\n1 AU. The orbit of a comet is generally known, we also know the distance between the comet and the Sun (SC).\nFurthermore, it is not too difficult to measure the angles between the Sun and the comet (SEC) and between the Sun and the tip of the tail of the comet (SET).\n\nSuppose one certain day SC = 0.68 AU and the following angles are being measured:\nSEC = 33\u00ba and SET = 48\u00ba. Then we may determine the length of the comet's tail:"}
{"text":"The Milky Way's spiral arms could have cast the Sun far from its birthplace, a new simulation suggests. The results could help explain why stars near the solar system vary widely in their chemical composition.\n\nBut many stars in the Milky Way, including the Sun, still take clean, circular paths around the galactic centre.\n\nNow, a new simulation suggests the Milky Way's arms could actually launch stars thousands of light years from their birthplaces, while still preserving their circular orbits.\n\n\"Our results imply that a star like our Sun could have originated in an entirely different place in the galaxy than where it presently resides,\" says astronomer Rok Ro\u0161kar of the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\nDisappearing arms\n\nRo\u0161kar and colleagues developed a computer simulation that modelled the formation of a spinning galactic disc from a sphere of material, beginning 10 billion years ago. That is when the Milky Way is thought to have undergone its last major merger with another galaxy.\n\nThe team found that the spiral arms seemed to form and disappear over the course of the simulation as the disc grew and its stars shifted position.\n\nDuring that time, many of the stars in the galaxy's disc seemed to undergo 'radial migration,' moving closer or farther away from the galactic centre while still following circular orbits.\n\n\"This seems very surprising at first,\" Ro\u0161kar told New Scientist. \"Typically one would assume that if a star's orbit is perturbed by something like a spiral arm, it would necessarily result in a more elliptical orbit.\"\n\nExtra kick\n\nBut galaxies can accomplish this feat through a process called 'co-rotation resonance'. A star trailing close behind a spiral arm will feel an extra pull from the arm's intense gravity. This will boost the speed of the star, sending it into orbit farther from the galactic centre.\n\nConversely, a star moving in front of an armful of stars will get dragged backwards, prompting it to slow and move closer to the centre of the galaxy.\n\nThis stellar migration could be quite widespread. The authors estimate it might account for the origin of as many as 50% of the stars in the Sun's neighbourhood, which is roughly 26,000 light years from the centre of the Milky Way.\n\n\"It is a nice piece of work,\" says Johannes Andersen of the Niels Bohr Institute for Astronomy, Physics, and Geophysics in Copenhagen, Denmark. But confirming the migration has occurred may be difficult, since \"the mechanism leaves no observable record in the orbits and velocities of stars.\"\n\nShape-shifters\n\nAnalysing the stellar populations in other galaxies could hold some clue. Galaxies form from the inside out, so stars are supposed to be younger the farther away they sit from the centre of a galaxy. But a lot of stellar migration could change that, leaving an altered age distribution of stars.\n\nBut the lynchpin to the case will be whether spiral arms change significantly over time, says Ro\u0161kar.\n\nFor the Sun to have migrated significantly over the course of its lifetime, the spiral arms cannot be static creatures. If they are, stars simply travel a small horseshoe-shaped path in the galaxy, yo-yoing between a close-in position at the trailing edge of an arm and a farther-out spot on the leading edge.\n\nIn the simulation, the galaxy's arms flicker in and out of existence and change their shape. But no one is sure whether the Milky Way arms have a similar history. \"We don't yet know whether spiral arm[s] are transient or not,\" says AndersenSun May Have Been Thrown Far From Its Birthplace\n\nWed Sep 17 04:31:22 BST 2008 by Farshid\n\nSounds tantalizing. But, if our sun was catapulted by the spiral arms of the Milky Way, how could it come all the way and stop precisely at a distance from the earth where it helped the formation of life? I mean, it stoped exactly at a distance where the earth needed it to be?\n\nSun May Have Been Thrown Far From Its Birthplace\n\nWed Sep 17 06:14:24 BST 2008 by Farshid\n\nHi,\n\nNo, I was not kidding. I had a purpose of making the questions (comments). I actually \"reflected\" a common belief among some certain people who believe that the sun was \"placed\" within a distance from the earth to help life form and sustain on it.\n\nThe replies are actually my \"replies\" to those certain people.\n\nNow, really, why the Sun is in such a (lets say) precise distance (not too far not too close from the earth) that it helps life form and sustain on the Earth? Is there any mind behind it?\n\nSun May Have Been Thrown Far From Its Birthplace\n\nWed Sep 17 07:01:21 BST 2008 by Kevin\n\nI think you're suggesting some sort of theory of intelligent design. Nobody ever said evolution was perfect. Our distance from the Sun may not be as determinative as you believe Farshid. There likely wasn't some all seeing and all knowing hand directly at play. Not everything has to happens for a specific purpose. There's a random beauty to the universe. The existance of something as spectacularly 'de trop' as the ostrich wing is only a problem for those who believe in intelligent design.\n\nSun May Have Been Thrown Far From Its Birthplace\n\nWed Sep 17 17:27:28 BST 2008 by Amran\n\nIt seems Farshid your a closet evolutionist..\"to help life form...\"!\n\nnow seriously, the earth is where it is, and regardless of creationist or evolutionary views, it sustains life. There will never be a satisfactory answer because theres no way to prove either position, either that it was intentional or that its there because its there and the only reason we know is because we are here to see it!\n\nSun May Have Been Thrown Far From Its Birthplace\n\nFri Sep 19 01:13:00 BST 2008 by Lol\n\nAh the Earth as nailed down as the center of the universe. And man as existing first and the universe created around him.\n\nYou know not even official religious texts make those claims. Such claims are all derived works of later so-called experts and authorities whose works never get officially included as scripture but nevertheless hang on as popular unofficial traditional dogma. But guess that if you make Pope or Imam your potentially heretical ideas are accepted as desirable truth when it strokes the common ego.\n\nBut the scientist notes that things work out simpler if the Earth appeared where the Sun was and that Man was created\/evolved to fit nicely into an Earth environment that already existed.\n\nWhich incidentally is the order that most religious scripture say things happened too. Man as the final afterthought, if maybe ultimate thought in creation. (You know: separating light from dark - big bang and sun form; creation of land and animal - the earth; and then mankind).\n\nWhy do creationists always run their bible descriptions backward? To say man came first and harassed God into customizing the universe to fit their needs if just blasphemeous - if obviously the way many activists think. (I control God via prayer is actually shamanism and magic -- not modern theology -- even if it fits the western high powered ego better).\n\nSun May Have Been Thrown Far From Its Birthplace\n\nFri Sep 19 12:53:34 BST 2008 by Mike\n\nThe idea that we 'must' be here by divine mandate or design based on the theory that Earth can support life is a logical falicy and rather a non sequiteur. The very fact that were are able to exist and debate the point is due to the fact that Earth is in the 'right place'. If we were elsewhere, Earth would be sterile. Thus, there is a zero chance of our planet being 'wrong' for life, regardless of the existance or not of any divine being.\n\nGiven the size of the universe, conditions right for life on a vast number of planets are inevitable. The chance that it survives numerous mass extinction events and develops is also statistically inevitable, no matter how slim the odds. There is no miracle required.\n\nLet's say that there are 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars, and only one in 100 is the right 'kind'. Now say only one in 10,000 has and Earth-sized planet, and only one in 100 of those has it in the right place. Let's put the chance of life developing and surviving at 1 in a million. Let's be even more brutal and say that it only has a 1 in a million chance of developing into a higher intellegence.\n\nSo that's 1000 planets with higher intellegences... And every single one of them is living on a planet that's 'mysteriously' just right for life to exist! Wooooo... Spooky. Or not.\n\nSun May Have Been Thrown Far From Its Birthplace\n\nWed Sep 17 05:56:17 BST 2008 by Kevin\n\nHow do you know that a similar function hasn't happened thousands of times to thousands of other stars just on our local arm of the Milky Way? There may be millions of stars with planets out there where life evolved and continues to evolve. Like the song says...We are stardust! The existance of every iron atom in your blood proves it. You have to start thinking like the earth isn't the center of the universe and maybe you'll begin understand that the moon isn't made out of cheese however tantalizing that might sound.\n\nSun May Have Been Thrown Far From Its Birthplace\n\nWed Sep 17 06:17:40 BST 2008 by Vod\n\nNo, I think it was random where the sun ended up, and it was a random event that life appeared here.\n\nI do suspect though that the universe is predisposed to favor the evolution of life, that it'll take root wherever conditions favor it, so it might not have really mattered where the sun ended up anyway within possible limits.\n\nNot only that, who knows, have you thought about the possibility that the distance between the Earth and the sun might not actually be as important as you appear to think?\n\nSun May Have Been Thrown Far From Its Birthplace\n\nForgot to type four more words at the end of the last sentence in the last paragraph in my previous post - \"... As important as you appear to think to the presence of life?\"\n\nI think life will find a way to emerge and once it does to survive however it can. I've seen scientists refer to a Goldilocks orbit, a different distance closer or further out from the sun might not have resulted in life, but we have no other sample to compare with.\n\nSun May Have Been Thrown Far From Its Birthplace\n\nWed Sep 17 07:27:34 BST 2008 by Sean\n\nThere is no intelligent design in that.If the earth wasn't the right distance, then life (us) would not have evolved to be able to ask the question.....\n\nPlace water in a hole and it fits exactly the hole. The hole 'seems' made for the water , when it is infact the water that adapted to the hole. If the Water could think , it could presume that the hole had been made for iy by an intelligent being bacuse it is such a good fit. Life on earth is the water in the hole.\n\nSun May Have Been Thrown Far From Its Birthplace\n\nWed Sep 17 09:44:49 BST 2008 by Hayden\n\nI agree. The idea that it is pure luck or some other force that has made the conditions on earth so suitable for life is somewhat misguided. It is rather more likely that these were the conditions and millions of years of evolution has made us suitable to the conditions, not the other way round\n\nSun May Have Been Thrown Far From Its Birthplace\n\nWed Sep 17 11:26:00 BST 2008 by Horatio\n\nI think you've misunderstood the article - the Earth wasn't sitting here in space alone, and then the Sun got fired toward it. If the Sun was sent on one of these wild orbits, the Earth would travel with it. Or, if this happened very early on in the Sun's lifetime, the cloud of gas and dust surrounding the sun would have travelled with it and the Earth coalesced from that.\n\nNever forget that as we sit here, the Sun is travelling through space and a very fast rate, as the galaxy rotates. But the galaxy is also travelling through space at a terrific speed. As the Earth is gravitationally bound to the Sun, we travel with it. So your question isn't really applicable.\n\nSun May Have Been Thrown Far From Its Birthplace\n\nSun May Have Been Thrown Far From Its Birthplace\n\nFri Sep 19 01:21:17 BST 2008 by Doomsday\n\nThere is no strong case for saying that this current location in the spiral arms is especially necessary or supportive of life and humankind.\n\nThere has been some speculation that maybe the mixture of supernova dust might be significant. But no one has collected any material or data here at this arm location or others that show specific differences. There have been no experiments for connections positive or negative.\n\nWe do know that a position far in toward the center of the galaxy would probably be bad in terms of excessive radiation from close packed stars and the galactic black hole. But arm theories do not say much about returning or originating all the way into the center.\n\nIt Means Soon, Not Now\n\nFri Sep 19 15:06:17 BST 2008 by Richie\n\nWhy do so many smart people misuse the word \"presently\"?\n\nThe grammatical neurological circuits maintain the tendency to abide by rules. In English this includes the rule that adverbs are the proper form to modify verbs, and since \"resides\" is a verb, I suppose \"presently\" came to the writer's mind instead of \"now\" or the more awkward \"in the present.\""}

A Young Star Flaunts its X-ray Spots in McNeil's Nebula\n\nBy Rochester Institute of Technology07\/03\/2012 08:15:00\n\nFont size:\n\nRIT astronomers on team announcing the rapidly spinning protostar\n\nX-ray observations have revealed something curious about the young star that illuminates McNeil's Nebula, a glowing jewel of cosmic dust in the Orion constellation: The object is a protostar rotating once a day, or 30 times faster than the sun. The stellar baby also has distinct birthmarks\u2014two X-ray-emitting spots, where gas flows from a surrounding disk, fueling the infant star.\n\nThe young star, V1647 Orionis, first made news in early 2004, when it erupted and lit up McNeil's Nebula, located 1,300 light years away in a region of active star formation within the constellation of Orion. The initial outburst died down in early 2006, but then V1647 Ori erupted again in 2008, and has since remained bright.\n\nMore recently, astronomers combined 11 observations of V1647 Ori from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Japan-led Suzaku satellite, and the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton to determine the source of the high-energy emission. The team began monitoring the star shortly after its eruption in 2004 and continued to keep watch through 2010, a period covering both eruptions.\n\nStrong similarities among X-ray light curves captured over this six-year period allowed the lead author on the study, Kenji Hamaguchi, astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, to identify cyclic X-ray variations. Hamaguchi and the rest of the team determined the star is rotating once per day, making V1647 among the youngest stars whose spin has been determined using an X-ray-based technique. Results from the study will appear in the paper \"X-raying the Beating Heart of a Newborn Star: Rotational Modulation of High-energy Radiation from V1647 Ori,\" in the July 20 issue of The Astrophysical Journal.\n\n\"The observations give us a look inside the cradle at a very young star,\" says co-author Joel Kastner, a professor of imaging science and astronomical sciences and technology at Rochester Institute of Technology. \"It's as though we're able to see its beating heart. We're actually able to watch it rotate. We caught the star at a point where it is rotating so fast as it gains material that it's barely able to hold itself together. It's rotating at near break-up speed.\"\n\nThe team identified V1647 Ori as a protostar in formation. \"Based on infrared studies, we suspect that this protostar is no more than a million years old, and probably much younger,\" Hamaguchi says."}
{"text":"The first public data release from BOSS, the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey\n\nAug 08, 2012 Credit: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Sloan Digital Sky Survey III\"This is just the first of three data releases from BOSS,\" says David Schlegel of the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), an astrophysicist in the Lab's Physics Division and BOSS's principal investigator. \"By the time BOSS is complete, we will have surveyed more of the sky, out to a distance twice as deep, for a volume more than five times greater than SDSS has surveyed before \u2013 a larger volume of the universe than all previous spectroscopic surveys combined.\"\n\nSpectroscopy yields a wealth of information about astronomical objects including their motion (called redshift and written \"z\"), their composition, and sometimes also the density of the gas and other material that lies between them and observers on Earth. The BOSS spectra are now freely available at  to a public that includes amateur astronomers, astronomy professionals who are not members of the SDSS-III collaboration, and high-school science teachers and their students.\n\nThe new release lists spectra for galaxies with redshifts up to z = 0.8 (roughly 7 billion light years away) and quasars with redshifts between z = 2.1 and 3.5 (from 10 to 11.5 billion light years away). When BOSS is complete it will have measured 1.5 million galaxies and at least 150,000 quasars, as well as many thousands of stars and other \"ancillary\" objects for scientific projects other than BOSS's main goal.\n\nThe key to the history of the universe\n\nBOSS is designed to measure baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), the large-scale clustering of matter in the universe. BAO began as rippling fluctuations (\"sound waves\") in the hot, dense soup of matter and radiation that made up the early universe. As the universe expanded it cooled. Finally atoms formed and radiation went its own way; the density ripples left their marks as temperature variations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), where they can be detected today.\n\nThe CMB came into being 380,000 years after the big bang, over 13.6 billion years ago, and continues to stretch across the entire sky as the universe expands. Peaks in CMB temperature variation occur about half a billion light years apart, at the same angle, viewed from Earth, as peaks in the large-scale galactic structure that evolved billions of years later. The regions of higher density in the CMB were in fact the sources of galaxy formation; they correspond to regions where galaxies cluster, along with intergalactic gas and concentrations of much more massive underlying dark matter. The natural \"standard ruler\" marking peaks in clustering can be applied not only across the sky but in all three dimensions, backward in time to the CMB.\n\nDistant quasars provide another way of measuring BAO and the distribution of matter in the universe. Quasars are the brightest objects in the distant universe, whose spectra bristle with individually shifted absorption lines, a \"Lyman-alpha forest\" unique to each that reveals the clumping of intergalactic gas and underlying dark matter between the quasar and Earth.\n\nMarks on the cosmic ruler\n\nSchlegel has called BAO \"an inconveniently sized ruler,\" requiring \"a huge volume of the universe just to fit the ruler inside,\" but it's a precision tool for tracking the universe's expansion history, and for probing the nature of gravity and the mysterious dark energy that's causing expansion to accelerate.\n\nTo fill the huge volume, BOSS had to find more and fainter objects in the sky at greater distances than SDSS had attempted before. The camera system and spectrographs of the 2.5-meter Sloan Foundation Telescope at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico had to be completely rebuilt.\n\nSDSS uses \"plug plates\" at the telescope's focal plane, aluminum disks with holes drilled to match the precise position of previously imaged target objects. SDSS-I and II plug plates had only 640 holes apiece, each covering three arcseconds; BOSS is using 2,000 plug plates with 1,000 holes apiece, each covering a tight two arcseconds to reduce light that's not from the target.\n\nOptical fibers are plugged into the holes every day by hand, to guide the light from each target to a spectrograph. While weather conditions vary night to night, observations on the best nights use up to nine plug plates. For BOSS, the spectrographs were rebuilt with new optics and new CCD detectors designed and fabricated at Berkeley Lab.\n\n\"Light from distant galaxies arrives at Earth redshifted into the infrared,\" says Natalie Roe, director of Berkeley Lab's Physics Division and BOSS's instrument scientist, who led construction of the spectrographs. \"We optimized the BOSS spectrographs for mapping exactly these galaxies.\"\n\nWorking with Schlegel and Adam Bolton at the University of Utah, Berkeley Lab's Stephen Bailey is in charge of daily \"extraction pipeline\" operations that convert raw data from the telescope into useful spectra and quantities derived from them, ready for scientific analysis. Data storage and the extraction pipeline run on the Riemann Linux cluster of Berkeley Lab's High-Performance Computing Services Group; the data is copied from Riemann to the University of Utah, New York University, Johns Hopkins University, and the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) at Berkeley Lab. The Lab also hosts the SDSS-III website,  from which the data can be downloaded.\n\n\"Data releases are a proud tradition for SDSS, and the first BOSS data greatly increase the SDSS store of information,\" Bailey says. \"Members of the SDSS-III collaboration get first crack at it \u2013 with barely enough time to write up their results \u2013 but three times as many papers based on the data are published by scientists outside the collaboration.\"\n\nSays Schlegel, \"SDSS-III is already the most used of all surveys from any telescope in the world, including the Keck telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope. With DR9, BOSS contributes a huge information increase for all kinds of scientific investigations, from quasars to how stars evolve to really odd objects like galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses. Meanwhile the BOSS BAO survey is over two-thirds finished, and ahead of schedule \u2013 we're well on our way to the best measure of BAO that will be made for a long time. All the data BOSS collects will be available to anyone who can use it.\"\n\nMore information: \"The Ninth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: First Spectroscopic Data from the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey,\" by Christopher Ahn et al, has been submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Supplement and may be found on the arXiv preprint server at arxiv.org\/abs\/1207.7137.\n\n\"The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey of SDSS-III,\" by Kyle Dawson, David Schlegel et al, has been submitted to the Astronomical Journal and may be found on the arXiv preprint server at arxiv.org\/abs\/1208.0022.\n\n\"Spectral Classification and Redshift Measurement for the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey,\" by Adam Bolton et al, has been submitted to the Astronomical Journal and may be found on the arXiv preprint server at arxiv.org\/abs\/1207.7326\n\nRelated(PhysOrg.com) -- The distant past of the universe is moving closer.

{"text":"Most Distant Water in the Universe Found\n\nDec 17, 2008\n\nThe spectrum -- a radio \"fingerprint\" that revealed radio emission from water masers in the distant quasar MG J0414+0534. The background image is an infrared image of the quasar, made with the Hubble Space Telescope. The quasar appears broken up into four components by a foreground galaxy (diffuse object in the center), acting as a gravitational lens and strengthening the signal by a factor of 35. The inset with the galaxy M87 shows how the quasar might be seen from nearby. Image: Milde Science Communication, STScI, CFHT, J.-C. Cuillandre, Coelum.\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Astronomers have found the most distant water yet seen in the Universe, in a galaxy more than 11 billion light-years from Earth. Previously, the most distant water had been seen in a galaxy less than 7 billion light-years from Earth.\n\nUsing the giant, 100-meter-diameter radio telescope in Effelsberg, Germany, and the National Science Foundation's Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico, the scientists detected a telltale radio \"fingerprint\" of water molecules in the distant galaxy.\n\nThe soggy galaxy, dubbed MG J0414+0534, harbors a quasar -- a supermassive black hole powering bright emission -- at its core. In the region near the core, the water molecules are acting as masers, the radio equivalent of lasers, to amplify radio waves at a specific frequency.\n\nThe astronomers say their discovery indicates that such giant water masers were more common in the early Universe than they are today. MG J0414+0534 is seen as it was when the Universe was roughly one-sixth of its current age.\n\nAt the galaxy's great distance, even the strengthening of the radio waves done by the masers would not by itself have made them strong enough to detect with the radio telescopes. However, the scientists got help from nature in the form of another galaxy, nearly 8 billion light-years away, located directly in the line of sight from MG J0414+0534 to Earth. That foreground galaxy's gravity served as a lens to further brighten the more-distant galaxy and make the emission from the water molecules visible to the radio telescopes.\n\n\"We were only able to discover this distant water with the help of the gravitational lens,\" said Violette Impellizzeri, an astronomer with the Max-Planck Institute for Radioastronomy (MPIfR) in Bonn, Germany. \"This cosmic telescope reduced the amount of time needed to detect the water by a factor of about 1,000,\" she added.\n\nThe astronomers first detected the water signal with the Effelsberg telescope. They then turned to the VLA's sharper imaging capability to confirm that it was indeed coming from the distant galaxy. The gravitational lens produces not one, but four images of MG J0414+0534 as seen from Earth. Using the VLA, the scientists found the specific frequency attributable to the water masers in the two brightest of the four lensed images. The other two lensed images, they said, are too faint for detecting the water signal.\n\nThe radio frequency emitted by the water molecules was Doppler shifted by the expansion of the Universe from 22.2 GHz to 6.1 GHz.\n\nWater masers have been found in numerous galaxies at closer distances. Typically, they are thought to arise in disks of molecules closely orbiting a supermassive black hole at the galaxy's core. The amplified radio emission is more often observed when the orbiting disk is seen nearly edge-on. However, the astronomers said MG J0414+0534 is oriented with the disk almost face-on as seen from Earth.\n\n\"This may mean that the water molecules in the masers we're seeing are not in the disk, but in the superfast jets of material being ejected by the gravitational power of the black hole,\" explained John McKean, also of MPIfR.\n\nImpellizzeri and McKean worked with Alan Roy, Christian Henkel, and Andreas Brunthaler, also of the Max-Planck Institute; Paola Castangia of the Max-Planck Institute and the INAF Astronomical Observatory of Cagliari in Italy; and Olaf Wucknitz of the Argelander Institute for Astronomy in Bonn, Germany. The scientists reported their results in the December 18 issue of the scientific journal Nature.\n\nRelated StoriesA team of physicists from Russia's Institute of Applied Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences, has built an exceptionally sensitive spectrometer that they claim, is the first to measure waterI agree that it could be something else. Although water consists of two OH-bonds and it is the general way to identify water (even here on earth) the possibility exists that it could be something else. That would show also in the spectrum recorded though, but still the possibility exist.\n\nWhat worries me more is the height of the peak in the spectrum. If I approach it the statistical way, the height needs to be approx. 4 times the noise in order to be significant. So, can this signal be trusted?\n\nThe astronomers say their discovery indicates that such giant water masers were more common in the early Universe than they are today. MG J0414 0534 is seen as it was when the Universe was roughly one-sixth of its current age.\n\nNot a bad guess since this is the furthest galaxy that they have found with water molecules. I love the way we can infer such things from a sample of one. It makes all crackpot theories about everything much more likely"}

Thousands of these \"time bombs\" could be scattered throughout our Galaxy.\n\n\"We haven't found one of these 'time bomb' stars yet in the Milky Way, but this research suggests that we've been looking for the wrong signs. Our work points to a new way of searching for supernova precursors,\" said astrophysicist Rosanne Di Stefano of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA).\n\nThe specific type of stellar explosion Di Stefano and her colleagues studied is called a Type Ia supernova. It occurs when an old, compact star known as a white dwarf destabilizes.\n\nA white dwarf is a stellar remnant that has ceased nuclear fusion. It typically can weigh up to 1.4 times as much as our Sun - a figure called the Chandrasekhar mass after the astronomer who first calculated it. Any heavier, and gravity overwhelms the forces supporting the white dwarf, compacting it and igniting runaway nuclear fusion that blows the star apart.\n\nThere are two possible ways for a white dwarf to exceed the Chandrasekhar mass and explode as a Type Ia supernova. It can accrete gas from a donor star, or two white dwarfs can collide. Most astronomers favor the first scenario as the more likely explanation. But we would expect to see certain signs if the theory is correct, and we don't for most Type Ia supernovae."}

{"text":"Dark energy 'imaged' in best detail yet\n\nSome had hoped it might be just an illusion. But it looks like dark energy is real and here to stay, as astronomers \"image\" the mysterious entity in action.\n\nIn 1998, astronomers found that distant supernovae were dimmer, and thus farther away, than expected. This suggested that the expansion of the universe is accelerating - and \"dark energy\" was named as the culprit.\n\nTo find an independent check on the existence of dark energy, Istv\u00e1n Szapudi at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, US, and colleagues turned to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) - relic radiation from the big bang. Detailed maps of the CMB show hot and cold spots that reflect variations in the density of the early universe.\n\nWhen dark energy was proposed, astronomers realised that it should create additional temperature bumps on the map.\n\nThis extra dark energy effect is generated because the temperature of a photon zipping across the universe can be changed depending on whether it has passed through a region of dense matter or a sparser region.\n\nShallow well\n\nA photon gains energy when it enters a dense region with enhanced gravity - such as a galaxy cluster - as though it is falling into a well. When it leaves the cluster and climbs back out of the gravitational well, it loses energy.\n\nIn a universe without dark energy, the energy gained and lost during the crossing would be equal and would cancel out. But in the presence of dark energy, the universe expands quickly enough to stretch the gravitational well while the photon is still inside. This makes the well shallower and easier for the photon to climb out.\n\nThat means that a photon travelling through a cluster gains more energy than it loses, giving it a little energy kick so that it creates a hotter spot than would be expected on images of the CMB. Similarly, a photon that has passed through a void would leave a cold spot.\n\nIt's tough to detect this effect because dark energy gives only a slight nudge to the temperature, which is easily swamped by the normal temperature variations seen in the CMB, says Szapudi.\n\nExtreme density\n\nTo get around this, his team looked at regions of extremely high and extremely low density, where you would expect to see the biggest effect.\n\nOther teams have reported signs of this effect in the past, but those have been open to alternative explanations, says Szapudi. By contrast, his calculations suggest that there is less than a 1 in 200,000 chance that the match up his team saw is down to anything other than dark energy.\n\n\"We have shown the imprint on the CMB of dark energy at work,\" says Szapudi. \"In this sense, we have imaged dark energy.\"\n\nThe finding should rule out any notion that dark energy is an illusion, he says. \"We've really attacked the dark energy question in a different way from supernovae measurements. It's difficult to argue that an illusion could be responsible for this effect.\"\n\nWarped space\n\nThomas Buchert at the University of Lyon in France, one of the physicists who suggested that dark energy may be an illusion, is impressed by the thoroughness of Szapudi's work. \"People have discussed this effect, but this is the first really clear-cut signal,\" he says.\n\nHowever, Buchert is not ready to abandon alternatives to dark energy just yet. He points out that a similar effect might be produced if space-time is significantly warped around the voids and clusters - something that isn't usually considered in standard calculations.\n\nHe also notes that Szapudi's team observed a temperature effect that was stronger than expected from dark energy. \"This could be a hint that there may be something else happening here that's worth investigatingTime Dilation\n\nSat May 24 06:06:30 BST 2008 by Charles\n\nIsn't this the same effect that is predicted by David Wiltshire? I.e. That time dilation caused by the mass distribution in clusters and voids will change the CMB photon energies and give the illusion of dark energy?\n\nUnless they can be distinguished, surely we should use Occam's razor and assume the explanation which postulates the least unknowns, i.e. Wiltshire's version, until more evidence comes in.\n\nDark Energy 'imaged' In Best Detail Yet\n\nSat May 24 17:14:52 BST 2008 by William Curry\n\nAstronomers have struggled to explain what dark energy actually is, and then explain that it should create additional temperature bumps on the map of the cosmic microwave background.

The fact that this debate still rages on PROVES without a doubt that a distracting, aimless agenda is at hand to keep us all dumb.\n\nSupervoids of empty space (blue) and superclusters of galaxies (red) were slightly cooler or warmer, respectively, than expected in maps of the cosmic microwave background because of dark energy (Illustration: Granett\/Neyrinck\/Szapudi\/NASA\/SDSS)"}
{"text":"Black Dwarfs\n\nSirius and Procyon are two of the brightest and closest stars in the night sky. And by coincidence, they both have faint companions. These companion stars are destined to become black dwarfs -- stars that have faded to invisibility.\n\nToday, the companions to Sirius and Procyon are classified as white dwarfs. They're only about as big as Earth, but they still shine because they're very hot.\n\nThis heat is left over from the white dwarf's earlier life, when it shone as the Sun does -- by generating energy from nuclear reactions in its core. But the star ran out of fuel and cast its outer layers into space. All that remains today is the dead core -- a star so dense that a spoonful weighs more than a ton.\n\nAs white dwarfs shine their meager light into space, they cool, so they fade even more. Countless trillions of years from now, the stars will have faded completely, so they'll be black dwarfs.\n\nRight now, though, there's not a single black dwarf anywhere in the universe. That's because the universe isn't old enough for any white dwarfs to have had enough time to cool and fade away. Come back in the far-distant future, though, and the white dwarfs around Sirius and Procyon will have faded to black.\n\nLook for Sirius well up in the southeast in early evening. It's the brightest star in the night sky. Procyon is far to its left, and a little higher.

{"text":"Iron in the Fire: The Little-Star Supernovae That Could\n\nIRON CURTAIN If you had lived south of the equator four centuries ago, you might have seen a white dwarf explode in the Large Magellanic Cloud; the blast forged iron and created this expanding bubble, which is now about 23 light-years across.Image: NASA, ESA, and the Hubble Heritage Team (STScI\/AURA); acknowledgment: J. Hughes (Rutgers U.)\n\nAlthough stars other than our sun are light-years away, their gifts are all around us: the oxygen we breathe, the calcium in our bones, the iron in our blood. High-mass stars have been especially generous. During their short lives, they cook up such elements as oxygen and magnesium and eject them into space via supernova explosions; the blasts themselves forge still heavier elements, such as gold and platinum. About 80 percent of the Milky Way's supernovae arise from large stars, so their by-products are everywhere\u2014from the magnesium in chocolate to the gold at Fort Knox.\n\nIn contrast, supernovae from small stars are element-creating underdogs. Named type Ia, these supernovae occur when a white dwarf\u2014a dense star smaller in diameter than Earth\u2014accretes too much material from a companion star and gains a mass of at least 1.4 suns. The resulting explosion spews heavy elements into space. These \"little-star\" supernovae do excel at producing one vital element, iron; they have created roughly two thirds of the iron in Earth's core and in your blood. Despite that important accomplishment, though, small-star supernovae have left a lesser mark on the world. The same pattern appears in the heavens, where elements generated by large-star explosions overwhelm those from their smaller and rarer brethren.\n\nBut now a surprising exception has turned up: in NGC 1718, a two-billion-year-old cluster of about 100,000 stars located in the Large Magellanic Cloud\u2014the Milky Way's brightest satellite galaxy, around 160,000 light-years from Earth. \"NGC 1718 has very unusual chemical abundances,\" says Takuji Tsujimoto, an astronomer at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. \"It has chemical abundances equivalent to type Ia supernovae.\"\n\nThe key clues are magnesium and iron. Magnesium nuclei originate in high-mass stars and normally outnumber iron nuclei, the latter a product of both types of supernovae. But new observations by astronomer Janet Colucci of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and her colleagues reveal that the odd star cluster has far more iron than magnesium. Its iron-to-magnesium ratio is eight times the solar value.\n\nWhat happened in NGC 1718? The odd chemistry \"means that the formation history of this cluster should be quite different from other clusters,\" says Kenji Bekki, an astronomer at the University of Western Australia. He and Tsujimoto propose in The Astrophysical Journal Letters that it takes a virtual village of exploding white dwarfs to endow an entire cluster of 100,000 stars with such high iron-to-magnesium ratios.\n\nIt also takes another galaxy: The Large Magellanic Cloud has its own satellite\u2014the Small Magellanic Cloud\u2014which dances around its mate on an elliptical orbit, sometimes coming close, other times veering away.\n\nTo explain NGC 1718, Tsujimoto and Bekki propose that the drama actually started with another star cluster, whose high-mass stars exploded and catapulted gas out of part of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Then the Small Magellanic Cloud swung by, dumping its gas into the hole left by the exploding stars. This gas was magnesium- and iron-poor, because the smaller of the two galaxies has fewer stars to create these elements. Then white dwarfs in the same cluster that had blasted the hole began to detonate, enriching the infalling gas with their iron but little magnesium"}

{"text":"Black Holes Can Switch Between Gears\n\nSRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research astronomers argue in a new study that black holes can switch between gears just like a car does, depending on the rates at which it converts matter falling through the event horizon into energy emanating from its poles.\n\nThe fact that accretion disks around the Universe's most massive black holes channel matter through their event horizon is no secret, but very few people know that black holes also produce stuff. They release very strong radiation jets in plumes from their poles. The phenomenon puzzles researchers.\n\nIn effect, these structures appear to be acting like very large matter converters. Granted, not all matter is turned into radiation and energy, since some of the material falling through the event horizon goes on to fuel the black holes itself, allowing it to grow.\n\nOver the years, astronomers were puzzled to observe that not all black holes were conducting this conversion process in the same manner. The SRON team set out to investigate why that was.\n\nResearchers studied two black holes, and noticed how the objects can switch between two conversion regimes, essentially changing gears in terms of activity. Details of the work will appear in two upcoming papers, to be published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\n\"We found that these two black holes could also 'change gear', demonstrating that this is not an exceptional property of one peculiar black hole. Our work suggests that changing gear might be common among black holes,\" SRON PhD student Eva Ratti explains.\n\n\"We also found that the switch between gears happens at a similar X-ray luminosity for all the three black holes,\" adds the expert, who led the work with expert and study team leader, Peter Jonker.\n\nThe group used the NASA Chandra X-ray Observatory for this job. The observations were augmented with data from the Expanded Very Large Array, in New Mexico. These telescopes were critical for the success of the study.\n\nDue to their intense gravitational pull, black holes consume even light, which means that astronomers will never be able to study them directly. However, studying radiation given off by their accretion disks and light plumes can reveal important data on their activity."}
{"text":"Gamma rays are the most energetic kind of light we know. Light comes in many different forms, from low-energy radio waves and microwaves that we use to talk on our phones and cook our food, to higher energy visible light that let us see a beautiful painting and spot a fly ball against a cloudy sky, to even higher energy x-rays that the dentist uses to peer inside our teeth. For pure energy, gamma rays beat them all.\n\nOn April 27, the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope and the Swift Telescope recorded a burst of gamma rays from a target 3.6 billion light years away. The burst was so powerful that it released more energy in a few seconds than our Sun will produce in ten billion years! Anyone near such a burst would be fried instantly \u2013 fortunately the light years between it and us protected us from that fate.\n\nWhat might cause such an enormous outpouring of energy? This is still a great mystery, but scientists believe gamma ray bursts are just one step in the process of a stellar explosion called a supernova. As an aging star uses up its fuel in a process called nuclear fusion, the weakening outward push of the star's light begins to lose a battle with gravity. The star's own enormous weight begins to crush its center into a black hole. As matter from the star falls toward the black hole, it is super-heated and emits an intense beam of gamma rays. These gamma rays fly away from the star's North and South poles and out into space.\n\nBut that's just the beginning. As the star continues its internal collapse, a rebound occurs (see the activity below*) and some of the star's outer material flies away in a giant explosion called a supernova. This supernova is so bright it can outshine an entire galaxy for a short time. It is this supernova that scientists hope to see next. If they do see a supernova in the same part of the sky, it will confirm that we do, indeed, understand a little bit about the details of how stars die.\n\nBut why should we care? What difference does it make that a star blew itself up so long ago and so far away? Look at your hand. Just below your skin flows a river of life-giving blood. At the heart of every blood cell is a molecule called hemoglobin, carrying oxygen to each of your cells. And at the heart of each hemoglobin molecule is a single atom of iron. That iron atom has not been around forever, but instead was born in a supernova explosion that itself occurred billions of years ago. Stars are the places that iron, carbon, oxygen, and almost all other elements are forged, and it is in supernovas that those elements are scattered throughout the universe. We are made of starstuff.\n\nKeep watching this blog for updates on the story; will the expected supernova show up? What will it teach us about the universe? Science is always moving forward; we are always learning more. What will we discover next?\n\n*You can recreate your own supernova explosion with nothing more than a tennis ball and a basketball. Hold the two balls apart from each other, the same height from the floor. When you drop them at the same moment, they hit the ground together. This shows that each falls at the same rate. Yet the basketball, being heavier, has much more momentum.\n\nNow stack the tennis ball on top of the basketball. Drop them again (be careful to keep the tennis ball right on top, or it may come back and hit you!). This time, the tennis ball goes flying skyward with surprising speed. This is like what happens in a supernova explosion, as the outer parts of the star collapse and bounce off the dense inner surface of the collapsing star. You just created a supernova1) The Earth isn't roundMaybe a better challenge, though, comes from Mt. Chimborazo in Peru. This mountain is shorter than Everest by almost 10,000 feet, but because it is on the Earth's equatorial bulge (see #1 above), the top of Mt. Chimborazo is actually over six thousand feet further from the Earth's center than the top of Everest. So if you start measuring from the center of the Earth, you'd find that the farthest point that is still on land isn't Everest, it's the top of Mt. Chimborazo.\n\n3) The oceans are really . . .\n\nHow deep are the oceans? Try this: get an ordinary piece of 8 \u00bd by 11 paper. Draw a map of the Pacific Ocean on the paper. Put Japan on the left side and California on the right. Now imagine the water in between. In order to create a scale model of the Pacific Ocean, how far below the paper would the water have to dip? Five inches? Ten? In fact, on this scale the depth of the Pacific Ocean is the thickness of the paper itself!\n\nWhen considered this way, the ocean waters (which are \"only\" a few miles deep in most places) barely cover the ocean floor, almost like puddles on a sidewalk after the rain. Our planet's oceans are much, much wider than they are deep.\n\n4) The Earth is fast!\n\nThe fastest humans ever were the astronauts on the Apollo missions. They traveled at speeds of up to 24,791 mph on the way back from the Moon. But that speed is in relation to the Earth, and we know the Earth itself is always moving around the Sun. How fast is the Earth's motion? Get ready \u2013 over 66,000 mph! So in that sense every one of us, every second of every day, is moving faster than the fastest of the Apollo astronauts. Don't even get me started on how fast the Sun is moving around the center of the galaxy, or how fast the galaxy . . . well, you get the point. We're moving fast!\n\n5) Everything is recycled\n\nWhile we occasionally receive visitors from space, most of the Earth's matter has been here for a very, very long time. In fact, in your body right now are molecules of water that once passed through the bladder of Aristotle, Joan of Arc, and even Fabio! Water (like many other materials) circulates around and around our planet, finding new uses again and again. This is because atoms (which make up everything) are very small. In fact, there are far more atoms in a single glass of water than there are glasses of water in all the oceans of the world. The Earth itself is the original recycler!\n\n6) Speaking of atoms in water\n\nDid you know that the oceans of the world contain around 20 million tons of gold? Of course, no one knows how to extract all that gold from seawater in a way that makes doing so worthwhile. The gold in the ocean is so dilute that only about one part in a trillion (that's 1\/ 1,000,000,000,000th) of seawater is gold. For now, the gold will stay there. But just imagine . . .\n\n7) People are amazing\n\nOf all the incredible facts about our planet, the most amazing is probably this: our planet is home to a creature that can know and understand the world, and can use that understanding to make a difference. As far as we know, Earth is the only planet where matter has come to life, and has grown up to understand its world and itself. We are the eyes, ears, and consciousness of the Earth, and that's pretty spectacular. Happy Earth Day, everyone!\n\nAuthor\n\n]]>Mon, 22 Apr 2013 09:55:38 -0400For Carl: Three New Worlds in the Cosmos\n Carl: Three New Worlds in the CosmosWhen Cosmos aired, no one knew if even a single planet existed outside our Sun's little family. Could we be the only planetary system in the galaxy, or even the universe? Or were planets common, with many other stars sporting their own planetary systems? Might any other planets even support life? No one knew.\n\nBut Sagan knew that scientists would one day find out. He said to those students \u2013 and to me, \"By the time you are as old as I am now (Sagan was 45 at the time \u2013 coincidentally, just my age today), we should know for all the nearest stars whether they have planets . . . That will happen in your lifetime, and it will be the first time in the history of the world that anybody found out, really, if there are planets around other stars.\"\n\nCarl Sagan died in 1996, a time when we were just uncovering the first tantalizing hints of extra-solar planets. But Sagan's prediction was right on the money. Today, we know of hundreds of other planets. Most of them (because they're the easiest to find) are gas giants like Jupiter and larger, with no solid surface. And most of these are in tight orbits around their star, with soaring temperatures and little if any chance for our kind of life. But this week NASA announced the discovery of three planets nearly the size of Earth, in orbits nearly like our planet's orbit. It's the closest we've come yet to finding another Earth in the heavens.\n\nHow did we find these worlds?\n\n... the ways by which men arrive at knowledge of the celestial things are hardly less wonderful than the nature of these things themselves \u2014 Johannes Kepler\n\nOK, if you can get past the sexism in the quote above, you'll recognize one of the great truths about science, a truth that Sagan celebrated again and again in Cosmos. Yes, what we discover is wonderful, but at least as wonderful are the methods by which we tiny humans, armed with nothing but cleverness, imagination, and the tools we create, learn about our world.\n\nThe Kepler telescope (named after the same Johannes Kepler quoted above) is one of those amazing human-created tools. In orbit around the Earth, Kepler stares at one particular patch of sky without pause. Hold your hand out at arm's length. This is just about the size of the sky Kepler is watching. Within that patch, Kepler keeps track of the light from 100,000 stars, all at the same time.\n\nWhen one of those stars gets dimmer, by even a fraction of a percent, Kepler records the event. The dimming might be caused by a spot on the star or some other local phenomenon. Or it might be caused by a planet passing between Kepler and the star. If, sometime later, Kepler sees the same kind of dimming again, the odds that Kepler has found a planet grow greater. After three or even four such cycles, Kepler's scientists know they've spotted a planet.\n\nThis kind of science requires incredible patience. If a planet is in an Earth-like orbit, it will take around one Earth year to go around its star, so we'll see the dimming of its star only once every few hundred days. Kepler needs to remember each dimming event and then, a hundred days, or two hundred, or five hundred days later, catch that same event again, all the while watching and recording 100,000 other stars in the same way. It's a task a human could never accomplish alone. But with our amazing ability to mold and shape the raw materials of the world into useful tools, we can make visible that which had remained hidden since the cosmos was born.\n\nThese planets are for you, Carl. I wish you could've been around to see them. The device is a wearable robot that consists of a motorized frame and computer, which will be used to help paraplegics with upright mobility. It always amazes me how medical technology continues to help so many lives around the world!Here's what I found out from Steve:\n\nIt all comes down to one idea: the world is made of atoms. Atoms in air combine together to form molecules, mostly nitrogen molecules (made of two nitrogen atoms) and oxygen molecules (made of two oxygen atoms). When these molecules are warm, they move quickly and bounce off one another. When they're cooler, they slow down and don't bounce as much.\n\nIn colder air, then, the molecules can get closer together while in warmer air they're further apart. The more molecules, the heavier the air, so cold air is heavier than warm air. When cold air and warm air meet, the cold air pushes under the warm air, sending the warm air higher.\n\nAir isn't much good at absorbing heat from the Sun; instead, it gains heat from the ground. So when you push warm air up, it cools (think about the tops of mountains - it's cold up there!) As the warm air cools, water vapor turns to drops of liquid water, forming clouds. If the drops are big enough, they fall from the cloud as rain or (if the cold air below is cold enough) flakes of snow.\n\nOne more thing: all that moving air creates lots of static electricity. Think of rubbing a balloon on your head, or getting clothes from the dryer. That static buildup can result in a discharge - a spark - that also makes a sound. The spark we call lightning and the sound we call thunder.\n\nEverything I've described so far applies to thunderstorms such as we often get in the spring and summer. There's so much heat energy available at these times that air masses can move all over the country, colliding, pushing on one another, and creating storms. In the winter, generally everything is pretty cold, so there's not much energy available to create big air movements. But every once in a while, there's enough energy available to create a powerful snowstorm that includes thunder and lightning.\n\nOne interesting fact, and another reason that thundersnow is so rare, is that the falling snow actually muffles the thunder. While thunder from a rainstorm can be heard many miles away, thunder generated in a snowstorm is often only audible up to two or three miles from the source. This means that even if you are near a rare thundersnow, you may never know it because the snow deadens the sound.\n\nThat is so cool! I love that when I have a science question I can ask the experts right here in the place that I work. Thanks, Steve, for enlightening me. I can't wait to bring this up next time I'm having dinner with friends!The static on the screen is the same static you'll hear between radio stations. Now reach out and put your hand on the screen.\n\nAround one out of every one hundred of those little bursts impacting your hand is caused by a bit of light left over from the Big Bang, the event that began our universe nearly fourteen billion years ago. When you touch that screen, you are touching the Big Bang itself.\n\nWhat does this have to do with modern experiments? On March 21, 2013 the Planck telescope released a much better picture of that same light.\n\nIn fact, this is the most detailed picture ever taken of the \"Cosmic Background Radiation\". It reveals the moment when light was first able to move through our universe. Within the tiny squiggles and bumps in this picture, we see nothing less than the origins of ourselves. The fluctuations in this radiation directed the formation of stars and galaxies. Within the images returned by the Planck telescope, we are truly seeing our own beginnings. We are, in a sense, watching the Big Bang unfold before our eyes.\n\nResearchers with the Planck telescope hope to use this image to gain a better understanding of how and why our universe began. The light waves* that formed this image are the same ones making one percent of that static on your screen. So don't tell me there's nothing on television. You can always watch the Big Bang!\n\n*also known as microwaves, a kind of light that our eyes can't see \u2013 but that's great for popping corn!\n\nAuthor\n\n]]>Fri, 22 Mar 2013 18:29:14 -0400The REAL First Day of Spring\n REAL First Day of SpringTo answer these questions, we have to go back to the REAL first day of spring, or at least the first spring we would recognize as such. We have to go back around four and a half billion years to our planet's early history, a time when we orbited our Sun without a companion, lonely and alone.\n\nThe Earth was a different world then, glowing hot and battered by collisions with asteroids, comets, and all manner of rocky and icy junk flying about the early solar system. A huge asteroid would careen into our planet and a molten pool of rock would form all around the wound, then slowly cool until the next collision occurred. It was a hot, hellish, unrecognizable world. Yet it was the world that would become our home.\n\nOne day on this hot and unfamiliar planet, something deeply profound and nearly catastrophic happened. Our world was hit, not by a bit of space junk the size of a city, but rather by another world.\n\nThis interloping planet, named Theia, was perhaps the size of Mars, perhaps even larger. Its impact nearly ripped the Earth apart. But by chance this monster collision was at just the right angle to produce a shower of debris in the Earth's vicinity. That debris, in time, coalesced to form our Moon.\n\nThe collision also did something else. It knocked the Earth over on its side, resulting in a spinning planet with a tilt of just about 23 degrees from vertical. Why does this matter? It is just this tilt that produces our seasons. As the Earth orbits the Sun, first the northern and then the southern half receive more direct sunlight, resulting in more daylight and warmer temperatures. We call this time summer. When our hemisphere is tilted away from our star, we experience our darker, colder winters. At the two halfway points of the Earth's yearly trip round the Sun, we celebrate the first day of spring (the vernal equinox, if you want to get technical) and the first day of fall (the autumnal equinox).\n\nBut the connection goes much deeper even than that. Mars, with no large moon in orbit, has an axis tilt almost the same as our Earth's. But this is just an accident of history; Mars's tilt changes over time as the planet wobbles through space and is tugged by other passing worlds. Earlier and later in history, Mars' tilt was and will be be very different from Earth's, wreaking havoc with seasons on the Red Planet.\n\nEarth, on the other hand, has a large Moon that orbits relatively nearby. That big, nearby Moon has kept the Earth's axis tilt stable for billions of years, giving us (you guessed it) regular seasons, year after year after year.\n\nSo as you celebrate this year's vernal equinox, take a moment to thank the Moon, whose violent birth and everyday gentle tug makes springtime possible.\n\nAuthorBack in July of 2012, scientists at the LHC reported that they'd found a particle that behaves very much like the Higgs particle. The Higgs particle is not so important in itself, but it gives us clues about the Higgs field, which is the field that gives you and me (and the particles that make us up) mass. They were able to find the Higgs particle ahead of schedule because of a surprising way in which the particle was decaying.\n\nThe best way to think of the Higgs particle is a disturbance (a wave or a wiggle) in the Higgs field. But this disturbance is very unstable. The Higgs particle survives in our world only a tiny fraction of a second, such a short time that we never see the particle itself \u2013 we only see the things it decays into. One of those \"decay paths\" is into two photons \u2013 two very high-energy pieces of light. The experiments at the LHC detected lots and lots of these two photon decays. In fact, it was because there were so many of them that the Higgs discovery could be announced so early in the experiment, long before many expected it.\n\nThis surprising result was exciting news for physicists. They were actually hoping to be wrong about the Higgs. They were hoping that some feature of the Higgs \u2013 such as its likelihood to decay into two photons \u2013 would be wrong. This would point them toward new physics, new ideas, new experiments to try. No one knew if this excess of two photon decays really was new physics, or if it was just luck, a little like rolling doubles three times in a row in Monopoly. Sure it's rare, but rare things do happen (that's what makes them rare and not impossible.)\n\nThe announcement on March 14 of this year was that the extra photon decays really were like rolling doubles three times. If you keep rolling, eventually the doubles streak goes away. That's what happened at the LHC. As they analyzed more and more data, the scientists found that the extra photon decay signal blended into the background. As far as that particular decay is concerned, the Higgs particle seems to behave just as theory would suggest. That's good, it means our theory works, but it's also disappointing, because physicists really, really want to be wrong. It'll tell them what to do next.\n\nAll is not lost, however. We know that our current theories of the world are far, far from complete. We know there are mysteries out there, such as dark matter and dark energy. We have no idea what they are, but we know they exist. We don't understand the mass of neutrinos, or of the Higgs particle itself. We don't yet know what caused the universe to suddenly expand over 13 billion years ago. And of course there's always the mystery of what is a \"Q\" and why do they only use the tip. There's lots more to learn, so keep watching!\n\nAnd then in a twinkling, our breathing did catch,\nAs we watched the craft slow, and the backshell detach.\nThe rockets deployed and the nylon unwound -\nDown the crane Curiosity came with a bound:\n\nIt was gleaming with new lacquer, whiter than snow,\nTo contrast the rusty red dust down below.\nA bundle of instruments sat on its back,\nIn front of the nuclear battery pack.\n\nIts lenses, they twinkled! its MastCam how merry,\nIts cables like honey, ChemCam like a cherry;\nIts six giant wheels, with their high-traction cleats,\nCould turn a full circle in place to retreat;\n\nThe robot arm, long as an old jouster's lance,\nIt pulled tight to itself at the crater's advance.\nThe gold-plated Sample Analysis suite\nWas packed up with tools, like a box full of treats.\n\nIt was ten feet across, a right warrior chief,\nAnd we laughed when we saw it, in utter relief;\nA twist of its mast and the Sky Crane it shed\nSoon gave us to know we had nothing to dread.\n\nIt took not a rest, but went straight to its work,\nAnd scooped up some soil; then turn'd with a jerk,\nAnd, taking commands from down here, I suppose,\nAnd spinning its wheels, up the great Mount it rose.\n\nWith the pow'r of plutonium dioxide decay,\nOur bright Curiosity soldiered away:\nAnd we heard in our heads, as it drove out of sight-\nMerry Mars-mas to all, and to all a good night!\n\nAuthorThe parachute flies away and rockets fire beneath the falling body, slowing its descent further until, at only 66 feet above the surface, the creation hovers in mid-Martian air, balanced over the rocky, uneven surface below.\n\nThen the strangest thing of all happens. What was one object becomes two, as the underbelly of the beast drops down to the surface on a set of cables known as a sky crane. Over the next minute, the lower body descends while the upper craft hovers around 66 feet above the surface. Finally, as the lower craft bites into the Martian dust, the cables break away and the upper craft disappears over the far horizon, never to be heard from again.\n\nT\n\nhis is the strange scene NASA hopes to create in the wee morning hours of August 6, 2012 (COSI time). If all goes well, the Curiosity Rover will awaken from a long slumber in the Gale Crater near the Martian equator, and thereafter begin exploring what could be the most interesting landing site we've ever reached on the Red Planet.\n\nFor most of the history of our species, Mars was but a tiny red-orange dot in a starry night sky. But for us, for we humans lucky enough to live in the first years of the 21st century, Mars is a place, a world, a new land we have just begun to explore with our innovation, or ingenuity, and our curiosity.\n\nThe Rover itself is in many ways the most complex object ever to travel to Mars. The size of a small SUV, the Curiosity Rover is powered by radioactive decay and carries ten precision scientific instruments. Among these instruments is a robotic arm that will drill into Martian rocks, gather soil samples, and deliver those samples to instruments within. Curiosity will be the closest thing we've ever had to a working geologist on the surface of another planet.\n\nWhile Curiosity itself is unlikely to detect life, and in fact the instruments aren't designed for such a detection, it will tell us whether or not the surface of Mars could ever have provided a suitable habitat for living things. For an entire Martian year (around two Earth years), Curiosity will roam the area in and around Gale Crater, helping scientists back on Earth understand the past, present, and future of our neighbor in space.\n\nBut why do we care? So what if once, long ago, Mars was home to microbes? Here's what. If we ever learn that Mars harbored life, then there are three possibilities:\n\nEarth life migrated to Mars through space. While possible, this is unlikely, as it is difficult for rocks blown off Earth (perhaps by meteor impacts) to reach Mars.\n\nMars life migrated to Earth. This is actually much more likely than the former scenario, as it is much easier for rocks to be blasted off Mars (because of its lower gravity), and also more likely that such rocks might one day fall to Earth. If this scenario is true, then we are all Martians! But what if we find that...\n\nLife arose independently on Mars and Earth. This third is the most exciting scenario of all. For if so, then the universe must be teeming with life. One instance of life (on Earth) might be a fluke, not repeated in a billion, or even a hundred billion, worlds. But two examples of life practically side-by-side in the same solar system would indicate that life must be widespread throughout the cosmos.\n\nBut we must also consider possibility 4. Perhaps life never developed on Mars at all. Perhaps life is more delicate than our science currently suggests. Perhaps our Earth really is unique. This fact might remind us all just how precious life really is, and how worthy of celebration.\n\nThe greatest thing about science is that someday (maybe someday soon) we will know. With Curiosity, we will discover secrets about Mars we never dreamt of before, and when we look up on a starry night and see a red-orange dot in the sky, we'll know that dot is a place, a place we humans know a little better now, thanks to a rover with a name befitting the humans who sent it there. Good luck, Curiosity!"}

So I think this scenario is more likely with dead stars. Also it should be noted that medium sized stars (those that don't become supernovae at the end of their lives) only lose a fraction of their masses due to fusion or stellar wind. So they still retain a lot of mass when they become white dwarfs or neutron stars but not enough energy to resist collapse into a black hole."}
{"text":"A new, distant arm of the Milky Way galaxy\n\nJun 13, 2011\n\nThe Milky Way's basic structure is believed to involve two main spiral arms emanating from opposite ends of an elongated central bar. But only parts of the arms can be seen - gray segments indicate portions not yet detected. Other known spiral arm segments--including the Sun's own spur--are omitted for clarity. Credit: T. Dame\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Our Milky Way galaxy, like other spiral galaxies, has a disk with sweeping arms of stars, gas, and dust that curve around the galaxy like the arms of a huge pinwheel.\n\nThe Sun, Earth, and solar system are located in a spur of material that lies between two of the spiral arms, collectively orbiting around the galaxy about 25,000 light-years from its center. Because the Milky Way contains copious amounts of dust that blocks our optical views, it is extremely difficult to study the galaxy from our vantage point within the disk.\n\nThus the details of the spiral arms in our own galaxy are much less certain than is the structure of external spirals such as Andromeda, which is a few million light-years away but sits well above the plane of obscuring dust. Radio wavelengths can peer through the dust, however, and molecules like carbon monoxide that emit in the radio and concentrate in the galaxy's spiral arms are particularly good tracers of their structure.\n\nUsing a small 1.2-meter radio telescope on the roof of their science building in Cambridge, CfA astronomers Tom Dame and Pat Thaddeus used carbon monoxide emission to search for evidence of spiral arms in the most distant parts of the galaxy, and discovered a large new spiral arm peppered with dense concentrations of molecular gas. The CfA scientists suggest that the new spiral is the far end of the Scutum-Centaurus Arm, one of the two main spiral arms thought to originate from opposite ends of our galaxy's central bar (see figure). If their proposal is confirmed, it will demonstrate that the Milky Way has a striking symmetry, with the new arm being the ...\n\nThough the universe is chock full of spiral-shaped galaxies, no two look exactly the same.

{"text":"When stars which have a Main Sequence lifetime which is less than the age of the Universe get old and die, they swell up to become red giants, or supergiants. In the process, their surface gravities become much lower, and the convective motions in their outer layers help drive a mass loss which can reduce their masses by a substantial amount during the last stages of their life.\nIf the giant star is a single star, as the Sun is, all that happens as a result of the mass loss is that it becomes less massive, and ends its red giant lifetime, and its life as a whole, a little sooner. But if it is a member of a binary star system, as a large number of stars are, then there can be a transfer of mass from the dying star to the other star, resulting in a number of interesting possibilities. When the other star is a Main Sequence star, the transfer of mass increases the weight compressing the core of the star, and as the core becomes denser and hotter, the nuclear reactions go faster and faster, producing an ever larger amount of heat, and making the star swell up to a larger, hotter, brighter structure which corresponds to the now larger mass which it has. In other words, it remains a Main Sequence star, but moves up the Main Sequence to a position corresponding to its new mass. This sort of thing must have happened to the star Sirius, which is the brightest star in our sky, other than the Sun, partly because it is one of the closest stars to our Sun, and partly because it is a little over twice the weight, and twenty times the brightness of the Sun. Such stars only last about two billion years as Main Sequence stars, but Sirius has a companion, Sirius B, which is a white dwarf about the same mass as the Sun. Since a star like the Sun can last for over ten billion years as a Main Sequence star, it is impossible for the less massive star to have already died, while the more massive star still lives. At one time, the star which is now less massive must have been the more massive one, and as it grew old, it swelled up, dumped material on its companion, and in the process, became a less massive star, while its companion became a more massive one. But suppose that the companion is not a Main Sequence star, but a white dwarf, the most common type of dead stellar object which we know of. In this case, as the dying star transfers material to the white dwarf, the nuclear reactions in its core will not go faster, because white dwarfs cannot have any nuclear reactions inside them. In a normal star, if nuclear reactions go a little too fast, the gas will heat up, increase its pressure, and expand, which will reduce the temperature, and damp down the nuclear reactions, forcing them back toward a value closer to the average heat loss of the core. If the nuclear reactions go too slowly, the gas will cool off, decrease its pressure, and contract, which will increase the temperature, and increase the nuclear reactions. In either case, the relationship between temperature and pressure which applies to normal gases will guarantee that the nuclear reactions cannot go too fast, or too slow, at least on the average. In the electron-degenerate material which makes up a white dwarf, however, pressure and temperature are not linked. If nuclear reactions go too fast, the temperature will rise, but the pressure will not be significantly changed, and the increase in temperature will simply make the nuclear reactions go faster and faster, until, as in a chain reaction, the region which contains nuclear fuel simply undergoes a catastrophic explosion. (Note: This is discussed in the text under such topics as the Helium Flash which occurs during the red giant lifetime of the Sun.) Because of this, it is not possible for a white dwarf to have any nuclear burning going on inside it. So, when new material is dumped onto the surface of the star by a companion, the mass of the star increases, and the pressure inside the star increases, but otherwise, nothing much happens, at least for a while. Over a long period of time, however, as more and more material is dumped onto the star, the pressures and temperatures within the electron-degenerate gas do begin to rise, and if they reach values where nuclear burning can begin, there will be an explosion of considerable violence.\nHow violent the explosion is depends upon the size and mass of the white dwarf. Since white dwarfs, unlike Main Sequence stars, are smaller the more massive they are, a white dwarf with a mass near, but not too near, the limit of mass for white dwarfs (the Chandrasekhar Limit) will be relatively small, and have a relatively large gravity. This means that material falling onto the star will very quickly reach high pressures and temperatures, and so little material will accumulate before an explosion occurs, and the explosion will be 'relatively' minor. This is believed to be the reason for so-called recurrent novae, such as RS Ophiuchi (shown below). Over a period of a few dozens to a few hundreds of years, material piles up on a massive white dwarf, then explodes, making the object millions of times brighter for a short while. After the explosion is over, more material has to accumulate before another explosion can take place, and so there will be another few decades or centuries before the nova recurs. (For white dwarfs with masses extremely close to the Chandrasekhar Limit, see the note following neutron stars, below.)\n\nArtist's conception of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi. The red giant on the right is continually dumping material onto the white dwarf on the left. Every twenty years or so, temperatures in the white dwarf's not-quite-degenerate envelope reach fusion values, and a runaway reaction causes a nova. Even though the system is two thousand light years from Earth, the novae can be seen with the unaided eye, in a dark sky. Over time, more and more mass will be shed by the red giant, and eventually -- perhaps a hundred thousand years or so from now -- the white dwarf may reach the Chandrasekhar Limit, and have a far more violent explosion -- a supernova that will blow it to bits.

Hurt (SSC)\n\nRings Around the Galaxy\n\nThree newly-discovered streams arcing high over the Milky Way Galaxy are remnants of cannibalized galaxies and star clusters. The streams are between\n13,000 and 130,000 light-years distant from Earth and extend over much of the northern sky.\n\nTwo of the newly discovered streams are almost certainly the remains of ancient star clusters.

These materials, depending on\ntheir ionized state and composition, ultimately end up in various neutral (non-ionized) clouds and radiation belts in Jupiter's magnetosphere and, in\nsome cases, are eventually ejected from the Jovian system.\n\nSurrounding Io (up to a distance of 6 Io radii from the moon's surface) is a cloud of neutral sulfur, oxygen, sodium, and potassium atoms. These\nparticles originate in Io's upper atmosphere but are excited from collisions with ions in the plasma torus (discussed below) and other processes into\nfilling Io's Hill sphere, which is the region where the moon's gravity is predominant over Jupiter. Some of this material escapes Io's\ngravitational pull and goes into orbit around Jupiter. Over a 20-hour period, these particles spread out from Io to form a banana-shaped, neutral\ncloud that can reach as far as 6 Jovian radii from Io, either inside Io's orbit and ahead of the satellite or outside Io's orbit and behind the\nsatellite. The collisional process that excites these particles also occasionally provides sodium ions in the plasma torus with an electron, removing\nthose new \"fast\" neutrals from the torus. However, these particles still retain their velocity (70 km\/s, compared to the 17 km\/s orbital velocity at\nIo), leading these particles to be ejected in jets leading away from Io.\n\nIo orbits within a belt of intense radiation known as the Io plasma torus. The plasma in this doughnut-shaped ring of ionized sulfur, oxygen,\nsodium, and chlorine originates when neutral atoms in the \"cloud\" surrounding Io are ionized and carried along by the Jovian magnetosphere. Unlike\nthe particles in the neutral cloud, these particles co-rotate with Jupiter's magnetosphere, revolving around Jupiter at 74 km\/s. Like the rest of\nJupiter's magnetic field, the plasma torus is tilted with respect to Jupiter's equator (and Io's orbital plane), meaning Io is at times below and\nat other times above the core of the plasma torus. As noted above, these ions' higher velocity and energy levels are partly responsible for the\nremoval of neutral atoms and molecules from Io's atmosphere and more extended neutral cloud. The torus is composed of three sections: an outer,\n\"warm\" torus that resides just outside Io's orbit; a vertically extended region known as the \"ribbon\", composed of the neutral source region and\ncooling plasma, located at around Io's distance from Jupiter; and an inner, \"cold\" torus, composed of particles that are slowly spiraling in toward\nJupiter. After residing an average of 40 days in the torus, particles in the \"warm\" torus escape and are partially responsible for Jupiter's\nunusually large magnetosphere, their outward pressure inflating it from within.Particles from Io, detected as variations in magnetospheric plasma,\nhave been detected far into the long magnetotail by New Horizons. To study similar variations within the plasma torus, researchers measure the\nultraviolet-wavelength light it emits. While such variations have not been definitively linked to variations in Io's volcanic activity (the ultimate\nsource for material in the plasma torus), this link has been established in the neutral sodium cloud. en.wikipedia.org...(moon)\n\nJupiter's magnetic field lines, which Io crosses, couples Io's atmosphere and neutral cloud to Jupiter's polar upper atmosphere through the\ngeneration of an electric current known as the Io flux tube.[50] This current produces an auroral glow in Jupiter's polar regions known as the Io\nfootprint, as well as aurorae in Io's atmosphere. Particles from this auroral interaction act to darken the Jovian polar regions at visible\nwavelengths. The location of Io and its auroral footprint with respect to the Earth and Jupiter has a strong influence on Jovian radio emissions from\nour vantage point: when Io is visible, radio signals from Jupiter increase considerably. The Juno mission, planned for the next decade, should help to\nshed light on these processes. The Jovian magnetic field lines that do get past Io's ionosphere also induce an electric current, which in turn\ncreates an induced magnetic field, within Io's interior. Io's induced magnetic field is thought to be generated within a partially molten, silicate\nmagma ocean 50 kilometers beneath the moon's surface. Similar induced fields were found at the other Galilean satellites by Galileo, generated within\nliquid water oceans in the interiors of those moons.\n\nThe upward motion is but one of the vector factors in determining how fast we are moving... but WHY we are moving perpendicular to the plane might be\neasier to explain if we are just merging with the Milky Way..\n\nRecent observations by the Spitzer Infrered telescope have shown that the Milky Way is in collision with the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy... in\nfact it is absorbing this galaxy. It appears that our solar system was indeed originally part of the Sagittarius Galaxy and has now 'crossed over'\ninto the larger galaxy we call the Milky Way.\n\nI have gathered a lot of material on this and I will link to my site after I pull up the key points"}

The white points in the picture are all thought to be distant galaxies. The image size is approximately 10 arcminutes squared in size.\n\nGalaxies in which active star formation is taking place emit most of their energy as infrared radiation from the interstellar material heated by the light from the young hot stars. The light observed from the distant galaxies, has long left the galaxies and is stretched (or 'red-shifted') due to the expansion of the Universe. This is why it is observed at wavelengths longer than the original emitting wavelengths. Due to the redshift, observations with ESA's Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) revealed that the number of faint, distant galaxies increased drastically when observed at 15 micrometres. The original emitting wavelength was 7 micrometres, approximately 6 thousand million years ago, and has been redshifted to 15 micrometres during its journey across the universe.\n\nThis emission feature around 7 micrometres, due to the characteristic emission from organic materials in the interstellar medium, is stronger in regions of active star formation. Thus, the ISO observations of a very small area of the sky containing only 24 galaxies already showed that active star formation took place at this epoch in the history of the Universe.\n\nThe area observed by AKARI is about three times wider than that of ISO. AKARI detected around 280 galaxies in this region, confirming the increase in the number of galaxies at 15 micrometres implied by the earlier ISO observations. Comparable numbers of even fainter galaxies have been discovered with AKARI, leading to the conclusion that the star formation activity was already intense even earlier than 6 thousand million years in the past. Similar deep surveys over the entire wavelength range (from 2 to 24 micrometres) are being carried out with AKARI. These data will provide a definitive description of the evolution of galaxies over the lifetime of the Universe."}
{"text":"Spider Web of Stars in Galaxy IC 342\n\nMar 20, 2012\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Looking like a spider's web swirled into a spiral, Galaxy IC 342 presents its delicate pattern of dust in this image from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. Seen in infrared light, faint starlight gives way to the glowing bright patterns of dust found throughout the galaxy's disk.\n\nAt a distance of about 10 million light-years, IC 342 is relatively close by galactic standards, however our vantage point places it directly behind the disk of our own Milky Way. The intervening dust makes it difficult to see in visible light, but infrared light penetrates this veil easily. IC 342 belongs to the same group as its even more obscured galactic neighbor, Maffei 2.\n\nIC 342 is nearly face-on to our view, giving a clear, top-down view of the structure of its disk. It has a low surface brightness compared to other spirals, indicating a lower density of stars (seen here as a blue haze). Its dust structures show up much more vividly (red). Blue dots are stars closer to us, in our own Milky Way.\n\nNew stars are forming in the disk at a healthy rate. The very center glows especially brightly in the infrared, highlighting an enormous burst of star formation occurring in this tiny region. To either side of the center, a small bar of dust and gas is helping to fuel this central star formation.\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- The various spiral arm segments of the Sunflower galaxy, also known as Messier 63, show up vividly in this image taken in infrared light by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope.

When the air is cold and the Sun is rising or setting, falling ice crystals can reflect sunlight and create an unusual column of light. Ice sometimes forms flat, six-sided shaped crystals as it falls from high-level clouds. Air resistance causes these crystals to lie nearly flat much of the time as they flutter to the ground.

{"text":"A black hole is a concentration of mass great enough that the force of gravity prevents anything from escaping from it except through quantum tunneling behavior. The gravitational field is so strong that the escape velocity near it exceeds the speed of light. This implies that nothing, not even light, can escape its gravity, hence the word \"black.\" The term \"black hole\" is widespread, even though it does not refer to a hole in the usual sense, but rather a region of space from which nothing can return. Theoretically, black holes can have any size, from microscopic to near the size of the observable universe.\n\nBlack holes are predicted by general relativity. According to classical general relativity, neither matter nor information can flow from the interior of a black hole to an outside observer. For example, one cannot bring out any of its mass, or receive a reflection back by shining a light source such as a flashlight, or retrieve any information about the material that has entered the black hole. Quantum mechanical effects may allow matter and energy to radiate from black holes; however, it is thought that the nature of the radiation does not depend on what has fallen into the black hole in the past.\n\nThe existence of black holes in the universe is well supported by astronomical observation, particularly from studying supernovae and X-ray emissions from active galactic nuclei.\n\nTheory says that we cannot detect black holes by light that is emitted or reflected by the matter inside them. However, those objects can be inductively detected from observation of phenomena near them, such as gravitational lensing and stars that appear to be in orbit around space where there is no visible matter.\n\nIn 2004 a cluster of black holes was detected, broadening our understanding of the distribution of black holes throughout our universe. This has led scientists' inferences of how many black holes are in our universe to be significantly revised. Due to these finds, it is believed that there are close to five fold the number of black holes than were previously predicted.\n\nIn July 2004 astronomers found a giant black hole, Q0906+6930, at the center of a distant galaxy in the Ursa Major constellation. The size and presumed age of the black hole has implications that may determine the age of the universe [9].\n\nIn November 2004 a team of astronomers reported the discovery of the first intermediate-mass black hole in our Galaxy, orbiting three light-years from Sagittarius A*. This medium black hole of 1,300 solar masses is within a cluster of seven stars, possibly the remnant of a massive star cluster that has been stripped down by the Galactic Centre.(Nature News)(original article) This observation may add support to the idea that supermassive black holes grow by absorbing nearby smaller black holes and stars.\n\nIn February 2005, a blue giant star SDSS J090745.0+24507 was found to be leaving the Milky Way at twice the escape velocity (0.0022 of the speed of light). The path of the star can be traced back to the galactic core. The high velocity of this star supports the hypothesis of a super-massive black hole in the center of the galaxy. Based on such observations, and even more on theoretical arguments, researchers guesstimate there are about 10 million black holes in the Milky Way.\n\nThese objects orbit just like other stars, meaning that it is not terribly likely that one is headed our way. But if a normal star were moving toward us, we'd know it. With a black hole there is little warning. A few decades before a close encounter, at most, astronomers would observe a strange perturbation in the orbits of the outer planets. As the effect grew larger, it would be possible to make increasingly precise estimates of the location and mass of the interloper. The black hole wouldn't have to come all that close to Earth to bring ruin; just passing through the solar system would distort all of the planets' orbits. Earth might get drawn into an elliptical path that would cause extreme climate swings, or it might be ejected from the solar system and go hurtling to a frigid fate in deep space."}
{"text":"Light detected by the Hubble telescope and NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope is believed to have come from the most distant galaxy yet. The galaxy is called MACS0647-JD, and from our perspective, is seen between the Big and Little Dippers.\n\nScientists combined data from the Hubble space telescope with NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope to make the discovery. MACS0647-JD would have existed about 13.3 billion years ago, or roughly 420 million years after the Big Bang. This would place it around 200 million years earlier than previous candidates for most distance object ever spotted.\n\nThe galaxy cluster in front of MACS0647-JD helped scientists to see it, since the gargantuan gravitational pull of the cluster bends light around it. This creates a gravitational lens that makes distant objects appear much brighter than they otherwise would.

All heavier elements found on the periodic table have been produced by stars over the last 13.7 billion years. Astronomers analyze starlight to determine the chemical makeup of stars, the origin of the elements, the ages of stars, and the evolution of galaxies and the universe. Now forCredit:\nCarnegie Observatories\n\nLead author of the Astrophysical Journal paper, Fellow Ian Roederer of the Carnegie Observatories explained: \"Stars like our Sun can make elements up to oxygen on the periodic table. Other more massive stars can synthesize heavier elements, those with more protons in their nuclei, up to iron by nuclear fusion\u2014the process in which atomic nuclei fuse and release lots of energy. Most of the elements heavier than iron are made by a process called neutron-capture nucleosynthesis.\n\n\"Although neutrons have no charge, they can decay into protons after they're in the nucleus, producing elements with larger atomic numbers. One of the ways that this method can work is by exposure to a burst of neutrons during the violent supernova death of a star. We call this process the rapid process (r-process). It can produce elements at the middle and bottom of the periodic table\u2014from zinc to uranium\u2014in the blink of an eye.\"\n\nRoederer, with co-author James Lawler, looked at an ultraviolet spectrum from the Hubble Space Telescope public archives to find arsenic and selenium in a 12 billion year-old halo star dubbed HD 160617. These elements were forged in an even older star, which has long since disappeared, and then\u2014like genes passed on from parent to infant\u2014they were born into the star we see today, HD 160617.\"\n\nThe team also examined data for this star from the public archives of several ground-based telescopes and were able to detect 45 elements. In addition to arsenic and selenium, they found rarely seen cadmium, tellurium, and platinum, all of which were produced by the r-process. This is the first time these elements have been detected together outside the Solar System. Astronomers cannot replicate the r-process in any laboratory since the conditions are so extreme. The key to modeling the r-process relies on astronomical observations.\n\n\"What I find exciting is that arsenic and selenium can be found in other stars, even ones like HD 160617 that we've been studying for decades,\" remarked Roederer. \"Now that we know where to look, we can go back and study these elements in other stars. Understanding the r-process helps us know why we find certain elements like barium on Earth, or understand why uranium is so rare.\"\n\nThe paper is published in the May 1, 2012 issue.

Photo by Marty Harris\/McDonald Observatory.\n\nAstronomers have determined the origin of a very unusual and rare type of star. New data indicate that extreme-helium stars, as they are called, form from the merger of two white dwarfs.\n\nAstronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope as well as instruments in India and Texas to obtain detailed spectrographic observations to determine the exact proportions of more than two dozen elements present in several extreme-helium stars.\n\n\"It's taken more than 60 years after the first discovery at McDonald to get some idea of how these formed,\" said team leader N. Kameswara Rao of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics in Bangalore. \"We are now getting a consistent picture.\"\n\nThe first extreme-helium star, HD 124448, was discovered at McDonald Observatory in Austin in 1942 by Daniel M. Popper of the University of Chicago. Only about two-dozen such stars have been found since.\n\nThe stars are supergiants, less massive than the Sun but many times larger and hotter. They are remarkable because they contain almost no hydrogen, the most abundant chemical element in the universe and the most basic component of all stars. Instead, they are dominated by helium, with significant amounts of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen and traces of all other stable elements.\n\nThe origin of extreme-helium stars cannot be traced back to protostellar clouds of helium gas, because no such clouds ever existed in the Milky Way. Moreover, nuclear reactions in stars like the Sun convert hydrogen to helium, but confine the helium to their hot cores, where it cannot be detected spectrally.\n\nA star must lose vast amounts of hydrogen gas before its helium can escape to the surface and be seen by telescopes. No known mechanism inside the star can drive off the overlying layers to expose the helium.\n\nTwo decades ago, astronomers Ronald Webbink and Icko Iben of the University of Illinois hypothesized that extreme helium stars formed from the merger of two white dwarfs.\n\nWhite dwarfs are the end product of the evolution of Sun-like stars. They contain very little hydrogen. Some are rich in helium and others in carbon and oxygen. A pair of white dwarfs can result from the normal evolution of standard stars.\n\nReporting in a recent issue of the Astrophysical Journal, Webbink and Iben said that, in some cases, one star in the binary could evolve as a helium-rich white dwarf, and the other as a carbon-oxygen-rich white dwarf. Over billions of years of orbiting each other, the two stars lose energy and move steadily closer.\n\nEventually, the helium white dwarf is consumed by the more massive carbon-oxygen white dwarf, and the resulting single star swells up to become a helium-rich supergiant.\n\nTo test this idea, the research team obtained observations from Hubble, from the 2.7-meter Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory at the University of Texas in Austin, and the 2.3-meter Vainu Bappu instrument in Kavalur, India.\n\nThey found Hubble's results match up well with predictions of the compositions of stars formed by the merger of two white dwarfs, in which the helium-core white dwarf is torn apart and forms a thick disk around the carbon-oxygen white dwarf.\n\nIn a process that takes only a few minutes, the disk is gravitationally pulled into the carbon-oxygen white dwarf.\n\nWhat happens next depends of the mass of the new, resulting star. If it is above a certain mass, called the Chandrasekar limit, it will explode as a Type Ia supernova. If its mass lies below this limit, the newly merged star will balloon into a supergiant, eventually becoming an extreme-helium star.\n\n\"It's interesting to note that the namesakes of these two telescopes, Harlan J. Smith and Vainu Bappu, were the very best of friends in graduate school at Harvard,\" said David L. Lambert, McDonald's director. Smith later served as director of McDonald Observatory from 1963 to 1989, and Vainu Bappu founded the Indian Institute of Astrophysics. \"Today, with collaborations like this project,\" Lambert added, \"we're maintaining the important international and personal ties that astronomy thrives upon.\"\n\n(Phys.org) \u2014Supernovae were always thought to occur in two main varieties.

Acknowledgment: Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit)\n\nAn international team of astronomers [1] has used ESO's Very Large Telescope to carefully study the star VFTS 682 [2] in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small neighbouring galaxy to the Milky Way. By analysing the star's light, using the FLAMES instrument on the VLT, they have found that it is about 150 times the mass of the Sun. Stars like these have so far only been found in the crowded centres of star clusters, but VFTS 682 lies on its own.\n\n\"We were very surprised to find such a massive star on its own, and not in a rich star cluster,\" notes Joachim Bestenlehner, the lead author of the new study and a student at Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland. \"Its origin is mysterious.\"\n\nThis star was spotted earlier in a survey of the most brilliant stars in and around the Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It lies in a stellar nursery: a huge region of gas, dust and young stars that is the most active star-forming region in the Local Group of galaxies [3]. At first glance VFTS 682 was thought to be hot, young and bright, but unremarkable. But the new study using the VLT has found that much of the star's energy is being absorbed and scattered by dust clouds before it gets to Earth \u2014 it is actually more luminous than previously thought and among the brightest stars known.\n\nRed and infrared light emitted by the star can get through the dust, but the shorter-wavelength blue and green light is scattered more and lost. As a result the star appears reddish, although if the view were unobstructed it would shine a brilliant blue-white.\n\nAs well as being very bright, VFTS 682 is also very hot, with a surface temperature of about 50 000 degrees Celsius [4]. Stars with these unusual properties may end their short lives not just as a supernova, as is normal for high-mass stars, but just possibly as an even more dramatic long-duration gamma-ray burst [5], the brightest explosions in the Universe."}

{"text":"Weapons & Artillery\n\nNebulae\n\nA nebula is an interstellar cloud of dust particles and gases in space. There are two general types of nebulae: diffuse nebulae and planetary nebulae. Both types are also called gaseous nebulae. Diffuse nebulae are the larger of the two types. Some diffuse nebulae contain enough dust and gases to form as many as 100,000 stars the size of the sun.\n\nFox Fur Nebula\n\nA diffuse nebula may occur near an extremely hot, bright star. The intense ultraviolet light from the star energizes the gas atoms of the nebula and enables the mass to emit light. A diffuse nebula of this kind is called an emission nebula and often referred to as H II regions.\n\nA diffuse nebula also may occur near a cool star. In this case, the ultraviolet light from the star is too weak to make the nebula's gas atoms give off light. But the dust particles in the diffuse nebula reflect the starlight. Astronomers refer to this kind of diffuse nebula as a reflection nebula. Reflection nebulae are usually blue because the scattering is more efficient for blue light than red.\n\nHelix Nebula\n\nIf a diffuse nebula occurs in an area that has no nearby stars, it neither emits nor reflects enough light to be visible. In fact, its dust particles blot out the light from the stars behind them. Astronomers call such a diffuse nebula a dark nebula. In the inner regions of dark nebulae important events take place, such as the formation of stars and masers.\n\nPlanetary nebulae are ball-like clouds of dust and gases that surround certain stars. They form when a star begins to collapse and throw off the outer layers of its atmosphere. When viewed through a small telescope, this type of nebula appears to have a flat, rounded surface like that of a planet. Planetary nebulae include some of the most stunning sights in the universe, contorted into various shapes by magnetic fields and the orbital motion of binary systems.\n\nA protoplanetary nebula is an astronomical object which is at the short-lived episode during a star's rapid stellar evolution between the late asymptotic giant branch phase and the subsequent planetary nebula phase. A protoplanetary nebula emits strong infrared radiation, and is a kind of reflection nebula. The exact point when a protoplanetary nebula becomes a planetary nebula is defined by the temperature of the central star.\n\nA supernova is a stellar explosion and occurs when a high-mass star reaches the end of its life. When nuclear fusion ceases in the core of the star, the star collapses inward on itself. The gas falling inward either rebounds or gets so strongly heated that it expands outwards from the core, thus causing the star to explode. The expanding shell of gas form a supernova remnant, a special type of diffuse nebula. Although much of the optical and X-ray emission from supernova remnants originates from ionized gas, a substantial amount of the radio emission is a form of non-thermal emission called synchrotron emission. This emission originates from high-velocity electrons oscillating within magnetic fields.\n\nVela Supernova Remnant\n\nStar-forming Nebulae\n\nStar-forming nebulae contain a combination of raw materials that makes star birth possible. Star formation, also referred to as a stellar nursery, can be seen throughout the Milky Way, but it is principally evident in the spiral arms and toward the galactic center. In these regions, the interstellar matter is dense enough for molecular clouds to exist. When stars are born, these clouds are illuminated from within to become emission nebulae, some of the most beautiful sights in the Milky Way.\n\nIt is believed that the creation of newborn stars occurs exclusively within molecular clouds. The dense part of these molecular clouds collapse into a ball of plasma to form a star. Remnants from the star-forming nebulae will surround the stars, and the stellar winds produced by the new stars can, in turn, cause these remnants to collapse. If the clouds are part of a larger complex, this can become a great stellar nursery. Massive stars have relatively short lives, and they can be born, live, and die as a supernova while their less-massive siblings are still forming. The shock wave from the supernova may plow through nearby interstellar matter, triggering yet more star birth."}

HH 110 appears different from most other Herbig-Haro objects: in particular, it appears on its own while they usually come in pairs. Astronomers think it may be a continuation of another object called HH 270, after it has been deflected off a dense cloud of gas.

When the energetic and fast-moving Herbig-Haro jets slam into colder gas, they form shock fronts that look and behave much like the bow waves that form in front of a boat. These so-called bow shocks, which glow thanks to very high temperatures, are a distinctive feature of Herbig-Haro objects.\n\nThe structure of HH 110 and other objects like it acts like a ticker-tape, recording the activity of the star that is the origin of the jet. Erratic outbursts from the star happen at times when more matter is falling in, and these are recorded as brighter knots or blobs within the Herbig-Haro object, which move along the jet over the years. Although the jets are very fast-moving, they are also very large: the streamer of gas in this image is around half a light-year in length. This means that the motion appears quite slow from our vantage point, even when measured over years (see heic1113 - \n\nBy measuring the current speed and positions of blobs within a Herbig-Haro object, astronomers can rewind time, projecting the motion of the knots backwards to the moment when they were emitted. This in turn tells the scientists about the environment directly around the forming star"}

Image courtesyRomano Corradi and the Instituto de Astrof\u00edsica de Canarias.\n\nExploding stars called Type 1a supernovae are ideal for measuring cosmic distances because they are bright enough to spot across the Universe and have approximately the same luminosity everywhere. Although astronomers have many theories about the kinds of star systems involved in these explosions (or progenitor systems), no one has ever directly observed one \u2014 until now.\n\nIn the August 24 issue of Science, the multi-institutional Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) team presented the first-ever direct observations of a Type 1a supernova progenitor system. This discovery was made possible with a combination of super-fast research networks, sophisticated algorithms, and high-performance computers and will improve the accuracy of cosmic measurements today.\n\nAstronomers have collected evidence indicating that the progenitor system of a Type 1a supernova called PTF 11kx contains a red giant star. The system is located 600 million light years away in the constellation Lynx.\n\n\"We know that Type 1a supernovae vary slightly from galaxy to galaxy, and we've been calibrating for that, but this PTF 11kx observation provides the first explanation of why this happens,\" says Peter Nugent, who leads the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's (Berkeley Lab's) Computational Cosmology Group and is a co-author on the paper.\n\nA one in a thousand discovery\n\nAlthough Type 1a supernovae are rare, occurring maybe once or twice a century in a typical galaxy, Nugent notes that finding a Type 1a progenitor system like PTF 11kx is even rarer. \"You maybe find one of these systems in a sample of 1,000 Type 1a supernovae,\" he says.\n\nThe PTF survey uses a robotic telescope mounted on the 48-inch Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar Observatory in southern California to scan the night sky. As the observations are taken, the data travels more than 400 miles via high-speed networks \u2014 including the National Science Foundation's High Performance Wireless Research and Education Network and the Department of Energy's Energy Sciences Network (ESnet) \u2014 to the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), located at Berkeley Lab. There, the real-time transient detection pipeline uses high-performance computers, a high-speed parallel file system and sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to sift the data and identify events for scientists to follow up on.\n\nAccording to Nugent, the pipeline detected the supernova on 16 January 2011. He and UC Berkeley postdoctoral researcher, Jeffrey Silverman, immediately followed up on the event with spectroscopy observations from the Shane telescope at the University of California's Lick Observatory had erupted, or went nova, previously,\"This was the most exciting supernova I've ever studied. For several months, almost every new observation showed something we'd never seen before,\" says Ben Dilday, a UC Santa Barbra postdoctoral researcher and lead author of the study.\n\nA new kind of supernova\n\nAccording to Dilday, it is not unusual for a star to frequently undergo nova eruptions In fact, a 'recurrent nova' system called RS Ophiuchi exists within our own Milky Way Galaxy.

{"text":"Cosmic explosion is most distant ever seen\n\nAstronomers have detected the most distant gamma-ray burst ever found. The cosmic explosion came from a star that detonated about 12.8 billion light years from Earth.\n\nGamma-ray bursts are fleeting blasts of high-energy radiation that occur when massive stars die and shoot out high-speed jets of matter. The expanding matter initially produces gamma rays, but when it starts colliding with surrounding gas, it creates afterglows at longer wavelengths.\n\nThe new record holder, called GRB 080913, was first detected on 13 September by NASA's Swift space observatory. Telescopes around the world soon detected its afterglow at longer wavelengths, and the light spectrum they observed revealed its incredible distance: 12.8 billion light years away.\n\nThat is about 70 million light years farther than the previous record holder. \"This is the most amazing burst Swift has seen,\" said Swift's lead scientist Neil Gehrels in a statement.\n\nAstronomers have been hoping to discover very distant GRBs because they exploded when the universe was young - they are being seen now because their light took billions of years to reach Earth. These ancient GRBs could reveal details about the lives and deaths of the very earliest stars.\n\nGRB 080913 exploded less than 825 million years after the big bang. \"This burst accompanies the death of a star from one of the universe's early generations,\" said Swift team member Patricia Schady of University College LondonWhen Will They Learn?\n\nSat Sep 20 14:13:35 BST 2008 by Marco Kaiser\n\nWhy do those articles always read as if the hypothesis that the universe is 13.7 billion years old is a fact. As I have stated many times it is not a fact and it would surprise me if it would not soon be discovered that it's much older. So please stop writing this as if it was 100% proven fact. I always have to laugh, when I read \"when the universe was young\" or \"shortly after the big bang\" in combination with numbers of 12 - 13.7 billion years. Dear astronomers and article writers, please get off your high horses and learn to use words like \"estimated\" or \"which is thought\" or \"at the moment....is believed to be\" and so on. I can't wait till Hubble is upgraded.\n\nSo in the limit of infinite red shift, where space is expanding faster than light, the radius of the visible universe is about 14.1 billion light years.\n\nSince accelertion to and beyond light speed requires infinite energy, limiting the size of the universe to the visible envelope is typical. Hence the univese can be no more than 14.1 billion light years old.\n\nWhen Will They Learn?\n\nSun Sep 21 10:51:51 BST 2008 by Marco Kaiser\n\nSorry, but this is nonsense. Forget your calculations for a second and use reason. If it would take an infinite amount of energy to reach light speed and beyond, we would have no chance to ever reach distant stars and galaxies in the future. Why are we researching, developing and living then, if we are so limited? What would be the meaning of life if we could only develop to the point of below light speed travel, that's absolutely illogical, besides the fact that photons reach light speed and that it has been scientifically proven that entangled photons can communicate at speeds of at least 10.000 times the speed of light. Even if we could never reach those speeds (which is nonsense) why do those speeds exist in the universe then? Let me tell you this: We will be able to travel much faster than the speed of light in the future, once we understand how tachyons work and are able to use \"hyperspace\". It will not be tomorrow, but we will get there.\n\nWhen Will They Learn?\n\nSun Sep 21 16:01:06 BST 2008 by Horatio\n\nI like the way you tell one guy that he's talking nonsense, and then write about how we're going to be using tachyons to travel through hyperspace... You state that life at less than light speed is 'illogical' - what on earth does that mean? Then you talk about hyperspace like it's something real after dissing cosmologists for daring to be confident in their estimations of the age of the Universe.\n\nNot knocking you, but if you're going to cite 'using reason', then perhaps you can think of ways in which we can advance within the framework of reality without invoking hyperspace or tachyons. Sub-c travel is still a valid research path. Also, entangled photons don't necessarily \"communicate\" - have a read about the phenomenum and its implications.\n\nWhen Will They Learn?\n\n\"It has been scientifically proven that entangled photons can communicate at speeds of at least 10.000 times the speed of light.\" - Marco Kaiser\n\nEntangled photons are thought not to \"communicate\" but spontaneously alter their entangled states.\n\nThe aspect of the particle in question that is being measured is considered a manifestation of a single entity, even though they are widely separated.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the transmission of all force carriers is thought to occurr at infinite speed in absolute terms by reduce to a finite limit of c as a result of scattering delay by the particles created from the energy of the vacuum.\n\nSince entanglement doesn't involve force carriers, it occurrs instantly - it is thought.\n\nWhen Will They Learn?\n\nMon Sep 22 11:54:25 BST 2008 by Mike\n\nHang on: Your 'reason' for insisting that it doesn't take an infinite amount of energy for a object with mass to reach the speed of light is basically 'then we won't be able to build spaceships'. I can't understand how you use this line of logic to undermine everything we have observed in physics. Just because your 'reason for living' matters to you, it doesn't mean that it has an effect on the world around you.\n\n\"What would be the meaning of life if we could only develop to the point of below light speed travel, that's absolutely illogical\"\n\nThat's a huge non sequeteur: That the physical laws of existence as we have observed them are 'wrong' and 'illogical' because the point of life is to fly in spaceships? Firstly, there is nothing except blind faith and fear of deathand being alone that leads us to believe in such a concept as a higher 'meaning of life'. Elsewhere in nature, the meaning of life is simply to survive and reproduce. Assuming that we are 'better' is purely a matter of faith, which in itself is niether logical of demonstrable. Secondly, what on earth makes you think that the point of life is for us to reach distant galaxies, anyway, and what makes that a certainty that our science is 'wrong'?\n\nThese speeds exist in the universe so that the universe works properly. If they didn't; we wouldn't be sitting here. They don't exist so that we can 'logically' [!] attain or breach them.\n\nWe are always fast-on-the-draw here to ridicule faith in gods or intellegent design, but what what is being proposed is an equally groundless faith in sci-fi, rather than observed and proven science.\n\nWhen Will They Learn?\n\nSun Sep 21 18:27:46 BST 2008 by William Curry\n\nYour calculation's correct IF and only IF the red shift is a Doppler shift.\n\nThe modern problem with cosmology began with an \"assumption\" about the nature of the red shift in the spectrum of faint extragalactic objects, discovered by Edwin Hubble. Hubble wrote, \"If the red shifts are a Doppler shift ... The observations as they stand lead to the anomaly of a closed universe, curiously small and dense, and, it may be added, suspiciously young. On the other hand, if red shifts are not Doppler effects, these anomalies disappear and the region observed appears as a small, homogeneous, but insignificant portion of a universe extended indefinitely both in space and time.\ufffd (Royal Astronomical Society Monthly Notices, 17, 506, 1937).\n\nPlugging in the Hubble constant estimate as Vendicar's 70.1 and entering an extreme red shift, z of 1 billion seems to max out the distance estimate to some 8.55 Giga parsecs which is suspiciously close to double Vendicar's result. It could be that the calculator is in error as this would suggest a light travel time of 8.55 E9* 3.26156 = some 27.887 billion years from the observable horizon of the universe. Or it could be that there is a little more to be done in order to extract the age of the universe from the informtion. Ofcourse this is where my understanding of these matters is very fallable. Does light travel time from the observable horizon (which is what z=infinity means) necessarily translate into the age of the universe? I ask this as I have always found the concept to be a particularly slimy one."}
{"text":"Radioactive decay of titanium powers supernova remnant\n\nOct 17, 2012\n\n\nStars are like nuclear furnaces, continuously fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores. When stars greater than eight times the mass of our Sun exhaust their hydrogen fuel, the star collapses. This may generate temperatures high enough to create much heavier elements by fusion, such as titanium, iron, cobalt and nickel.\n\nAfter the collapse, the star rebounds and a spectacular supernova explosion results, with these constituent elements flung into space.\n\nSupernovae can shine as brightly as entire galaxies for a very brief time thanks to the enormous amount of energy released in the explosion.\n\nAfter the initial flash has faded, the total luminosity of the remnant is provided by the release of energy from the natural decay of radioactive elements produced in the explosion.\n\nEach element emits energy at some characteristic wavelengths as it decays, providing insight into the chemical composition of the supernova ejecta \u2013 the shells of material flung out by the exploding star.\n\nThis image shows the patch of the sky surrounding the remnant of supernova remnant 1987A as seen in three different bands at high X-ray energies with ESA's Integral. Titanium-44 is only present in the central image, which spans the 65\u201382 keV energy range. The panel on the left is based on data collected in the 48\u201365 keV band, whereas the panel on the right is based on data collected in the 82\u201399 keV band. The presence of signal corresponding to the position in the sky of SNR 1987A only in the energy range between 65 keV and 82 keV demonstrates that the signal does arise from emission at the specific wavelengths unique to the radioactive decay of Ti-44, at 67.9 keV and 78.4 keV. Also seen in the field of view are two other bright sources of high-energy emission, the black hole binary known as LMC X-1 and the pulsar PSR B0540-69. Credits: ESA\/Integral\/IBIS\u2013ISGRI\/S. Grebenev et al.\n\nSupernova 1987A, located in one of the Milky Way's nearby satellite galaxies, the Large Magellanic Cloud, was close enough to be seen by the naked eye when its light first reached Earth in February 1987.\n\nDuring the peak of the explosion, fingerprints of elements from oxygen to calcium were detected, representing the outer layers of the ejecta.\n\nSoon after, signatures of the material synthesised in the inner layers could be seen in the radioactive decay of nickel-56 to cobalt-56, and its subsequent decay to iron-56.\n\nNow, thanks to more than 1000 hours of observation by Integral, high-energy X-rays from radioactive titanium-44 in supernova remnant 1987A have been detected for the first time.\n\n\"This is the first firm evidence of titanium-44 production in supernova 1987A and in an amount sufficient to have powered the remnant over the last 20 years,\" says Sergei Grebenev from the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Science in Moscow, and the first author of the paper reporting the results in Nature.\n\nFrom their analysis of the data, the astronomers estimated that the total mass of titanium-44 that must have been produced just after the core collapse of SN1987A's progenitor star amounted to 0.03% of the mass of our own Sun.\n\nThis value is near the upper boundary of theoretical predictions and is nearly twice the amount seen in supernova remnant Cas A, the only other remnant where titanium-44 has been detected.\n\n\"The high values of titanium-44 measured in Cas A and SNR1987A are likely produced in exceptional cases, favouring supernovae with an asymmetric geometry, and perhaps at the expense of the synthesis of heavier elements,\" says Dr Grebenev.\n\n\"This is a unique scientific result obtained by Integral that represents a new constraint to be taken into account in future simulations for supernova explosions,\" adds Chris Winkler, ESA's Integral project scientist and co-author of the Nature paper.\n\n\"These observations are broadening our understanding of the processes involved during final stages of a massive star's life.\"\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- A new X-ray study of the remains of an exploded star indicates that the supernova that disrupted the massive star may have turned it inside out in the process.

But money is only sometimes an object when it comes to peeking in on the furthest reaches of outer space, and on ALMA's first official day of being online, that investment is already paying off.\n\nUsing the gravitation lensing technique \u2014 when faraway galaxies are magnified and distorted by other galaxies in the foreground \u2014 ALMA's international team of astronomers got a detailed look at 26 starburst galaxies, which served as major breeders in the early stages of the universe.

They're a whopping 12 billion light years away, which puts their formative period around two billion years after the Big Bang, which means all this happened a full billion years before astronomers thought it did.

But while the flaring\nemission of these outlandish cosmic deaths never usually last for\nmore than a few hours, this bast has been pulsating with\nhigh-energy radiation for more than a week.\n\nAstronomers at Nasa believe that the unusually lengthy\nexplosion happened when a star wandered too close to its galaxy's\ncentral\nblack hole. Intense forces ripped the dying star to shreds,\nspilling its gaseous innards into the black hole. The spinning hole\nthen spewed out jets of X- and gamma-rays, which would be\nespecially prominent if they were pointed towards\nEarth.\n\nOn 28 March, Nasa's Swift\ntelescope discovered a fiery X-ray blast in the constellation\nDraco. It catalogued the location of the explosion, now named\ngamma-ray burst (GRB) 110328A, and got the word out to other\nastronomers around the globe.\n\nAs dozens of telescopes studied the blast, some cosmologists\nnoticed that a tiny, distant galaxy appeared near the explosion.\nNasa's\nHubble then took over, creating a deep image of the area, and\nthe 3.8 billion light-years away galaxy, on 4 April. On that same\nday, Nasa's\nChandra X-ray Observatory telescope took a four-hour long\nexposure shot of the blast.\n\nBy superimposing the images, Nasa could see that the fiery\nstarburst was actually radiating from the centre of the galaxy\nitself. This find led to the theory that the unusual blast came\nfrom a black hole at the galaxy's core.\n\nWe've seen stars ripped apart by\nsupermassive black holes before, but none have spewed out X-ray\njets at this brightness, variability and for this length of time.\n\"The best explanation at the moment is that we happen to be looking\ndown the barrel of this jet,\" said Andrew Levan at the University\nof Warwick, who led the Chandra observations. \"When we look\nstraight down these jets, a brightness boost lets us view details\nwe might otherwise miss.\""}
{"text":"Lurking at the centers of most galaxies are black holes that can weigh anywhere from one million to one billion times as much as the Sun. New research, published today in the Astrophysical Journal, shows that these black holes are growing at much larger rates than had previously been thought possible. Even the black hole in our own Milky Way Galaxy, which otherwise appears very quiet, has probably been consuming the equivalent of one Sun every 3,000 years.\n\nUntil recently astronomers had thought that black holes grow mostly when galaxies crash into each other, at which time a large concentration of gas forms around the black hole and gets very hot, shining very brightly in what is known as an active galactic nucleus. This gas gets so bright that active galactic nuclei can be seen all the way back to shortly after the universe first formed. This theory held that black holes in the centers of ordinary spiral galaxies like our own Milky Way cannot grow much. However, a new study led by University of Central Lancashire astronomer Dr. Victor Debattista used computer simulations to show that black holes in spiral galaxies must grow by large amounts without the need for collisions.\n\nRecent observations by the Hubble Space Telescope have indicated that black holes can grow even in quiet spiral galaxies. Some spiral galaxies have active galactic nuclei and these may outnumber those in merging galaxies. Closer to home, astronomers have recently discovered a gas cloud near the center of the Milky Way that later this year will be ripped apart by the central black hole. Over the next 10 years, the black hole is predicted to swallow up to as much as 15 times the mass of the Earth from this cloud.\n\nThe team of researchers, which included Dr. Stelios Kazantzidis of Ohio State University and Professor Frank C. van den Bosch of Yale University, used a property of black holes that was first discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope, that their masses can be quite accurately predicted from the speed of stars in the galaxies they live in.\n\nThe team successfully disproved the previous theory that black holes are unable to grow while the galaxy itself grows by using computer simulations to compare the masses of black holes in spiral galaxies with those of elliptical galaxies. The team's comparison of spiral and elliptical galaxies found that there is no mismatch between how big their black holes are. For this to have happened black holes had to have been growing along with the galaxy.\n\nThe black hole that has grown the most can be found in the Sombrero galaxy The researchers estimate that this black hole has been swallowing the equivalent of one Sun every twenty years and is now over 500 million times as heavy as the Sun.\n\nThe new study, published today in the Astrophysical Journal, provides the theoretical basis for understanding the emerging picture that galaxy collisions are a relatively small contribution to the growth of black holes, contrary to previous assumptions.\n\nCommenting on the significance of the new research, Dr. Debattista said: \"These simulations show that it is no longer possible to argue that black holes in spiral galaxies do not grow efficiently. Our simulations will allow us to refine our understanding of how black holes grew in different types of galaxies.\"\n\nAn assistant professor of physics at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) will be among a team of international researchers looking to advance the theory of quantum mechanics, a notion challenged by Albert Einstein and pursued by many of the top scientific minds during the past century.\n\nLe Luo, Ph.D., specializes in atomic physics and quantum optics, with expertise in the measurement and manipulation of trapped ions (charged particles). A new grant will allow him to work with researchers at the University of Science and Technology in China (USTC), Harvard University and several European universities to conduct a \"loophole-free test\" of the Bell Inequalities\u2014one of the most fundamental questions in quantum mechanics.\n\n\"This research is going to be conducted over much of the next five years or so,\" Luo said. \"If successful, this could have a major effect on exploring the fundamentals of quantum mechanics as well advancements in quantum information science, which will ultimately make information technology much more secure and efficient than it is today.\"\n\nQuantum theory states that there is no local realism. In other words, an object has no pre-existing values until that object is measured. Until then, there is only probability. The theory also suggests that a single measurement may affect two remote, distinct systems described by \"entangled\" quantum states.\n\nFor example, the theory says that if two entangled particles (ions, protons, electrons, etc.) are sent off to remote places, a measurement taken on one particle at one point should indicate the states (position and speed, for example) of both particles, no matter the distance between the two particles.\n\nEinstein's theory of relativity claims this would be impossible because the particles would have to communicate with one another faster than the speed of light. When considering the local realism for physics laws, the quantum theory could not be complete, Einstein reasoned.\n\nWhat is reality? What is matter? These weighty questions and others related to quantum theory have challenged scientists for generations.\n\n\"Hopefully, the expertise of this group from across the world will be able to make some progress in answering these long-standing questions,\" Luo said.\n\nThe debate on the local realism of quantum mechanics has been ongoing since the early 1900s. Einstein and collaborators Podolsky and Rosen first challenged the completeness of quantum mechanics on a large public scale in the 1930s. This later became commonly known as the EPR Paradox.\n\nIn 1964, the European physicist John Bell provided a detailed analysis of the EPR paradox. Bell's research produced a now famous result, known as Bell's Inequality, which suggests specific ways in which local realism can be tested.\n\nResearchers began using photons in 1980s to test Bell's theory and determine if Einstein's reasoning is right or wrong. Since then, researchers have used various quantum states to test the theory but continued to have loopholes in their methods, therefore falling short of a definitive result. Luo said the new collaboration would, for the first time, be using several different quantum systems\u2014including photons, ions, quantum dots and solid-state ensembles\u2014to test the theory across large distances and hopefully eliminate all possible loopholes, he said.\n\n\"It is very important that such Bell Inequality tests be implemented at large distances, across distances such as tens of miles, so that our measurement can be loophole-free by eliminating the possibility the two objects can communicate with one another,\" Luo said.\n\nAndy Gavrin, chair of the Department of Physics at IUPUI, said two graduate students at IUPUI will work with Luo on the project. The department should \"receive additional financial support and recognition from being involved in this major effort,\" he added.\n\nCo-collaborators with Luo include Chuan-Feng Li and Yongjian Han of USTC, one of the top research universities in China; Jyrki Piilo; University of Turko in Finland; Heinz-Peter Breuer, Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg in Germany; and Man Hong Yung of Harvard University.\n\nThe School of Science is committed to excellence in teaching, research and service in the biological, physical, behavioral and mathematical sciences.

First of all, one may pose the following question: from now on institutions for learning and research will more and more have to be supported by grants from the state, since, for various reasons, private sources will not suffice. Is it at all reasonable that the distribution of the funds raised for these purposes from the taxpayer should be entrusted to the military? To this question every prudent person will certainly answer: \"No!\" For it is evident that the difficult task of the most beneficent distribution should be placed in the hands of people whose training and life's work give proof that they know something about science and scholarship.\n\nIf reasonable people, nevertheless, favor military agencies for the distribution of a major part of the available funds, the reason for this lies in the fact that they subordinate cultural concerns to their general political outlook. We must then focus our attention on these practical political viewpoints, their origins and their implications. In doing so we shall soon recognize that the problem here under discussion is but one of many, and can only be fully estimated and properly adjudged when placed in a broader framework.\n\nThe tendencies we have mentioned are something new for America. They arose when, under the influence of the two World Wars and the consequent concentration of all forces on a military goal, a predominantly military mentality developed, which with the almost sudden victory became even more accentuated. The characteristic feature of this mentality is that people place the importance of what Bertrand Russell so tellingly terms \"naked power\" far above all other factors which affect the relations between peoples. The Germans, misled by Bismarck's successes in particular, underwent just such a transformation of their mentality\u2014in consequences of which they were entirely ruined in less than a hundred years.\n\nI must frankly confess that the foreign policy of the United States since the termination of hostilities has reminded me, sometimes irresistibly, of the attitude of Germany under Kaiser Wilhelm II, and I know that, independent of me, this analogy has most painfully occurred to others as well. It is characteristic of the military mentality that non-human factors (atom bombs, strategic bases, weapons of all sorts, the possession of raw materials, etc.) are held essential, while the human being, his desires and thoughts\u2014in short, the psychological factors\u2014are considered as unimportant and secondary. Herein lies a certain resemblance to Marxism, at least in so far as its theoretical side alone is kept in view. The individual is degraded to a mere instrument; he becomes \"human material.\" The normal ends of human aspiration vanish with such a viewpoint. Instead, the military mentality raises \"naked power\" as a goal in itself\u2014one of the strangest illusions to which men can succumb.\n\nIn our time the military mentality is still more dangerous than formerly because the offensive weapons have become much more powerful than the defensive ones. Therefore it leads, by necessity, to preventative war. The general insecurity that goes hand in hand with this results in the sacrifice of the citizen's civil rights to the supposed welfare of the state. Political witch-hunting, controls of all sorts (e.g., control of teaching and research, of the press, and so forth) appear inevitable, and for this reason do not encounter that popular resistance, which, were it not for the military mentaility, would provide a protection. A reappraisal of all values gradually takes place in so far as everything that does not clearly serve the utopian ends is regarded and treated as inferior.\n\nI see no other way out of prevailing conditions than a far-seeing, honest, and courageous policy with the aim of establishing security on supranational foundations. Let us hope that men will be found, sufficient in number and moral force, to guide the nation on this path so long as a leading role is imposed on her by external circumstances. Then problems such as have been discussed here will cease to exist\n\nSimOn February 15 a chunk of rock about 50 meters wide will whiz by Earth at nearly 8 km\/s, coming within 27,680 km of our planet's surface \u2014 closer than many weather and communications satellites.\n\nFor those of you more comfortable with imperial units, that's 165 feet wide traveling 17,800 mph coming within 17,200 miles. But regardless whether you prefer meters or miles, in astronomy that's what's called a close call.\n\nScientists stress that there's no danger of an impact by this incoming asteroid, designated 2012-DA14, but it's yet another reminder that in our neck of the Solar System we are definitely not alone.\n\n\"2012-DA14 will definitely not hit Earth,\" says JPL's near-Earth object specialist Don Yeomans. \"The orbit of the asteroid is known well enough to rule out an impact.\"\n\nBut with 2012-DA14\u2032s upcoming February flyby Yeomans notes, \"this is a record-setting close approach.\"\n\nThe rocky asteroid will come within about 4 Earth radii, which is well within the orbits of geosynchronous satellites. During its closest approach at 19:26 UTC it should be visible in the sky to amateur telescopes (but not the naked eye), becoming as bright as an 7th- or 8th-magnitude star.\n\nRadar observatories will be watching 2012-DA14 during the days leading up to and following its approach in an attempt to better determine its size, shape and trajectory.

Its shape and density are partly controlled by the internal magnetic field of the planet.\n\nFor Earth, which has a strong magnetic field, the ionosphere is relatively stable under a range of solar wind conditions. By comparison, Venus does not have its own internal magnetic field and relies instead on interactions with the solar wind to shape its ionosphere.\n\nThe extent to which this shaping depends on the strength of the solar wind has been controversial, but new results from Venus Express reveal for the first time the effect of a very low solar wind pressure on the ionosphere of an unmagnetised planet.\n\nThe observations were made in August 2010 when NASA's Stereo-B spacecraft measured a drop in solar wind density to 0.1 particles per cubic centimetre, around 50 times lower than normally observed; this persisted for about 18 hours.\n\nAs this significantly reduced solar wind hit Venus, Venus Express saw the planet's ionosphere balloon outwards on the planet's 'downwind' nightside, much like the shape of the ion tail seen streaming from a comet under similar conditions.\n\n\"The teardrop-shaped ionosphere began forming within 30\u201360 minutes after the normal high pressure solar wind diminished. Over two Earth days, it had stretched to at least two Venus radii into space,\" says Yong Wei of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany, lead author of the new findings.\n\nThe new observations settle a debate about how the strength of the solar wind affects the way in which ionospheric plasma is transported from the dayside to the nightside of Venus.\n\nUsually, this material flows along a thin channel in the ionosphere, but scientists were unsure what happens under low solar wind conditions. Does the flow of plasma particles increase as the channel widens due to the reduced confining pressure, or does it decrease because less force is available to push plasma through the channel?\n\n\"We now finally know that the first effect outweighs the second, and that the ionosphere expands significantly during low solar wind density conditions,\" says Markus Fraenz, also of the Max Planck Institute and co-author on the paper.\n\nA similar effect is also expected to occur around Mars, the other non-magnetised planet in our inner Solar System.\n\n\"We often talk about the effects of solar wind interaction with planetary atmospheres during periods of intense solar activity, but Venus Express has shown us that even when there is a reduced solar wind, the Sun can still significantly influence the environment of our planetary neighbours,\" adds H\u00e5kan Svedhem, ESA's Venus Express project scientist."}
{"text":"The nature of galaxies and scale of the universe were the subject of the Great Debate, a public program arranged in 1920 by the National Academy of Sciences at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Featured were talks by Shapley and the aforementioned Heber Curtis, who were recognized as spokesmen for opposite views on the nature of spiral nebulae and the Milky Way Galaxy. This so-called debate has often been cited as an illustration of how revolutionary new concepts are assimilated by science. It is sometimes compared to the debate, centuries before, over the motions of the Earth (the Copernican revolution); however, though as a focal point the debate about Earth's motion can be used to define the modern controversy, the Shapley-Curtis debate actually was much more complicated.\n\nA careful reading of the documents involved suggests that, on the broader topic of the scale of the universe, both men were making incorrect conclusions but for the same reasons\u2014namely, for being unable to accept and comprehend the incredibly large scale of things. Shapley correctly argued for an enormous Milky Way Galaxy on the basis of the P-L relation and the globular clusters, while Curtis incorrectly rejected these lines of evidence, advocating instead a small galactic system. Given a Milky Way Galaxy system of limited scale, Curtis could argue for and consider plausible the extragalactic nature of the spiral nebulae. Shapley, on the other hand, incorrectly rejected the island universe theory of the spirals (i.e., the hypothesis that there existed comparable galaxies beyond the boundaries of the Milky Way Galaxy) because he felt that such objects would surely be engulfed by the local galactic system. Furthermore, he put aside the apparent faint novae in M31, preferring to interpret S Andromeda as an ordinary nova, for otherwise that object would have been unbelievably luminous. Unfortunately for him, such phenomena\u2014called supernovae\u2014do in fact exist, as was realized a few years later. Curtis was willing to concede that there might be two classes of novae, yet, because he considered the Milky Way Galaxy to be small, he underestimated their differences. The van Maanen rotation also entered into Shapley's arguments: if spiral nebulae were rotating so fast, they must be within the Milky Way Galaxy as he conceived it. For Curtis, however, the matter provided less of a problem: even if spiral nebulae did rotate as rapidly as claimed, the small scale of Curtis's universe allowed them to have physically reasonable speeds.\n\nThe Shapley-Curtis debate took place near the end of the era of the single-galaxy universe. In just a few years the scientific world became convinced that Shapley's grand scale of the Milky Way Galaxy was correct and at the same time that Curtis was right about the nature of spiral nebulae. Such objects indeed lie even outside Shapley's enormous Milky Way Galaxy, and they range far beyond the distances that in 1920 seemed too vast for many astronomers to comprehend"}

{"text":"LONG BEACH, CALIF.\u2014One of the oddities of the universe revealed over the past decade is that galaxies and the giant black holes at their hubs fit together as if they were made for each other. This is one of those facts of life that sound obvious at first glance, but get stranger the more you think about them.\n\nA giant black hole is a formidable beast, surely able to bend the surrounding swarm of stars to its will. Yet even a giant black hole is still fairly small by the standards of a galaxy, so the galaxy should pay little heed to the monster within. The monster, for its part, is in direct contact with only a fairly small neighborhood and should be oblivious to what happens in the galaxy at large.\n\nYet astronomers find that black holes consistently have about 0.1 percent of the mass of their galaxies\u2014or, more precisely, of the portion of their galaxies that has an spheroidal shape (which, for an spheroidal galaxy, is the whole thing and, for a spiral galaxy such as our Milky Way, is only the innermost parts). Some astronomers argue that the black hole mass is related not to the mass of the galaxy per se, but to the velocity of the stars, but it amounts to much the same thing: black holes and their host galaxies are blood brothers.\n\nThe center of the Milky Way galaxy is a forbidding place, dominated by what astronomers strongly suspect is a black hole four million times the mass of the sun. But a new study provides evidence that stars are able to form there, despite the violent conditions stirred up by the supermassive gobbler.\n\nThe findings indicate that the clouds of gas at the galaxy's core must be denser than previously believed to coalesce into stars while resisting being ripped apart by the black hole's gravitational pull. Study leader Elizabeth Humphreys, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., presented the results yesterday at the semiannual meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Long Beach, Calif.\n\nJudge Helen Gillmor of the U.S. District Court in Hawaii dismissed the lawsuit Friday, saying the American judicial system has no jurisdiction over the $8-billion LHC, which is housed in a circular tunnel straddling the Swiss-French border. The New York Times is reporting on the dismissal"}
{"text":"The interstellar medium, composed primarily of gas and dust, occupies the regions between the stars. On average, it contains less than one atom in each cubic centimetre, with about 1 percent of its mass in the form of minute dust grains. The gas, mostly hydrogen, has been mapped by means of its 21-cm emission line. The gas also contains numerous molecules. Some of these have been detected by the visible-wavelength absorption lines that they impose on the spectra of more-distant stars, while others have been identified by their own emission lines at millimetre wavelengths. Many of the interstellar molecules are found in giant molecular clouds, wherein complex organic molecules have been discovered.\n\nIn the vicinity of a very hot O- or B-type star, the intensity of ultraviolet radiation is sufficiently high to ionize the surrounding hydrogen out to a distance as great as 100 parsecs to produce an H II region, known as a Str\u00f6mgren sphere. Such regions are strong and characteristic emitters of radiation at radio wavelengths, and their dimensions are well calibrated in terms of the luminosity of the central star. Using radio interferometers, astronomers are able to measure the angular diameters of H II regions even in some external galaxies and can thereby deduce the great distances to those remote systems. This method can be used for distances up to about 30 megaparsecs. (For additional information on H II regions, seenebula: Diffuse nebulae (H II regions).)\n\nInterstellar dust grains (seenebula: Interstellar dust) scatter and absorb starlight, with the effect being roughly inversely proportional to wavelength from the infrared to the near ultraviolet. As a result, stellar spectra tend to be reddened. Absorption amounts typically to about one magnitude per kiloparsec but varies considerably in different directions. Some dusty regions contain silicate materials, identified by a broad absorption feature around a wavelength of 10 \u03bcm. Other prominent spectral features in the infrared range have been sometimes, but not conclusively, attributed to graphite grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.\n\nStarlight often shows a small degree of polarization (a few percent), with the effect increasing with stellar distance. This is attributed to the scattering of the starlight from dust grains that have been partially aligned in a weak interstellar magnetic field. The strength of this field is estimated to be a few microgauss, very close to the strength inferred from observations of nonthermal cosmic radio noise. This radio background has been identified as synchrotron radiation, emitted by cosmic-ray electrons traveling at nearly the speed of light and moving along curved paths in the interstellar magnetic field. The spectrum of the cosmic radio noise is close to what is calculated on the basis of measurements of the cosmic rays near Earth.\n\nCosmic rays constitute another component of the interstellar medium. Cosmic rays that are detected in the vicinity of Earth comprise high-speed nuclei and electrons. Individual particle energies, expressed in electron volts (eV; 1 eV = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg), range with decreasing numbers from about 106 eV to more than 1020 eV. Among the nuclei, hydrogen nuclei are the most plentiful at 86 percent, helium nuclei next at 13 percent, and all other nuclei together at about 1 percent. Electrons are about 2 percent as abundant as the nuclear component. (The relative numbers of different nuclei vary somewhat with kinetic energy, while the electron proportion is strongly energy-dependent.)\n\nA minority of cosmic rays detected in Earth's vicinity are produced in the Sun, especially at times of increased solar activity (as indicated by sunspots and solar flares). The origin of galactic cosmic rays has not yet been conclusively identified, but they are thought to be produced in stellar processes such as supernova explosions, perhaps with additional acceleration occurring in the interstellar regions. (For additional information on interstellar matter, seeMilky Way Galaxy: The general interstellar medium.)\n\nThe central region of the Milky Way Galaxy is so heavily obscured by dust that direct observation has become possible only with the development of astronomy at nonvisual wavelengths\u2014namely, radio, infrared, and, more recently, X-ray and gamma-ray wavelengths. Together, these observations have revealed a nuclear region of intense activity, with a large number of separate sources of emission and a great deal of dust. Detection of gamma-ray emission at a line energy of 511,000 eV, which corresponds to the annihilation of electrons and positrons (the antimatter counterpart of electrons), along with radio mapping of a region no more than 20 AU across, points to a very compact and energetic source, designated Sagittarius A*, at the centre of the galaxy (seeSagittarius A). Sagittarius A* is a supermassive black hole with a mass equivalent to 4,310,000 Suns"}

In such maps, Aquarius is visualized as facing Eridanus, requiring a different perspective and a redesign of how the stars of Aquarius connect, so the water pours onto the same side as Eridanus.\n\nHistory and mythology\n\nAccording to one theory, the Greek constellation takes its name from the Babylonian constellation known as the Star of Eridu (MUL.NUN.KI). Eridu\n\nEriduwas an ancient city in the extreme south of Babylonia; situated in the marshy regions it was held sacred to the god Enki-Ea who ruled the cosmic domain of the Abyss - a mythical conception of the fresh-water reservoir below the Earth's surface.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Pha\u00ebton or Phaethon was the son of Helios and the Oceanid Clymene. Alternate, less common genealogies make him a son of Clymenus by Merope, of Helios and Rhode or of Helios and Prote' sky chariot (i.e., the Sun), but didn't have the strength to control it and so veered wildly in different directions, scorching both earth and heaven. Zeus intervened by striking Pha\u00ebton dead with a thunderbolt and casting him to earth. The constellation was supposed to be the path Pha\u00ebton drove along; in later times, it was considered a path of souls. Since Eridanos was also a Greek name for the Po (Latin Padus), in which the burning body of Pha\u00ebton is said by Ovid to have extinguished, the mythic geography of the celestial and earthly Eridanus is complex.\n\nEquivalents\n\nThe stars that correspond to Eridanus are also depicted as a river in Indian astronomy. Eridanus is called Srotaswini sr\u00f3tas meaning the course of a river or stream. Specifically, it is depicted as the Ganges on the head of Dakshinamoorthy stars that correspond to Eridanus cannot be fully seen from China.

{"text":"There had to be a Type II Supernova in the vicinity of our resultant Sun, because the elements found in the Sun and in the Earth (and other planets in the Solar System had to be created in a Supernova (and were not simply the result of the Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Many stars lack these heavier elements which are in our system. We know that there was a supernova because of these resultant elements which would not be there otherwise.\n\nThe presence of elements heavier than helium is evidence for probably several supernovae in the 10 billion years between the formation of the galaxy and the birth of the Sun and its retinue of planets.\nThe question, however, had to do with a supernova about 1 million years ago that might have blown out the \"local bubble\" in which we seem to reside.\n\nThe Sun had sisters when it was born. In fact, according to new research, it had hundreds of thousands of siblings.\nAnd at least one was a supernova, providing further support for the idea that there could be lots of planets around other stars since our solar system emerged in such an explosive environment.\n\n\"We know that the majority of stars in our galaxy were born in star clusters. Now we also know that the newborn solar system not only arose in such a cluster, but also survived the impact of an exploding star. This suggests that planetary systems are impressively rugged and may be common in even the most tumultuous stellar nurseries\" - Leslie Looney, who arrived at the solar sibling finding along with his colleagues at the University of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignThe best candidate for the most recent SN in the local bubble is a old pulsar called Geminiga. It probably went SN between 120 and 180 light years from earth about 2 million years ago. There was a mass extinction of certain classes of radiation sensitive marine animals at the time.\n\nThe local bubble (or chimney) is a region with less than 1\/10 of the normal milky way interstellar gas density. It's about 300 ly across and was created\/cleared by up to 6 supernovae from the Sco-Cen OB association. The sun is near to one wall and will encounter higher density gas again within 100,000 years. In fact we might have started to encounter a higher density region already (the local fluff).\n\nThe local bubble is not unique. Sco-Cen is creating another bubble at the moment (Loop 1) and there are several other known bubbles associated with the Perseus OB assoc, the Pleiades and others.\n\nThe big theory issue is what happens to the solar system. In the local bubble the sun's heliopause is 100 AU+ out (About perihelion of Sedna). When we reenter \"normal\" gas some researchers think that the heli0pause will be inside the orbit of Jupiter. Under these circumstances the earth will be far more exposed to interstellar events than now.\n\nLocal Bubble\n\n[QUOTE=Azpod;4099]I haven't heard of this event before, so I am curious.\n\nAzpod. The exact morphological characteristics (shape) of the Local Bubble remains somewhat in dispute. (Try Googling Local Bubble). A good initial summary was published many moons ago in Sky & Telescope,circa 1994-5, (Dec.-Jan?) by Alyssa Goodman of the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. In it an artists rendition of the structure from then-radio-surveys indicated a slight oval or prolate spheroid...quite typical of a supernova remnant (my area of interest).Recently, Local Bubble conferences have decided to coordinate observations over wide ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, to create instrumental overlap of times of observing the same patch of sky(a good thing), and to try to publish data with images in standardized formats by size, so that infrared, visible, UV, X-ray, gamma ray, microwave, radio..might all be overlapped for coincident observations.(a better thing)\nDoppler estimates of the velocity of the expanding walls of the Local Bubble give ~ 25-30 km\/sec. This is interesting because it's at ~ that range that the temperature of the walls begins to allow the growth of dust grains of refractory compounds (those with high melting points...as you cool plasma down, they appear first)olivine, silica, pyroxene etc. (read stuff by Eli Dwek, NASA Space Goddard).\nMy interest has been in the microwave contribution that the wall brings to the CMB. It is at least thermodynamically possible for the wall to produce a microwave hiss, smooth to ~one part in 10,000, with a slight asymmetry due to parity effects in supernova remnants. Initially, I had hoped to find what percentage contribution the wall might make to some sort of systemic error in measuring the CMB. I was both quite surprised and delighted to find that there is sufficient kinetic energy deposited to give an upper limit of ~ 2.79 K for it's hiss....all local.\nThere is of course the historical evidence for catastrophic loss of life in the late Bronze age..~540 AD, well documented by the Irish dendrochronologist (tree rings) Michael Baillie, at Queens College, Dublin. Catastrophic loss of life occurred in all cultures worldwide. From typical supernova expansion velocities, and the distance from the sun to the presumed epicenter of the Local Bubble, I had predicted in 1994-5 that the primary supernova event should have taken place ~1800-2000 years ago, and was in all probability the origin of the the popular legend of the Star of Bethlehem, to be accompanied by a dusting of the surface of Earth and Mars between 450-600 AD. At less than 5 light years...that's a show.\nThe authors' argument for an earlier epoch for the sun's sister is also possible, of course, and some might consider the lost Pleiad, that disappeared during the Trojan War epoch, but neither of those accounts for the tree ring\nanomaly documented by M.Baillie. An isotopic analysis of marine core sediments from the ~ 540 Ad era should prove interesting. If it's rich in hematite (like the surface of Mars) or iron-60, it will prove interesting.\nAs Steve Strom at Umass has shown that stars that form in clusters usually have common magnetic polarizations, the Local Bubble ought to carry a polarization linked somewhat anomalously to the sun's spin axis....Tegmark's axis-of-evil. Interesting. Pete. theimagination...\n\nOriginally Posted by eburacum45 theEburacum. The image printed in Sky & Telescope, accompanying the article by Ms Goodman, indicated an epicenter ~ 45 light years from the sun.\nExpansion velocities of type 2 supernovae at least, (published by Alexei Fillipenko in the Astrophysical Journal,)following SN1987a, indicated velocities as high as c\/10 for expansion of the ejecta. If that ejecta expands into a bubble previously cleared by a supernova, it can cover 180 light years (the ~ radius of the published graphic), in about 1800 years. A. Fillipenko is one of the world's leading theorists in supernova theory.\nWe live in a remnant....the Local Bubble...along with several dozen other nearby ultraviolet emitting stars. That's how the Local Bubble is defined...those stars beyond the \"swept\" volume have their ultraviolet emissions absorbed, or scattered by the intervening dust and gas. That epoch was recent enough that a second supernova would expand it's ejecta almost unhindered, producing the ~180 light year radius Local Bubble in ~1800-2000 years.\nIt is of more than a curiosity that such a second ejecta cloud, running into a primary ejecta cloud, and braking, would give off first an optical, then an infrared, then a microwave display. It is also of more than a curiosity that kinematic equations using no dark matter, no dark energy, and no Big Bang, but only conservation of momentum, conservation of energy, and the Stefan-Boltzmann Law yield an upper limit to the energy density of the microwave hiss at ~ 2.79 K, for the present Bubble wall velocity (~25 km\/sec)...not far from the observed 2.72.(Hartford AAPT Meeting, \"Downsizing the Big Bang\", ATM thread Local Bubble CMB..trinitree88.\nWhile it is true that the exact morphology of the Local Bubble remains a construct in progress...CMB maps routinely subtract all foregrounds...potential sources of the CMB itself.\nThe argument that no dust can emit smoothly has been taken up in it's appropriate forum..ATM. The Astrophysical Journal article by Hines , Low & Schreiber found dust using Hubble's NICMOS, around HD98800, emitting in a SED best fit by a near blackbody curve around 165 K.\nRecent work on Cas A, and Tycho's remnant by Dwek indicates spectral fits best modeled by the presence of iron whiskers in the remnant interior. We live in a remnant interior.Kind of reminds me of Steinbeck's short story...\"The Lottery\". They draw straws and then kill somebody every year by stoning them to death...because they always have. Fun community..... Pete\n\nThe Solar System sits within a shell or bubble of expanding hot gas that radiate low-energy X-rays, known as the \"Local Hot Bubble\" created by a supernova. A study using data from the XMM-Newton Space Telescope has shown that this local bubble is being compressed by an even more recent supernova remnant, the \"Loop 1 Superbubble\", which is expanding faster and is compressing an area of cool dense gas, known as the Wall, that lies between the two shells.\n\nThe Local Hot Bubble because of this and many more ancient remnants has actually an hourglass shape.\n\nThe high-latitude Galactic H I cloud toward the extragalactic radio source 3C 225 is characterised by very narrow 21 cm emission and absorption indicative of a very low H I spin temperature of about 20 K. Through high-resolution optical spectroscopy, we report the detection of strong, very narrow Na I absorption corresponding to this cloud toward a number of nearby stars. Assuming that the turbulent H I and Na I motions are similar, we derive a cloud temperature of 20 (+6, -8) K (in complete agreement with the 21 cm results) and a line-of-sight turbulent velocity of 0.37 \u00b10.08 km\/s from a comparison of the H I and Na I absorption linewidths. We also place a firm upper limit of 45 pc on the distance of the cloud, which situates it well inside the Local Bubble in this direction and makes it the nearest-known cold diffuse cloud discovered to date.\n\n[QUOTE=trinitree88;856462[\/QUOTE] travelling travellingEburacum. Agreed, if that's the required velocity for Geminga, it's too high.1%c is about the limit..must be another pulsar, hopefully yet to be found.\nAs to whether the bubble dominates the radio sky, or not, I'll stick to my conservation laws here...at ~180 light years, 25-30 km\/sec, it's almost entirely microwave, with a column density just sufficient to quench exo-bubble stars' ultraviolet through Rayleigh-Taylor scattering.\n\nH1 distributions...\n\nOriginally Posted by Ken GKen G. It now seems that overlaying microwave emissions with gas velocity distributions of H1 regions is adding some interest in the community in mechanisms for the generation of microwaves from the implicit geometry of these areas. Good. I'll be keeping a light tab on these activities as they warm up.pete"}

E-mail Alan, or connect via Facebook, Twitter or Google+.\n\nA long-exposure Hubble Space Telescope image shows a majestic face-on spiral galaxy located deep within the Coma Cluster of galaxies, which lies 320 million light-years away in the northern constellation Coma Berenices.\n\nGalactic jewel shines in its setting\n\nSeen one galaxy, seen 'em all? Not on your life: The Hubble Space Telescope has captured lots of fantastic pictures of spiral galaxies during its 20-plus years of operation, as you can see in our lineup of \"Hubble's Greatest Hits.\" But I have a feeling that today's image of the galaxy NGC 4911 will be joining the hit parade.\n\nThis jewel and the other gems in the setting are part of the Coma Cluster, a gathering of galaxies 320 million light-years away from Earth in the northern constellation Coma Berenices. You can make out the wispy tracks of NGC 4911's outer spiral arms, which are being pulled out by the gravitational tug of the neighboring galaxy just to the right (known as NGC 4911A). In today's image release, the Hubble Heritage team says that the material stripped away from the central spiral will be dispersed throughout the galaxy, fueling the creation of new stars.\n\nThe cluster is home to nearly 1,000 galaxies in all - and the gravitational interactions involving all those galaxies spark starbirth galore. In NGC 4911, you can see the sparkles of newborn star clusters sprinkled amid iridescent pink clouds of hydrogen. And if you look closely at a higher-resolution view of the scene, you'll spot dozens of galaxies in the background where that story of creation is being repeated countless times.\n\nThis picture is the result of 28 hours' worth of exposures made over the course of three years, using Hubble's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 and the Advanced Camera for Surveys. Some of those exposures were made in 2006 and 2007, before the ACS broke down and the WFPC2 was replaced. Others were made in 2009, after the ACS was fixed and WFPC2 was replaced by Wide Field Camera 3. All those exposures were put together for the Hubble Heritage project.\n\nI loved that movie Mob-Barley, it stirred my emotions when that happened because I could imagine what if felt like if that could happen to me. I wish I could go out and explore space like I jump in my car to go out for a night on the town.\n\nMy favorite part about the Hubble pics like this are all of the other smaller galaxies floating around in the 'background'. To imagine that if Hubble could get the angle necessary, this same pic could be taken of each of those and this galaxy would be one of those floating around in the 'background'. Then to just try and wrap your head around the distances between two objects in this one pic is mind-numbing. They should include one of those legends like they have on maps that show...one inch = x distance. : ) That would be funny.\n\nEven though its amazing to see something so far away....the fact that there isn't any push to create a propulsion system capable of taking us there ( as in a few hours\/weeks\/months) makes it less important.\n\nWe need to leave this planet, regardless what people think, humans are explorers and need to have more new homes in order to survive...or one big rock could smash into earth and its GAME OVER\n\nThe fastest man made object in space travels at 18 km\/sec (Voyager). At this rate, we can't send humans beyond the solar system. Other planets in our solar system can be an experimental bed, but can't be called home.\n\nLet's say, if we develop an engine in the next couple of million of years, that travels at 1% the speed of light. Then it'll take the engine 100 years to reach the distance of 1 light-year. If we're lucky to find any planets within a distance of 5 light years (say) having a rocky core, oxygen and water, then 5-6 generations of humans may travel, having to live in the space ship for about 500-600 years. Its very questionable whether a space ship can survive that long without complete repairs (the ISS can live for 20), not to mention human beings.\n\nI understand the \"we've made a lot of progress in 100 years\" theme, but I wonder if mankind will find a solution to the speed\/distance conundrum. It will need a lot of ingenuity and luck to escape from Earth. Ingenuity because it becomes harder to manipulate matter and energies on a large scale. It's one thing to accelerate an electron to 99% the speed of light, yet another to do that to 1000kg of mass. Luck because, the closer the planet is to us, obviously our chances are better.\n\nBut we do need find another place before time runs out. We don't have a choice. It'll be an epic story, if we're successful.\n\nInitially we will get our best \"push\" the same we way we always did...SURFING!!...little hotrodders in their modified solar sails will hang around the sun hoping to \"ride the big one, bro\"........after that the naysayers will make nanny laws about getting to close to the sun and tell stories of icarus...till then the loudest din in the house is going to be \"why bother, it is sooo impossible\" ...wonder what kind of wax one uses on a proverbial solar board...hydrogenated coconut oil perhaps??? (proton field induced collapsed magnetic induction thermal shields might be a second suggestion, any other ideas out there?)\n\nIt will happen, the real question should be when, orwill we still be around for it to happen. Baring our destroying ourselves or some comic disaster that wipes out our species we will eventually get there.\n\nWe just need to learn to crawl before we can learn to walk, and walk before we can learn to run, right now our species is still in the crib.\n\nBut just look at how fast technology is advancing, what will it be like in 50 years? who knows.\n\nThank you Alan for bringing us this wonderful information. I especially enjoyed the Hubble Heritage site.\n\n - There is a portion that speaks about a \"soft capture mechanism\". it's sad to think that the hubble doesn't get any more astronaut visit to repair or upgrade it. I know Chandra and other telescopes are bringing us beautiful images but Hubble is just magnificent. the day the use the soft capture mechanism to bring Hubble down to earth will be a bittersweet day for me.\n\nawesome picture, I wonder exactly where that galaxy is right now, knowing it took 320 million light years to get those photons into the big light bucket in the sky (hubble). It would matter where it is now if one wanted to set a course for the heart of that sun..more so, it matters now, if one was looking for gravity waves emananting form THAT black hole AND one assumed (like I do) that gravity waves travels much faster than c. Some food for thought all."}
{"text":"Explosions Starve Black Holes\n\nby Andrea Thompson, Senior Writer\n\nDate: 12 January 2008 Time: 08:30 AM ET\n\nAn illustration of a black hole \"starving\" as its surrounding gas is evaporated. CREDIT: NASA\/JPL-Caltech\/T.Pyle (SSC)\n\nLONG BEACH,\nCalif. - Supermassive black holes are thought to lurk at the heart of\nessentially all galaxies bigger than our own. Their powerful gravity should be luring\nin galactic matter, feeding the black holes' voracious appetites.\n\nHowever, while\nplenty of gas is available for these black\nholes to feast upon, few of them have been observed to actively\naccrete gas from their home galaxy, presenting astronomers with a puzzle as\nto why these black holes aren't eating. Something must be preventing the black\nholes from accreting gas, though no one has known exactly what that was.\n\n\"This\nhas been a longstanding problem,\" said Q. Daniel Wang of the University of\nMassachusetts at Amherst.\n\nNow, Wang\nand his colleagues have some possible suspects behind the starving black holes:\nexploding stars, or supernovas.\n\nWang and\nhis team investigated the starvation of the supermassive black holes at the\ncenter of two galaxies, M31 (aka the Andromeda Galaxy, our nearest galactic\nneighbor) and NGC 5866. They presented their findings here this week at the\n213th meeting of the American Astronomical Society.\n\nWith both\nof these galaxies, and others, the precise clue that the galaxies aren't\nfeeding is the lack of large amounts of radiation coming from the nucleus of\nthe galaxy, which astronomers would expect to detect from an actively eating\nblack hole. What makes the lack of radiation most perplexing is that plenty of\ngas should be expelled by older stars and their remnants, such as planetary nebulas, and accumulating in\nthe galactic bulges of the galaxies (the tightly-packed group of stars found in\nthe center of galaxies, where the black hole resides).\n\nWhat was\nhappening to that gas has been a mystery. Astronomers had surmised that the gas\n\"has to be removed continuously from the bulge,\" Wang said, otherwise\nthe black holes would be feasting on it.\n\nThese\nexplosions occur when a massive star's core stops generating energy and\ncollapses in on itself, releasing energy that heats and expels the star's outer\nlayers - the star goes supernova.\n\nSupernovas\ncome in slightly varying types.\n\nType 1a supernovas\nare constantly exploding throughout a given galaxy. These exploding stars send\nout a shockwave - what Wang calls an \"interstellar tsunami\" - that\npropagates throughout the gas in the galaxy. Wang and his team simulated the\neffect of these shockwaves on the gas accumulation around the galaxy?s center.\n\nThe\ninterstellar tsunami works in a similar manner to tsunamis on Earth: The\nshockwave generated by an earthquake below the ocean has little effect where\nthe ocean is deep and can absorb the energy, but when that wave reaches shallow\nwater, it forms the characteristic enormous wave that slams onto the coast.\n\nLikewise,\nthe hot gas in the galaxy can absorb the supernova's shock, but when the wave\nreaches the cool gas expelled by dying stars, it steepens and pounds the\ncentral disk of the galaxy, evaporating the gas.\n\nBecause\nthese supernova explosions are happening all the time, they continue to pound\naway at the disk; the gravity of a less massive galaxy can't counteract the\nevaporating energy of the supernovae, so the gas can?t accumulate, and the\nblack hole starves.\n\nThe\ninterruption of the gas accumulation also affects the evolution of the galaxy,\nWang noted.\n\nMore\nmassive galaxies, on the other hand, have a bigger gravitational pull that\nkeeps the gas from leaving."}

{"text":"SUMMARY: After surveying 120,000 nearby galaxies as part of the Sloan Digital Survey, a team of astronomers have found evidence that the growth of supermassive black holes at the heart of most galaxies is closely matched to the rate of new star formation. The growth rate of the black holes was determined by measuring the amount of material being consumed at the heart of the galaxy. The actual nature of this relationship is still unknown, but future surveys will help to uncover more details.\n\nComments or questions about this story? Feel free to share your thoughts.\n\nArramon\n\n2003-Jul-16, 09:15 PM\n\nWe must discover what lies at the heart of a black hole and beyond it before any theories may be brought forth..... for all we know, the spinning force of the black hole may be the catalist that is pouring energy into the formation of stars...\nlike sparks from flint upon steel....\nIf what lies beyond is any indication of how these 'holes' are formed, then the answers lay within our own galaxian center. Is it possible to analyze the structure of a black hole enough that we may know the ingredients of them?\nThe atomic structures? I try to envision that all the energy ever needed for life resides within the black holes.... that when the matter around it is drawn towards the 'hole', the material released is what gives the galaxy its form and mass and compilation of ingredients that form the stars we see, and thus the other objects that apply to a galaxy....\nAlthough galaxies differ in many ways, there seems to always be a center to its function... and if none is there, then the core of that galaxy may be depleted enough that the black hole has collapsed into itself... leaving behind the many beauties that we see from the Hubble and Chadra images...\n\nAs the galaxy expands, so does its center...\nthats an interesting observation.. but to what ends can it expand... how much matter must be consumed? and how much energy can it produce?\n\nMaybe Black Holes are consistent with solar energy... solar panels are used to gain energy from the sun, then used to power electrical instruments...\nCould a black hole have the opposite effect? Its energy is released when matter is drawn in, instead of energy being drawn in and matter released...\n\naahhh.... too much to think about!! =)\nwell...never too much... but a whole massive amount!\nIf anyone has any answers for these ?? and thoughts please let me know!!"}
{"text":"Moon Phases\n\nEducational Sponsor\n\nDark Skies\n\nCurrent Global Traffic\n\nThe galaxies pictured here have so much dust surrounding them that the brilliant light from their quasars cannot be seen in these images NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. Quasars are the brilliant beacons of light that are powered by black holes feasting on captured material, and in the process, heating some of the matter to millions of degrees. Image credit: NASA\/ESA\/Yale\n\nWhen it comes to the early Universe, apparently black holes and their resultant quasars expanded in small steps rather than giant leaps. According to new observations taken by the Hubble , most quasars were formed gradually. These mega-watt light sources are fueled by black holes consuming material and run a temperature of up to millions of degrees. The very brightest of these are found in galaxies distorted by collisions \u2013 where the maelstrom of materials is eagerly seized by voracious black holes. Astronomers are now taking a closer look at \"normal\" spiral galaxies and finding a host of faint quasars which appear to have been triggered by black holes ingesting smaller fuel sources \u2013 such as a satellite galaxy or a cloud of gas. These findings came through a census of 30 quasar host galaxies taken with the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes. Out of the survey, 26 of the host galaxies show no signs of having been part of a galaxy interaction.\n\nThey had no unusual shapes and only one of the group had evidence of galaxy collision event. All of the survey candidates were also roughly the same age \u2013 about 8 to 12 billion years old \u2013 formed at the peak of black hole growth.\n\nThe study, led by Kevin Schawinski of Yale University, upholds previous observations which show the enlargement of a majority of massive black holes in the early Universe were fueled by small events over a period of time \u2013 not huge steps which occurred quickly.\n\n\"Quasars that are products of galaxy collisions are very bright,\" Schawinski said. \"The objects we looked at in this study are the more typical quasars. They're a lot less luminous. The brilliant quasars born of galaxy mergers get all the attention because they are so bright and their host galaxies are so messed up. But the typical bread-and-butter quasars are actually where most of the black-hole growth is happening. They are the norm, and they don't need the drama of a collision to shine.\"\n\nSchawinski's science paper has been accepted for publication in a letter to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. In his work, Schawinski examined galaxies observed by the Spitzer and Hubble telescopes in the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey.\n\nHowever, they weren't just a random choice. In infrared images taken by Spitzer, 30 dusty galaxies about the same mass as the Milky Way glowed more brightly than the rest \u2013 a clue that the dust was covering up quasar activity at visible wavelengths. Thanks to Spitzer's capabilities, dust poses no problem and infrared light imaging allowed Schawinski to study their structures in detail.\n\nAn Artist's interpretation of a Quasar\n\nBut, Spitzer wasn't the only camera in action. Schawinski also employed near-infrared images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3. These well-resolved images provided for careful analysis of the galaxy's shapes \u2013 shapes which would have been distorted if they had been involved in a merger event. Of these, only one showed evidence of an interaction. So what's going on with quasars? Just what is providing their power?\n\nWhatever is responsible is apparently below the detection capability of Hubble. \"I think it's a combination of processes, such as random stirring of gas, supernovae blasts, swallowing of small bodies, and streams of gas and stars feeding material into the nucleus,\" Schawinski said.\n\nWhen it comes to a quasars, it doesn't take much gas to ignite them. \"There's more than enough gas within a few light-years from the center of our Milky Way to turn it into a quasar,\" Schawinski explained. \"It just doesn't happen. But it could happen if one of those small clouds of gas ran into the black hole.\n\nRandom motions and stirrings inside the galaxy would channel gas into the black hole. Ten billion years ago, those random motions were more common and there was more gas to go around. Small galaxies also were more abundant and were swallowed up by larger galaxies.\"\n\nThe studies aren't ending here, though. The galaxies in Schawinski's study are prime targets for NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, a large infrared observatory scheduled to launch later this decade. \"To get to the heart of what kinds of events are powering the quasars in these galaxies, we need the Webb telescope. Hubble and Spitzer have been the trailblazers for finding them.\""}

{"text":"Giant Stars Bare Their Whirling Hearts\n\nA giant disguise. Although the surface of a cool giant star usually rotates slowly, its core\u2014shown here as white and blue\u2014spins fast.\n\nCredit: Paul G. Beck\/Leuven University, Belgium\n\nBeauty can be just skin deep. So can stellar spin. Cool giant stars usually have surfaces that rotate slowly, but now NASA's Kepler spacecraft has revealed that their cores spin far faster. By stirring up a star's interior, rapid rotation can affect how a star lives and dies. Furthermore, because our sun will one day become a giant, the discovery provides insight into its future.\n\nToday, our sun is a main-sequence star, converting hydrogen into helium at its core. When the core runs out of hydrogen, 6.4 billion years from now, the element will begin burning in a layer around the core, making the sun expand, brighten, and cool until it becomes a yellow giant, then an orange giant, and finally a red giant. Giants are rare, accounting for less than 1% of all stars, but because of their brilliance\u2014they typically emit 100 times more light than our sun\u2014they make quite a splash in the night. The fourth brightest nighttime star, named Arcturus, is an orange giant, and the sixth brightest, Capella, consists of a pair of yellow giants.\n\nAstronomers measure how fast a star's surface spins by exploiting the Doppler shift. One side of a star spins toward us, producing a blueshift, while the other side spins away, producing a redshift. That means every spectral line gets smeared out, and the broader the spectral lines, the faster the spin. Such observations show that the surfaces of most yellow, orange, and red giants rotate slowly\u2014but the observations say nothing about what's happening beneath the surface.\n\nNow Paul Beck of the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium and his colleagues have used data from the Kepler space observatory to study the cores of three yellow giant stars named KIC 5356201, KIC 8366239, and KIC 12008916. The stars are only 20% to 50% more massive than the sun, but they're about five times larger and 800\u00b0 to 950\u00b0C cooler.\n\nKepler monitors tiny dips in starlight that occur when planets pass in front of their stars. But vibrations running through a star also cause starlight to vary. Just as seismologists employ earthquakes to probe our planet's mantle and core, so astronomers use these so-called asteroseismological vibrations to study stellar interiors. From more than a year's worth of Kepler data, Beck and his colleagues report online today in Nature that the cores of all three giant stars spin at least 10 times faster than their surfaces.\n\n\"This is really a beautiful result,\" says astronomer Marc Pinsonneault of Ohio State University in Columbus, noting the frustration astronomers face in being unable to observe something as crucial as a star's internal spin. \"It's been a terrible problem: We know that rotation is important, we know that it can change the lives of stars quite a bit, but we've had surprisingly little data on what the insides of stars are actually doing.\" Pinsonneault says the discovery suggests that when the sun becomes a giant, it will also have a fast-spinning core, which may affect how the sun sheds its outer atmosphere and transitions from a red giant to a white dwarf.\n\nBeck says that elementary physics can explain his finding. When a star's core runs out of hydrogen, it contracts. \"Similar to an ice skater who's doing a pirouette, when you pull your arms toward you, you start to spin faster,\" Beck says, and so the star's core spins up. Just the opposite happens to the star's surface: it expands, so it spins more slowly."}
{"text":"Unveiling new Galactic surprises\n\n15 February 2012\n\nThe \"Galactic Haze\" as measured by Planck, seen as a glow near the Galactic Centre. The dark band across the middle is where strong emission from the rest of the Galaxy has been blanked out. The origin of the Haze is not yet known, though there are a number of possibilities. Image credit: ESA\/Planck collaboration.\n\nThe European Space Agency's Planck mission with the support of University astronomers has unveiled more surprises about our Galaxy, bringing scientists closer to being able to understand the structure of the Universe.\n\nThe results include previously unknown clouds of cold gas, and a mysterious haze of microwave emission near the centre of the Galaxy.\n\nPlanck is surveying the sky at microwave wavelengths, with a primary science goal of observing the Cosmic Microwave Background - the afterglow of the Big Bang. But in the course of its cosmological quest Planck is also making maps of anything in the foreground, which includes our own Galaxy.\n\nAstronomers from around the world including those from the University's School of Physics and Astronomy are busily pouring over these maps, with some of the intermediate results being presented for the first time.\n\nMost of the emission from our Galaxy is due to hot gas and dust between the stars, or from very energetic electrons moving through magnetic fields. Planck's instruments are also able to pick up the emission from very cold clouds of gas scattered throughout the Milky Way.\n\nThe main constituent of these clouds is hydrogen, though this is very difficult to observe as hydrogen molecules do not emit much light. Instead, astronomers identify the gas clouds by detecting emission from carbon monoxide molecules, which although rarer is much easier to detect.\n\n\"It is great that such data comes serendipitously through the course of getting to the principal Planck science results,\" said Dr Locke Spencer, School of Physics and Astronomy, and member of the Planck collaboration.\n\n\"Observations of carbon monoxide at these wavelengths are very challenging to obtain, and require many experts of different specialities working together. The full-sky map of carbon monoxide will provide a vital resource for astronomers using other telescopes, pointing out new places to look for stars in the process of forming,\" he added.\n\nAn even more unusual result is the detection of a mysterious haze of microwave emission near the Galactic centre. A relatively well understood phenomenon, called 'synchrotron emission', involves very fast electrons travelling through magnetic fields. The haze, however, seems to be caused by an unexpectedly energetic population of electrons, the origin of which is uncertain.\n\nThere are a number of possible explanations for the haze, though none have been confirmed. It could be that there are more supernovae occurring in the centre of the Galaxy than previously thought, or that the flow of material from the Galactic centre is stronger for some reason.\n\nA more intriguing possibility is that the electrons could be the result of the annihilation of dark matter particles. If true, this would provide a new way for tracing this unusual constituent of the Universe.\n\n\"We always knew that with all sky coverage in nine wavebands we would make unexpected discoveries,\" said Professor Peter Ade, School of Physics and Astronomy, who has been responsible for building, testing and calibrating the ultra-cold sensitive detectors at the heart of the High Frequency Instrument.\n\n\"The detection of the galactic centre haze and the serendipitous mapping of cold gas are good examples of this. As we continue to dig deeper into the images and results we should expect many more fascinating discoveries,\" he adds."}

The flare contains lots of oxygen, but no hydrogen -- the most abundant element in \"normal\" stars like the Sun.\n\nFrom this and other factors, the team deduced that the system probably consists of two stellar corpses: a white dwarf and a black hole.\n\nA white dwarf is the final stage of life for a star like the Sun. It's a small, dense ball of carbon and oxygen that no longer produces energy, but that shines because it's extremely hot. A black hole is packed so tightly that not even light can escape from it.

The results appear in the June 20 Astrophysical Journal\nLetters.\n\nIn ultraviolet light, Hubble has resolved a small hook-like\nappendage extending from Mira in the direction of the companion, which\nmight be material from Mira being gravitationally drawn toward the\nsmaller star. Alternately, it could be material in Mira's upper\natmosphere being heated due to the companion's presence.\n\nHubble's visible-light images show that Mira has an odd,\nasymmetrical shape resembling a football. This may be tied to dramatic\nchanges occurring during its expansion-contraction cycles, or to the\npresence of unresolved spots on its surface.

{"text":"Thursday, July 19, 2012\n\nHow To Build A Middleweight Black Hole\n\nA new model for intermediate black hole formation parallels growth of giant planets\n\nA new model shows how an elusive type of black hole can be formed in the gas surrounding their supermassive counterparts. In research published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, scientists from the American Museum of Natural History, the City University of New York,This simulated image shows the interaction between a massive gas giant planet (comparable in mass to Jupiter) and a surrounding protoplanetary disk of gas and dust. New research predicts that intermediate-mass black holes can create gaps in gas disks around supermassive black holes, analogous to the gaps produced by giant planets in disks around stars. The gap provides a signature that might give scientists the first glimpse of this elusive type of black hole.\n\nCredit: Phil Armitage, University of Colorado\n\n\"We know about small black holes, which tend to be close to us and have masses a few to 10 times that of our Sun, and we know about supermassive black holes, which are found in the centers of galaxies and have a mass that's millions to billions of times the mass of the sun,\" said coauthor Saavik Ford, who is a research associate in the Museum's Department of Astrophysics as well as a professor at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, City University of New York (CUNY) and a faculty member at CUNY's Graduate Center. \"But we have no evidence for the middle stage. Intermediate-mass black holes are much harder to find.\"\n\nThe birth of an intermediate black hole starts with the death of a star that forms a stellar or low-mass black hole. In order for this \"seed\" to grow, it must collide with and consume other dead and living stars. But even though there are many billions of stars in large galaxies, there's an even greater proportion of empty space, making collisions a very rare occurrence.\n\nThe researchers' new model suggests that previous searches for middleweight black holes might have been focused on the wrong birthing ground.\n\n\"The recent focus had been on star clusters, but objects there move very quickly and there's no gas, which makes the chances of a collision very slim,\" said Barry McKernan, a research associate in the Museum's Department of Astrophysics who is a professor at CUNY's Borough of Manhattan Community College and a faculty member at CUNY's Graduate Center.\n\nThe new mechanism turns attention instead to active galactic nuclei, the piping hot and ultra-bright cores of galaxies that feed supermassive black holes. The gas in this system is key, causing the stars to slow down and conform to a circularized orbit.\n\n\"You can think of the stars as cars traveling on a 10-lane highway,\" McKernan said. \"If there were no gas, the cars would be going at very different speeds and mostly staying in their lanes, making the odds of collision low. When you add gas, it slows the cars to matching speeds but also moves them into other lanes, making the odds of collision and consumption much higher.\"\n\nThe resulting collisions allow a stellar black hole to swallow stars and grow. The black hole's size and gravitational pull increase as its mass expands, escalating its chance of further collisions. This phenomenon, called \"runaway growth,\" can lead to the creation of an intermediate-mass black hole.\n\nAs they increase in size, the black holes start altering the gas disk that controls them. The researchers' model shows that black holes of a certain mass can create a gap in the gas disk, a signature that might give scientists the first glimpse of intermediate black holes.\n\nThe model describing this growth is a scaled-up version of the mechanism for the formation of gas giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn. Like intermediate black holes, these planets are thought to have grown in gas disks. The planets, though, developed in disks surrounding newly forming stars. Mordecai-Mark Mac Low, chair of the Department of Astrophysics at the Museum, has modeled that case.\n\n\"In some regions, we showed that rocky planets could be moved by the gas into common orbits, where they collide to form objects more than ten times the mass of the Earth, massive enough to attract gas and form gas giant planets,\" Mac Low said. \"The creative work described here applies the same principles to the far more massive disks found at the centers of galaxies, to form black holes rather than giant planets.\"\n\n###\n\nOther authors on the paper include Museum research associate Wladimir Lyra from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology and Hagai Perets from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics"}
{"text":"Friday, August 05, 2011 The Milky Way's Supermassive Black Hole Supermassive black holes - objects with masses of millions or even billions of suns - are found at the nuclei of galaxies. Our Milky Way\ngalaxy, for example, has a massive black hole at its core, albeit one that is relatively quiescent. Despite their reputation for being implacable sinks for matter and energy, both radiation and matter can be ejected from the vicinity of a black hole, often in powerful jets, when it is ringed by a disk of matter and material accretes onto it. Thus in dramatic cases, like quasars, nuclear black holes are responsible for some of the most spectacular phenomena in the cosmos.\n\nA black hole is so simple that it can be completely described by only three parameters: its mass, its spin, and its electric charge. The\nsupermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, because it is example closest to us, has been a prime target for study by scientists\ntrying to measure these parameters and understand how they influence the behavior of the region. For example, why it is that our black hole is so quiescent, while bright jets and luminous emission are seen in more dramatic cases?\n\nCfA astronomer Avi Loeb, his recent student Avery Broderick, and two colleagues have modeled the nature of the Milky Way's black hole. The mass has been estimated by other scientists who, by watching the motions\nof stars in its vicinity, find that it is about 4.3 million solar-masses. (The charge of the black hole remains unknown.) The CfA team used results from ultra-high spatial resolution millimeter wavelength astronomy to measure the angular size of the weak emission around the black hole; the equipment has an angular precision roughly equivalent to seeing a dime on the moon. Based on their analysis of the data, they find that the Milky Way's central black hole spin is at best modest - although whether this explains why the emission is weak is still uncertain. They also conclude that the millimeter emission is slightly extended - it has an axis ratio of about 2.3, but the orientation does not appear to align with any other known features. Not least, their models strongly suggest that the emission comes from some kind of an accretion process. The new result is just the opening salvo that indicates astronomy has entered an epoch in which it will be able to study black hole physics directly using high spatial resolution techniques."}

{"text":"Shadows Helped Form the \"Pillars of Creation\"\n\nby Nancy Atkinson on April 22, 2009\n\nWant to stay on top of all the space news? Follow @universetoday on Twitter\n\nHow were the famous \"Pillars of Creation\" formed? Perhaps only the shadow knows! New research suggests that shadows hold the key to how giant star-forming structures like the \"Pillars\" in the Eagle Nebula take shape.\nThe pillars are dense columns within giant clouds of dust and gas where massive stars form. Several theories have been proposed to explain why the pillars develop around the edge of ionized gas bubbles surrounding young, very hot stars. Using computer models, a group of astronomers from the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies has found that partially-shadowed clumps of gas tend to creep towards darker areas, causing pile-ups behind dense knots of gas and dust that screen the intense ultraviolet light emitted by the stars.\n\nJonathan Mackey, who is presented the results at the European Week of Astronomy and Space Science in the UK said, \"We created a simulation with a random distribution of lots of dense clouds with different sizes and shapes. We found that in certain cases a number of clouds can merge together in the shadows to form structures that look very like observed pillars. They are sufficiently dense to match the observations, can form in about 150,000 years and can survive for about 100,000 years. Although this is a preliminary study, we believe our results are quite robust and will be confirmed by more detailed modeling.\"\nThe team, led by Dr. Andrew Lim, found that the configuration of clumps of gas had to be favorable for the pillars to form. Some age estimates put the Eagle Nebula pillars at no more than 100,000 years old, and models show that the shadow from a single clump would not attain the density to form a pillar in that relatively short timescale.\n\n\"Many of our models do not produce pillars that are as long and narrow as those in the Eagle Nebula, at least not at the observed gas density. It needs the right configuration of dense clumps of gas to form a long pillar. Unless the shadowed region is already very dense to begin with, it just takes too long to collect and organize the gas into a pillar,\" said Lim.\n\nThe group plans to add increasing levels of realism to the model over the next couple of years, bringing in more accurate representations of the complex chemistry of interstellar gas, the effects of radiation from diffuse sources. Adding in the effects of gravity will also be important as the pillars contain dense gas condensations which are in the process of collapsing under their own weight to form the next generation of stars.\n\nMackey said, \"Gravity is relatively unimportant when the pillars are forming, but there comes a point when they get very dense and it cannot be ignored any longer. We plan to include gravitation in future work so that we can study the next generation of stars which are forming in the pillars.\"\n\nThe electromagnetic process of star formation goes something like this:\n\n)\n\nJustinnitsuL\n\nAlmost seems like the pillars of shadows are eating the stars. Perhaps it is a universal parasite? It would make sense because here on our planet we have parasites and since the universe is just a larger version of the same picture we should assume that something of this nature could be possible. I believe the Big Bang Theory is possible but I have come to adopt a Universal Recycling Theory. Basically I believe that every thing in the universe churns around on and back into one center point, similar to how the Earth's crust comes to the surface than churns back in. This is what makes it appear that the undiverse is expanding when in all reality it is but it can only expand back to the center point. Infinity is Zero, Zero is Infinity. I know this is kind of a scattered thought but if you just think about it then you will understand. Everything works the same just on a different scale.\n\nPerhaps intelligent life is being created to help the universe's white blood cells(stars) combat this disease similar to how cold medicines complement the immune system for a speedier recovery. It boggles my mind to think about it but it could be a theory worth looking into. It would be sad if our universe is being eaten or destroyed by some sort of disgusting astronomical parasite or virus. If so then it would make you wonder what the point in fighting each other is when we apparently have bigger problems to deal with. Think about it.\n\nTrippy\n\nSo here we have mainstream theory ignoring gravity in favour of electromagnetic influences\u2026 But everybody keeps saying that mainstream theory fails because it ignores electromagnetic influences in favour of gravity.\n\nIt's a puzzle\u2026\n\n:3\n\nDave Finton\n\nJustinnitsuL: You've done it.

{"text":"way to weigh giant black holes\n\nWednesday, July 16, 2008\n\nA composite image from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory (shown in purple) and Hubble Space Telescope (blue) shows the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 4649. By applying a new technique, scientists used Chandra data to measure the black hole at its center to be about 3.4 billion times more massive than the Sun. The value from this X-ray technique is consistent with a more traditional method using the motions of stars near the black hole. NGC 4649 is now one of only a handful of galaxies for which the mass of a supermassive black hole has been measured with two different methods. (Credit: X-ray: NASA\/CXC\/Univ. of California Irvine\/P.Humphrey et al.; Optical: NASA\/STScI)\n\nHow do you weigh the biggest black holes in the universe? One answer now comes from a completely new and independent technique that astronomers have developed using data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory.\n\nBy measuring a peak in the temperature of hot gas in the center of the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 4649, scientists have determined the mass of the galaxy's supermassive black hole. The method, applied for the first time, gives results that are consistent with a traditional technique.\n\nAstronomers have been seeking out different, independent ways of precisely weighing the largest supermassive black holes, that is, those that are billions of times more massive than the Sun. Until now, methods based on observations of the motions of stars or of gas in a disk near such large black holes had been used.\n\n\"This is tremendously important work since black holes can be elusive, and there are only a couple of ways to weigh them accurately,\" said Philip Humphrey of the University of California at Irvine, who led the study. \"It's reassuring that two very different ways to measure the mass of a big black hole give such similar answers.\"\n\nNGC 4649 is now one of only a handful of galaxies for which the mass of a supermassive black hole has been measured with two different methods. In addition, this new X-ray technique confirms that the supermassive black hole in NGC 4649 is one of the largest in the local universe with a mass about 3.4 billion times that of the Sun, about a thousand times bigger than the black hole at the center of our galaxy.\n\nThe new technique takes advantage of the gravitational influence the black hole has on the hot gas near the center of the galaxy. As gas slowly settles towards the black hole, it gets compressed and heated. This causes a peak in the temperature of the gas right near the center of the galaxy. The more massive the black hole, the bigger the temperature peak detected by Chandra.\n\nThis effect was predicted by two of the co-authors -- Fabrizio Brighenti from the University of Bologna, Italy, and William Mathews from the University of California at Santa Cruz -- almost 10 years ago, but this is the first time it has been seen and used.\n\n\"It was wonderful to finally see convincing evidence of the effects of the huge black hole that we expected,\" said Brighenti. \"We were thrilled that our new technique worked just as well as the more traditional approach for weighing the black hole.\"\n\nThe black hole in NGC 4649 is in a state where it does not appear to be rapidly pulling in material towards its event horizon, nor generating copious amounts of light as it grows. So, the presence and mass of the central black hole has to be studied more indirectly by tracking its effects on stars and gas surrounding it. This technique is well suited to black holes in this condition.\n\n\"Monster black holes like this one power spectacular light shows in the distant, early universe, but not in the local universe,\" said Humphrey. \"So, we can't wait to apply our new method to other nearby galaxies harboring such inconspicuous black holes"}

Introductory chapters provide background information about the historical observations and our modern understanding of supernovae and novae, and of supernova remnants (SNRs) and pulsars. Subsequent chapters discuss the historical observations of the well defined historical SN and modern observations of their remnants. These chapters cover Kepler's SN of AD1604, Tycho's SNe of AD1572, the SN of AD1181, the SN of AD1054, which produced the well known Crab Nebula, and the especially bright SN of AD1006. One chapter discusses the young SNR Cassiopeia A, and the proposed sighting of its SN in AD1680 by Flamsteed. Earlier but less certain supernovae of the preceding millennium chronicled in China are also discussed, along with their possible remnants. Other less certain observations of historical SN, and the future potential for additional historical observations, are briefly discussed.\nThis book also includes as an appendix an up-to-date catalogue of over two hundred known Galactic SNRs."}
{"text":"Thursday, July 12, 2012\n\nA 'finger' of the Universe's dark-matter skeleton, which ultimately dictates where galaxies form, has been observed for the first time. Researchers have directly detected a slim bridge of dark matter joining two clusters of galaxies, using a technique that could eventually help astrophysicists to understand the structure of the Universe and identify what makes up the mysterious invisible substance known as dark matter.\n\nDark-matter filaments, such as the one bridging the galaxy clusters Abell 222 and Abell 223, are predicted to contain more than half of all matter in the Universe. Credit: J\u00f6rg Dietrich, University Of Michigan\/University\nObservatory Munich\n\nAccording to the standard model of cosmology, visible stars and galaxies trace a pattern across the sky known as the cosmic web, which was originally etched out by dark matter \u2014 the substance thought to account for almost 80% of the Universe's matter. Soon after the Big Bang, regions that were slightly denser than others pulled in dark matter, which clumped together and eventually collapsed into flat 'pancakes'. \"Where these pancakes intersect, you get long strands of dark matter, or filaments,\" explains J\u00f6rg Dietrich, a cosmologist at the University Observatory Munich in Germany. Clusters of galaxies then formed at the nodes of the cosmic web, where these filaments crossed.\n\nThe presence of dark matter is usually inferred by the way its strong gravity bends light travelling from distant galaxies that lie behind it \u2014 distorting their apparent shapes as seen by telescopes on Earth. But it is difficult to observe this 'gravitational lensing' by dark matter in filaments because they contain relatively little mass.\n\nDietrich and his colleagues got around this problem by studying a particularly massive filament, 18 megaparsecs long, that bridges the galaxy clusters Abell 222 and Abell 223. Luckily, this dark bridge is oriented so that most of its mass lies along the line of sight to Earth, enhancing the lensing effect, explains Dietrich. The team examined the distortion of more than 40,000 background galaxies, and calculated that the mass in the filament is between 6.5 \u00d7 1013 and 9.8 \u00d7 1013 times the mass of the Sun. Their results are reported in Nature today1. Mass equation\n\nBy examining X-rays from plasma in the filament, observed by the XMM-Newton spacecraft2, the team calculated that no more than 9% of the filament's mass could be made up of hot gas. The team's computer simulations suggest that roughly another 10% of the mass could be due to visible stars and galaxies. The bulk, therefore, must be dark matter, says Dietrich.\n\nMark Bautz, an astrophysicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, notes that astrophysicists do not know precisely how visible matter follows the paths laid out by dark matter. \"What's exciting is that in this unusual system we can map both dark matter and visible matter together and try to figure out how they connect and evolve along the filament,\" he says. Japan's Astro-H X-ray space telescope, due to launch in 2014, will be able to characterize the ionization state and temperature of the plasma in the filament, which will help to discriminate between different models of how the structure formed.\n\nRefining the technique could also help to pin down the identity of dark matter \u2014 whether it is a cold (slow-moving) particle or a warm (fast-moving) one, like a neutrino \u2014 because different particles will clump differently along the filament. The Euclid space mission, due to launch in 2019, will provide more lensing data. \"This will complement direct dark-matter searches, for example at the Large Hadron Collider,\" says Alexandre Refregier, a cosmologist at ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.Nature doi:10.1038\/nature.2012.10951"}
{"text":"Our Connection to the Cosmos\n\nOur story begins in a vast cloud of protons, about 14 billion years ago. The cloud consisted almost entirely of hydrogen atoms, with one proton each, and a trace amount of helium, with two protons in each atom. With the mass of 100 suns, the cloud spread over a sphere in space about a light year in diameter. It had separated from an even larger cloud with the mass of 1000s of suns, and now began to shrink, drawn to its center by its own gravitational attraction. In this original cloud of protons, let us follow the progress of 26 of them.\n\nThe protons in the cloud moved extremely slowly at first, with a temperature only a few degrees above absolute zero. As the cloud gradually shrank, the protons falling toward the center of the cloud and traveling steadily faster, the temperature rose, and collisions between protons became more frequent. After millions of years had passed, the vast cloud had shrunk to a diameter a few times larger than our sun, the protons had fallen an immense distance and were now traveling at speeds of thousands of miles per second, and the temperature in the core of the cloud approached 12 million degrees.\n\nAt such high collision speeds, the single protons of hydrogen atoms fuse (after a rather complicated process) into helium atoms of two protons each, releasing enormous amounts of energy. With thermonuclear fusion now occurring in the core of the cloud, the shrinking of the cloud had stopped, and a stable star had formed.\n\nFor the next 100 million years this colossal star continued to convert hydrogen to helium, and along the way our 26 protons fused into 13 helium atoms. This star did not have rocky planets in its solar system \u2013 at this time in the history of the universe, only hydrogen and helium existed, and no rocks could form.\n\nGradually, the supply of hydrogen in the core was converted to helium, and the star began to run low on fresh hydrogen fuel. The rate of reaction fell, the star began to lose temperature and pressure, and the ever-present gravity forced the center of the star to shrink dramatically. Again gas fell toward the center of the star, causing the speed of the atoms to soar, raising the temperature to higher extremes, approaching 100 million degrees.\n\nThe combination of drawing in fresh hydrogen from the lower atmosphere of the star, and the beginning of helium fusion \u2013 three helium atoms combining to form one carbon atom with 6 protons \u2013 created a new source of energy to stop the further collapse of the star. This surge of energy caused the enormous atmosphere of the star to expand to fill a vast volume of space \u2013 about the diameter of the orbit of Mars in our solar system. The star became a red supergiant. Of our 26 protons in 13 helium atoms, three helium atoms (6 protons) were fused into a carbon atom, resulting in 1 carbon atom and 10 helium atoms.\n\nAfter another few hundred thousand years of burning helium into carbon at the core of the aging star, helium became depleted at the core, and the reaction rate again began to fall. This caused another round of core collapse, speed-up of atoms, and soaring temperatures, enabling fusion of carbon to helium, producing oxygen (8 protons).\n\nThe same cycle repeated several more times, but with the protons rapidly forming larger and larger groups, there were correspondingly fewer and fewer possible reactions, and the time of each cycle was reduced dramatically. Oxygen atoms combined with helium to create neon, neon with helium to create magnesium, and similarly through the production of silicon, sulfur, argon, calcium, titanium, chromium, and finally \u2013 iron. Each iron atom contains 26 protons. The entire sequence starting at silicon lasted less than a day. As each larger atom fused, less and less energy was released in the reaction relative to the amount of energy needed to cause the reaction.\n\nWhen, at last, iron started fusing to helium, more energy was consumed than was produced \u2013 and the star was dramatically COOLED. This caused the final, disastrous collapse of the star's core, with the entire core rushing to the star's center in a matter of seconds. The temperature exceeded several hundred billion degrees, and a chaotic fusion process in which any atom can fuse to any other atom ensued. In less than a second the energy equivalent of billions of stars was released, and the star became a supernova.\n\nThis star died dramatically. Our 26 protons in the iron atom were blown clear of the star, while the center collapsed into a black hole.\n\nFor the next 9 billion years, the iron atom traveled through interstellar space and intermingled with other clouds of hydrogen, helium, and the remains of other supernovas. At last, it found itself in another vast cloud of gas \u2013 this time laced with atoms heavier than hydrogen and helium, and dust. And this cloud slowly began to shrink upon itself, attracted by its own gravity toward its center. And the iron atom fell inward as well\u2026\n\nHydrogen fusion started in the core of this shrinking cloud, and a smaller star was created. The dust and heavier elements formed rocks orbiting this star, and those rocks crashed into one another, slowly building planets. Our iron atom became a part of one of those rocks. After about a billion years, a system of eight planets had stabilized, but our iron atom remained part of a large rock for another billion years.\n\nAbout 2 billion years ago, the rock containing our 26 protons in an iron atom crashed through the atmosphere of the third innermost planet around the star, and exploded in mid-air, sending our iron atom into the sea. After two billion years of geological transformations, the iron atom entered the surface soil in a farming area, and about a year ago made it into the feed on a beef farm. The atom, bonded into a complex bio-organic compound in the muscles of a steer, was inside the hamburger I ate last night, and now flows in the blood of my veins.\n\nAlthough parts of this tale are approximated due to uncertainty in the exact history of iron atoms reaching Earth, the basic fact remains \u2013 all of the atoms of which you and I are made, and which surround us on this planet (apart from hydrogen) were formed in ancient supernovae of stars formed very shortly after the emergence of the universe. Fusion of atoms occurs only within stars (ignoring the few fused by Man), and of atoms larger than carbon, only within stars that become supernova resentment"}

It is projected that the person that this finger came from would have been more than 16 feet tall! You can see more pictures of this amazing find on BILD.de. As you can tell from the picture above, the fingernail is clearly visible. This truly is a remarkable specimen. So is this really a finger of a giant that once lived in Egypt?The new cloud of water is enough to supply 28 galaxies with water.\n\nTruly, that is one swampy patch of intergalactic space.\n\nEqually stunning is the age of the water factory. The two teams of astrophysicists that found the quasar were looking out in space a distance of 12 billion light years. That means they were also looking back in time 12 billion years, to when the universe itself was just 1.6 billion years old. They were watching water being formed at the very start of the known universe, which is to say, water was one of the first substances formed, created in galactic volumes from the earliest time. Given water's creative power to shape geology, climate and biology, that's dramatic.\n\n\"It's another demonstration that water is pervasive throughout the universe, even at the very earliest times,\" says Matt Bradford, an astrophysicist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and leader of one of the teams that made the discovery. (The journal article reporting the discovery is titled, without drama, \"The Water Vapor Spectrum of APM 08279+5255: X-Ray Heating and Infrared Pumping over Hundreds of Parsecs.\")\n\nIt is not as if you'd have to wear foul-weather gear if you could visit this place in space, however. The distances are as mind-bogglingly large as the amount of water being created, so the water vapor is the finest mist\u2014300 trillion times less dense than the air in a typical room.\n\nAnd it's not as if this intergalactic water can be of any use to us here on Earth, of course, at least not in the immediate sense. Indeed, the discovery comes as a devastating drought across eastern Africa is endangering the lives of 10 million people in Somalia, Kenya, and Ethiopia. NASA's water discovery should be a reminder that if we have the sophistication to discover galaxies full of water 12 billion light years away, we should be able to save people just an ocean away from drought-induced starvation.\n\nThe NASA announcement is also a reminder how quickly our understanding of the universe is evolving and how much capacity for surprise nature still has for us. There's water on Mars, there's water jetting hundreds of miles into space from Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons, there are icebergs of water hidden in the polar craters of our own Moon. And now it turns out that a single quasar has the ability to manufacture galaxies full of water.\n\nBut it was only 40 years ago, in 1969, that scientists first confirmed that water existed anywhere besides Earth.\n\nI am a huge fan of all things Slenderman, and I also happen to be an avid writer.

The footprints were so called because some people believed that the footprints were the tracks of Satan, as they were allegedly made by a cloven hoof. Many theories have been put forward to explain the incident, and some aspects of its veracity have also been called into question traveled straight over, and footprints appeared on the tops of snow-covered roofs and high walls which lay in the footprints' path, as well as leading up to and exiting various drain pipes of as small as a four inch diameter.Am Fear Liath M\u00f2r also known as The Big Grey Man of Ben MacDhui or simply The Greyman) is the name of a presence or creature which is said to haunt the summit and passes of Ben Macdui, the highest peak of the Cairngorms and the second highest peak in Britain. It has been described as an extremely tall figure covered with short hair, or as an unseen presence that causes uneasy feelings in people who climb the mountain. Evidence of the existence of this creature is limited to various sightings and a few photographs of unusual footprints.\n\nIt was traditionally seen as a supernatural being, but Am Fear Liath M\u00f2r has been compared to the Yeti of the Himalaya and the Sasquatch or Bigfoot of North America. References to wild 'Greymen' in Scotland and similar creatures elsewhere in Europe, sometimes called Wudewas or 'Wood Men', date back to the 13th century, and are believed by some to represent relict hominids.\n\nIn 1925, the noted climber John Norman Collie recounted a terrifying experience he had endured while alone near the summit of Ben MacDhui some 35 years before. \"I began to think I heard something else than merely the noise of my own footsteps. For every few steps I took I heard a crunch, and then another crunch as if someone was walking after me but taking steps three or four times the length of my own.\" Collie was unable to make out the source of the noises because of mist, and continued \"\u2026 [as] the eerie crunch, crunch, sounded behind me, I was seized with terror and took to my heels, staggering blindly among the boulders for four or five miles.\" Other climbers have also reported similar experiences, many describing uncontrollable feelings of fear and panic, some actually seeing a huge grey figure behind them, and others only hearing sounds or even succumbing to inexplicable feelings of terror while in the area.\n\nIn the Matt Lamy book 100 Strangest Unexplained Mysteries, Lamy notes a sighting in the early 1990s in which three men caught sight of a bipedal creature with an eerie, inhuman face in a forest near Aberdeen. Several weeks later, whilst driving through the area at night, the creature appeared again and ran alongside their car even at speeds of 45 miles per hour, seemingly trying to enter the vehicle.\n\nSimilar panic responses have been reported in many North American Sasquatch encounters, and explanations involving infrasound or pheromones have been advanced. Cryptozoologist Karl Shuker has expressed belief that the creature is the guardian of an inter-dimensional portal in his 1997 book, The Unexplained. However, hallucinations and panic brought on by isolation and exhaustion, or an optical illusion similar to the Brocken spectre, are very plausible explanations for the Big Grey Man legend. A Brocken spectre, or 'glory', can occur in certain atmospheric conditions when the sun is at a particular angle.

{"text":"IceCube, the big high-energy neutrino experiment cleverly embedded into the ice at the South Pole, announced a very interesting result yesterday, following on an already interesting result from a few weeks ago, one that I failed to cover properly. They have seen the highest-energy neutrinos ever observed, ones that, unlike previously observed high-energy neutrinos, appear not to be generated by cosmic rays hitting the top of the atmosphere. Instead, they apparently come from new sources far out in space. And as such, it tentatively appears that they've opened up, as long anticipated, a new era in neutrino astronomy, in which high-energy neutrinos will be used to understand astrophysical phenomena!\n\nI don't understand certain details well enough yet to give you a careful explanation \u2014 that will probably come next week \u2014 but here's an early description (and expert readers are strongly encouraged to correct any errors.) Continue reading \u2192\n\nThis is hot off the stellar press: as NASA announced today (with cool pictures), a brilliant, long, and rather nearby GRB, or \"gamma-ray burster\", was observed on April 27th, initially by the Fermi and Swift satellites. Gamma-rays are just an old name for photons (i.e. particles of light) which have lots more energy (per photon) than the photons of visible light. And a GRB is a distant astronomical explosion that produces an enormously bright flare of these high-energy photons, typically for a short time (seconds or minutes), though this one lasted for hours. It is believed that a narrow jet of high-energy particles produced in a supernova (a powerful explosion of a star) is behind these flares, but they are still poorly understood and are under active study.\n\nEverything about last week's GRB is on the exceptional side. The most energetic photon detected had somewhat more energy than the photons produced in the decays of Higgs particles, a bit less than the energy of the photons that Fermi might be seeing from dark matter, and more than three times more energy than any GRB photon previously detected by Fermi. Its gamma rays were produced for many hours, setting another record. It lasted so long that several other types of telescopes were able to observe it, including those that look at visible light (it was even seen by an amateur astronomer), and those that look at radio waves (which are made from photons with vastly lower energy). And it was relatively close\u2026 well, relatively compared to most GRB's. It occured in a galaxy 3.6 billion light years away. Now that is still a good fraction of the distance across the visible part of our universe, but still, it puts this GRB in the top 5% as far as proximity to Earth.\n\nWith such a vast amount of data to work with, it seems very likely that astronomers will learn qualitatively new things about GRBs by studying this blast. In astronomy, it sometimes takes just one spectacular event to change the scientific landscape! The next phase of the process will involve directly detecting the lesser (but still intense) glow from the (presumed) supernova that produced the GRB flare. Stay tuned! It should be a matter of a week or so\u2026\n\nDark Matter, Dark Matter, Everywhere! It's in your shoes, it's in your coffee, it's in the stars and even in your favorite cheese\u2026 at least, it's widely believed to be wandering all about, mostly unnoticed. Still it's not quite as inscrutable as its reputation would lead you to believe. It's responsible for a galactic glow, an abundance of anti-matter, and now \u2014 three quiet little taps in an underground mine.\n\nOr is it?\n\nApparent effects of dark matter have been \"discovered\" so many times in the last decade that you may by now feel a bit jaded, or at least dispassionate. Certainly I do. Some day, some year, one of these many hints may turn out to be the real thing. But of the current hints? We've got at least six, and they can't all be real, because they're not consistent with one other. It's certain that several of them are false alarms; and once you open that door a crack, you have to consider flinging it wide open, asking: why can't \"several\" be \"all six\"? All of the dark-matter search experiments are difficult, as they involve pushing the technological envelope. And as anyone with experience in science knows, most of the exciting-sounding results emerging from forefront experiments don't survive the test of time. Never underestimate the challenge of science at the frontier of knowledge!\n\n[UPDATE, midnight New York time: the cloud of particles from the solar flare arrived a few hours ago, but it didn't impact the earth's magnetic field quite as hard as the best-guess forecast. (Remember the probability of a geomagnetic storm was only 60%; i.e. the probability of no storm was 40%.) Right now, the auroras are likely visible in Canada but probably not in the US. This could change, but don't get your hopes up too high; we may have to wait for the next solar flare.]\n\nNow, many of you may have heard that there is a forecast of northern (and southern) lights, also known as auroras, tonight.

{"text":"X-ray map of the central region of the Milky Way. This map shows a region along the galactic plane with an area of 500 light-years by 100 light-years. The galactic center exists in the white portion near the center of the image, and the red-dotted line is the high-temperature plasma sphere. The green ellipsoid is a supernova remnant, and the blue circle is the molecular cloud. The black regions have not yet been observed.\n\nMolecular cloud of Sagittarius B, observed by ASCA in 1994 (left) and by Suzaku in 2005 (right).\n\nAt the center of the Milky Way, the galaxy that's home to our planet, there is a black hole that is a few million times the mass of the Sun and is currently considered to be in a dormant state. Also, stars are being formed near the center of the galaxy, and these activities are observed by electromagnetic waves of various wavelengths, such as radio waves, X-rays and gamma rays. Suzaku confirmed from the precise observations of X-ray spectra emitted from the highly-ionized ions of heavy elements such as iron that the X-ray emission from a spherical region with a radius of about 500 light-years is coming from plasma with a temperature of 70 million degrees. This suggests that even today stars formed by active star formation cause a lot of supernova explosions and emit a large amount of heavy elements into space. In the center of the Milky Way, there are still many undiscovered supernova remnants, and it's possible that the supernova explosions that created these remnants were the energy sources of the high-temperature plasma.\nSuzaku has also observed a neutral iron emission line from the central region of the galaxy, and one from a molecular cloud 300 light-years away from the galactic center. A molecular cloud is an aggregation of gases and cosmic-dust particles, and because its temperature is low, normally the iron atoms it contains do not emit X-rays. However, when the molecular cloud is irradiated from the outside with strong X-rays, it emits characteristic X-rays of is own. Suzaku's X-ray image of the molecular cloud called Sagittarius-B appears different from the image obtained by the X-ray astronomy satellite ASCA about ten years ago. If we suppose that the strong X-rays irradiating the molecular cloud come from the black hole at the center of the galaxy, it is possible that the wave front of the X-ray flare passed very close to this molecular cloud. In other words, the black hole at the center of the Milky Way was active just 300 years ago.\n\nCosmic rays are high-energy charged particles, mainly protons, that fly around in space at nearly the speed of light, and bombard the Earth at every moment. Ever since cosmic rays were discovered at the beginning of the twentieth century, scientists have wondered from where they come how they are accelerated. Suzaku's observations have given us some important clues. One was obtained through the observation of supernova remnant RX J1713-3946, together with the observation with the NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. This celestial body emits not only X-rays but also ultrahigh-energy gamma rays, and it's the gamma rays that attracted our attention.\nFirst, the Chandra X-ray observatory, which has exceptional spatial resolution, captured X-rays whose intensity varied among 2000, 2005 and 2006 observations, namely on time scale of just one year, which is a very short time in astrophysics. , This corresponds to seeing the behavior of charged particles when they are gaining energy (accelerating) and losing energy (cooling). This was the first time we had captured the acceleration phenomena of the cosmic rays directly. On the other hand, Suzaku measured X-ray spectra up 40 keV (kilo electron volt), revealing that X-ray intensities rapidly decrease from near 10 keV. The fact that the X-ray spectra extend up to such a high energy shows that electrons are also accelerated effectively. By combining the observation results of two satellites, it becomes clear that cosmic rays consisting primarily of protons are created and accelerated by means of the shock wave of the supernova remnant.\n\nAn X-ray image of supernova remnant RX J1713-3946 observed by Chandra. There are regions whose X-ray intensity varies on time scale of about a year. (reproduced from Uchiyama et al., Nature 2007)\n\nX-rays generated near the Earth. X-rays are emitted through the charge exchange reaction between the ionized ions in the solar wind and the neutral matter. (the background picture by: NASA, CXC, M. Weiss)\n\nElectromagnetic waves of various lengths float in the universe, causing the entire sky to glow almost homogeneously. This is called cosmic background radiation. In the 1990s, the German satellite ROSAT found a phenomenon where the intensity of X-rays increased by a factor of two or more in the course of about one day, during the observation of soft X-ray cosmic background radiation. At that time, people could not find any parameters correlating with the X-ray intensity, and didn't have the faintest idea of where that radiation was coming from. Thanks to the discovery in 1996 of X-ray emissions from a comet, we have had to consider the possibility that X-rays can be emitted by a process which was considered not to be so important previously. When highly ionized ions in the solar wind interact with the neutral matter in the comet atmosphere, X-rays are emitted.\nSuzaku detected that increase of X-ray intensity during the observation of background radiation, and obtained a firm evidence that its origin is the solar wind. We studied how the X-ray spectrum changes when the intensity of the radiation increases. Suzaku's observations detected a characteristic X-ray that is emitted by the interaction of highly ionized ions and neutral matter by means of charge exchange when the X-ray intensity is increased. In the charge exchange reaction an electron moves from the neutral matter to the ionized ions, leaving the ions in exited states. Exited ions emits X-ray line emissions characteristics of the reaction. Suzaku found that the emission comes from an altitude of about 6000 km from Earth surface. We consider that the completely ionized carbon ions and highly ionized oxygen ions in the solar wind penetrate from the magnetic pole of the Earth into a 6000-km altitude, and emit X-rays by the charge exchange reaction with the hydrogen atoms existing there.\nThis reaction occurs not only in near-Earth regions and near comets, but also in other places in the solar system. For example, in the aurora of Jupiter, the X-rays generated by the charge exchange of ionized ions in the solar wind are observed. Suzaku also observes Jupiter and other planets, and studies in detail what kinds of X-rays are emitted from Jupiter."}

{"text":"In this final installment in the Golden State Star Party series, I want to discuss the nature of the galaxies that I photographed.\n\nOne of the reasons that I like astronomy is that it continually stimulates me to contemplate the vast scale of the objects I observe. M81 is the dominant galaxy in a nearby group of galaxies, about 12 million light years from our own. (A light year is the distance that light travels in one year.) Knowing M81's distance and apparent size in the sky, we can readily calculate that it is about 90,000 light years in diameter.\n\nThis has the mind-bending consequence that not only did the photons of light illuminating my camera's image sensor leave M81 over 12 million years ago, but since the photons on the far side of M81 had a greater distance to travel, they had to start about 75,000 years before the photons from the near side. (M81 is tipped from our viewpoint. Otherwise they would have had to start a full 90,000 years earlier.) So, while we think of a picture as representing a moment in time, my picture of M81 is actually smeared out over 75,000 years!\n\nM81 probably contains on the order of 100 billion stars revolving around the center in one of the most beautiful spirals of any galaxy we can see. With my telescope, they all blend together, and even the brightest star is far too small to see. However, a supernova would be visible, and indeed an amateur astronomer discovered one in M81 during 1993.

{"text":"Atacama Pathfinder Experiment: Setting the dark on fire\n\nJan 23, 2013 image shows\n\n(Phys.org)\u2014 But one of these dark clouds is not what it seems.\n\nIn space, dense clouds of cosmic gas and dust are the birthplaces of new stars. In visible light, this dust is dark and obscuring, hiding the stars behind it. So much so that, when astronomer William Herschel observed one such cloud in the constellation of Scorpius in 1774, he thought it was a region empty of stars and is said to have exclaimed, \"Truly there is a hole in the sky here!\"\n\nIn order to better understand star formation, astronomers need telescopes that can observe at longer wavelengths, such as the submillimetre range, in which the dark dust grains shine rather than absorb light. APEX, on the Chajnantor Plateau in the Chilean Andes, is the largest single-dish submillimetre-wavelength telescope operating in the southern hemisphere, and is ideal for astronomers studying the birth of stars in this way.\n\nLocated in the constellation of Orion (The Hunter), 1500 light-years away from Earth, the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex is the closest region of massive star formation to Earth, and contains a treasury of bright nebulae, dark clouds and young stars.

This region\u2014when seen in visible light\u2014is what astronomers call a reflection nebula, where the pale blue glow of background starlight is reflected from clouds of dust. The nebula is mainly illuminated by the energetic radiation from the young star V380 Orionis lurking at its heart. In the centre of the nebula is a dark patch, which can be seen even more clearly in a well-known image from the NASA\/ESA Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nNormally, a dark patch such as this would indicate a dense cloud of cosmic dust, obscuring the stars and nebula behind it.

{"text":"The Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram\n\nThere are stars both smaller and bigger than the Sun. The lifetime of\nthe Sun is 10 billion years. More massive stars burn the fuel more\nquickly and, despite the fact tha have more fuel, have shorter\nlifetimes. The following relation holds:\n\nSmaller stars than the Sun\nbut large enough to obtain ignition, red dwarfs, burn the fuel more\nslowly and might last hundreds of billions of years. Stars with masses\nless than approx. 3 times the mass of the Sun get so hot in the core\nthat they can burn (fuse) atoms of helium to produce carbon; the\ntemperature is not enough in these stars to make anything else. More\nmassive stars burn carbon to oxygen, and then to silicon and finally\niron. Iron is a very stable nucleus and no nuclei heavier than iron\nare produced in stars. Regardless of their mass, most stars spend most\nof the time burning hydrogen.\nTwo astronomers, Hertzsprung and Russell, noticed that when they\nplotted, for each star, its luminosity vs. its temperature, most stars\nwould cluster along a line. (Note: luminosity is the energy that the\nstar radiates at all wavelengths in one second; recall -see the Tutorial - that the\nluminosity L = 4 x 3.14 x R2 x T4, where s = the Stefan-Boltzman constant. In the figure\nbelow, the luminosity of a star is given with respect to the\nluminosity of the Sun).\n\nThe temperature of the star is its surface\ntemperature - recall that we can think of a star as a \"black body\" that emits\nradiation with a peak emission given by its temperature.\nStars hotter than the Sun are bluish, while cooler ones are reddish.\nThe place where stars bunch up in the diagram is called the \"main sequence\".\nMore massive and luminous stars are at the top; less luminous, cooler\nstars are at the bottom.\n\nFor most of its life a star\nstays in one point of the diagram. However, towards the end of its life,\na star like the Sun will move right and up of the diagram,\nin the so called \"red giant branch\". In this branch, where stars have\nconverted part of their hydrogen fuel (12 % in mass) into He, the core\nof a star starts to contract while the outer layer expands and become\ncooler (red giants have a lower temperature than the original\nstar). When this happens to the Sun, 4-5 billion years from now, the\nouter reaches of our star will hit the Earth and perhaps Mars.\nIn the meantime, the core\ncontracts so rapidly that helium (He) becomes so hot that it burns quickly into carbon (He\nflash). The outer layers are blown off and the star crosses the\ndiagram right to left (i.e., its surface temperature increases) very\nquickly - this is called \"the horizontal branch\". Finally the inner\ncore will forms a \"white dwarf\" that, having burned up its fuel, slowly\ncools until it will not be visible.\n\nStars three times or more massive than the Sun will be able to\nmaintain high temperatures in the core for longer periods of time and\nwill be able to burn other elements as well.\n\nPlanetary nebula NGC 6720.\nThe colored shadows give us information about the\nelements produced by the star.\nCredits:Howard Bond (ST ScI) and NASA\n\nIt is important to\nrealize that the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is a snapshot of the\nluminosity and temperature of all stars at a given moment; most stars\nare seen on the main sequence because they move off sequence for\nrelatively brief periods of time (in the case of the Sun for hundreds\nof million of years compared to a lifetime of 10 billion years).

{"text":"Science News\n\nHubble Sees a Planetary Nebula in the Making\n\nOct. 11, 2012 \u2014 The Universe is filled with mysterious objects. Many of them are as strange as they are beautiful. Among these, planetary nebulae are probably one of the most fascinating objects to behold in the night sky. No other type of object has such a large variety of shapes and structures. The NASA\/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has provided a striking image of Hen 3-1475, a planetary nebula in the making.\n\nShare This:\n\nPlanetary nebulae -- the name arises because most of these objects resembled a planet when they were first discovered through early telescopes -- are expanding, glowing shells of gas coming from sun-like stars at the ends of their lives. They glow brightly because of the radiation that comes from a hot, compact core, which remains after the outer envelope is ejected, and is powerful enough to make these gossamer shells shine.\n\nEach planetary nebula is complex and unique. Hen 3-1475 is a great example of a planetary nebula in the making, a phase which is known to astronomers as a protoplanetary or preplanetary nebula.\n\nSince the central star has not yet blown away its complete shell, the star is not hot enough to ionize the shell of gas and so the nebula does not shine. Rather, we see the expelled gas thanks to light reflected off it. When the star's envelope is fully ejected, it will begin to glow and become a planetary nebula.\n\nHen 3-1475 is located in the constellation of Sagittarius around 18,000 light-years away from us. The central star is more than 12,000 times as luminous as our sun. Its most characteristic feature is a thick ring of dust around the central star and two S-shaped jets that are emerging from the pole regions of the central star. These jets are long outflows of fast-moving gas travelling at hundreds of kilometers per second.\n\nThe formation of these bipolar jets has puzzled astronomers for a long time. How can a spherical star form these complex structures? Recent studies suggest that the object's characteristic shape and the large velocity outflow is created by a central source that ejects streams of gas in opposite directions and precesses once every thousand years. Precession means a change in the orientation of the rotational axis of a rotating body. It is like an enormous, slowly rotating garden sprinkler in the middle of the sky. No wonder astronomers also have nicknamed this object the \"Garden-sprinkler Nebula.\"\n\nThis picture was taken with Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3, which provides significantly higher resolution than previous observations made with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2.Into The Eye Of The Helix Nebula(Mar. 4, 2009) \u2014 A deep new image of the magnificent Helix planetary nebula has been obtained using the Wide Field Imager at ESO's La Silla Observatory.

{"text":"The Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) is taking shape. Team members at universities in Texas and Germany are working to create the hardware and computer programs that will enable our look back at the expansion history of the Universe, to provide unique data for solving the riddle of dark energy.\n\nDark energy dominates the Universe. It constitutes about 73 percent of the cosmos, while everything made of atoms accounts for a mere four percent, and the rest \u2014 about 23 percent \u2014 is made up of a mysterious \"dark matter.\" Dark energy's effects have been reconfirmed by numerous observations: It is causing the Universe to expand at an accelerating rate (when the expansion should be slowing down). Beyond that fact and a rough approximation of the amount of energy needed to account for the observed effects, nothing is known.\n\nThe importance of dark energy to our understanding of the Universe was highlighted by the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to two teams that made the discovery of the Universe's accelerating expansion. We are proud that, with HETDEX, our Texas astronomers are leading the effort to go beyond discovery to a physical understanding of dark energy.\n\nThe first phase of creating HETDEX was to design and build a new tracker assembly for the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. The upgraded wide-field corrector and prime focus instrument package needed for HETDEX have larger mirrors than those currently housed at the HET's prime focus. Together, they are seven times heavier than the current package, and they require a new, stronger tracker structure. New gears and motors have been designed for HETDEX that will move the parts of the 3.4-ton prime focus instrument package around 10 different axes with a precision of plus or minus .002 millimeters.\n\nThe new tracker built for HETDEX undergoing testing at the Center for Electromechanics in Austin\n\nThat complex new tracker assembly and much of the new prime focus instrument package are operational and are undergoing testing at The University of Texas at Austin's Center for Electromechanics.\n\nThe second phase of creating HETDEX is the design and construction of a suite of 150 innovative integral-field spectrographs (arranged in 75 pairs), collectively called VIRUS. Teams in Potsdam, Germany, and at UT Austin and Texas A&M are building the components and beginning the assembly of the first set of VIRUS spectrographs, which will be integrated and tested at Texas A&M. Current planning calls for installation of VIRUS beginning in mid 2012.\n\nWe plan to take the Hobby-Eberly Telescope offline in March 2012 and to begin installing the new tracker in April. The pacing item for installation will be delivery of the new wide-field corrector mirror from the University of Arizona's College of Optical Sciences, now slated for early 2012.\n\nWe then plan to begin HETDEX observations in September 2012 with 32 pairs of VIRUS spectrographs and with the full complement of 75 pairs by year's end.\n\nHETDEX can show better than any competing project whether dark energy has evolved over time, which is critical to unlocking dark energy's secrets. HETDEX will also determine whether, to a few tenths of a percent, the Universe's geometry is curved or flat, a measurement that our competitors will need to test the validity of their dark-energy observations in more recent times.\n\nAs exciting as HETDEX is, I am just as energized by the new capabilities that the HETDEX upgrades and VIRUS spectrographs will give to all other observations with the HET. These new capabilities will open up whole new areas in astrophysics for studies of galaxy formation, the large-scale structure of the Universe, the characteristics of dark matter in nearby galaxies, and the history of our own Milky Way, and the HET will be unrivaled for these new areas of exploration.\n\nHETDEX has received wonderful support from the State of Texas and The University of Texas at Austin, from U.S. government agencies, from our partner institutions, and from generous private donors.\n\nIn early 2012, we will set a date for the dedication of HETDEX and a ceremony to recognize our generous donors. A highlight of that ceremony will be naming the new tracker assembly and wide-field corrector \"The Harold C. Simmons Dark Energy Optical System,\" in honor of the generous benefactor whose leadership has done so much to make HETDEX possible.\n\nI look forward to celebrating with you in 2012, and I invite you to explore more about dark energy and HETDEX at the HETDEX team's Web site:"}

{"text":"HD 98800A\n\nAn artist's conception shows TW Hydrae (left) and HD 98800A (right), two young star systems that are both members of the TW Hydrae stellar association which formed about 10 million years ago. Chandra observations of their X-ray spectra revealed that, although the stars were both formed in the same region of space at the same time, they produce X-rays by different mechanisms.\n\nThe insets show portions of the X-ray spectra for each system. Of particular interest are the peaks labeled r, i, and f. These peaks, due to X-rays from neon atoms that have lost all but two of their ten orbital electrons, are sensitive indicators of the density and temperature in the hot, X-ray emitting gas in the star systems.\n\nThe relative sizes of the peaks in TW Hydrae provide strong evidence that the matter is accreting onto the star from a circumstellar disk as shown in the illustration. X-rays are produced as matter is guided by the star's magnetic field onto one or more hot spots on the surface of the star.\n\nIn contrast, the spectrum of the binary star system HD 98800A revealed that its brightest star is producing X-rays much as the Sun does, from a hot upper atmosphere or corona. This indicates that any disk around these stars has been greatly diminished or destroyed in ten million years, perhaps by the ongoing formation of planets or by its companion stars."}

{"text":"'This is not a pipe': Curious dark nebula seen as never before\n\nThis picture shows Barnard 59, part of a vast dark cloud of interstellar dust called the Pipe Nebula. This new and very detailed image of what is known as a dark nebula was captured by the Wide Field Imager on the MPG\/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at ESO's La Silla Observatory. This image is so large that it is strongly recommended to click on it for the enlarged version to appreciate it fully.\n\nJust as Ren\u00e9 appearing on the 45th anniversary of the painter's death.\n\n The Pipe Nebula appears silhouetted against the rich star clouds close to the centre of the Milky Way in the constellation of Ophiuchus (The Serpent Bearer).\n\nBarnard 59 forms the mouthpiece of the Pipe Nebula and is the subject of this new image from the Wide Field Imager on the MPG\/ESO 2.2-metre telescope. This strange and complex dark nebula lies about 600-700 light-years away from Earth.\n\nThe nebula is named after the American astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard who was the first to systematically record dark nebulae using long-exposure photography and one of those who recognised their dusty nature. Barnard catalogued a total of 370 dark nebulae all over the sky. A self-made man, he bought his first house with the prize money from discovering several comets. Barnard was an extraordinary observer with exceptional eyesight who made contributions in many fields of astronomy in the late 19th and early 20th century. At first glance, your attention is most likely drawn to the centre of the image where dark twisting clouds look a little like the legs of a vast spider stretched across a web of stars. However, after a few moments you will begin to notice several finer details. Foggy, smoky shapes in the middle of the darkness are lit up by new stars that are forming. Star formation is common within regions that contain dense, molecular clouds, such as in dark nebulae. The dust and gas will clump together under the influence of gravity and more and more material will be attracted until the star is formed. However, compared to similar regions, the Barnard 59 region is undergoing relatively little star formation and still has a great deal of dust.

{"text":"MySlate is a new tool that lets you track your favorite parts of Slate. You can follow authors and sections, track comment threads you're interested in, and more.\n\nI love it when a good observation backs up a hypothesis.\n\nOur galaxy is essentially made of three things: stars, gas, and dust (well, there's dark matter too, which actually dominates the mass of the galaxy, but we can't see it). By dust, I mean various molecules that absorb visible light, so they look black when seen in photos (see this gallery for several examples). Some are complex organic compounds (essentially, soot), while others are chemically pretty simple like iron silicate (FeSiO3).\n\nThere's a lot of dust in the galaxy, and we think it's made when stars are born, and when they die. Massive stars explode when they die, and dust can be made inside the expanding debris. This has been seen before, but a new observation removes all doubt that this occurs:\n\nHubble (left) and Herschel (right) images of the Crab Nebula, the expanding debris from a star that exploded a millenium ago. Click to crustaceanate.\n\nOn the left is a Hubble image of the Crab Nebula, the rapidly expanding material from a star that went supernova back in 1054 (or, if you prefer, the light reached us on that date). As you can see, it looks like an explosion! The filaments and fingers are extremely hot gas expanding at well over a thousand kilometers per second\u2014that's a thousand times faster than a rifle bullet. The Hubble image is in visible light, the kind we can see with our eyes (you can get just the Hubble image alone if you'd like, and I recommend getting the limulidaenated 3864 x 3864 pixel image).\n\nOn the right is the same view using the European Space Agency's Herschel observatory, a space telescope that sees way out into the infrared. In the past, telescopes in that wavelength have only gotten blurry, extremely low-resolution images of the Crab, but here you can actually trace many of the same structures in the Hubble image as in the one from Herschel. What looks red in the picture is dust at an incredibly chilly 28 Kelvins, about -245\u00b0 Celsius (-410\u00b0 F). Green and blue are slightly warmer, by just a few degrees.\n\nThe astronomers who took this observation very carefully removed the influence of various non-dust sources of light (including things like atoms of carbon and oxygen, and radiation from atoms whipping around the strong magnetic fields inside the nebula; they used several other infrared observatories like WISE, Planck, Spitzer, and ISO to do this), until all that was left was infrared light from the dust. When they did, they found that the total mass of dust in the Crab is about 0.25 times the mass of the Sun.\n\nA quarter of the Sun may not sound like much\u2026 but that means it's enough dust to make 80,000 Earths! Imagine, 80,000 planets like our own, lined up side-by-side\u2026they'd stretch for over a billion kilometers (600 million miles), more than the distance from the Sun to Jupiter! And that's just from dust. The total mass of all the expanding shrapnel from the supernova is nearly five times that of the Sun. And mind you, this all came from a single exploding star. Before it blew up, it was far more massive than our own star.\n\nWhile there was little doubt before, these new observations make it pretty clear at least some of the dust in the galaxy comes from exploded stars. Massive stars are rare, but the death of each one creates a lot of stuff. Still, the total amount made by supernovae is hard to determine. In most supernovae, expanding material slamming into the thin matter between the stars creates enormous shock waves that rip dust molecules apart. In the Crab, conditions are a little odd; there isn't much gas outside the expanding remnant, so the shock waves are weak, letting the dust survive.\n\nThat's a pretty typical kind of thing astronomers have to deal with. You come up with an idea, test it, and it works! Yay! But there's always some monkey in the wrench that makes life more complicated and more difficult. But the good news here is that the infrared observations certainly confirm that dust is made where stars die, and the high-resolution images even help astronomers understand how it happens.\n\nWe talk about the cycle of life on Earth, but it exists in the heavens as well. Stars are born, live out their existence, and then some explode. When they die, they scatter into the Universe the elements needed for planet formation and, eventually, for life to arise. As Carl Sagan was fond of saying, we are star stuff. It's literally true.\n\nPerhaps that statement resonates with you as strongly as it does in me; I sometimes get choked up thinking about it. Or maybe it's just a little stardust in my eye."}
{"text":"In addition to being big red flags announcing the presence of young stellar objects, or YSO's, outflows from these so-called 'Herbig-Haro objects' inject a considerable amount of mechanical energy into their environments. This is particularly important because stars don't typically form alone, but rather in clusters of dozens to thousands of stars. Since stars begin as overdensities in cold molecular clouds that are unstable to collapse, even being \"kicked\" a little by the outflow of a neighboring YSO is enough to push these \"cores\" over a density threshold, causing the star formation process to formally begin. In this manner, once star formation gets started in a cloud, it can proceed in a snowball fashion as a few new stars kick off the formation of many others. -JCB"}
{"text":"Double Explosion\n\nA few years ago, a giant star in another galaxy blew its top. But that was just a prelude to the main act. A couple of years later, it blew itself to bits -- perhaps giving birth to a black hole.\n\nThe star is known as Supernova 2006jc. It was about 77 million light-years away, in the constellation Lynx. That means the fireworks actually took place 77 million years ago, but their light just recently reached Earth.\n\nThe saga of 2006jc began in late 2004, when a Japanese amateur astronomer noticed a bright outburst in the Lynx galaxy. Astronomers first thought it was a supernova -- an explosion that can outshine an entire galaxy of normal stars.\n\nJust two years later, though, the star produced an even brighter outburst. This time, it really was a supernova.\n\nAstronomers are still studying the star, but the most likely scenario is this.\n\nThe star was many times larger and more massive than the Sun. An eruption from its surface layers spewed enough material into space to make several thousand planets as massive as Earth.\n\nBut the star quickly reached the point where it could no longer produce energy in its core. It may have made particles of matter and antimatter. These particles annihilated each other, driving the explosion that ripped the star apart. At the same time, the star's core collapsed -- perhaps producing a black hole.\n\nThere's a similar star in our own galaxy, just a few thousand light-years away. More"}

It's hard to understand how these estimates can be so far apart unless some important assumptions are different,\n\nYes, the assumptions used are very important. That's partly why I asked you to clarify your question (in the OP).\n\nsuch as how does Z relate to expected dimming.\n\nWhat Disney and Lang do (or rather, claim to do) is put a galaxy somewhat like our own (the Milky Way) at various distances (redshifts) and estimate whether it could be detected or not. They use two kinds of \"detection\" - could the galaxy be 'seen' as an extended source? and could the galaxy be 'seen' as a point source?\n\nRedshift (z) affects the former via observed surface brightness (which goes as (1+z)^4) ), while how the latter varies with z is a bit more complicated.OK, but I think that's a highly restrictive assumption.\n\nConsider AGNs (active galactic nuclei): our galaxy does not, today, have an AGN; however, per our current understanding, it certainly did in the past, possibly as recently as a few million years ago. And its nucleus certainly was active many times before that*. Nearly a decade ago now Chandra stared at a small field in the constellation Bo\u00f7tes for a while, and found lots of point sources (and a few extended sources). Many of these turned out to be AGN, some at very high redshift. Optical counterparts for some of the x-ray sources were not found. Is it possible that one of such sources may have been a distant Milky Way, with its SMBH+accretion disk 'on'?\n\nNow suppose an x-ray survey is done, with Chandra staring at a small field for much longer. For sure, many more point sources will be detected (some caveats apply), and perhaps some will be just like our galaxy, at a considerably greater distance. As luck would have it, here is a recent report of just such a deeper x-ray survey.That's a lot more precise, and so the answer to your question can be too.\n\nOf course, you say \"with some confidence\" but also \"definitely\"!\n\nYou also say \"light\"; do you mean \"electromagnetic radiation, in the region ~400-700 nm\" (i.e. the 'visual' or 'optical')? Or do you mean any part, or parts, of the entire electromagnetic spectrum?The key point the Disney and Lang paper makes is not so much the luminosity (brightness) one, but the surface brightness one: at extreme distances, our galaxy's apparent surface brightness is too low for it to be detectedI'll address this part of your post later; stay tuned!\n\n* true, the 'duty cycle' - as it is called - of the SMBH (super-massive black hole), and its accretion disk, at the centre of the nucleus of galaxies like ours is not well understood, but they do seem to have been 'on' more than once in their lives\n\nRedshift (z) affects the former via observed surface brightness (which goes as (1+z)^4) ), while how the latter varies with z is a bit more complicated I suppose Z goes to infinity at BB T0? I must have some misconception about the distances in an expanding Universe or something. In Ned Wright's calculator I'm taking the light travel time as the measure of distance.\n\n1 + Z is the wavelength ratio (emitted\/received) of a given spectral line, correct? Strange that Z was defined that way, instead of simply as the ratio.\n\nAs luck would have it, here is a recent report of just such a deeper x-ray survey. The HST optical images clearly show \"normal\" galaxies at 1 Z, but I have no idea if those galaxies are comparable to our own in luminosity.\n\nBTW I guess the X-ray detections of AGN are relatively insensitive to the orientation of the jets? Otherwise wouldn't it be possible that the \"normal\" galaxies detected are actually AGN at unfavorable viewing angles?\n\nOriginally Posted by NereidOK, so let's make it a bit more precise. Detection will be defined to mean that the source can be resolved as extended and that a spectral line can be measured to get Z. That's what I would like to consider as confident identification.\n\nLet's put it another way, if there were lots of galaxies like our own at the time they emitted the light that reaches us now, at what maximum distance would we be well aware of their existence.\n\nIn a later post, you moved a very long way from this as the key criterion!\n\nAs you discovered, 'being aware of the existence' of something, and being able to convince yourself of its similarity to something else, are two very different questions (or goals).\n\nThe purpose - well, one purpose - of my 'x-ray papers and post' was to illustrate that you could very well 'be aware of' a galaxy much like a (somewhat) earlier\/younger version of our galaxy (i.e. one with an active nucleus) without knowing, with any degree of certainty, that it is, in fact, a Milky Way sibling.\n\nI realize this is a theoretical question because of the assumptions about dimming and dust, so I'm asking in the context of mainstream LCMD theory formulas.\n\nI don't know how dust entered your considerations; perhaps you were concerned that a galaxy like ours, viewed sideways (so that the disk appears edge-on) might be very much dimmer (in that narrow band, ~400-700 nm) than the same galaxy viewed face on.\n\nCan you explain why you thought this important, please?\n\nSoIt's from the Fathi et al. paper I indirectly mentioned (I did some rounding), in an earlier post; have you read it yet?\n\nOh, and is there are particular reason you write \"Z\" for redshift, instead of the usual convention (\"z\")It's what you can readily observe; converting it to a distance depends on the cosmological model you choose to use, and the values of the parameters in that model.\n\nIt also depends upon the definition of distance you're using, e.g. luminosity distance, radar distance, etc. Which one have you chosen?The answer to that question is a definite \"maybe\"!\n\nIt depends, heavily, on things like what you mean by \"galaxies like our own (as it currently is)\" and \"detect\".\n\nBut we've moved on since your wrote these words; time for me to do so tooYes it is.\n\nAnd, given how much of that other thread you've no doubt read by now, you have begun to appreciate some of the limitations of D&L's approach. Yes?\n\nQuite astonishing how General Relativity works, isn't it?\n\nYet it's a very well tested theory, with nothing even remotely in sight to challenge it.\n\nI suppose Z goes to infinity at BB T0? must have some misconception about the distances in an expanding Universe or something. In Ned Wright's calculator I'm taking the light travel time as the measure of distance.\n\nWhy choose this kind of distance, rather than any other?\n\n1 + Z is the wavelength ratio (emitted\/received) of a given spectral line, correct? Strange that Z was defined that way, instead of simply as the ratio.But you spoiled the fun, by changing your criteria before I could get hereThe HST optical images clearly show \"normal\" galaxies at 1 Z, but I have no idea if those galaxies are comparable to our own in luminosity.BTW I guess the X-ray detections of AGN are relatively insensitive to the orientation of the jets? Otherwise wouldn't it be possible that the \"normal\" galaxies detected are actually AGN at unfavorable viewing angles?\n\nAs I understand it, spiral galaxy AGNs rarely, if ever, have jets. Certainly not ones visible in the x-ray part of the spectrum.\n\nThe source of x-rays, in most AGNs, is the accretion disk, and the immediate surroundings (by reflection). In principle, you'd expect accretion disk orientation - relative to us - would matter a lot (in terms of observed x-ray intensity); I do not know if, in fact, it does.\n\nOK, so let's make it a bit more precise. Detection will be defined to mean that the source can be resolved as extended\n\nGood. In the local group, there are three classical spirals: M31, our galaxy, and M33. They differ considerably in size and estimated total luminosity. They also differ - considerably - in many other ways (e.g. M31 apparently has far more globular clusters than our galaxy does, and M33's globular clusters seem to have a very different range of ages than those of either M31 or our own galaxy).\n\nand that a spectral line can be measured to get Z.\n\nEmission or absorption? Or you don't care?\n\nAnd if there's only one, how do you know which one it is? If you make a mistake, you'll get the estimated z completely wrong, won't you?\n\nThat's what I would like to consider as confident identification.\n\nAssuming the redshift is confident (by some magic), wouldn't that simply result in you having identified an extended source, of redshift z? How would you know it's even a galaxy?Originally Posted by NereidOriginally Posted by NereidOriginally Posted by NereidOriginally Posted by NereidOriginally Posted by NereidOriginally Posted by NereidThe images vary from z~0.08 to 1.2. All were made with what I'm guessing are visible band filters (B435, V606, and z850). I cannot find the absolute magnitudes in the paper. One at z 1.2 is quite red and dim but looks to be a face on spiral. The absolute mag of M31 is about -20. So now, I do wonder what it would look like (imaged identically) at z~1.2!\n\nOriginally Posted by NereidNo offense please, but why should I care? Isn't surface brightness more useful to talk about. I would imagine that compressing the luminosity into a point would much improve visibility\/detectability.\n\nOriginally Posted by Nereid\n\nAs I understand it, spiral galaxy AGNs rarely, if ever, have jets. Certainly not ones visible in the x-ray part of the spectrum.\n\nThat's interesting and something I was not aware of. What sort of galaxies are found with jets then? Are AGNs and quasars thought to be the same phenomenon, the result of central SMBHs in galaxies?\n\nOriginally Posted by Nereid\n\nIn this, I think we are in much agreement. The various sorts of detection discussed don't necessary tell us that much detail about what we have detected at cosmic distances. Again I think this is the whole point of the D&L paper. I'm not sure I see the basis for your severe criticism. I guess I could read that thread again but it really lost me in the details.\n\nOriginally Posted by Nereid\n\nEmission or absorption? Or you don't care?\n\nDefinitely emission, who knows where the absorbing medium is relative to the emitter? Of course you could also argue about re-emission but that seems much less likely to be a problem.\n\nOriginally Posted by Nereid\n\nAnd if there's only one, how do you know which one it is? If you make a mistake, you'll get the estimated z completely wrong, won't you?\n\nYou are a stickler, but of course you would need many more lines to identify the elemental source of any measured line.\n\nOriginally Posted by Nereid\n\nAssuming the redshift is confident (by some magic), wouldn't that simply result in you having identified an extended source, of redshift z? How would you know it's even a galaxy?\n\nYou are continuing to make the D&L paper's point! Why did you get so upset about it?\n(I wasn't aware that magic was required to be confident about a red-shift. Are you referring to my failure to mention the need for multiple lines?)\n\nI'm very interested in what you can tell me about the above very specific question about an HST image of M31 at z~1.2* I tried to post the two images, but got a strange error message, so you'll have to click on the link to see how dramatically different the two images, of the same galaxy, are.\n** it is obvious to you, isn't it?\n\nI mentioned dust in reference to intergalactic dust which affects brightness and color of background galaxies.\n\nAs far as I know, there are very few reports of the confident detection of intergalactic dust ... once you get out to ~5 effective radii for most spirals, the sky is quite clear. There are some exceptions - near the centre of rich clusters, possibly in various streams, and in tidal tails (a result of close encounters of the galactic kind). The IGM (inter-galactic medium) does certainly contain metals, but none of it in the form of dust.\n\nPerhaps you were thinking of the ISM (interstellar medium)? If not, could you give some references please?\n\nZ versus z - oops, but you got it anyway.\n\nIt seems that in this era of \"precision cosmology\" one should take conclusions about the galactic population at z ~> 0.15 with a large grain of salt.\n\nOne should always take broad, over-simplified conclusions with a truckload of salt!\n\nGalaxies are fascinating astronomical objects; on the one hand they seem so simple, yet when you start to examine them in detail, they turn out to be amazingly complicated. Fortunately, astronomers being (in general) especially fond of paying a lot of attention to detail, conclusions they draw (in the papers they publish) come with more than enough detail to enable you, the reader, to estimate just how much salt you need to take.\n\nI do wish the astronomical community would be more modest about what they think they know.\n\nMost of this post is scene-setting, making sure we're on the same page, that sort of thing ...\n\nOriginally Posted by TooMany\n\nOriginally Posted by NereidGood, especially the part about making doubly sure you're comparing apples with applies (so to speak).Discussion of this would take us too far from this thread, but if DM poses a problem for GR, it poses an equally daunting problem for the weak field limit we call Newtonian gravity (e.g. spiral galaxy rotation curves).Thus reinforcing the point that converting an observation of a redshift to an estimate of a distance is 'model dependent', as they say ...I think it depends on what you're trying to do, with the question you asked.\n\nIf your aim has something to do with galaxy evolution, then perhaps the best distance to use would be one that you could easily use to relate observations to 'age since photons streamed free' (i.e. when the universe ceased being radiation dominated). But as you have stated that you are explicitly interested in what the Milky Way would look like if it were a distance x from us, then perhaps a better measuring rod would be redshift (z)?Good; my point was that conventions sometimes do not seem to make much sense, when you are new to a field of scienceWhich is getting us much closer to what it is, exactly, that you think makes the Milky Way unique.\n\nAnd here we run into a completely different kind of challenge: what, exactly, does our own galaxy look like? As we're at a location close to the disk plane, ~10 kpc from the nucleus, it's actually very difficult to say, with a reasonable degree of confidence, what our homegalaxy looks like, from M31, say.\n\nTo get around this, how about we change the question in the OP to \"How close must a galaxy like M31 be to clearly detect?\" and \"Stated differently, with current instruments, at what distance would a galaxy like M31 probably not be detected?\"\n\nIf we use a GRB as a back-light, then detecting an M31 look-alike could be as simple as finding a set of absorption lines in its spectrum, at a fixed z, and with the characteristics of M31's ISM (a certain metallicity, and temperature). A bright quasar could serve in place of a GRB, giving the added benefit of repeat observations using different instruments over many years. In this way, an M31 look-alike could be detected to a redshift just shy of that of the GRB or quasar.\n\nIn emission, we could add up the light detected from the distant M31 look-alike, across as many wavelengths as possible*, and plot the integrated intensity against wavelength (or frequency). This would give us a SED (spectral energy distribution, or density); if we have a z, we can convert this to absolute units (assuming isotropic emission). We could then compare that with the (suitably redshifted) observed SED of M31 (taking care to ensure we integrate over the entire observed extent of M31, which is far from trivial to do). For this we do not need to 'resolve' the distant galaxy, although having it \"... be detected in minimally four connected pixels, each at \u2265 0.75\u03c3 above the local computed sky-background\" would be helpful**OK, so this is worth exploring further then.\n\nOn the question of what \"current instruments\" (per the OP) are capable of, is it OK to include what facilities such as LOFAR and the SKAwill be capable of, once they are up and running (and assuming they achieve their design objectives)?\n\n* as the distant galaxy will be faint, the points may have to be integrated over a 'broad band', such as SDSS' r.\n** see p8 of the Bias effects in galaxy detection threadI recall some years ago HST images of deep objects were interpreted as irregular, unformed galaxies. I think this interpretation was later discarded. The above example demonstrates how form can be misinterpreted in faint images.\n\nThat helps answer my question(s). Interesting that the authors don't highlight how this population might substantially differ from the current population. The featured conclusion is that the merger theory of large galaxy formation is probably wrong. However they do mention star formation rates as much higher. This makes me wonder how star formation rates can be measured.\n\nInteresting that the authors don't highlight how this population might substantially differ from the current population.\n\nIt's not my experience that much useful can be inferred from whether an individual research paper stresses or even mentions something or not. This is even more the case for something like CANDELS where the results will be appearing over perhaps dozens of papers over a span of years.\n\nThis makes me wonder how star formation rates can be measured.\n\nOptical and UV color, luminosity in emission lines (especially recombination lines), radio emission... it seems that the (emitted) optical and near-infrared bands are the only ones in which we easily see stellar populations other than quite young ones.

{"text":"Saturday, October 30, 2010\n\nIntroducing Some Basic Astrophysics\n\nLet's now start examining a number of basic problems typically posed in astrophysics. We'll start out with one of the most fundamental, the nature of \"gray atmospheres\" in stellar modelling. Stellar modelling itself is a topic that can occupy whole monographs (e.g. 'An Introduction to the Study of Stellar Structure' by S. Chandrasekhar) but we will confine current interest strictly to one simplified aspect of stellar atmospheres for now. (At a later point, we can examine how a full stellar model is developed from the interior to the outer envelope).\n\nModeling stellar atmospheres is similarly a very complex undertaking that often requires we make basic assumptions. The \"gray atmosphere\" is one such simplifying assumption.\n\nFirst, some preliminaries on essential technical terms, etc.\n\nThe Planck function describes the distribution of radiation for a black body, and can be expressed:\n\nB(L) = {(2 hc^2)\/ L^5} * [1\/ exp(hc\/LkT) - 1)]\n\nwhere h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, T is the absolute temperature, k is the Boltzmann constant, and L defines the wavelength.In the plane-parallel treatment, we take layers of the gases in a stellar atmosphere to be like layers of a \"sandwich\", where ds is an element of length or path perpendicular to the layers\n\nThis is opposed to employing curved layers (as would technically be the case, but for which the math is many times more complex!)\n\nNow as a beam of radiation passes through stellar gases, there will be emission and absorption along the way. The \"source function\" specifies the ratio of one to the other and can be expressed:\n\nS(L) = e(L)\/ k(L)\n\nwhere L again denotes wavelength, e(L) is the emission coefficent, and k(L) the absorption coefficient.\n\nIn the case of simple radiation transfer in a model stellar atmosphere (e.g. nothing changes with time), we have the relation of radiation intensity I(L) to source function S(L):\n\ndI(L)\/ds = -k(L) I(L) + k(L) S(L) = k(L)[S(L) \u2013 I(L)] - 0\n\nor I(L) = S(L)\n\nNow, for a black body, I(L) equals the Planck function B(L)\n\nSo, in effect, we have:\n\nS(L) = I(L) = B(L)\n\nAnd this is a condition \u2013 which for any stellar atmosphere \u2013 implies LOCAL THERMODYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUMor LTE Note: LTE does NOT mean complete thermodynamic equilibrium!(E.g. since in the outer layers of a star there is always large energy loss from the stellar surface)\n\nThus, one only assumes the emission of the radiation is the same as for a gas in thermodynamic equilibrium at a temperature (T) corresponding to the temperature of the layer under consideration.\n\nAnother way to say this is that if LTE holds, the photons always emerge at all wavelengths.\n\nNow, in the above treatment, note that the absorption coefficient was always written as: k(L) to emphasize its wavelength (L) dependence.\n\nHowever, there are certain specific treatments for which we may eliminate the wavelength dependence on absorption, and simply write:ke.g. k has the same value at ALL wavelengths!\n\nThis is what is meant by the \"gray atmosphere\" approximation.\n\nI'll now give a specific application of the gray atmosphere approximation. In a particular integral, the surface flux\n\n(pi F(O)) = 2 pi (I(cos (theta)) =[a(L) + 2(b(L)\/3 ] pi\n\nand F_L(0) = S(L) (t(L) = 2\/3\n\nwhich states that the flux coming out of the stellar surface is equal to the source function at the optical depth t = 2\/3. This is the important 'Eddington-Barbier' relation that paves the way for the understanding of how stellar spectra are formed.\n\nOnce one then assumes LTE, one can further assume k(L) is independent of L (gray atmosphere) so that:\n\nk(L) = k; t(L) = t andF_L(0) = B_L(T(t = 2\/3)\n\nThus, the energy distribution of F_L is that of a black body corresponding to the temperature at an optical depth t = 2\/3.\n\nFrom this, with some simple substitutions and integrations (hint: look at the Stefan-Boltzmann law!) the interested reader can easily determine:\n\npi F(O) = o(T_eff)^4 and T_eff = T(t = 2\/3)\n\nwhere o is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Thus, the temperature at optical depth 2\/3 must equal the effective temperature"}

It captures half a billion individual stars and galaxies.\n\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) today released the largest-ever digital color image of the sky.\n\nImage Credit: Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n\nThe new image, above, is created from seven million images of the night sky. It consists of 1.2 trillion pixels. It covers a third of the night sky and captures half a billion individual stars and galaxies. Every yellow dot in the image above is a galaxy. If you could zoom in on these dots, you'd find a galaxy's detailed structure and individual star-forming regions.\n\nSky surveys such as the Sloan are part of a venerated tradition in astronomy.

They were part of the National Geographic Palomar Survey, which used 14-inch square photographic plates, covering about 6\u00b0 of sky per side (approximately 36 square degrees per plate).\n\nToday's Sloan surveys of the universe are more ambitious and technologically rich, but the principle is still the same.

{"text":"The Question\n\n(Submitted April 20, 1998)\n\nWhat is the error factor in the distances to galaxies? For instance, the\nAndromeda galaxy (M31) is 2.8 million light years. How accurate is that?\nIs the error plus or minus 1 million light years or what? And does that\nerror factor get much worse the farther out we go?\n\nThe Answer\n\nNearby galaxies, where you can see individual stars, probably have about a\n10% distance uncertainty.\n\nFor galaxies at distances where you can't see individual stars, the\ndistance is found by multiplying the redshift by a number called the Hubble\nConstant H0. The value of H0 is a contentious issue, but the two extreme\ncamps are arguing for ~55 or ~70 km\/s\/Mpc, which means that there is about\na 30% range in how far away people think any given galaxy is. The accuracy\nwith which the redshift is measured doesn't depend much on the distance to\nthe galaxy, so this is a constant factor: you know that one galaxy is 3.0\ntimes as far away as another, and not 3.1 or 2.9 times.\n\nAt distances which are a good fraction of the age of the universe away, the\nquestion is how constant the Hubble constant is. Depending on how much\nmass there is in the universe (and thus how much the universe has been\nslowed down by gravity--so how much faster it was expanding in the early\ndays) this can add an additional uncertainty range of 50%."}
{"text":"causes gamma-ray bursts? The most energetic type of explosions known in the cosmos has been an enigma since discovered over 30 years ago. It now appears that there may not be one unique type of progenitor. Long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been localized, over the past few years, to blue regions in the universe rich in star formation. Massive young stars nearing the end of their short lives commonly explode in these regions. Astronomers associate these long duration GRBs, that can last from seconds to minutes, with a type of stellar explosion common in young massive stars. Over the past few months, short duration GRBs have finally been localized and found to occur in different types of regions \u2014 not only blue regions rich in star formation. Many astronomers therefore now theorize that short GRBs, which typically last less than one second, are the result of a different progenitor process than long GRBs. A leading model is that a short GRB will occur when a neutron star either impacts another neutron star or a black hole. Such collisions may occur well after star-forming regions have otherwise burned out. Pictured in the above illustration, two energized neutrons stars finally approach each other in their orbits, a death spiral that might end with a short GRB."}

{"text":"Pulsars are perhaps the most extraordinary physics laboratories in the Universe.\n\nResearch on these extreme and exotic objects already has produced two Nobel Prizes\n. Pulsar researchers now are poised to learn otherwise-unavailable details of nuclear physics, to test General Relativity in conditions of extremely strong gravity, and to directly detect gravitational waves with a \"telescope\" nearly the size of our Galaxy.\n\nNeutron stars are the remnants of massive stars that exploded as supernovae. They pack more than the mass of the Sun into a sphere no larger than a medium-sized city, making them the densest objects in the Universe, except for black holes, for which the concept of density is theoretically irrelevant.\n\nPulsars are neutron stars that emit beams of radio waves outward from the poles of their magnetic fields. When their rotation spins a beam across the Earth, radio telescopes detect that as a \"pulse\" of radio waves.\n\nBy precisely measuring the timing of such pulses, astronomers can use pulsars for unique \"experiments\" at the frontiers of modern physics.\n\nThree scientists presented the results of such work, and the promise of future discoveries, at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nPulsars are at the forefront of research on gravity. Albert Einstein published his theory of General Relativity in 1916, and his description of the nature of gravity has, so far, withstood numerous experimental tests. However, there are competing theories.\n\n\"Many of these alternate theories do just as good a job as General Relativity of predicting behavior within our Solar System. One area where they differ, though, is in the extremely dense environment of a neutron star,\" said Ingrid Stairs, of the University of British Columbia.\n\nIn some of the alternate theories, gravity's behaviour should vary based on the internal structure of the neutron star.\n\n\"By carefully timing pulsar pulses, we can precisely measure the properties of the neutron stars. Several sets of observations have shown that pulsars' motions are not dependent on their structure, so General Relativity is safe so far,\" Stairs explained.\n\nRecent research on pulsars in binary-star systems with other neutron stars, and, in one case, with another pulsar, offer the best tests yet of General Relativity in very strong gravity. The precision of such measurements is expected to get even better in the future, Stairs said.\n\nAnother prediction of General Relativity is that motions of masses in the Universe should cause disturbances of space-time in the form of gravitational waves. Such waves have yet to be directly detected, but study of pulsars in binary-star systems have given indirect evidence for their existence. That work won a Nobel Prize in 1993.\n\n\"\nPulsars are such extremely precise timepieces that we can use them to detect gravitational waves in a frequency range to which no other experiment will be sensitive,\" said Benjamin Stappers, of the University of Manchester in the UK.\n\nBy carefully timing the pulses from pulsars widely scattered within our Galaxy, the astronomers hope to measure slight variations caused by the passage of the gravitational waves.\n\nThe scientists hope such Pulsar Timing Arrays can detect gravitational waves caused by the motions of supermassive pairs of black holes in the early Universe, cosmic strings, and possibly from other exotic events in the first few seconds after the Big Bang.\n\n\"At the moment, we can only place limits on the existence of the very low-frequency waves we're seeking, but planned expansion and new telescopes will, we hope, result in a direct detection within the next decade,\" Stappers said.\n\nWith densities as much as several times greater than that in atomic nuclei, pulsars are unique laboratories for nuclear physics. Details of the physics of such dense objects are unknown.\n\n\"By measuring the masses of neutron stars, we can put constraints on their internal physics,\" said Scott Ransom of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.\n\n\"Just in the past three to four years, we've found several massive neutron stars that, because of their large masses, rule out some exotic proposals for what's going on at the centers of neutron stars,\" Ransom said.\n\nThe work is ongoing, and more measurements are needed. \"Theorists are clever, so when we provide new data, they tweak their exotic models to fit what we've found,\" Ransom said.

This means that the star is less hidden than had been thought, and therefore about half as massive. They estimated that the star had an initial mass of about 25 times the mass of our Sun, but that it is shedding material so rapidly that it has already lost 10-40 percent of its initial mass into the dusty torus, by means of a violent stellar wind.\n\n\"The characteristics of the star mean that it may be experiencing a very unstable phase accompanied by heavy mass loss,\" says Markus Wittkowski from ESO. \"We estimate that the belt of gas and dust that surrounds it contains between three and nine solar masses, which means that the star has already lost between one tenth and a third of its initial mass.\"\n\nInfrared images of the Large Magellanic Cloud, our nearest galactic neighbour at a distance of 160,000 light years.

They have concluded that evaporating mini-black holes\nare unlikely to be the origin of (at least the majority of) gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs).\n\nHere are some of the reasons:\n\nEvery GRB is different: some are complex, some are simple, some are long,\nsome are short, some are hard, some are soft. But every decaying black hole\nis the same (except for angular momentum and surrounding material).\n\nDecaying black holes have well predicted time and energy behavior. What\nis expected from a black hole decay is a brief, rapidly hardening flash\nwhich would be most observable by Comptel or EGRET. Comptel and EGRET have\nlooked for such, and not found any.\n\nDecaying black holes don't decay unless they are relatively small, so they\ndon't have very much energy, thus they must be in our immediate neighborhood\nto be seen.

Without them, solid, rocky planets would be impossible, and the prospects for Earth-like life would be correspondingly dim.\n\nThe iron Chandra X Ray Space Telescope has recently imaged in Cas A might one day flow as hemoglobin in the blood of some future alien species. Fast moving knots of silicon from the Cas A supernova could provide the raw material for sand on otherworldly shores, where crashing waves of H2O send thunderous sound waves through a nitrogen-rich atmosphere.\n\nA team of astronomers led by Dr. John Hughes of Rutgers University used observations from NASA's orbital Chandra X-ray Observatory to make an important new discovery that sheds light on how silicon, iron, and other elements were produced in supernova explosions. An X-ray image of Cassiopeia A (Cas A), the remnant of an exploded star, reveals gaseous clumps of silicon, sulfur, and iron expelled from deep in the interior of the star.\n\nA preon star is a proposed type of compact star made of preons, a group of hypothetical subatomic particles that could originate from supernova explosions or the Big Bang. Preons were originally proposed as quark constituents over three decades ago, but in 2005, Fredrik Sandin and Johan Hansson of the Lule\u00e5 University of Technology in Sweden came up with the concept of preon \"stars\" or \"nuggets\" in space.\n\nThese objects, would be somewhere between the size of a pea and a football, with a mass comparable to the Moon with a density that would be in the range between a neutron star--the densest ordinary form of matter--and a black hole.\n\nWe learned in our intro to science courses that information cannot be transmitted faster than the speed of light. Yet laboratory experiments done over the last 30 years clearly show that some things appear to break this speed limit without abrogating Einstein's special theory of relativity.\n\nYet astrophysicists in the US have observed such superluminal speeds in space in the form of radio pulses from a pulsar.\n\nScientists who challenged current models of physics by reporting particles that broke the Universe's speed-of-light limit said on Friday they were taking a second look at their hotly debated experiment.\n\nNew observations from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope provide strong evidence that the slender, bulgeless galaxies can, like their heftier counterparts, harbor supermassive black holes at their cores. Previously, astronomers thought that a galaxy without a bulge could not have a supermassive black hole. In this illustration, jets shooting away from the black holes are depicted as thin streams.\n\nThe findings are reshaping theories of galaxy formation, suggesting that a galaxy's core does not determine whether it will be harbor a supermassive black hole.\n\nThere's also a chance that past visits to Earth by intelligent aliens left signs much closer to home. But probability and the length of the universe's age suggest that any such alien visit would have taken place before humans ever emerged on Earth, says Paul Davies, astrophysicist with Arizona State University.\n\nThat means any traces of an alien visitation would have had to survive for hundreds of millions or billions of years of erosion and plate tectonics for humans to still find them today.\n\nOctober 29, 2011\n\nVast clumps dust shrouds that obscure about half of supermassive black holes could be the result of high speed roller-derby crashes between planets and asteroids, according to a new theory from an international team of astronomers, led by Sergei Nayakshin of the University of Leicester. Collisions between these rocky objects would occur at colossal speeds as large as 1000 km per second, continuously shattering and fragmenting the objects, until eventually they end up as microscopic dust.\n\nThe existence of a new signature of the birth of the first stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way was revealed by two researchers from Observatoire Astronomique de Strasbourg. More than 12 billion years ago, the intense ultraviolet light from these stars dispersed the gas of our Galaxy's nearest companions, virtually putting a halt to their ability to form stars and consigning them to a dim future.\n\nThree planets -- each orbiting its own giant, dying star -- have been discovered by an international research team The new research is expected to shed light on the evolution of planetary systems around dying stars. It also will help astronomers to understand how metal content influences the behavior of dying stars.\n\nThe three newly-discovered planetary systems are more evolved than our own solar system. \"Each of the three stars is swelling and has already become a red giant -- a dying star that soon will gobble up any planet that happens to be orbiting too close to it,\" according to Alex Wolszczan, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State, who, in 1992, became the first astronomer ever to discover planets outside our solar system."}

Data from the Subaru Telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST), the Very Large Telescope (VLT), the 1.88 m telescope at the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory (OAO), and the Japanese infrared astronomy satellite AKARI all contributed to this finding, which takes scientists closer to understanding the prevalence and formation of C60 in space.\n\nInterstellar space is teeming with solid, minute particles called \"dust\", a large fraction of which are rich in carbon that was formed in the cores of solar-type stars. When dust grains are ejected into interstellar space from dying stars, they are catalysts for the formation of the next generation of stars. Therefore, an investigation into the amount and composition of the dust produced by dying stars as well as its subsequent return to interstellar space is a crucial step in understanding stellar evolution and the chemical evolution of galaxies.\n\nThe C60 fullerene (Note 1) is a molecule consisting of 60 carbon atoms, with a geometric pattern that resembles the seams on a soccer ball (Figure 1). It is particularly interesting since C60 is an extremely stable molecule, which easily forms in laboratories on Earth, and probably exists in abundance in interstellar space. However, its detection in space has only been recent (2010) and elusive, having been found in about 20 objects. Scientists do not know yet how prevalent it is or what sort of environment is necessary to produce it.\n\nHow much C60 exists in space? Since C60 is very stable, could there be much more C60 in celestial objects than on Earth? To answer these queries, the team focused on a class of dying stars called \"planetary nebulae\" (Note 2), because cosmic C60 has previously been detected in these objects. Otsuka analyzed all of the relevant spectroscopic data taken by the SST and analyzed spectral data from more than 300 planetary nebulae, checking each carefully for evidence of C60 infrared wavelengths. The team identified C60 in several planetary nebulae, including the first detection of C60 in M1-11 (Figure 2).\n\nOtsuka also found evidence for C60 in the archived spectra of M1-11 taken by the VLT and proceeded to estimate the total amount and the temperature of C60 in M1-11. Using data obtained with the SST and AKARI, he also investigated the dust grain composition in M1-11 and obtained the amount in each component. Although M1-11 is rich in carbon-bearing molecules and minerals, C60 makes up only 0.01 percent of the total dust mass. Therefore, he concluded that C60 is very rare in the interstellar medium The\n\nDetailed analysis of the spectra (Figure 3) revealed the relative amounts (abundances) of eleven elements.

{"text":"AGNs\n\nWith the exception of dwarfs, all galaxies have the potential to be active and\nalmost certainly went through a period of intense activity at the time when\nthe central bulge and associated black hole were being formed. But only about\n10% of local galaxies are classed as active, though the percentage increases\nas we look to higher redshifts. Activity is a somewhat slippery concept but is\nmost easily defined as emission resulting from accretion of matter on to the\nblack hole at the centre of a galaxy. Observationally, this activity can\nmanifest itself in the form of Seyfert-like behaviour, i.e., strong, broad,\nhigh ionisation emission lines and strong blue\/UV continuum emission, or as\nradio emission powered by jet of relativistic particles which can occur either\nwith or without associated Seyfert-like behaviour. The range of optical\nluminosities can be enormous ranging from LINERS (poor cousins of Seyferts) to\nquasars which are the most luminous objects in the Universe. The same is true\nfor the radio emission; the most luminous radio sources are usually\naccompanied by strong optical activity but the converse is not true. There\nreally do seem tobe two types of AGN, those that are radio-loud and produce\njets, and those that are radio quiet. Most of the research at JBCA focuses on\nthe radio loud objects but even amongst those there is a vast range of\nluminosities.\n\nSome of the key questions are:\n\n1. What triggers a galaxy to become active? This is almost certainly related to\navailibility of gas to be accreted by the black hole, perhaps liberated by an\ninteraction with another galaxy, but the details of the process remain a\nmystery.\n\n2. Why are some object radio loud and others, apparently identical in other\nrespects, radio quiet?\n\n3. How are the radio jets produced and what regulates the maximum energy of the\nsynchrotron electrons that are accelerated? Radio loud objects emit over the\nwhole EM spectrum up to gamma-ray wavelengths and the study of their spectral\nenergy distributions is an important topic.\n\n4. How do radio jets interact with their host galaxies? On a global level it\nis thought that jets in the dramatic early stages of galaxy formation can\nregulate the growth of galaxies through feedback. In nearby galaxies such\nphysical process can be studied in detail but at a much less grander scale.\n\nExciting times are ahead for AGN science: new radio facilities like e-MERLIN,\nEVLA, SCUBA2 and ALMA are about to come on line and there is a flood of\nmulti-wavelength data from optical\/IR\/Gamma-ray surveys like SDSS, UKIDDS,\nHerschel GLAST. A list of current projects JBCA is involved in is available\nhere and some are introduced below.\n\nNot very active elliptical galaxies\n\n(R. Battye, I. Browne)\n\nThe details of how the elliptical galaxies were assembled is one of the key\nquestions in modern astrophysics. There are two main approaches to the\nproblem: to look back in redshift to the times when assembly was happening or\nto look at local galaxies for clues in their properties as to their histories.\nBy studying of the radio emission from relatively local SDSS galaxies, we have\ndiscovered a statistically highly significant trend for the axes of the radio\nemission to be aligned with minor axes of the stellar distribution in\nelliptical galaxies. Remarkably, when the sample is split on the basis of the\nratio of radio flux density to optical flux density it is found that the\ntendency to align is enhanced if we select only the radio weaker sources.\nAlignments have been long searched for because of their potential to tell us\nabout the shapes of galaxies and about the orientation of the accretion\ndisk\/black hole system. Our results imply that the galaxies must be oblate\nspheroids (squashed spheres) and the emerging radio jets must be aligned with\nthe minor axes of the spheroids. This is itself a new result. An interesting\nopen question is the reason for the dependence of alignment properties on\nradio loudness. We speculate that the division we find is related to the\nmerger history of elliptical galaxies which in turn is related to the recently\nrecognized division of elliptical galaxies into those that are rotationally\nsupported and those which are not rotating. In this picture radio weaker\nobjects are rotationally supported and kinematically well ordered. Conversely,\nthe louder objects live in kinematically more complex galaxies.\nWe are following up these results -- there are opportunities here for student\nprojects. We can extend the sample using existing SDSS data and also look for\ncorrelations with other measured parameters. The environments of the aligned\nand non-aligned objects are being studied because the richness of the\nenvironments tells us about the likelihood of mergers which is how ellipticals\nare built up. We also plan to examine in depth the radio structures of a\nsubset of the aligned and unaligned objects to see if the differences are\nreflected in their radio morphologies. Does the complex kinematics of the\nnon-rotators destroy the alignment information? We also want to make long-slit\nor integral field optical spectroscopic observations to study the kinematics\nin objects with detailed radio maps. This work is complementary to that in\nthe SENSE project because the intrinsic radio\nluminosities (not the beamed luminosities) and redshifts of the samples of\nobjects are very similar."}

Never before have astronomers observed two of these powerful stellar explosions occurring in the same galaxy so close together in time.\n\nThe galaxy, known as MCG +05-43-16, is 380 million light-years from Earth. Until this year, astronomers had never sighted a supernova popping off in this stellar congregation. A supernova is an extremely energetic and life-ending explosion of a star.\n\nMaking the event even more unusual is the fact that the two supernovae belong to different types. Supernova 2007ck is a Type II event - which is triggered when the core of a massive star runs out of nuclear fuel and collapses gravitationally, producing a shock wave that blows the star to smithereens. Supernova 2007ck was first observed on May 19.\n\nIn contrast, Supernova 2007co is a Type Ia event, which occurs when a white dwarf star accretes so much material from a binary companion star that it blows up like a giant thermonuclear bomb. It was discovered on June 4, 2007. A white dwarf is the exposed core of a star after it has ejected its atmosphere; it's approximately the size of Earth but with the mass of our Sun.\n\n\"Most galaxies have a supernova every 25 to 100 years, so it's remarkable to have a galaxy with two supernovae discovered just 16 days apart,\" says Stefan Immler of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

Scientists who speculate on plant life and what might constitute photosynthesis \"out there\" say that plant color depends on the size and light intensity that the planet feeds off from its star, or sun, as well as the extrasolar planet's atmospheric chemistry.\n\nWhen we think of extrasolar Earth-like planets, the first tendency is to imagine weird creatures like Jar Jar Binks, Chewbacca, and, if those are not bizarre enough, maybe even the pointy-eared Vulcan, Spock, of Star Trek fame.\n\nBut scientists seeking clues to life on extrasolar planets are studying various biosignatures found in the light spectrum leaking out to Earth to speculate on something more basic and essential than the musical expertise of Droopy McCool. They are speculating on what kind of photosynthesis might occur on such planets and what the extrasolar plants might look like.\n\nPaint it black\n\nIt could be the plants are black, says Robert Blankenship, Ph.D., Lucille P. Markey Distinguished Professor in Arts & Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. But it all depends on what size and light intensity of star - or sun - the planet feeds off, and the extrasolar planet's atmospheric chemistry.\n\nPlants on Earth are green because of chlorophyll, which harnesses the energy of the sun to make sugars for metabolism. But our plants aren't completely efficient - they waste a little bit of light.\n\n\"Ideally, what you want is a black molecule that absorbs all of the light,\" Blankenship said. \"There could be another system developed on an extrasolar planet where plants are completely black if the spectrum of light that's available to organisms is different from the light available to organisms on Earth.........\n\nNew Technique for Observing Faint Companions\n\nHertzsprung-Russell Diagram\n\nObserving the image of a faint object that lies close to a star is a demanding task as the object is generally hidden in the glare of the star. Characterising this object, by taking spectra, is an even harder challenge. Still, thanks to ingenious researchers and a new ESO imaging spectrograph, this is now feasible, paving the way to an eldorado of a number of new thrilling discoveries.\n\nThese very high contrast observations are fundamental for directly imaging unknown extra-solar planets (i.e. planets orbiting a star other than the Sun), as well as low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, those failed stars that are too small to start burning hydrogen into helium.\n\nAstronomer Niranjan Thatte and colleagues developed a new method for exactly this purpose. The basis of the concept is relatively simple: while the positions of most of the features linked to the host star and artefacts produced by the telescope and the instrument scale with the wavelength, the location of a faint companion does not. So if the image has an internal reflection of the star masquerading as a planet, this phantom planet will be in one location in the image when looking in red light, and another when looking in blue; a real planet will stay at the same place no matter what colour of light one examines. Therefore, with the combined detection of spectra and position, one can see what is scaling, subtract it, and be left with what is fixed, that is the target dim object. Such observations can be done with specific instruments, called 'integral field spectrographs', such as the SINFONI instrument on ESO's VLT. This technique, termed Spectral Deconvolution (SD), eventhough first proposed in 2002 for space-based applications, has never been applied to obtain spectra of a real object until now.........\n\nGazing up at the Man in the Star?\n\nAn artist's rendition of Altair, a star that spins so quickly it stretches at its equator.

Credit: Zina Deretsky, National Science Foundation\n\nUsing a suite of four telescopes, astronomers have captured an image of Altair, one of the closest stars to our own and a fixture in the summer sky.\n\nWhile astronomers have recently imaged a few of the enormous, dying, red-giant stars, this is the first time anyone has seen the surface of a relatively tiny hydrogen-burning star like our own sun.\n\n\"The galaxy is shaped by the effects of relatively rare but powerful hot, rapidly rotating stars,\" says John Monnier of the University of Michigan, the lead author on the study that will appear on Science Express on May 31, 2007. \"These stars have more in common with Altair than our own sun and understanding Altair will allow us to better understand how these influential stars scattered throughout the galaxy operate\".\n\nMonnier was part of an international team of astronomers that captured the image using four of the six telescopes at a facility on Mt. Wilson, Calif., operated by the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) at Georgia State University in Atlanta with partial support from the National Science Foundation (NSF).\n\nThe CHARA telescopes were able to make the breakthrough observation because they were outfitted with a novel system to clean up some of the distortions from Earth's atmosphere, a technology called the Michigan Infrared Combiner, developed with NSF support at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Recent advances in fiber optic telecommunication technology made this new combiner possible.........\n\nUniversity of Colorado at Boulder scientists will scan Venus during a spacecraft flyby this week using an $8.7 million instrument they designed and built for NASA's MESSENGER Mission, launched in 2004 and speeding toward Mercury.\n\nBuilt by CU-Boulder's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, the instrument will make measurements of the thick clouds and shrouded surface of Venus during the June 5th flyby, said LASP Senior Research Associate William McClintock, a mission co-investigator who led the CU-Boulder instrument development team. Known as the Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer, or MASCS, the instrument will compare the atmosphere of Venus with data from other spacecraft that have visited the planet in the past four decades.\n\n\"This is our first opportunity for a close flyby of a solar system object with MESSENGER, and we should be able to tell if the atmosphere of Venus has been changing in recent years, \" said McClintock. \"As importantly, we are using Venus as a test case to learn more about our instrument performance in preparation for the spacecraft's ultimate destination of Mercury\".\n\nCarrying seven instruments, MESSENGER will be the first spacecraft ever to orbit Mercury and the first to return data from the hot, rocky planet in more than 30 years.

The mass may actually be two or more times prior estimates.\n\n\"These results will help us understand the overall question of the age and hence the origin of Saturn's rings,\" said Josh Colwell, assistant professor of physics at the University of Central Florida and a member of the Cassini ultraviolet imaging spectrograph team publishing its results in the journal Icarus this month.\n\nPrincipal investigator Larry Esposito at the University of Colorado, Boulder is fascinated with the findings.\n\n\"The rings are different from the picture we had in our minds,\" Esposito said. \"We originally thought we would see a uniform cloud of particles. Instead we find that the particles are clumped together with empty spaces in between. If you were flying under Saturn's rings in an airplane, you would see these flashes of sunlight come through the gaps, followed by dark and so forth. This is different from flying under a uniform cloud of particles.\"........\n\nBreathtaking views of Deuteronilus Mensae\n\nThe High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on board ESA's Mars Express has captured breathtaking images of the Deuteronilus Mensae region on Mars.\n\nThe images were taken on 14 March 2005 during orbit number 1483 of the Mars Express spacecraft with a ground resolution of approximately 29 metres per pixel.\n\nThey show the Deuteronilus Mensae region, located on the northern edge of Arabia Terra and bordering the southern highlands and the northern lowlands. Situated at approximately 39 degree North and 23 degree East, Deuteronilus Mensae are primarily characterised by glacial features. The scene is illuminated by the Sun from the south-west (from bottom left in the image).\n\nThe scene is dominated by a depression measuring approximately 2 000 metres in depth and 110 kilometres in diameter, north to south.\n\nVisible in the centre of the first image, the interior of the depression is characterised by dark material, differing from the light-toned surrounding plains.\n\nDeeply incised valleys of a depth ranging from 800 to 1 200 metres are clearly identifiable in the northern part of the scene. Deeply incised valleys with a depth ranging from 800 to 1 200 metres are clearly identifiable in the northern part of the scene.\n\nIt is believed that these valleys may have originated due to intense flooding by melted water ice. The water then froze rather quickly, flowing down the slopes of the depression like a glacier. Aeolian sediments (eroded by the action of wind) traced the flow pattern on the surface.........\n\nTwo Supermassive Black Holes In Colliding Galaxies\n\nNGC 6240 Credit: C. Max, G. Canalizo, and W. de Vries.\n\nAstronomers, including UC Riversides Gabriela Canalizo, have used powerful adaptive optics technology at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to reveal the precise locations and environments of a pair of supermassive black holes at the center of an ongoing collision between two galaxies 300 million light-years away.\n\nThe new observations of the galaxy merger known as NGC 6240 reveal that each of the black holes resides at the center of a rotating disk of stars and is surrounded by a cloud of young star clusters formed in the merger.\n\nFindings from the study are published online in Science Express today; in print in Science at a date to be determined.\n\n\"The study of the interplay between galaxy mergers, star formation, and activity from accreting black holes is crucial to our understanding of how the universe evolved to the galaxies and structures we see today,\" said Canalizo, an assistant professor of physics in UCRs Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics\n\nCanalizo, the second author of the research paper, worked with Claire E.

Hurford is lead author of a paper on this research appearing in Nature May 17. This paper is one of two studies on Enceladus in this issue of Nature. The other paper explains that tidal forces cause the sides of the cracks to rub together and produce enough heat to vaporize ice into plumes that jettison off the moon, scientists suggest.\n\nIn 2005, the Cassini spacecraft flew by Enceladus and saw plumes of material erupting from the south pole of Enceladus. Researchers were surprised to see this because eruptions are powered by heat from an object's interior. Enceladus is tiny in comparison to most moons, only about 500 kilometers (310 miles) in diameter, so it should have lost its interior heat to the cold of space long ago.\n\nA closer look by Cassini revealed a series of 120-kilometer (75-mile) long cracks in the south polar region of Enceladus, which were nicknamed \"Tiger Stripes\" because they resembled a tiger's distinctive marks. The stripes are warmer than their surroundings, so researchers believe they are the source of the eruptions. The Cassini observations also show the plumes consist of water vapor, so there is evidence for liquid water under the ice. Since liquid water is necessary to support known forms of life, Enceladus has become a promising place to look for extraterrestrial life.........\n\nBetween July 2004 and February 2005, the X-ray observatories watched the heart of the nearby galaxy, Andromeda, also known to astronomers as M31. During that time, Pietsch and colleagues monitored novae, looking for the X-rays.\n\nThey detected that eleven out of the 34 novae that had exploded in the galaxy during the prior year were shining X-rays into space. \"X-rays are an important window onto novae. They show the atmosphere of the white dwarf,\" says Pietsch.\n\nWhite dwarfs are hot stellar corpses left behind after the rest of the star has been ejected into space. A typical white dwarf contains about the mass of the Sun, in a spherical volume little bigger than the Earth. Given its density, it has a strong pull of gravity. If in orbit around a normal star, it may rip gas from the star........."}

{"text":"Growing Pains [Preview]\n\nBow down before dark matter: that is one of the messages of 20th-century astronomy. Some unseeable material rules the cosmos, and ordinary matter is just along for the ride. It sounds like the culmination of the Copernican revolution, the ultimate displacement of humanity from a central role in the grand scheme of things. But lately researchers have been thinking that the lesson in humility has gone too far. What dark matter demands, ordinary matter doesn't always obey meekly.\n\nInklings of the spunkiness of ordinary matter have emerged over the past decade as observers have peered deeper into space and therefore farther back in time. According to the standard dark matter scenario, galaxies should have formed hierarchically: subgalactic scraps came first and slowly consolidated into full-fledged galaxies. Yet many galaxies seem to have jumped the gun: they were too big too early. \"The mass assembly of massive galaxies is extremely and remarkably rapid--and much more rapid than is seen in the models,\" says Reinhard Genzel of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching,"}
{"text":"Spectral lines are produced by transitions of electrons within atoms or ions. As the electrons move closer to or farther from the nucleus of an atom (or of an ion), energy in the form of light (or other radiation) is emitted or absorbed. The yellow \"D\" lines of sodium (seeD-lines) or the \"H\" and \"K\" lines of ionized calcium (seen as dark absorption lines) are produced by discrete quantum jumps from the lowest energy levels (ground states) of these atoms. The visible hydrogen lines (the so-called Balmer series; seespectral line series), however, are produced by electron transitions within atoms in the second energy level (or first excited state), which lies well above the ground level in energy. Only at high temperatures are sufficient numbers of atoms maintained in this state by collisions, radiations, and so forth to permit an appreciable number of absorptions to occur. At the low surface temperatures of a red dwarf star, few electrons populate the second level of hydrogen, and thus the hydrogen lines are dim. By contrast, at very high temperatures\u2014for instance, that of the surface of a blue giant star\u2014the hydrogen atoms are nearly all ionized and therefore cannot absorb or emit any line radiation. Consequently, only faint dark hydrogen lines are observed. The characteristic features of ionized metals such as iron are often weak in such hotter stars because the appropriate electron transitions involve higher energy levels that tend to be more sparsely populated than the lower levels. Another factor is that the general \"fogginess,\" or opacity, of the atmospheres of these hotter stars is greatly increased, resulting in fewer atoms in the visible stellar layers capable of producing the observed lines.\n\nThe continuous (as distinct from the line) spectrum of the Sun is produced primarily by the photodissociation of negatively charged hydrogen ions (H\u2212)\u2014i.e., atoms of hydrogen to which an extra electron is loosely attached. In the Sun's atmosphere, when H\u2212 is subsequently destroyed by photodissociation, it can absorb energy at any of a whole range of wavelengths and thus produce a continuous range of absorption of radiation. The main source of light absorption in the hotter stars is the photoionization of hydrogen atoms, both from ground level and from higher levels.\n\nSpectral analysis\n\nThe physical processes behind the formation of stellar spectra are well enough understood to permit determinations of temperatures, densities, and chemical compositions of stellar atmospheres. The star studied most extensively is, of course, the Sun, but many others also have been investigated in detail.\n\nThe general characteristics of the spectra of stars depend more on temperature variations among the stars than on their chemical differences. Spectral features also depend on the density of the absorbing atmospheric matter, and density in turn is related to a star's surface gravity. Dwarf stars, with great surface gravities, tend to have high atmospheric densities; giants and supergiants, with low surface gravities, have relatively low densities. Hydrogen absorption lines provide a case in point. Normally, an undisturbed atom radiates a very narrow line. If its energy levels are perturbed by charged particles passing nearby, it radiates at a wavelength near its characteristic wavelength. In a hot gas, the range of disturbance of the hydrogen lines is very high, so that the spectral line radiated by the whole mass of gas is spread out considerably; the amount of blurring depends on the density of the gas in a known fashion. Dwarf stars such as Sirius show broad hydrogen features with extensive \"wings\" where the line fades slowly out into the background, while supergiant stars, with less-dense atmospheres, display relatively narrow hydrogen"}
{"text":"Scientists measure the universe's first starlight\n\nBy: CNN\n\nUpdated: November 2, 2012\n\nThe universe was just a kid at 4 billion years old. Thursday,\nscientists said that they have a measurement for all of the light that\nwas around at that time that's still traveling to us.\n\nIt's called the extragalactic background light. This includes light\nfrom stars that existed when the universe was even younger than 4\nbillion years old. Researchers report in the journal Science that this\ncan help with understanding how stars formed and how galaxies evolved.\n\n\"I think it's amazing to be able to probe our universe when it was so\nyoung, when the very first stars formed,\" said Marco Ajello, researcher\nat Stanford University and study co-author.\n\nResearchers write in the study that there have been several attempts\nin the past to detect this phenomenon, but none were successful.\n\nThe finding is important for estimating the number of smaller,\nfainter galaxies that current telescopes cannot detect, said\nClaude-Andre Faucher-Giguere, researcher in the Department of Astronomy\nat the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the\nstudy.\n\nHere's why: Every telescope has limitations, especially its size. So\nastronomers can use them to detect the big, luminous galaxies, but there\nare more galaxies that the tools will miss.\n\n\"Studying the extragalactic background light allows us to overcome\nthis limitation, because the background light is the sum of the light\nproduced by all galaxies, including the ones that are too faint to be\ndetected individually by traditional methods,\" he said.\n\nWhen this extragalactic background light absorbs gamma rays, the\nprocess produces electron-positron pairs. A positron is an anti-matter\nparticle.\n\nThis is the inverse reaction from what's described in Dan Brown's\nnovel \"Angels and Demons,\" explains Faucher-Giguere. In that book, the\nvillains' bomb would harness the extraordinary energy from matter and\nanti-matter annihilating each other.\n\nBased on how many gamma rays are expected to be present, compared to\nhow many were observed, scientists calculated the number of gamma rays\nthat appeared to be absorbed by the starlight from the early universe.\n\nIn that sense, these gamma-ray sources are like \"lighthouses\" and the\nstarlight is like the fog, Ajello said. Scientists know that starlight\nis absorbing the gamma rays when the \"lighthouse\" is dimmer.\n\nScientists can therefore add up the light from the galaxies they can\ndetect, and compare that to the extragalactic background light. This\nsubtraction is a clue to how many galaxies we haven't yet directly\ndetected with our telescopes, and how luminous they are, Faucher-Giguere\nsaid.\n\nAccording to this study, the galaxies observed directly via telescope\naccounts for most of the extragalactic background light measured. That\nmeans there cannot be much more light coming from fainter galaxies,\nFaucher-Giguere explains. This also puts limits on how many black holes\nand massive stars were in the early universe.\n\n\"This is a new and unique constraint that all future models of galaxy\nand black hole evolution will have to satisfy,\" Faucher-Giguere said.\n\nAn extremely powerful telescope is required to support and complement these findings by directly observing the first galaxies. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, whose launch is scheduled for 2018, may do the trick.\n\n\"The Webb telescope will open a completely new era,\" Ajello said at a NASA press briefing Thursday."}

Credit: Edo Berger (Harvard\/CfA\n\nRed shift is a phenomenon that is the shift in the wavelength of light in the electromagnetic spectrum towards the \"red\" or infrared section. This is the result of wave mechanics, particularly the Doppler Effect. If you don't know what the Doppler Effect is, it's a theory describing the behavior of waves as their source moves away or toward an observer. The theory states that the closer the source of the waves to the observer the shorter the wavelength and frequency of the waves. The opposite also occurs as the source of the waves move away from the observer causing the wavelength of the waves to increase. This theory was first physically explained by Charles Andreas Doppler in 1842 concerning sound waves. It later tested and proven in 1845 by the Dutch scientist Christoph Ballot\n\nThe common example used in describing it is the fire engine siren. Most people have heard a siren on a fire truck and noticed that the pitch of the siren changes as the vehicle come towards them and as it leaves. Sound waves with shorter wavelengths sound higher in pitch while sound waves with longer wave lengths have a lower pitch. This is how we are able to know the Doppler Effect is occurring.\n\nThe theory also stated from the beginning that this phenomenon occurred for all types of waves. In astronomy it took the research of a man named Armand-Hippolyte-Louis Fizeau to prove that this phenomenon occurred in light as well. Light is also a kind a wave but the wavelengths are visible which gives us the visible spectrum. Fizeau proved it by separating the light from stars into their individual spectrum lines proving that red shift occurs.\n\nThis discovery allowed for other advances such as the calculations of stars' velocities. The theory also helped scientist compile evidence proving the expansion of the universe. The light of galaxies as well could be observed and analyzed to see if the light they emit in general produces the red shift effect. In the present time we use this also in spectroscopy the science of using light to determine the characteristics of a substance such as it elemental composition. Thanks to the Doppler Effect and light waves we now can not only determine, the distance and speed of celestial objects, we can also learn what they are made of even without the aid of probe. This theory has helped to advance astronomy and physics to our current understanding also helping to pave the way for other important theories like the Theory of Relativity."}

However, our universe appears to be made of matter - though astronomers have never been able to rule out the possibility that there are antimatter galaxies out there.\n\nIn 2006, astronomers discovered the Bullet cluster - two clusters of galaxies that had collided, leaving a giant cloud of hot gas. If any fraction of this gas is a mixture of matter and antimatter, then collisions between these particles should result in mutual annihilation, producing gamma rays instead of the X-rays expected from collisions between matter particles.\n\nGary Steigman of Ohio State University in Columbus now says that the amounts of X-rays and gamma rays emitted from the Bullet cluster prove"}

Cassiopeia A, she said, \"would appear as a single dot to those previous telescopes.\"\n\nHigh-energy X-rays can punch through dust and gas blocking our view into the distant universe, giving us a picture of what is otherwise concealed in the visible and infrared wavelengths.

{"text":"Astronomers Find Most Stable Optical Clock In Heavens\n\nDec 05, 2005\n\nAfter 31 years of tracking the light- output of a burnt-out star from telescopes at McDonald Observatory, astronomer S.O. Kepler of Brazil's Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, and a slew of University of Texas colleagues have found the most stable optical clock in the heavens.\n\nThe finding has implications for theories of how stars live and die, and places limits on where planets can exist around this white dwarf.\n\nTheir results are being published in today's edition of The Astrophysical Journal in what is being called a \"landmark paper\" by one of that journal's editors.\n\nThe star in question is a 400 million-year-old white dwarf called G117-B15A, located in Leo Minor. Its pulses of light are so regular that it loses one second in 8.9 million years. This makes the pulses of G117 more accurate and much more stable than the ticks of an atomic clock, Kepler said.\n\nSome may suggest that the so-called \"millisecond Pulsars\" are better timekeepers than G117. Kepler Doesn't think so. Millisecond pulsars are the spinning remnant cores of massive stars that have exploded as supernovae. Their lighthouse-like beacon of radio waves and X-rays sweep by Earth regularly, acting as extremely accurate clocks. While it is true that a few pulsars are somewhat more accurate than G117, their clocks are not as stable -- that is, their accuracy breaks down sooner, Kepler said.\n\nAs a white dwarf, G117 is the corpse of a Sun-like star that has exhausted its supply of nuclear fuel, and shed its outer layers of gas so that only the core remains. This dead core slowly cools over billions of years.\n\nIf astronomers could measure the rate of cooling, it would be a boon to understanding how stars evolve and die. In fact, this can now be done. \"The use of white dwarfs as chronometers is a sport we invented here at McDonald Observatory in 1987,\" said white dwarf expert Don Winget of The University of Texas at Austin, one of the co- authors on the paper. \"White dwarfs are now a standard chronometer for stellar evolution.\"\n\nThe key is that some white dwarfs pulsate -- that is, give off bursts of light in a regular rhythm. As the white dwarf cools over time, the pulse arrival time slows down. By measuring how the pulses slow over time, astronomers can measure how fast the white dwarf is cooling.\n\n\"What we\u00b9re measuring is the pulse arrival time of the main pulsation of the star, which is a 215-second pulsation,\" Winget said. \"We've exploited the fact that time is the most accurate physical quantity that human beings can measure. So over the years we've accumulated timings of the pulsations of this star, which have turned out to be remarkably stable. And in fact we\u00b9ve finally measured a change in the pulsation period.\n\n\"This is a direct measure of the evolution of a star,\" he said. That feat has only been reached once before. In 1987, Winget and a team of Texas astronomers measured the cooling rate of a pre-white dwarf star called PG1159-035. \"Its evolutionary timescale was four orders of magnitude shorter\n\n- - faster than G117,\" Winget said. \"So this new result is an extension by a factor of 10,000 over the only previous measure of stellar evolution.\"\n\nAnd because white dwarfs are some of the oldest stars in the galaxy, measuring how long they've been cooling is one way to measure the age of the Milky Way itself.\n\n\"The other thing that this does is set limits on extrasolar planets that might be present around this star,\" Winget said. Kepler explained that both the star and any planets orbiting it would orbit around the entire system's center of mass. \"This will affect the pulse arrival time,\" he said, allowing detection of the planet(s).\n\nThe decades of data on G117 show no Jupiter-mass planet at Jupiter's distance or any closer, Kepler said. The orbital distance from the parent star is an important factor, Winget said. \"This whole area has never been probed by any other method ever before ... we\u00b9re sort of plowing a new field here.\"\n\nTexas astronomer Rob Robinson and his graduate student John McGraw began timing the pulses from G117 in 1974, using the\n\n2. 1-meter and 0.9-meter telescopes at McDonald Observatory. Kepler joined the work as a graduate student at Texas in 1979. Kepler continued the project after he completed his PhD at Texas and returned home to Brazil.\n\n\"No one thought the project could be done,\" Winget said. \"You'd never get the telescope time. Even 20 years ago, we knew it was going to take another 20 years. This result is a testimony to perseverance,\" Winget said. \"Kepler has seen this through.\"\n\nThe reconnaissance of G117 continues. \"My students will be observing G117,\" Kepler said. He traces the \"family tree\" from Rob Robinson, to John McGraw, to himself, to his Brazilian graduate student Barbara Castanheira, who is spending a year visiting The University of Texas at Austin.\n\nRelevant PhysicsForums posts\n\nRelated StoriesIn 1604, a new star appeared in the night sky that was much brighter than Jupiter and dimmed over several weeks.

{"text":"[show abstract][hide abstract] ABSTRACT: We have used the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) detector on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) to measure bright sub-mm emission associated with a recently discovered extensive (>100\/h kpc) and highly luminous, `blob' of Ly-alpha emission at z=3.09. The blob lies within a known large overdensity of optical sources in the z=3.07-3.11 range, and is centered on a locally overdense peak within this region. The best explanation for the copious sub-mm emission is a dust obscured continuum source, which may produce the ionizing flux for the Ly-alpha cloud. Cooling gas explanations are plausible but excessively complicated, and the 450\/850 micron ratio rules out a significant fraction of the signal arising from the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich increment. At least two additional ~10 mJy sub-mm detections in the SCUBA map, with a surface density significantly higher than in blank field surveys, suggests that they may be associated with the z=3.09 structure. A SCUBA `photometry' observation of a second nearby Ly-alpha blob tentatively detects a weaker sub-mm counterpart. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures, accepted in ApJ letters"}
{"text":"Hypervelocity stars\n\nHypervelocity star\n\nHypervelocity stars (HVSs) are stars with a velocity so great, that they are able to escape the gravitational pull of the galaxy. Hence also the name Exiled Stars. Ordinary stars in the galaxy have velocities on the order of 100 km\/s, while hypervelocity stars (especially near the center of the galaxy, which is where most are \"produced\"), have velocities on the order of 1000 km\/s.\n\nObservational evidence\n\nHVSs were first theorized by J. Hills in 1988. Currently, ten HVSs are known. One of them possibly originated from the Large Magellanic Cloud, and was discovered by H. Edelmann et al. Warren Brown et al. from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics discovered the first one in 2005. In 2006 and 2007 seven more were discovered by Warren Brown et al. All of the stars are over 50,000 parsecs away and unbound to the galaxy.\n\nNumber of hypervelocity stars in the Milky Way\n\nIt is believed that about 1000 HVSs exist in our Galaxy. Considering that there are around 100 billion stars in the Milky Way, this a minuscule fraction.\n\nProduction method\n\nHVS ejection mechanism\n\nThe main production method for HVSs is summarized as thus: they are believed to originate by close encounters of binary stars with the supermassive black hole in the centre of the Milky Way. One of the two partners is captured by the black hole, while the other escapes with high velocity. Also, it is worth noting that \"captured\" does not necessarily mean \"swallowed,\" for in all likelihood the companion to the HVS will never fall into the black hole.\n\nKnown HVSs are main sequence stars with masses a few times that of the Sun.\n\nAsymmetric supernova\n\nSome neutron stars are inferred to be traveling with similar speeds, however they are unrelated to both HVSs and the HVS ejection mechanism. Neutron stars are the remnants of supernova explosions, and their extreme speeds are very likely the result of an asymmetric supernova explosion. The neutron star RX J0822-4300 , which was measured to move at a record speed of over 3 million miles per hour in 2007 by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, is thought to have been produced this way."}

{"text":"Colliding galaxy cluster unravelled\n\nMay 24, 2012\n\nAn international team of astronomers has used the International LOFAR Telescope from ASTRON, the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy, to study the formation of the galaxy cluster Abell 2256.\n\nAbell 2256 is a cluster containing hundreds of galaxies at a distance of 800 million lightyears. 'The structure we see in the radio images made with LOFAR provides us with information about the origin of this cluster, explains lead author dr. Reinout van Weeren (Leiden University and ASTRON). The study will be published in the scientific journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. The research involved a large team of scientists from 26 different universities and research institutes.\n\nLOFAR has made the first images of Abell 2256 in the frequency range of 20 to 60 MHz. What came as a surprise to scientists was that the cluster of galaxies was brighter and more complex than expected. Dr. van Weeren: 'We think that galaxy clusters form by mergers and collisions of smaller clusters'. Abell 2256 is a prime example of a cluster that is currently undergoing a collision. The radio emission is produced by tiny elementary particles that move nearly at the speed of light. With LOFAR it is possible to study how these particles get accelerated to such speeds. 'In particular, we will learn how this acceleration takes place in regions measuring more than 10 million light years across', says Dr. Gianfranco Brunetti from IRA-INAF in Bologna, Italy, who together with Prof. Marcus Br\u00fcggen from the Jacobs University in Bremen, coordinates the LOFAR work on galaxy clusters.\n\nLOFAR was built by a large international consortium led by the Netherlands and which includes Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Sweden. One of the main goals of LOFAR is to survey the entire northern sky at low radio frequencies, with a sensitivity and resolution about 100 times better than what has been previously done. Scientists believe that this survey will discover more than 100 million objects in the distant Universe. \"Soon we will start our systematic surveys of the sky that will lead to great discoveries,\" says Prof. Huub R\u00f6ttgering from Leiden University and Principal Investigator of the \"LOFAR Survey Key Project\".\n\nRelated Stories\n\nIn the quest to discover more about our Universe and the birth of stars and galaxies, a new UK telescope connected for the first time to others across Europe has delivered its first 'radio pictures'.

With LOFAR it is possible to study how these particles get accelerated to such speeds.\"\n\nRadio emissions are more properly defined as resulting from a change in electron velocity, right? If these emissions are spiky synchrotron, then that generally indicates electrons spiraling around a magnetic field. And if the morphologies being observed indicate long filaments, then you are looking at a very large Birkeland Current conducting an electrical current.\n\nFrom \"The Curious Case of Abell 2256\" ...\n\n\"These observations have revealed a previously unknown population of ~ 100 - 200 kpc long steep spectrum synchrotron filaments surrounding the cluster center ... The very steep spectral indices of the new synchrotron filaments ... suggest that they are all likely due to merger shock induced adiabatic compression of fossil radio plasma.\"\n\nWhat's happening here is that you have a scientific framework which is standing in the way of the simplest inference. The simplest inference is that this is exactly what it looks like: a Birkeland Current. But, the framework is a gravitationally-dominant framework which becomes complicated by the very existence of such things.\n\nTo be clear - for those who have not permitted themselves to fall in love with the textbook theories - Birkeland Currents extend the electric force to infinity. Far from any physical bodies in space, long after the pull of gravity has essentially gone to zero, a pair of conducting plasma filaments will attract one another with the strength of the electric force. Yet, a counter-balancing short-range force precludes them from combining.\n\nAnd that force is 10^36 times more powerful than gravity.\n\nWhen this twisting becomes sufficiently powerful, it can scavenge the ions within the immediate vicinity like a transmission line (Marklund convection)."}

{"text":"A leading candidate for the most mysterious star found in recent times is variable star V838 Monocerotis. At a distance of about 8,000 light-years, V. Seen above in two separate images from the South African Astronomical Observatory's 1 meter telescope, the nebula is probably a light echo from shells of formerly unseen material lost by the star during its previous evolution. Light-years in diameter, the shells progressively reflect the light from V838 Mon's outbursts, providing an opportunity to look back at the history of this remarkable star's behaviour. Credit: Lisa Crause (Univ. Cape Town), Warrick Lawson (Australian Defence Force Academy)\n\nCape Town - Dec 06, 2002 A highly unusual new variable star has attracted a great deal of attention amongst the astronomical community in recent months: the star has significantly changed its appearance during this time.\n\nVariable stars, as their name suggests, are stars that vary in brightness. With some stars, this dimming and brightening can occur periodically on timescales from a few seconds to many years; others vary in brightness on an irregular or once-off basis.\n\nThis eccentric new star, however, has changed completely in appearance over the last few months. \"Normally, similar astronomical events happen on an enormously long timescale so one does not often get to witness significant changes in individual objects during the course of a human lifetime; that is what makes this so exciting\", says University of Cape Town PhD student Lisa Crause, working at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO).\n\nThe highly unusual star, now known as V838 Mon -- one of the several hundred variables in the constellation Monocerotis (the mythological unicorn) -- has attracted enormous attention since its appearance earlier this year.\n\nThe object was first noticed by an amateur astronomer in Australia. Professional astronomers cannot spend valuable telescope-time scanning the sky for such objects. But once alerted, astronomers working at large observatories around the world can carefully monitor and study these newly identified objects.\n\nV838 Mon has evolved dramatically since its discovery nine months ago. First, it brightened about a hundredfold, then it faded slowly before erupting to around ten thousand times its original brightness. As V838 Mon started fading after this last outburst, a light-echo appeared and continues to expand around the star.\n\nThis echo is due to light from the eruption bouncing off dust surrounding the star and getting scattered towards us. If we assume that these are dust shells centred on the star, we can estimate V838 Mon's distance from the rate at which the echo has grown. In this way, we calculate that the star is about 7500 light years away, which means that the outbursts that we have been following, actually took place 7 500 years ago and the news has only just reached us! The light-echo provides more clues about the nature of this unusual star. Images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope in April show several rings and arcs of material surrounding the star, maybe indicating that these sorts of outbursts have been happening roughly every century for the past thousand years.\n\nUnlike most other sciences, astronomy can only gather data by analysing collected light: one cannot get a spoonful of star! \"We have to make the most of the information that the light of different energies provides,\" says Crause. \"Everything we know about the Universe comes from analysing these light signals\".\n\nWhen the star experienced a less violent eruption in March this year, data obtained with the SAAO's 1.9-m telescope in Sutherland showed that another shell of material was ejected during this time. Lower energy light gathered with another SAAO telescope indicates that a new dust cocoon condensed around V838 Mon in April and this caused the star to suddenly fade from view. Another consequence of this dust obscuration is that the star now looks much redder than it used to, in the same way that sunsets are redder when the air is polluted.\n\nAs the star remains faint, it is quite difficult to observe with the telescopes currently available.\n\nFortunately, we have the services of the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) to look forward to in years to come. This giant 11-m light bucket will give astronomers the advantage of more than thirty times the light gathering area of the 1.9-m, the largest telescope in Sutherland at this stage.\n\n\"While we do not yet understand all the mechanisms responsible for V838 Mon's complex behaviour, nor can we predict what it may do in the future, we can be sure that it will continue to challenge and entertain us!\" says Crause.\n\nGravity-Wave Search Produces Initial Data Boston - Nov 06, 2002 The MIT team heading the search for gravitational waves reaching Earth from space expects to have some numbers early next month from its analysis of its observatory's first scientific run"}

Image: NASA\/ESA\/JPL\u2013Caltech\/STScI\/UCLA.\n\nWhen galaxies evolve, they lose the cool gas they use for forming new stars, and become dusty and red with the light of older, long-lived stars. This often happens when galaxies merge and form a giant elliptical galaxy, or when a spiral galaxy enters a dense galaxy cluster and is stripped of its star-forming gas to form a disc-shaped galaxy, lacking spiral arms, called a lenticular galaxy (see our related news story here). Blue and ultraviolet light is more typically associated with star-formation in less evolved spiral galaxies like the Milky Way, and the GALEX satellite has ultraviolet cameras to detect such activity in distant galaxies. However, Dr Samir Salim of Indiana University and Michael Rich of the University of California, Los Angeles, were surprised when they used GALEX to discover 29 of these 'dead' galaxies with an excess of ultraviolet light.\n\nFurthermore, when they used the Hubble Space Telescope to take a closer look, they saw that in 22 of the 29 the ultraviolet light was being emitted by structures around the galaxies, including 15 galaxies that had rings of ultraviolet light. The inference is that somehow these dead galaxies, which are on average 1.5 billion light years away, are forming new stars. How can that be the case, and why in the shape of rings? Salim and Rich set out to discover why.\n\nRinged galaxies are not unheard of; the Hubble Space Telescope in particular has photographed galaxies with rings caused by a smaller galaxy plunging head first into the centre of a larger galaxy, causing ripples to expand outwards as though a stone had been dropped into a pond. But such head-on collisions are relatively rare, so Salim and Rich had to search for another explanation.\n\nThe Cartwheel Galaxy is a ring galaxy that formed when a smaller galaxy collided head-on with a spiral galaxy, but an alternative explanation had to be found for the rings found around old galaxies. Image: C Struck and P Appleton (Iowa State University)\/K Borne (Hughes STX Corporation)\/R Lucas (STScI)\/NASA\/ESA.\n\nThe space between galaxies isn't empty. It's filled with gas, mostly hydrogen \u2013 the stuff from which stars are made. Salim and Rich suspect that these galaxies are gathering up large quantities of this gas. That explains where the gas to form the stars comes from, but why in rings? Many typical spiral galaxies have central bars that run through their centres, and these are often linked to ring-like structures encircling the galaxy. Despite having lost their spiral structure, lenticular galaxies can still have bars, which could explain the rings. Salim and Rich are planning on searching for more evidence for bars.\n\nInterestingly, while the ultraviolet excess is seen in galaxies with several times the mass of our Milky Way, even bigger galaxies do not seem to have these features. \"Those may have a way of preventing new star formation from happening,\" Salim told Astronomy Now. \"Most massive galaxies are primarily ellipticals, so the ultraviolet excess that we see may be primarily a lenticular galaxy phenomenon, but we are still working on proving this.\"\n\nTheir work was published in the 21 April issue of"}

It's high in the northwest at nightfall, and wheels low across the north later on.\n\nAbout three centuries ago as seen from Earth, one of Cassiopeia's stars exploded as a supernova. It blasted its outer layers into space at a few percent of the speed of light. This material continues to expand into space as a giant shell. It contains lots of oxygen and other elements that will disperse into the galaxy.

The central cluster of stars inside NGC 3603 harbours thousands of stars of all sorts (eso9946): the majority have masses similar to or less than that of our Sun, but most spectacular are several of the very massive stars that are close to the end of their lives.\n\nThis video is not supported by your browser at this time.\n\nZooming in on NGC 3603, the large distance.

Using another recent set of observations performed with the SINFONI instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT), astronomers have confirmed that one of these stars is about 120 times more massive than our Sun, standing out as the most massive star known so far in the Milky Way.\n\nThe star, NGC 3603-A1, is an eclipsing system of two stars orbiting around each other in 3.77 days. The most massive star has an estimated mass of 116 solar masses, while its companion has a mass of 89 solar masses.\n\nThe clouds of NGC 3603 provide us with a family picture of stars in different stages of their life, with gaseous structures that are still growing into stars, newborn stars, adult stars and stars nearing the end of their life. All these stars have roughly the same age, a million years, a blink of an eye compared to our five billion year-old Sun and Solar System. The fact that some of the stars have just started their lives while others are already dying is due to their extraordinary range of masses: high-mass stars, being very bright and hot, burn through their existence much faster than their less massive, fainter and cooler counterparts.\n\nThe newly released image, obtained with the FORS instrument attached to the VLT at Cerro Paranal, Chile, portrays a wide field around the stellar cluster and reveals the rich texture of the surrounding clouds of gas and dust.\n\nRelated StoriesThe massive Arches Cluster is a rather peculiar star cluster.

{"text":"Acidification Stops Star Formation\n\nBy observing nearby galaxies, using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope situated in Hawaii, astronomer Floris van der Tak observed in the dust clouds outside our galaxy, the first acidic cloud. The stellar and planetary formation might be explained through acidification inhibition, but astronomers cannot know for certain until the completion of the SRON Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared space telescope, which is scheduled to launch next year, designed to map the chemical composition of nearby galaxies and stars, by identifying the atomic and molecular spectral lines in submillimeter regions.\n\nStars and planets form through a process which involves rotating masses of gas which are drawn together and eventually collapse under the influence of gravitational fields. As pressure grows in the center of the newly created body, it compresses ever more the matter which will eventually heat up and light the whole gas mass to create a star that could potentially be orbited by one or more planets. However, solar systems are not as widespread as you might think, so scientists tried to find what the conditions for solar systems formation are, what triggers this process and what stops it.\n\nFloris van der Tak thinks that a star and planet formation is greatly influenced by the amount of charged molecules inside the dust clouds, which are then manipulated by the exerted surrounding magnetic fields that agitate the cloud and prevent the star-forming process. To determine the ratio of acidic molecules inside a dust cloud, it is necessary to measure the quantity of charge molecules. However these ratios can be determined on Earth, since our atmosphere is rich in water content.\n\nOne of the solutions to this problem was to observe light coming from the galaxies, in high altitude regions where the air is more rarefied, thus the water content in the atmosphere is lower than average. The top of the Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii is situated at an altitude of 4092 meters, where the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope is situated, providing a perfect spot to observe the rich acidic water dust clouds, situated in the galaxies M82 and Arp 220.\n\nEven though both of the galaxies present high quantities of acidic water molecules, it seems that the causes that created them are completely different. In Arp 220 they are created under the influence of X-rays emitted by the central ultra massive black hole, whereas in M82, the high acidic content is triggered by ultraviolet radiation emitted by hot forming young stars, thus stopping the star forming process in the respective galaxies.\n\nThe launch of the SRON HIFI next year will present the possibility of better observing the dust of cloud from out of space."}
{"text":"All posts tagged 'chandra'\n\nA supermassive black hole pulls in hot gas, offering astronomers clues about the growth of black holes and the behavior of matter under their gravitational clutches.\n\nPrevious findings have shown black holes pulling material toward them, but this black hole, at the center of large, lens-shaped galaxy known as NGC 3115, reveals the first clear signals of hot gas in this new image from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory.\n\n\"It's exciting to find such clear evidence for gas in the grip of a massive black hole,\" said Ka-Wah Wong of the University of Alabama, in a release. \"Chandra's resolving power provides a unique opportunity to understand more about how black holes capture material by studying this nearby object.\"\n\nAs the gas approaches the black hole, the compression makes it glow hotter and brighter. This temperature rise begins about 700 light-years away from the black hole, allowing astronomers to estimate the black hole's mass. The supermassive black hole at the center of NGC 3115, they calculate, has a mass of about 2 billion Suns, making it the nearest billion-solar-mass black hole to Earth at 32 million light-years away.\n\nAn ordinary star may have lived through a catastrophic explosion that created one of the most famous supernova remnants in astronomy. A new look at the cosmic debris cloud known as Tycho's supernova remnant shows an arc of material that could explain what creates a key type of supernova.\n\n\"It looks like this companion star was right next to an extremely powerful explosion and it survived relatively unscathed,\" said astronomer Q. Daniel Wang of the University of Massachusetts in Amherst in a press release. The study appears in the May 1 Astrophysical Journal.\n\nThe remnant is named for the great Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, infamously known for his metal nose and more respectably for describing in 1572 the stellar explosion that bears his name. It was formed by a Type 1a supernova, which are useful in measuring astronomical distances because of their reliable brightness. Type 1a supernovas have also been used to show that the universe's expansion is accelerating, and to probe the mysterious force called dark energy that's pushing the universe apart.\n\nThe ultra-dense remains of the galaxy's youngest supernova are full of bizarre quantum matter.\n\nTwo new studies show for the first time that the core of the neutron star Cassiopeia A, is a superfluid, a friction-free state of matter that normally only exists in ultra-cold laboratory settings.\n\n\"The interior of neutron stars is one of the best kept secrets of the universe,\" said astrophysicist Dany Page of the National Autonomous University in Mexico, lead author of a paper in the Feb. 25 Physical Review Letters describing the state of the star. \"It looks like we broke one of them.\"\n\nCassiopeia A (Cas A) was a massive star 11,000 light-years away whose explosion was observed from Earth about 330 years ago. The supernova left behind a tiny, compact body called a neutron star, in which matter is so densely packed that electrons and protons are forced to fuse into neutrons. Neutron star material is some of the most extreme matter in the universe. Just a teaspoonful of neutron star stuff weighs about 6 billion tons.\n\nThe neutron star in Cas A was first spotted in 1999, shortly after the Chandra X-Ray Observatory began scanning the sky for objects that emit X-rays.\n\nLast year, astronomers Craig Heinke of the University of Alberta and Wynn Ho of the University of Southampton noticed something odd: The neutron star was cooling down at an alarmingly fast rate. In just 10 years, the star had cooled from 2.12 million degrees to 2.04 million degrees, a drop of 4 percent.\n\nSEATTLE \u2014 This gorgeous new X-ray image of the nearby galaxy M82 shows a frantic burst of star formation that may have been triggered by a close encounter with a nearby galaxy.\n\nM82 is \"the prototypical starburst galaxy in the nearby universe,\" said astronomer Roy Kilgard of Wesleyan University, who presented the new image in a press conference Thursday at the meeting of the American Astronomical Society. The galaxy lies just 12 million light-years from the Milky Way, and is the brightest galaxy in the sky in infrared wavelengths.\n\nA sun-like star has kept up a youthful appearance by devouring its smaller neighbors. A new X-ray image of the star BP Piscium reveals the shredded corpse of a companion star or giant planet that the star recently consumed.\n\n\"It appears that BP Psc represents a star-eat-star universe, or maybe a star-eat-planet one,\" said astronomer Joel Kastner of the Rochester Institute of Technology in a press release.\n\nBP Psc has been an enigma since Kastner and astronomer Ben Zuckerman of the University of California, Los Angeles, first looked at it 15 years ago. Optical images from the Lick Observatory showed that the star, which lies about 1,000 light-years from Earth, has a pair of jets several light-years long shooting away from its poles. BP Psc is also surrounded by a dusty, gaseous disk. Both these features are characteristic of young stars.\n\nBut BP Psc is also a loner, while most young stars live in clusters. Other details \u2014 like the star's radius, surface gravity and composition \u2014 point to a much older star.\n\nNew observations from NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory clinch the debate. If BP Psc were as young as it seems, it would be spewing X-rays in the hundreds or thousands per day. Instead, the star emits a few X-rays at a time.\n\n\"We stared at BP Psc for one day with Chandra and only detected about 18 X-rays,\" Kastner said. \"We could almost name them.\""}
{"text":"wrong. You continue to ignore the simple fact that the intenstity varies as 1\/r^2. So the contamination from the dust in a normal galaxy will be lower than that of the Milky Way.\n\nIntensity in terms of the power received from a given source at distance r does decline as 1\/r^2. However, the surface brightness (the power you receive from a source per steradian occupied by the source) does not change. It stays constant with distance (excepting extinction and non-Euclidean\/expansion effects at high z such as redshift). The amount of radiant power you receive from the galaxies in some solid angle of the sky, depends only on the intrinsic surface brightness of the galaxies (which are independent of distance) and the fraction of that solid angle which is covered by the galaxies. In this case, I estimated 4% of the sky is covered with galaxies. Does that make sense to you now?\n\nThe paper is about improving the removal of all sources of foreground contamination including extragalactic point sources.If there's an average of 250,000 galaxies per pixel, assuming a Poisson distribution and that all galaxies are randomly distributed across the sky, the standard deviation (pixel to pixel) is 0.2%.\n\nThis is orders of magnitude bigger than the signal variation that is being measured (approx. 0.005%). What's more, it's probably an underestimate, because galaxy size is not evenly distributed: the large galaxies will have the biggest effect, but they are far rarer than small galaxies. So their Poisson uncertainty is higher.\n\nThen you have to consider if the distribution of galaxies is truly isotropic and randomly distributed. Do we have a systematically higher density of galaxies along some sightlines relative to others.\n\nBut the next stage is to evaluate the dependence of the overall uncertainty on this Poisson variation, and to do that is what the whole discussion on this thread is about ! If galaxies are completely transparent to the CMB, and also contribute almost zero to it at the the wavelengths under consideration, then it's a negligible source of error.\n\nThe amount of radiant power you receive from the galaxies in some solid angle of the sky, depends only on the intrinsic surface brightness of the galaxies (which are independent of distance) and the fraction of that solid angle which is covered by the galaxies(bold added)If galaxies are completely transparent to the CMB, and also contribute almost zero to it at the the wavelengths under consideration, then it's a negligible source of error.\n\nJust thinking out loud.\n\nNereid and ngc3314 did some estimates of surface brightness of galaxies (like ours) due directly to starlight:\n\nTo take Nereid's example in an earlier post, if we approximate the Milky Way as 100 billion sunlike stars, their collective cross-section is about 10^11 x (106 km)^2 = 1023 km^2 spread over (100,000 light-years)2 = 10^36 km2, so the collective spectrum would be an approximate 5500 K blackbody distribution, but with surface brightness lower by a factor 10^13 than predicted by the Planck blackbody function.\n\nSo, let's see how that works out for the CMB spectrum using the equation for intensity ratio of two emitters at 200 GHz with temperatures T1 and T2 which I approximated from Planck's law as:\n\nI2\/I1 = (e^(10\/T1) - 1)\/(e^(10\/T2) - 1)\n\nWhere T2 = 5500 K and T1 = 2.7 K\n\nI2(star)\/I1(CMB) = 40\/0.0018 = 2.2*10^5\n\nHowever, starlight intensity is diluted by a factor of 10^-13 due to their sparseness, so:\n\nI2(galaxy)\/I1(CMB) = 2.2*10^-8. Thus the direct contribution from starlight from a galaxy is indeed very small in comparison with the CMB. The Planck probe sensitivity to differences in CMB is at best about 1 part per million which is 50 times greater that the direct effect of galaxy starlight.\n\nSo yes, the direct affects of galactic starlight should be negligible!\n\nI'd still like to understand how exactly the same dilution arises for dust emissions, but so far no one has replied about that. It bothers me because dust appears opaque in the optical spectrum and so should act more like a black body.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nAnother possibility to consider:\n\nThe only way I can see that starlight from galaxies could seriously affect CMB measurements is if something happens to starlight on it's path to us over billions of light years that moves a very small part of the stellar energy into the CMB spectral range.\n\nThe ratio of total energy from a star in comparison to total energy from the CMB is about 2*10^13\n\nif a small fraction, say 10-5 (1 part in 100,000), of stellar energy is somehow moved into the CMB spectral range as it travels to us, it would very seriously contaminate the CMB spectrum (at the level of 40 micro Kelvin) wherever there is a galaxy on the sky. If there is some physical effect that moves such small amounts of stellar energy into the CMB spectrum without scattering it's possible that we could find it with the Planck data by looking for CMB variations where galaxies are denser than average. This is still somewhat difficult because the Planck resolution is only about 5'.And so on.\n\nI recently saw some paper that discussed transparency, but I think they concluded that the optical seeing through a galaxy wasn't all that useful. Of course the transparency really doesn't matter, only the surface brightness matters, including whatever radiation passes right through. If the radiation is adsorbed, then it has to be re-radiated (at lower T).\n\nIf a galaxy is tilted or on edge, then in the CMB spectrum its surface brightness may be proportionally higher per solid angle, if dust is more or less transparent at CMB frequencies.\n\nSo let's say that galaxies have some average surface brightness which only extends slightly farther than the optical disk. What is you estimate of sky coverage?\n\nI made my guess just looking at the HUDF image (low resolution), I think it might be conservative, but one would need the actual data to either do a complete integration or a Monte Carlo analysis. I wonder if anyone has. Of course at high red shift we don't have a very good idea of surface brightness yet AFAIK, except for CIB measurements. Maybe when JWT is in place all estimates will get a lot better. I believe it will be sensitive much deeper into the infrared than HSTTo be more exact they remove about 500 detectable powerful point sources. If you cannot detect a point source then it is really hard to remove its contamination!\n\nN.B. These are the point sources that are detectable by WMAP. Future missions like PLANCK will have higher sensitivity and will detect more point sources that will have to be removedYou might want to check your calculations, and also take a hard look at a field imaged by the Hubble and extensively studied by other instruments (e.g. GOODS, COSMOS). You may find that, in terms of coverage of the sky's real estate, the higher redshift objects ('galaxies') may, collectively, dominate.\n\nThen you have to consider if the distribution of galaxies is truly isotropic and randomly distributed. Do we have a systematically higher density of galaxies along some sightlines relative to others.\n\nGalaxies are known to cluster; they form groups, and clusters of various 'sizes'. They also tend to be found near or on 'filaments'.\n\nThose in rich clusters are also found, generally, to be in approximately spherical clouds of hot plasma; the estimated baryonic mass of these clouds exceeds the estimated total mass of the constituent galaxies by a factor of several. Per textbook physics, if the CMB is 'behind' such a cluster, the plasma will leave an imprint on the CMB; this is called the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effectWP* (the SZE). An important test of our understanding of the CMB is whether a) the SZE can be detected in WMAP (and similar) data, from known rich clusters; and b) whether Planck can, blindly, find previously unknown rich clusters (via the SZE footprint).\n\nInterestingly, both tests have been done, and the results are ... interesting. For WMAP, the observed SZE is not quite what was expected, from theoretical models, thus pointing to something new we learned about rich clusters of galaxies. For Planck, the blind search indeed turned up several previously unknown rich clusters; it also found some, um, unusual structures.\n\nOf course, there are independent facilities studying the region of the spectrum where the CMB signal is strongest, and searches by these should also find, independently, both known and previously unknown rich clusters (via the SZE). At least one has (the South Pole Telescope).\n\nSo let's say that galaxies have some average surface brightness which only extends slightly farther than the optical disk. What is you estimate of sky coverage?\n\nLet's not.\n\nThis paper, by Tal and van Dokkum, shows that the LRGs in SDSS, collectively, extend far beyond \"the optical disk\" (ignoring, for a moment, that ellipticals don't have disks).\n\nAnd this one, by Bakos and Trujillo (which I posted earlier in this thread), shows that spirals (or the stars in them) emit detectable light well beyond \"the optical disk\".\n\nUsing the distribution of stellar light as a proxy for dust is not a good ideaI'm not sure I understand what you're asking; could you explain a bit more please? issuesIf you make this assumption (7 times as much gas), a lot of problems disappear.\n\nWell, of course they do, with such an assumption. This is essentially why dark matter is hypothesized - the observed rotation implies there must be a lot more unseen mass in the galaxy. The reason why the \"gas\" or baryon hypothesis is not favored is because baryons are generally detectable, yet we're not detecting them. So, the thinking goes, it must be something not directly detectable -- dark matter. If someone can explain why we are not detecting 7 times the amount of baryons that we currently detect, then they may be on to something. But again, there are numerous ways to detect baryons. Add them all together, and we fall woefully short. That's a lot of baryons to hide.\n\nCougar wrote: If someone can explain why we are not detecting 7 times the amount of baryons that we currently detect, then they may be on to something.\n\nThat's what he's trying to do -saying why we are not detecting the bulk of the gas.\n\nHowever the question in this thread was, imagine IF the hypothesis is correct, that is, there is a lot of \"self-opaque\" gas in galaxies, what would that do to the CMB observations ? The author does not address these extra-galactic questions and I am wondering about it. Bruce Draine and his collaborators have written a number of high quality, in-depth papers on the subject, but they're extremely dense and technical.\n\nThey are; even in the far-IR, where cold dust emits most of its light, the absorption efficiency is down around 1E-6 or 1E-5, and it gets still lower as the wavelengths get longer. Since the wavelengths involved are much, much longer than the grains are wide (their radii are in the sub-micron range and smaller for the most part), far-IR, microwaves, and radio tend to either diffract around dielectric grains or pass right on by.\n\nThe optical depth through a column of dust can be written as n*pi*a^2*Q*s, where n is the number density of dust particles, a is the radius of a dust grain, Q is the absorption\/scattering efficiency, and s is the path length through the cloud (this of course assumes a uniform dust density, composition, and grain size, but this gets us within an order of magnitude of the answer or two). An optical depth of 1 means that, on average, a photon has interacted with at least one particle; higher optical depths imply more interactions per photon. For typical values of the Milky Way ISM, the path length needed to get an optical depth of 1 is on the order of gigaparsecs, but the dust is not nearly so concentrated as the MW ISM on those scales. Given this, it seems to me that dust opacity to microwaves is totally insignificant when measuring the CMB, though I've not read the WMAP papers to see what the science team thinksOriginally Posted by ctcoker\n\nOriginally Posted by Nereid\n\nThanks.Bruce Draine and his collaborators have written a number of high quality, in-depth papers on the subject, but they're extremely dense and technical.\n\nI have read quite a few of those, and yes, they do seem in-depth and very high quality but also extremely dense and technical\n\nOf possible pertinence to some of TooMany's questions may be one (I forget exactly which one) which shows that the estimated energy absorbed, in a spiral galaxy (the MW?) in the UV-optical-NIR part of the spectrum (and emitted by stars, mostly) is the same (to within the estimated errors) as that emitted (re-radiated) in the rest of the IR (and sub-mm) range (by dust). And why is this - possibly - directly relevant? I'd like to wait until TooMany returns, to see if he can work it out for himself (I'm a great believer in discovery learning). Of course, if anyone else would like to post an explanation ... issuesThe author tackles a quite large number of questions\/problems\/sets of observations ('issues'); not surprisingly, as this is just a single paper (albeit one > 30 pages long), not many of the issues are covered in depth. That - necessarily - means that a reader with a critical-thinking hat on would have many questions about many of the issues that cannot be answered (because of the lack of depth). A general one might be this: Davies takes a close look at several areas, and examines\/questions\/challenges the consistency generally accepted in the literature; however, in doing so, he accepts other areas of consistency. There's nothing wrong with that (of course! ), but a closer analysis of some of these may show 'consistency links' that give rise to various problems of their own (this is a muddled way of saying that if you pull on a thread in a densely woven fabric, you never know what you might end up unraveling). Both Cougar and Tensor (and maybe others) - both in this thread and the other where kzb introduced the paper - have made this point already (in one way or another).\n\nSome specifics, in no particular order, and by no means comprehensive (and not necessarily well-thought through either! ):\n\n* \"Galaxies were selected such that they have angular diameters (r25) greater than 1 arc min\", and \"The only remaining problem is how does the size given in LEDA (r25) equate to the size R0 used in our model (Note: R0 is the physical size of the disc), which we are assuming is the same as the cut-off observed at 21cm (see below).\" How does Davies deal with inclination?\n\n* a* \"Finally, by using t > 2 we hopefully restrict our analysis to galaxies dominated by their disc.\" One of the interesting results to come from Galaxy Zoo is that this is not a safe assumption, and that it is possible to reliably study variation due to bulge\/disk ratio (Davies probably didn't know about Lackner and Gunn (2012) when he was writing his paper, if he had, I'm sure he'd have at least referenced it)\n\n* \"This discrepancy between observed and predicted baryons is typically accounted for by invoking a huge reservoir of baryons in the warm inter-galactic medium (see the introduction of Takei et al. 2011 for a recent discussion of the issue). An alternative is that they actually reside in the disc of galaxies.\" Davies, in this paper, does not cover any significant aspect of \"the issue\", so we have no way to tell if putting all the 'cluster dark mass' into massive gas disks in the cluster galaxies has issues of its own! Most readers could likely come up with a pretty lengthy list of 'issue candidates' ...\n\n* Section 5.5 (\"Constraints imposed by quasar absorption lines\") is really short, and (for me) raises at least twice as many questions as those Davies seeks to address!\n\n* If Section 5.5 leaves you unsatisfied, Section 5.6 (\"Dwarf galaxies\") is even worse. One particular beef: the only three papers cited are dated 1997 and 1998; an awful lot of work has been done on dwarf galaxies since then, so why did Davies not cite any of it (Section 5.5 is even worse in this regard)?\n\n* are\"10^-6 as emitting as a blackbody\" immediately meant emissivity to me. I'm a grad student in astronomy, and the project I'm currently finishing up depends heavily on dust opacities and emissivities, so this was all fresh in my mind. And for a greybody, of course, emissivity and absorption efficiency are the same thing.For theory papers, yes, if there's been no significant development, old may be good.\n\nFor almost every aspect of observational astronomy, it's a bad thing, sometimes a really, really bad thing.\n\nDavies cites THINGS, a recent HI observational survey, but not SDSS (he uses LEDA to pick his galaxies, not one of the value-added SDSS catalogues, for example). One advantage of more recent observational results - especially surveys - is much greater attention to systematics. Papers based on analysis of recent observations are, IMHO, better than those based on older ones (generally; there are obvious exceptions). Did Davies simply not know of the more recent work (hard to believe)?Um, no.\n\nIf, per Davies, spiral galaxies have a massive gas disk that has a 'sharp' edge, then the observed rotation curve - beyond that edge - will reflect this; if there's a massive halo, extending far beyond R0, then then the observed rotation curve - beyond that edge - will reflect that. Either way, it (potentially) offers a good, quick way to test Davies' main hypothesis. Why he chose not to apply that test is ... odd.No, inclination data is available in LEDA (and HI data from THINGS, etc).\n\nAfter all, the astronomers (like Bill Keel\/NGC3314) researching dust in spirals, by studying extinction (etc) at various wavelengths as inclination varies, have been using that data for decades.\n\nOf course, it's entirely possible Davies 'corrected' for inclination (but simply didn't mention it); however, it's odd that he didn't, given its potential to test his main hypothesis.No, not really. some someShouldn't the collisionless nature of CDM together with virialization of CDM particles through gravitational interaction force a certain distribution?

With its magnitude of 6.6, it is one of the brightest clusters in Perseus, but don't let this number fool you.\n\nThis is actualy very poor cluster, dominated by 6.8-mag quadriple star STF 446 (mags: 6.86, 9.9, 10.3 and 12.0). Remaining stars are dimm, 12- to 14-mag, and are situated mainly NW from STF 446, less than 2' away.\n\nAlthough the cluster (i.e its brightest star) might be, under very dark skies, detected with the naked eye, you will need at least 120 mm telescope and power above 100x to even begin to detect remaining stars in the cluster. With good seing, 8\" telescope will show up to 20 stars.\n\nIt is a 5' diameter cluster with cca 30 stars, having magnitudes between 11 and 18. In very good conditions, cluster propably can be detected with 4\" telescope, and 8\" telescope will resolve about 15 stars. You will need a 12\" or 13\" telescope and averted vision to see all 30 stars in the cluster.\n\nThis is very rich area of Milky Way, so many other clusters are within 2\u00b0 range. Brightest of them is NGC 129.\n\nIt is a 8' diameter cluster with cca 30 stars, having magnitudes between 13 and 14. The cluster can be seen in 3\" refractor as a faint nebulous patch. You will need 8\" telescope and power above 80x to detect individual stars. In 14\" to 16\" telescopes, at 150x, Berk 58 is dense cluster of 20 mostly faint stars. Averted vision should help resolve many fainter stars....\n\nIt is a small cluster, with its brightest part having less then 5' in diameter. Four most brightest star shines at magnitudes between 9.2 and 11. Those 4 stars form the shape of kite. Total number of stars in the entire cluster (having 15' in diameter) is somewhere around 90. Except the 4 main stars, all other are dimmer than m=11.7. The cluster is unique for having a well-defined zone of low star density in a 3' diameter region, immediately surrounding the nucleus, inside the \"diamond\", propably due to dark interstellar matter obscuring this region.\n\nYou will need at least 4\" telescope and power of 25x to see some more stars."}
{"text":"And just like that, we've got a new candidate for the most distant object in the universe. It was only in January that Hubble data showed that the space telescope had glimpsed a galaxy so distant that it appeared as it did when the universe was only a few hundred million years old. Now a gamma-ray burst first spotted by NASA's Swift satellite in April of 2009 could potentially replace it as the most distant object ever seen"}
{"text":"The spiral galaxy Messier 83 is a delicate wisp in infrared wavelengths, as seen at left by the HAWK-I instrument on the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope. But it looks like a fiery pinwheel in the visible-light image at right, captured by the MPG\/ESO telescope. Click on the picture for a larger view.\n\nThe spiral galaxy Messier 83, also known as the Pinwheel Galaxy, is a spectacular fireworks show when it's seen through a big telescope in visible light. But when the European Southern Observatory looked at the pinwheel in infrared wavelengths, the result was a much more delicate, no less beautiful picture of the galaxy's hottest young stars with the surrounding gas stripped away.\n\nM83, which sits about 15 million light-years away from us in the constellation Hydra, isn't exactly an undiscovered treasure. It's one of the best-known galaxies, easily seen with binoculars or a small telescope. It's also one of the most photographed galaxies: Just last year, the Hubble Space Telescope's brand-new Wide Field Camera 3 gave it the full treatment, focusing in on bursts of starbirth within its big, bright spiral arms.\n\nBut just one telescope is never enough, even if it's Hubble. The latest view of M83, released today by the ESO, comes from the High-Acuity Wide-field K-band Imager (HAWK-I), a near-infrared camera on the Very Large Telescope in Chile. This telescopic hawkeye can cut right through the dust and gas that obscures the stars within the galaxy.\n\nThe image above demonstrates the difference: The picture at right shows M83 as seen in visible light by the MPG\/ESO telescope, while the picture at left was produced using HAWK-I. The infrared view isn't as flashy, but it does trace the underlying structure of the galaxy's spiral arms more clearly - and pinpoints individual stars.\n\n\"This clear view is important for astronomers looking for clusters of young stars, especially those hidden in dusty regions of the galaxy,\" the ESO says in today's image advisory. \"Studying such star clusters was one of the main scientific goals of these observations.\"\n\nThere are lots of other examples showing how different telescopes, operating in different wavelength, can show astronomers a \"fuller spectrum.\" Here's just a sampling:\n\nThe data for the HAWK-I image were acquired by a team led by Mark Gieles of the University of Cambridge and Yuri Beletsky of the ESO. Mischa Schirmer of the University of Bonn performed the data processing.\n\nWhy was the Voyager 2 probe sending back digital gobbledygook from the edge of the solar system? Answer:The Jet Propulsion Laboratory says the cause of the garbled data was apparently a single bit in the memory of an onboard computer that was flipped from a 0 to a 1. The effect was successfully re-created on a computer at JPL, and engineers expect to reset the memory bit on the actual spacecraft on Wednesday. Voyager 2 and its twin, Voyager 1, rank among the most distant objects made by humans. They toured the planets in the 1970s and 1980s and are now heading toward interstellar space. Voyager 1 is 10.5 billion miles from Earth, and Voyager 2 is 8.6 billion miles away in a different direction.\n\nWhy didn't the world's antimatter and matter combine to blow up the universe as soon as it was born? Answer: It may have been because more matter than antimatter was created in the subatomic processes that occurred during those very first moments. Researchers at Fermilab have observed a 1 percent difference in the number of muons vs. antimuons that were created through the decay of B mesons produced in Fermilab's Tevatron particle collider. \"Many of us felt goosebumps when we saw the result,\" said Stefan Soldner-Rembold, co-spokesperson for the Tevatron's DZero experimental team. The results are laid out in a paper submitted to Physical Review D.\n\nWhen is Cosmic Log's birthday? Answer: Actually, it was a few days ago. This weblog got its start on May 13, 2002, and the past year has brought new records for page views and comments (thanks to \"Noah's Ark found? Not so fast\"). More than 78,000 comments have been received over the past four years. As we head into the ninth year of operation, more changes are on the way. Within a few weeks, we'll be rolling out a new look and a different way of handling comments. While you're waiting, take the Cosmic Log birthday quiz.\n\nThe changes on the mountain are fascinating to biologists - and perhaps unexpectedly, creationists as well.\n\nFor example, consider the amphibians of the ponds: When the volcano blew on May 18, 1980, an avalanche of logs, rocks and other debris wiped out some lakes and reshaped others. Biologists thought amphibians such as salamanders, frogs and toads would be among the hardest-hit species.\n\n\"They're thought to be very sensitive to environmental change,\" Charlie Crisafulli, a U.S. Forest Service ecologist who has been studying St. Helens since shortly after the eruption, told a \"Nova\" documentary team.\n\nSo biologists were \"absolutely shocked\" to find that most of the area's amphibian species had survived the blast, Crisafulli said. The eruption created an array of 150 ponds that actually encouraged the amphibians to widen their territory.\n\nThese weren't your father's amphibians: The reshaped terrain reshaped the animals as well. The pond habitat favored Northwestern salamanders that could keep their gills and live their whole lives as aquatic animals, as detailed in this Seattle Times report.\n\n\"The salamanders are a good example of what I would call hedging your bets,\" Mount St. Helens monument scientist Peter Frenzen told me today.\n\nThe eruption wiped out land-dwelling amphibians, but new colonists could take advantage of protected burrows that were built by gophers beneath the ash.\n\nA big factor behind the amphibians' resurgence is the fact that they've been able to stay a leap ahead of the things that could bring them down - predators, pathogens and parasites, which Crisafulli calls the \"three P's.\" Once St. Helens' ecosystem fills out more completely, biologists expect the amphibian population to be brought back into check.\n\nThat might suggest that amphibians do best in off-balance environments, thanks to their ability to switch between marine and land habitats. But it really depends on the situation: Scientists have long argued that amphibians are in the midst of an extinction crisis precisely because their habitats are out of balance, in part because of human-caused pollution.\n\nUnexpected consequences are a big part of the Mount St. Helens story, and not just for amphibians: After the eruption, some biologists thought that the thousands of acres of downed trees would leave the area more vulnerable to wildfires and insect infestation. Those concerns encouraged extensive salvage logging in some areas of the blast zone - but not within the 110,000-acre Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument that created by Congress in 1982.\n\nThe result was that significantly different ecosystems were created inside and outside the monument's boundaries. Selling all that salvaged lumber brought economic benefits for the region's hard-hit logging industry, but leaving the lumber alone didn't bring about the environmental problems some had feared: The volcanic ash that coated the trees served as a fire retardant as well as an insecticide.\n\nReviving the creationism connection ... Speaking of unexpected consequences, Mount St. Helens has become something of a poster child for \"creation geologists\" - St. Helens Creation Information Center, not far from the mountain itself.\n\nTo mark the occasion, my former colleagues at The Spokesman-Review in Spokane have put together a special report, including a heaping helping of reminiscences. If you have memories you'd like to share, please add them as comments below.\n\nAs you read stories about the rebirth of Mount St. Helens' ecosystem, and the scientific mysteries posed by its seismic activity, try to keep the eruption's 57 victims in your memory as well. The best-known casualty was David Johnston, the volcanologist who radioed \"Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!\" just as the volcano blew. His name now graces Johnston Ridge, the site of a volcano observatory and visitor center. Check out this memorial website for remembrances of all the victims.\n\nUpdate for 7 p.m. ET: Peter Frenzen, the U.S. Forest Service's monument scientist for Mount St. Helens, says that the changes at the volcano illustrate how a huge disturbance in an ecosystem can open up opportunities for a different mix of organisms to gain a foothold.\n\n\"I don't think it's quite evolution,\" he told me. \"Evolution takes a longer time to play out. This is more of an environmental shift and a shift in the habitat.\"\n\nSuch an environment favors organisms that can cope more easily with that kind of shift - a characteristic that ecologists call \"amplitude.\" The salamanders that can keep their gills and go aquatic provide a good example of amplitude. So do Mount St. Helens' deer mice. \"When seeds are around, they're eating seeds,\" Frenzen said. \"When insects are around, they're eating insects.\"\n\nClick for slideshow: Get a good look at the long-nosed tree frog and other new species from Indonesian New Guinea's Foja Mountains.\n\nBiologists returned to an exotic \"Lost World\" in Indonesian New Guinea - and found a fresh assortment of new species, including the kangaroo's smallest cousin and a frog with a Pinocchio nose.\n\nConservationists are so heartened by all the creatures they're finding in the world's wild places that they're aiming to double or triple the pace of discovery.\n\n\"While animals and plants are being wiped out across the globe, at a pace never seen in millions of years, the discovery of these absolutely incredible forms of life is much-needed positive news,\" Bruce Beehler, a senior research scientist at Conservation International, said in today's announcement of the species discoveries. \"Places like these represent a healthy future for all of us and show that it is not too late to stop the current species extinction crisis.\"\n\nIf you think \"crisis\" is too strong a word, take a look at recent developments:\n\nIn March, a top U.N. official said that tigers were on \"the verge of extinction\" in the wild, due in large part to poaching and illegal trade in tiger products.\n\nA week ago, another U.N. report declared that the world's nations were experiencing a \"collective failure\" in their efforts to preserve biodiversity. For example, nearly a quarter of all plant species are endangered.\n\nA few days ago, scientists published a report predicting that 20 percent of the world's lizard species would go extinct by 2080 if temperatures continued to rise at current rates.\n\nThe potential for massive environmental damage caused by the Gulf of Mexico's deep-sea oil spill is just beginning to sink in ... literally.\n\nThe Foja Mountains of Indonesian New Guinea encompass an area of more than 1,150 square miles (300,000 hectares) of unroaded, undeveloped, undisturbed rainforest. Back in 2006, Conservation International, the Indonesian Institute of Sciences and other groups hailed the region as a \"Lost World\" with dozens of species that were new to science. (Click through this slideshow to see a sampler.)\n\nMany of those researchers, including Beehler, returned in late 2008 for the latest survey of the region. This time, the \"rapid assessment\" survey received an extra boost from the National Geographic Society and the Smithsonian Institution. CI says the modern-day explorers battled torrential rain storms and flash floods as they tracked species from the Foja's foothills to the mountain range's 7,200-foot (2,200-meter) heights.\n\n\"The Pinocchio of Frogs,\" a tree frog with a spiky nose that points upward when the male is calling but deflates and points downward when he's less active.\n\nA dwarf wallaby that represents the smallest documented member of the kangaroo family.\n\nTwo imperial pigeons with reddish, white and gray feathers - rare birds that went unnoticed during past surveys but showed up repeatedly during the latest expedition.\n\nConservationists see areas such as the Foja Mountains as more than mere menageries. These \"lost worlds\" serve as reservoirs of biodiversity, carbon sinks that moderate global climate, potential sources of new medicines and materials, and living space for the region's forest-dwelling inhabitants. The region is already a national wildlife sanctuary, but Conservation International hopes that the additional documentation of the region's biodiversity will encourage the Indonesian government to beef up long-term measures to protect it.\n\nConservation International itself has been encouraged by its string of \"rapid assessment\" successes - so much so that it's embarking on a project to double or triple the number of species discoveries in \"lost worlds\" over the next few years.\n\n\"Many of the still-undescribed species may be beneficial to people's health, food and fresh-water security, and therefore important for conservation,\" the group says.\n\nAstronauts including Hubble spacewalker Mike Massimino and the crew of Atlantis' current mission to the International Space Station explain how to use the shuttle's space potty in a YouTube video from NASATelevision.\n\nIf this astronaut gig doesn't work out for Mike Massimino, he can always find a job as a TV comedian.

But Charles Townes had a pretty good idea.\n\nAfter all, it was his work with microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation - masers - that set the stage for the optical lasers to come. In fact, he and others theorized that lasers could be built a couple of years before Maiman did it. Townes' research earned him a share of the 1964 Nobel Prize in physics.\n\nToday, at the age of nearly 95, Townes is still a working scientist at the University of California, doing research in astrophysics. And when you talk with him on the phone, you get the impression that his intellect is still as sharply focused as a you-know-what.\n\nIn an interview, Townes looked back at the first 50 years of the Laser Age - and looked ahead to the next phase of the revolution. Here's an edited transcript of the Q&A:\n\nCosmic Log: Fifty years ago, did you know how significant laser technology would turn out to be - or did you have the sense, like many other people, that the laser was a \"solution looking for a problem\"?\n\nCharles Townes: I knew it was quite important. I could see many things for which it would be very useful. Some other people said, \"Well, it's a solution looking for a problem.\" Actually, when we were working on the maser for some years, trying to make the first one work, nobody was interested. Once it got working, everybody got interested, and they saw the applications for it.\n\nUC-Berkeley\n\nNobel laureate Charles Townes is a professor at the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nFor quite a while, nobody thought masers could be pushed down to light waves - which is what I wanted to do. My primary object was to get the short waves. After a few years of working with the maser, with all the excitement about that, I decided, \"Well, let me see how we can get right on down to light waves.\" I figured out ways of doing that and wrote a paper about how a laser might be built.\n\nI could foresee a lot of applications, but many people doubted it.\n\nQ: Are there some applications that you saw at the time that have not been done yet?\n\nA: Uh, no, I wouldn't say that's the case. In fact there are many applications that have been done that I didn't foresee. For example, I didn't foresee the medical uses at all. The medical uses are enormous. I saw, oh, communications, and burning and welding and cutting, and a lot of scientific applications. About 10 or 12 Nobel Prizes have been given as a result of people having lasers or masers available to work with. It's produced a lot of good science. And everybody knows how important it's been in industry applications. It's really a very big business right now.\n\nQ: There's an old saying that \"success has many fathers,\" and of course a lot of people were involved in the development of laser technology. Is there a bit of a competitive discussion going on?\n\nA: Oh, sure, everybody would like to claim some of the credit. Actually, the first idea was the maser. Nobody else was much interested in that - only the Russians, Basov and Prokhorov, who got the Nobel Prize with me. They were working on it in parallel, in Russia. I didn't know that at the time, and I don't think they knew just what I was doing. Only two groups in the whole world were working on masers.\n\nOnce the maser came along, it became a very exciting field. But nobody seemed to think you could get down to short wavelengths. After Arthur Schawlow and I wrote a paper on how to get down to short wavelengths, then everybody jumped into the field. Lots of different lasers were built. All the lasers were built in industry. I knew there'd be a lot of competition if I indicated that lasers could be built. That's why I wrote a theoretical paper on how to do it, rather than trying to build one, because I felt that people would beat me. And they did.\n\nQ: Are there any lessons in that for future innovation? People have talked about how we'll find future solutions for energy or communication ...\n\nA: Well, I would point out that my research was supported by the Navy. I was doing spectroscopy, and many people questioned whether the Navy should be supporting spectroscopy. One could question that, yet overall, it's paid off enormously. Not all research pays off, but every once in a while, research pays off enormously.\n\nIt's hard to predict. When I first started building a maser, the chairman of my department said, \"Oh, that's not going to work. You should stop. You're wasting the department's money.\" Nobody competed. They didn't think it was going to do anything special - until it did work. Then suddenly everybody got excited about it.\n\nNew things are new. People don't visualize new things very well. So we've got to be open-minded in order to get new things. We've got to be open-minded, and explore, and that's going to pay off in the long run. Not all of it pays off. Some of it won't work. But some of it will work - and when it works, you can do great things.\n\nQ: Do you feel as if the laser revolution has run its course?\n\nA: No, it's still being developed. And it will continue to develop for years and years.\n\nQ: How do you see the course of development going in the next few years?\n\nA: Oh, boy. Maybe we'll get on down to X-ray lasers. We have some now, but they're not terribly effective. Maybe we'll get some better ones. We can get more power, and higher precision, and just a lot of applications that people will see. They're finding more all the time.\n\nQ: What sorts of applications will X-ray lasers open up?\n\nA: Just think: If you could have an X-ray laser to do X-ray medical work, it could be very sharply focused, you see. You could just affect the part of the body that you wanted to affect, and nothing else.\n\nQ: Would that be for diagnostics, or for treatment?\n\nA: Both. Also, X-rays will penetrate things that light won't penetrate. We could get X-ray lasers penetrating through materials, and focus on areas inside materials to weld or burn something, to cut the inside of the material without affecting the outside very much.\n\nQ: How would that work?\n\nA: You focus the X-rays to a point inside something, and the rays would be weak on the outside before they focus on that inside zone.\n\nQ: Is there anything especially notable about the current generation of laser research? Is science being done differently from how it was when you did your Nobel-winning work?\n\nClick for slideshow: Aptera's electric vehicle zips along the track at the Michigan International Speedway during the \"Shakedown\" trials for the Progressive Automotive X Prize. Click on the image to see a slideshow featuring X Prize cars.\n\nTwenty-seven of the 36 vehicles that were invited to the \"Shakedown\" trials are still in the running after a series of evaluations at the Michigan International Speedway in Brooklyn, Mich. The evaluations included technical inspections as well as zero-to-60-mph acceleration runs, double-lane-change avoidance maneuvers and braking tests.\n\nThe next step for the surviving vehicles will be a \"Knockout\" round of tougher head-to-head evaluations in June.\n\nDuring the next round, teams will have to demonstrate that their cars can meet or beat 67 miles per gallon equivalent (MPGe) fuel economy. Because many of the cars are hybrid electric or all-electric, the X Prize has set up a formula to figure out the energy equivalence.\n\nThe contest's ultimate goal is to reward teams that can field marketable automobiles capable of getting more than 100 MPGe while satisfying requirements for range and low emissions.\n\n\"This was not meant to be easy,\" Eric Cahill, senior director of the X Prize competition, said in a statement issued today. \"If it were, it would have already been done. We expect to see additional eliminations during the Knockout Stage as we narrow the field in preparation for the Finals Stage in late July.\"\n\nThe $10 million in prize money will be split by the top-scoring cars in three categories: $5 million for a mainstream four-seater, $2.5 million for an alternative side-by-side two-seater, and $2.5 million for an alternative tandem two-seater. The prizes are to be awarded at a ceremony in September.\n\nJason Fagone, a writer who is following the competition for Wired magazine and writing a book about the X Prize teams, says the Virginia-based Edison2 team would have to be counted among the favorites. All of the cars that the team brought to the Shakedown trials have been cleared for the next phase.\n\n\"They absolutely killed it,\" Fagone told me today.\n\nBut he also said there was a long road ahead. It's not clear yet which cars will rise to the top when it comes to fuel efficiency. \"That's the big target, so it's still hard to know how it will shake out,\" Fagone said.\n\nSome cars passed with flying colors. Others received a \"conditional\" pass, meaning that they didn't complete all the mandatory events yet. Still others received a \"probationary\" pass, meaning that they didn't get far enough through the off-track evaluations to do the on-track safety tests. Those conditional and probationary competitors will have to complete all the mandatory Shakedown requirements before they can go on to the Knockout phase.\n\nHere's how the Shakedown results shook out:\n\nMainstream Class Teams: Mainstream Class vehicles must carry four or more passengers, have four or more wheels, and offer a 200-mile range.\n\nChina's first astronaut, Yang Liwei, waves after landing on the Inner Mongolian grasslands of northern China on Oct. 16, 2003. In his autobiography, Yang says dog meat and other traditional Chinese dishes were on his spaceflight menu.\n\nDogs made their mark in space history as the first animals in orbit - but now they're in the news because they were on the menu for China's first astronaut.\n\nYang Liwei, who made history in 2003 as the pilot for the first Chinese-made spaceship, discusses his orbital eating habits in his recently published autobiography, \"The Long March to Space,\" also known as \"The Nine Levels Between Heaven and Earth.\"\n\nThe list of items includes dog meat from Huajiang county in Guangdong province, which the Chinese say has medicinal benefits ranging from reducing high blood pressure to reducing frequent urination at night. It's also supposed to combat fatigue (\"better than ginseng\") and provide warmth in the winter.\n\nOther items on the menu included braised chicken and steamed fish - but it was the dog meat that sparked a buzz, in the media as well as among animal-rights advocates. Hong Kong-based Animals Asia, for example, has been waging a long-running campaign to fight the Asian trade in dog meat and cat meat.\n\nIn a statement, Animals Asia's Irene Feng sais she was \"a little shocked\" to hear that China was putting dog meat on the menu for its astronauts.\n\n\"There are so many health risks associated with the farming, slaughter and consumption of dogs,\" said Feng, who runs Animals Asia's Doctor Dog program in China. \"I hope our national space team will consider these issues.\"\n\nJill Robinson, Animals Asia's founder and chief executive officer, said it's especially important for China's astronauts to set an example.\n\n\"Yang Liwei is a role model for so many young people and he is one of China's greatest heroes,\" Robinson said. \"We hope that he might recognize dogs as the heroes they are too - they found survivors during the Sichuan earthquake and protected people from potential terrorists during the Olympic Games. Surely they deserve more.\"\n\nSpace food reflects the planet's different cultures just as much as earthly food does. Jewish and Muslim astronauts, for example, probably wouldn't go for the freeze-dried \"Kicked Up Bacon Cheese Mashed Potatoes\" that were served aboard the International Space Station in 2006. But they probably wouldn't stop their pork-eating crewmates from chowing down.\n\nSuppose Chinese astronauts brought dog meat with them onto the space station in future years: Would that be an acceptable reflection of their national culture, or an unacceptable example of bad taste in an increasingly international space workplace? What do you think?\n\nClick for video: Apollo 11 commander Neil Armstrong, left, looks on as Apollo 17's Gene Cernan makes a point during the Senate hearing. Click on the image to watch some of Armstrong's testimony.\n\nThe first man and the last man to walk on the moon spoke out forcefully against NASA's revised vision for future spaceflight today, suggesting that the space agency and President Barack Obama were in effect bamboozled.\n\n\"This budget proposal presents no challenges, has no focus, and is in fact a blueprint for a mission to nowhere,\" Apollo 17 commander Gene Cernan, who pledged just before leaving the moon in 1972 that \"we shall return,\" told the Senate Commerce Committee.\n\nCernan said the Obama administration's decision to bypass the moon and settle on a more open-ended path to deep space was \"most likely formulated in haste\" by budget experts and science policy advisers, with little input from NASA itself.\n\nApollo 11 commander Neil Armstrong, arguably the world's best-known living astronaut, said in his written testimony that the plan was \"likely contrived by a very small group in secret who persuaded the president that this was a unique opportunity to put his stamp on a new and innovative program.\"\n\n\"I believe the president was poorly advised,\" Armstrong said in his written remarks.\n\nIt's rare for retired astronauts to take such a public stand against U.S. space policy, and particularly rare for Armstrong, who is renowned for his reticence. However, Armstrong and Cernan - along with Jim Lovell, who flew around the moon on Apollo 8 and Apollo 13 - made their dissatisfaction known last month in a letter made public by NBC News.\n\nDuring today's high-profile hearing, Armstrong and Cernan urged Congress to add back funding for the development of a NASA rocket to carry astronauts to the International Space Station. NASA's current plan, in contrast, will rely on the Russians as well as U.S. commercial launch providers to provide space station transport services.\n\nThe Apollo astronauts said they were skeptical that the commercial sector - which is likely to include longtime launch providers such as the Boeing Co., Lockheed Martin and Orbital Sciences as well as newcomers such as SpaceX - could operate spaceships as safely and reliably as NASA will require.\n\nNASA's current plan calls for $6 billion dollars to be set aside over the next five years for the commercial development effort. SpaceX and other companies say they could start launching astronauts in as little as three to five years. The space agency's administrator, Charles Bolden, told senators today that he expected the first commercial crew flight to the space station to take place in 2015.\n\nCernan, however, said it \"might take as much as a full decade\" for commercial spaceships to become available, at a cost two to three times greater than projected. He said the commercial companies and NASA were underestimating how much effort would be required to certifying new rockets for human spaceflight.\n\nIn the meantime, America's space effort would have to rely on Russian space transports, \"leaving us hostage as a nation to foreign powers for some indeterminate time.\"\n\nHe urged the senators to allocate more funding for NASA's Ares 1 rocket development effort, which the White House wants to cancel as a money-saving measure. \"Get it up, get it running,\" Cernan told the panel.\n\nIn response to questions, Bolden estimated that keeping the Ares 1 project going would cost an additional $1 billion to $1.6 billion - depending on how much of that work could be incorporated into a more ambitious plan to develop a new heavy-lift rocket for trips beyond low Earth orbit.\n\nBolden said about $9 billion in all has been spent so far on NASA's back-to-the-moon Constellation program, and added that \"not a dime of that has been wasted.\" Although the White House's budget proposal calls for Constellation's cancellation, current legislation requires NASA to stick with the program until Congress decides otherwise.\n\nNASA's current budget plan faces stiff opposition in Congress, in part because canceling Constellation will result in thousands of layoffs. During today's hearing, White House science adviser John Holdren maintained that keeping Constellation was unworkable, due to \"technical and budgetary difficulties ... that we inherited.\"\n\n\"It clearly was time to push the reset button,\" Holdren told senators.\n\nThe White House's \"flexible-path\" plan for space exploration was formulated after months of deliberations by an independent review panel, headed by retired aerospace executive Norman Augustine. The panel concluded that the Constellation program, which called for astronauts to be sent back to the moon by 2020, was underfunded and unsustainable.\n\n\"It was our conclusion that there was really no way to conduct a human exploration program that would be meaningful and safe at all,\" Augustine told the senators.\n\nThe revised plan calls for extending support of the International Space Station from 2015 to 2020. NASA would have to rely on the Russians and commercial launch providers after the expected retirement of the shuttle fleet in late 2010 or early 2011.\n\nThe Orion crew capsule, which was being developed for trips to the moon as well as the space station, would be used instead in scaled-down form as a lifeboat for the space station. NASA would begin developing the new heavy-lift rocket by 2015. The first destination beyond Earth orbit would be an asteroid, in the 2025 time frame, and crewed spaceships would be sent into Martian orbit sometime in the mid-2030s.\n\nSenators and witnesses sparred over whether the revised plan was hatched without adequate consideration. Bolden, for example, was repeatedly asked whether he was consulted in advance of February's budget announcment. Bolden said that he was, before a trip to Israel\n\nBolden did say during the hearing that he expected commercial launch providers to run into technical problems, and that he would \"do everything in my power\" to make sure they were successful.\n\nThere have been rumblings about a plan that might give NASA extra money for following up on the Ares 1 development effort. Such an arrangement is being pushed by Sen. Bill Nelson, the Florida Democrat who heads the Senate's subcommittee on space (and flew on the space shuttle with Bolden in 1986).\n\nIn addition, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, the Texas Republican who is the Commerce Committee's ranking minority member, suggested that the remaining shuttle flights could be stretched out for another two years.\n\nThe shuttle Atlantis is due to be launched on its last scheduled mission Friday, setting the stage for retirement of the fleet after Discovery and Endeavour take their turns later this year. Bolden said he would be in favor of adding one more shuttle flight to the schedule, most likely in 2011. But he said there would be no backup shuttle available to rescue a crew in the event of an emergency in orbit. (Observers say Russian Soyuz craft would have to be employed instead.)\n\nBy the end of the hearing, the message came through loud and clear that Congress would make revisions in the NASA budget plan - most likely to keep additional elements of the Constellation program in play. Hutchison said Bolden is \"going to try to work with us\" on such revisions.\n\nUpdate for 7:40 p.m. ET: Some senators expressed doubts about NASA's plan to support commercial space transport, but others were supportive. As you might expect, the Commercial Spaceflight Federation focused on the supportive comments in its recap of the hearing.\n\nUpdate for 9 p.m. ET: I corrected the reference to Lovell's spaceflight experience. Also, it's worth noting that some other prominent astronauts (including Sally Ride and Armstrong's Apollo 11 crewmate, Buzz Aldrin) are in favor of the Obama plan. For some straight talk, check out Rand Simberg's take on the hearing at Transterrestrial Musings. You'll also find some great comments at NASA Watch.\n\nThe multimillion-dollar space race calls upon grownup teams to build lunar rovers that can be blasted to the moon for an exploratory trip that includes sending live video back to Earth. The kid-sized version calls upon student teams to design rovers that can drive around a simulated moonscape and capture video while they're doing it.\n\nThe deadline for signing up is Saturday, which leaves just a couple of days for choosing up a team (with four to six members) and filling out the X Prize Foundation's registration form.\n\nThe first stage of the rover-building mission will be done on computers, using free design software such as Google SketchUp or Lego Digital Designer. Team members are also required to create a video essay about lunar exploration and their expectations for the discoveries that will be made on the moon. And it doesn't hurt if the team sets up a blog or a website as well.\n\nThe design and the video have to be turned in by May 28. That's when the real fun begins.\n\n\"We will select 20 finalists, each of whom will get sent just shy of $500 worth of Legos,\" William Pomerantz, the foundation's senior director for space prizes, told me. Using Lego Mindstorms robotics kits, the finalist teams will build pint-sized moonbots based on their designs, plus a Lego-based lunar surface. Each webcam-equipped rover will be asked to perform a series of simulation tasks - for example, rolling off a landing base, visiting craters, collecting blocks, taking pictures and recording video.\n\n\"We've tested it out here at the X Prize Foundation offices,\" Pomerantz said, \"so I can tell you from personal experience that it's a really fun experience, and the children will learn quite a lot about both space exploration and about robotics and engineering.\"\n\nWinners will be selected in August. Members of the top team will get a chance to visit Lego headquarters in Denmark. Other prizes include free team registration and a startup kit for the FIRST robotics competition. Check the MoonBots website for full information about deadlines, rules and rewards.\n\nPomerantz said the MoonBots program meshes perfectly with the Google Lunar X Prize's goal of building up the buzz for the next generation of science and engineering, on Earth and in space. \"We think we've got a platform here that is compelling for students,\" he said. \"These are not boring jobs for the geeks in the class. These are the cool jobs.\"\n\nVirtual walk on the moon Even if you're not building a moonbot, you can still take part in lunar exploration through a new citizen-science project called Moon Zoo. The Web-based effort builds on the success of Galaxy Zoo, which has signed up more than 250,000 Internet users for astronomical research.\n\nMoon Zoo explorers can hunt through imagery from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and mark the craters that they see.\n\n\"We need Web users around the world to help us interpret these stunning new images of the lunar surface,\" Oxford University's Chris Lintott, chairman of the Citizen Science Alliance, said today in a NASA announcement. \"If you only spend five minutes on the site counting craters, you'll be making a valuable contribution to science - and who knows, you might run across a Russian spacecraft.\"\n\nCrater-counting is a time-honored method for determining the age and depth of a particular stretch of the lunar surface. The craters left behind by recent impacts could provide clues about the moon's past history - and the future risks Earth might face from meteor strikes.\n\n\"We hope to address key questions about the impact bombardment history of the moon and discover sites of geological interest that have never been seen before,\" said Katherine Joy of the Texas-based Lunar and Planetary Institute.\n\nVirtual shuttle launch For a down-to-earth classroom project about space, check out the Kennedy Launch Simulation System, or KLASS, a software package that simulates the preparations for a space shuttle launch. NASA says KLASS is based on the actual training software used at Kennedy Space Center, but tailored for sixth- through 10th-grade students.\n\nStudents get the chance to monitor simulated shuttle systems during a launch countdown and decide for themselves whether they're \"go\" for launch. The package, available on CD or via an online download, includes 40 hours of lesson plans and interactive resources for teachers.\n\nTo see how the real thing is done, just keep an eye on our Human Spaceflight section, where we're covering the countdown to Friday's scheduled launch of the shuttle Atlantis to the International Space Station.\n\nA boat moves through oily water on Thursday at the site of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana.\n\nThe Gulf of Mexico oil spill is getting progressively more serious, with the amount of leaked oil growing by 5,000 barrels (200,000 gallons) or more every day. In the three weeks since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded, about 100,000 barrels have been spilled. Tar balls and oiled-up birds are already washing up on the Louisiana shore - and the volume of leaked oil is projected to surpass the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill sometime next month.\n\nHow much worse could it get? A lot worse, according to projections from BP, the oil company responsible for cleaning up the spill. That's why engineers are being careful about what they do to stop the leak.\n\nIf the safety equipment installed on the wellhead worked the way it was supposed to, there wouldn't have been a spill at all. A stack of valves and tanks known as a blowout preventer, or BOP, should have slammed the pipe shut as soon as the pressure went out of control. Obviously, that didn't happen, but experts believe that the BOP is reducing if not stopping the flow of oil.\n\nWhen BP filed its oil-drilling plan for the site, more than a year ago, it estimated that the worst-case scenario would be a blowout leaking 162,000 barrels of oil a day. That's the equivalent of 10 Olympic-size swimming pools, or 32 times as much oil as is leaking right now.\n\nPhilip Johnson, a petroleum engineering professor at the University of Alabama, said that estimate is way beyond what could actually happen. He said that amount of oil flow would have to be sparked by a \"hugely bizarre event,\" such as the kind of undersea earthquake you might see in a Clive Cussler thriller.\n\n\"It's an extremely high rate,\" he told me. \"I don't believe that's a realistic upside to that well.\"\n\nIt's hard to judge how close the actual worst-case might come to the bizarrely huge projections, but Johnson guessed that the maximum flow might be 20,000 barrels a day. Last week, BP executives reportedly gave lawmakers a higher figure: 60,000 barrels a day.\n\nThe potential for a bigger leak helps explain why BP isn't blowing up the well site with torpedoes or nuclear weapons, even though some msnbc.com users have suggested that course. \"My reaction to that is, why would you think that would work?\" Johnson said.\n\nWhat is now a partially controlled wellhead would become a \"big crater with a hole coming up from the bottom of it,\" he told me. \"The pipe lying on the floor provides a better opportunity to seal this than an open well.\"\n\nPlan BP for stopping the leak Over the weekend, experts tried dropping a containment chamber over the pipe from which most of the oil was leaking. If the chamber worked, the oil mixture could be brought up to the surface for reprocessing. But the effort was stymied because frozen gas and water - a slushy blend known as gas hydrates - clogged the opening at the top of the chamber.\n\nBP is now looking into using a smaller containment chamber, nicknamed a \"top hat.\" Johnson explained that the smaller chamber would cut down on the amount of water mixing with the gas coming out of the pipe. Methanol would be injected into the flow to further inhibit the formation of hydrates.\n\nAnother strategy under consideration is to plug up the leaking well from above - perhaps by injecting shredded-up tires, golf balls and other material into the blowout preventer. Such a \"junk shot\" could plug up any leakage inside the BOP - but it could also create a risky buildup of pressure at the wellhead. In a worst-case scenario, the weakened wellhead could blow its top - and increase the flow of oil.\n\nJohnson said that such a turn of events could occur if the wellhead suffered significant damage. \"If that's the case, then that wellhead is going to come off eventually whether or not you put the junk shot in there,\" he said. \"The risks of doing the junk shot are far outweighed by the rewards: stopping the flow, and the sooner the better.\"\n\nStopping the flow is not the only front in BP's battle against the leak:\n\nChemical dispersants are being used at the surface and near the source of the leak to turn the oil into a light, viscous \"mousse\" that can degrade more easily.\n\nMiles and miles of booms are being put out to contain the oil at the surface.\n\nFires are being set at sea to burn off some of the oil.\n\nStaging areas are being set up in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida to cope with cleanup when oil reaches shore.\n\nFishing-boat operators and others are being recruited to help with the containment effort.\n\nFor a long-term fix, BP is drilling a relief well that should intersect with the leaking well 13,000 feet beneath the seafloor. Thick mud and concrete would be pushed down the relief well to plug up the leak for good.\n\nEven if the flow of oil were to increase dramatically, \"the strategy would remain completely unchanged,\" BP spokesman David Nicholas told me. \"The response plan that is in place would be the response that would be in place for the worst-case scenario.\"\n\nHow long, and how far? One factor that could make the worst-case scenario even worse is the possibility that coastal communities will have to deal with the spill for months or years. \"If we have a three-month oil spill, we're talking about absolute devastation of the largest coastal fishery in the U.S.,\" Ralph Portier, an environmental science professor at Louisiana State University, told me.\n\nRight now, dispersants are going a long way toward keeping the spill in check. \"We've gotten some very excellent results showing that the oil dispersant mousse to a great extent degrades ... if we have a finite event,\" Portier said.\n\nBut it's hard to predict the long-term impact, especially if the end of the oil leak is not yet in sight. How will all those dispersants affect the Gulf's ecosystems in general and the fisheries in particular? Will blobs of degraded oil start washing up in Texas? Or in Florida?\n\n\"I guess our biggest concern is, we may have to redefine what an oil spill is,\" Portier said. \"We may have to redefine what a catastrophe is. What if we have globules of oil that stay in the water column and continue to come ashore month after month after month?\"\n\nThe dynamics behind the response to this oil spill are nothing like the dynamics that dictated the response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill more than 20 years ago. Back then, the massive spill was over and oil was washing ashore even before dispersants could have been flown up to Alaska. Today, the tools are in place to battle the spill. But for how long?\n\n\"If you visit the lower parishes, you'll see that people are in hurricane mode,\" Portier said. \"It's the meteorologists who are telling the people where the oil spill is, just like it's the meteorologists who tell them where the storm is. There's a sense of urgency about this. There's a sense of being tough about it. But it is kind of defeating not knowing when the end is going to be.\"\n\nUpdate for 11 p.m. ET: Here are a few more thoughts from the experts:\n\nThe University of Alabama's Philip Johnson doesn't like the idea of blowing up the wellhead, but he is intrigued by the idea of using a carefully designed explosive charge to crimp or flatten the pipe without breaking it. The explosives would have to be \"configured in the right way,\" and there are some risks involved, but the strategy could conceivably work, he said.\n\nLouisiana State University's Ralph Portier said that if the flow of oil were to increase significantly, dispersants couldn't handle the surface spill. The worst-case scenario would probably look like Exxon Valdez in the short term, with chronic environmental degradation in the long term. \"We'll end up with the 'peanut butter and jelly sandwich,'\" he told me. \"Surface oiling event, bird populations oiled, and then we're going to end up with a dispersant event for many months after.\"\n\nRick Steiner, a retired University of Alaska professor who is now an independent consultant specializing in oil-spill response, told me that \"it's a catastrophic situation right now. ... The disaster has occurred, but it's offshore and in the water column.\" He said the oiling of Louisiana beaches has begun and will continue. \"Even if they cap the thing today, there's millions of gallons of oil in the Gulf that's going to be transported with the winds on the surface. It will weather, it will break down ... but it takes time.\"\n\nRadiation from a hot, massive star at the bubble's center is blasting gas and dust outward, and that's what has cleared out the space around the star. The central star doesn't show up well in Herschel's infrared image, but you can see it easily in this submillimeter-wavelength view from the European Southern Observatory's APEX telescope in Chile.\n\nThe shock wave from the central star compresses the material on the bubble's edge so much that still more stars are being squeezed into existence. In the Herschel image, you can see a particularly bright spot on the right edge of the bubble. That's an embryonic star that appears destined to turn into one of the brightest lights in our galaxy.\n\nThe Herschel science team calls it an \"impossible\" star because it's exceeding the theoretical limit for a star's mass.\n\n\"This star can only grow bigger,\" Annie Zavango, an astronomer at the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille, said in the ESA's image advisory. \"According to our current understanding, you should not be able to form stars larger than eight solar masses.\"\n\nAt about eight solar masses, the power of the newborn star should blast away any additional gas or dust before the extra mass has a chance to accumulate. But the star at the bubble's edge is already eight to 10 times as massive as the sun, and it's on track to get much larger.\n\nAstronomers have already spotted stars that are as much as 150 times as massive as the sun, but they don't know exactly how they can get that large. A close study of the brightening light in RCW 120 could show them the way.\n\nNASA \/ ESA \/ STScI\n\nHubble's view of Eta Carinae.\n\nStellar blasts can blow amazing bubbles in space. Perhaps the best-known blast is associated with Eta Carinae, a supermassive star that could go supernova one of these days.\n\nIts double-lobed shape, reminiscent of an old-fashioned dumbbell, arises because the star is blowing material out from both poles.\n\nLots of stellar explosions take on this shape: The phenomenon has been attributed to several factors, including spin dynamics and the star's magnetic field.\n\nNASA \/ ESA \/ KULeuven \/ Berkeley\n\nHubble image of Red Rectangle.\n\nPerspective plays a role as well: One famous example is the Red Rectangle, which looks like a quadrangle but is actually two back-to-back cones of material flowing out from a double-star system.\n\nAnd then there's the hexagon on Saturn: The six-sided cloud pattern at the ringed planet's north pole has puzzled astronomers for decades, but now physicists have figured out the dynamics that can cause hexagonal features - as well as triangular, square and even seven-sided shapes as well. They can even create them in the lab.\n\nOxford via YouTube\n\nSimulation shows six-sided fluid flow.

One video clip shows a huge prominence looping up from the sun's surface and back down again.

The resulting draft sequence, which represents about 60 percent of the entire genome, is unveiled in this week's issue of the journal Science.\n\nThe results shed light on the evolution of our own species, Homo sapiens, as well as on the genetic heritage of now-extinct Homo neanderthalensis. When researchers compared the detailed Neanderthal code with that of five modern-day humans from different areas of the world, they found overwhelming similarities. But they also found some scientifically significant differences.\n\nGenetic sequences from the three non-African modern individuals (from Papua New Guinea, China and France) were statistically more likely to be similar to Neanderthals than the sequences from southern Africa and West Africa. That suggests that some interbreeding took place after early humans spread out from Africa, most likely in the Middle East 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, P\u00e4\u00e4bo and his colleagues said.\n\nBut it wasn't all that much interbreeding. Between 1 and 4 percent of the human genome appears to have come from Neanderthals, statistically speaking. The researchers could find no specific string of code could be definitively traced back to them across the full sample. They could not point to any trait that we have inherited specifically from Neanderthals.\n\nIan Tattersall, an anthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History who was not involved in the research, said the study meshes with earlier findings about the relationship between the two species. Just last month, for example, yet another team of researchers reported similar statistical signs of Neanderthal DNA in samples from modern humans.\n\n\"I don't think it changes the picture we already had, that Neanderthals and Homo sapiens were functionally individuated entities,\" Tattersall told me. \"This is what species are about. There may have been a bit of Pleistocene hanky-panky, but nothing that left a clear biological mark on either party.\"\n\nA tangled tale Untangling our connection to Neanderthals is tricky on several counts. First, you have to get the Neanderthal DNA.\n\nThe species is reflected in the European fossil record as far back as 400,000 years ago, and scientists believe that Neanderthals co-existed with us Homo sapiens types until about 30,000 years ago. Did we kill them off? Were they assimilated into our species' gene pool? Or were they simply ill-suited to cope with changing conditions on Earth?\n\nScience \/ AAAS\n\nNeanderthal bones come from these four archaeological sites, marked with the approximate dates for the bones' age.\n\nFor whatever reason, the Neanderthals left behind a relatively scant record. To conduct their genetic study, P\u00e4\u00e4bo and his colleagues checked out 21 Neanderthal bone samples that were recovered from Croatia's Vindija Cave. Three bones, thought to date back to around 40,000 years ago, were selected for detailed DNA analysis.\n\nTiny amounts of powder were extracted from the interiors of the bones with a sterile dental drill, processed with chemicals and run through DNA-sequencing machines. An analysis of the DNA showed that 95 to 99 percent of it was from other organisms - for example, microbes that colonized the bones after the Neanderthals died. But the researchers used special enzymes to separate the signature of Neanderthal DNA from that of microbial (and human) contamination.\n\nEven though the Neanderthal DNA was broken up into small pieces, the researchers sequenced 3 billion base pairs and completed about 60 percent of the genome's jigsaw puzzle.\n\nHumans vs. Neanderthals Decoding the genome was only part of the job. Comparing that genome with our own genetic code was just as tricky. Neanderthals and the human species are thought to have diverged only 500,000 years ago, which means the two species are close cousins in anthropological terms. In fact, if you compared a particular area of the Neanderthal genome with the corresponding genetic code in a single modern human, there's a chance you'd find more similarities than you'd see between two modern humans.\n\nMax Planck Institute EVA\n\nMost of the Neanderthal genome sequence was retrieved from these three bones, which were found in Croatia's Vindija Cave.\n\nWhen P\u00e4\u00e4bo started the project, he didn't think he'd find any evidence of \"gene flow\" between ancient Neanderthals and humans. After all, an earlier study involving a different kind of genetic code known as mitochondrial DNA showed no such intermixing. \"I was probably biased really in the direction that it would not have happened,\" P\u00e4\u00e4bo said.\n\nBut when the comparison came back with the five modern humans, and the researchers found more similarities between the Neanderthal genome and the non-African genomes, that was a big hint that Neanderthals interbred with ancient humans after they emerged from Africa. \"At first I thought it was some kind of statistical fluke,\" P\u00e4\u00e4bo said.\n\nThe researchers rechecked their results, looked for alternate explanations, and went so far as to do yet another comparison with genomics pioneer Craig Venter's personal code. But the link between Neanderthals and non-Africans held up.\n\n\"This was really a surprise to us,\" said Harvard geneticist David Reich, one of the co-authors of the study.\n\nCase closed? The question over whether ancient humans ever \"did it\" with Neanderthals now appears to be resolved, but the draft genome raises more questions that are just as deep. For example, what traits did humans develop that gave them an evolutionary edge over Neanderthals? The researchers found some intriguing clues:\n\nFive genes stood out as different in Neanderthals and modern humans. One of them has to do with how sperm cells whip their tails around. Another relates to wound-healing. Yet another builds a protein for the skin, sweat glands and hair roots. \"It's tantalizing to think that the skin changed, but the biological implication of that is not at all clear yet,\" P\u00e4\u00e4bo said.\n\nSeveral genes showed evidence of positive selection in humans as opposed to Neanderthals - including genes linked to schizophrenia, autism and Down syndrome. \"This suggests that some of the genes that were positively selected may have had to do with cognitive development. ... It doesn't suggest that Neanderthals had no autism, or that they were more similar to people with autism,\" P\u00e4\u00e4bo said.\n\nThe researchers also focused on a gene that was linked to development of the frontal part of the skull, the shoulder bone and ribcage. Those are anatomical features where Neanderthals and humans differ, so the researchers said it was a \"reasonable hypothesis\" that that particular gene, RUNX2, \"was of importance in the origin of modern humans.\"\n\nResearchers are continuing to analyze the Neanderthal genetic data, and they expect to get a clearer picture of the species distinctions as time goes on.\n\nRight now, the coverage of the genome is 1.3x, which means an individual DNA base pair was checked only 1.3 times on average. P\u00e4\u00e4bo said \"our goal for the next two to three years is to come somewhere between 10 and 20x coverage,\" which would be comparable to the accuracy for a typical human genome. He estimated the cost of the project so far at 2 million to 3 million euros ($2.5 million to $3.8 million), but added that \"it will be a lot cheaper to now go on.\"\n\nTattersall said the research team's first draft was \"a remarkable achievement, and something they should be congratulated for.\" And he expected that there would be even more remarkable revelations ahead.\n\n\"This is the beginning of the story,\" he told me, \"not the end of it.\"\n\nThe space shuttle Atlantis sits on its Florida launch pad after its April 22 rollout.\n\nNASA today gave the green light for what's likely to be the space shuttle Atlantis' last launch, opening the final chapter in the orbiter fleet's 29-year history. Atlantis' solid-fuel rockets are due to fire up for a final time at 2:20 p.m. ET on May 14. But mission managers say they're not letting that finality sink in fully just yet.\n\n\"There's this ability to stay focused and compartmentalize,\" Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for space operations, told reporters today at the end of a flight readiness review for Atlantis' 12-day mission to the International Space Station.\n\n\"I have not spent a lot of time thinking about 'last this' or 'last that,'\" said John Shannon, NASA's space shuttle program manager.\n\nLaunch director Mike Leinbach said shuttle workers have been preparing for this STS-132 flight just as they have for the 131 others in the program. \"Probably a lot of hugs at the end of the day - but when they're working on the vehicle, it's the standard flow,\" he said.\n\nOf course, the more than 15,000 workers at Kennedy Space Center in Florida can't help but think about this final scheduled round of three flights for the three remaining orbiters - Atlantis, Discovery, Endeavour. And they can't help but wonder about what will happen when the last shuttle rolls to a stop.\n\n\"We've gotten past the denial stage of the change,\" Leinbach said, \"and we're into the exploration and acceptance stage.\" He said the reflections on Atlantis' flight would be \"bittersweet, to be sure.\"\n\nLast month, President Barack Obama visited the space center, seeking to reassure agency employees as well as contractors that they'd still be playing a vital role in the post-shuttle era. Over the weekend, the White House announced the appointment of a task force to oversee a $40 million program for workforce training and economic development on Florida's Space Coast.\n\nThat part of the economic endgame will play out over the months and years to come. But for now, the focus is on the first of the last shuttle flights.\n\nWhat Atlantis will do Atlantis' six-man crew, led by commander Ken Ham, will deliver Russia's 17,000-pound, 23-foot-long Rassvet (\"Dawn\") module to the International Space Station. Rassvet, which is also known as the Mini Research Module 1, has been packed with supplies and equipment for the station. A European robotic arm, radiator and airlock are attached to Rassvet's exterior.\n\nDuring Atlantis' visit, Rassvet will be hooked up to the station's Zarya control and cargo module during Atlantis' visit, and in 2012 a full-blown Russian orbital laboratory (known as Nauka or \"Science\") will be added on. Atlantis' trip marks the first time (and almost certainly the last time) that a Russian module has been flown up on a space shuttle. The arrangement follows through on a barter deal for U.S.-Russian space transport.\n\nThe shuttle will also carry a pallet containing six fresh batteries for the station's power-generating truss, a new Ku-band communication antenna and a tool platform for the station's Canadian-built Dextre robotic arm. Atlantis' astronauts will install the antenna, add the platform and swap out the batteries during a series of three spacewalks.\n\nAtlantis' history It's fitting that Atlantis is bringing up the last pressurized module designed from the get-go to be permanently attached to the space station. (In September, Discovery is due to deliver the Italian-built Leonardo logistics module, which has been carried back and forth several times but is now being modified to become a permanent fixture.)\n\nThe 25-year-old orbiter carried up the station's U.S-built Destiny laboratory and Quest air lock as well as the European-built Columbus lab. It has also sent up the Magellan probe to Venus, the Galileo probe to Jupiter and the now-defunct Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory, which was once one of NASA's \"Great Observatories.\"\n\nAtlantis will also go down in history as the first shuttle to dock with Russia's Mir space station (in 1995) and the last shuttle to hook up with the Hubble Space Telescope (a year ago).\n\n\"She's been around a long time, and a lot of us have known that ship for 25 years,\" Leinbach said today.\n\nRetired astronaut Jerry Ross, who holds the record for the most shuttle flights (in a tie with Franklin Chang-Diaz), took five of his seven trips to space aboard Atlantis. \"Personally, I think it's the best one in the fleet,\" he half-jokingly told reporters earlier this week.\n\nIs there really a difference in the way Atlantis handles itself in space? The astronauts say the significant differences between flights really have more to do with the payload distribution rather than the characteristics of the particular orbiter. But STS-132 pilot Dominic Antonelli noted that Atlantis lacked something that the other two shuttles have: an extension cord that lets the shuttle tap into the space station's power supply.\n\n\"That will limit the duration of our stay,\" Antonelli said. There's only so much power that will be available to Atlantis while it's docked to the station.\n\nBut when Atlantis comes back home, it won't be packed up right away. Instead, it will be put through the regular processing routine to serve as a backup rescue vessel, just in case something goes wrong during what is expected to be the final shuttle flight. The current schedule calls for Endeavour to take on that program-ending mission to the International Space Station no earlier than November.\n\nIf Endeavour were to suffer so much damage during that last scheduled flight that it couldn't return safely to Earth, Atlantis would be launched with a skeleton crew to bring the marooned astronauts home.\n\nThere's yet one more scenario for Atlantis to fly again: If the money is available for yet another flight beyond the three currently planned, Atlantis could conceivably be sent to the space station with a crew of four, to deliver a last load of supplies to the station. That STS-135 flight would have to come sometime next year.\n\nMission managers say they aren't counting on that STS-135 flight - but they aren't counting it out just yet, either.\n\nThe lead shuttle flight director for the upcoming mission, Mike Sarafin, likened this last go-around to the final season of a champion athlete. \"We are in the ninth inning,\" he told reporters. \"Atlantis may go into extra innings. We don't know.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama, left, talks with SpaceX millionaire founder Elon Musk during a tour of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on April 15.\n\nSpaceX founder Elon Musk says it's hard to imagine being under more pressure than he is now, during preparations for the first launch of a rocket that's being put forward as a replacement for the space shuttle system.\n\nIf the California-based company's Falcon 9 rocket delivers as promised, it could start delivering cargo to the International Space Station as early as next year. And if NASA gives the go-ahead, the Falcon 9 and its Dragon capsule could be configured to carry astronauts as well in as little as three years' time.\n\nBut those are a couple of big ifs, particularly for critics such as Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala. \"Today, the commercial providers that NASA has contracted with cannot even carry the trash back from the space station, much less carry humans to or from space safely,\" Shelby said last month during a Senate hearing.\n\nA successful Falcon 9 launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida would go a long way toward assuring NASA, the White House and Congress that SpaceX can indeed carry the trash and eventually astronauts as well. A significant launch failure, however, would strengthen the hand of Shelby and others who want NASA to resurrect the Ares 1 rocket development program. Ares 1 was part of NASA's Constellation return-to-the-moon program, but is currently marked for cancellation.\n\nSpaceX\n\nEngines on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket light up during a launch-pad test in Florida on March 13.\n\nThe way Musk sees it, this whole issue is not just about SpaceX: He points out that the potential beneficiaries of NASA's move toward commercializing space transport include the Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin, which currently co-manage the shuttle program (through their venture United Space Alliance). Their Atlas and Delta rockets have launched the vast majority of spacecraft for the space agency as well as the U.S. military (through another joint venture, United Launch Alliance).\n\n\"The thing is that it's much harder for Constellation's proponents to attack the Atlas and Delta than to attack Falcon 9, which has not yet launched,\" Musk told me last week.\n\nBut Musk doesn't want the Falcon 9 to be just another Atlas or Delta: His motivation in founding SpaceX eight years ago was to bring about a dramatic reduction in the cost of going to space, thus taking one giant leap toward the settlement of other worlds. The list price for a Falcon 9 launch is around $50 million, compared with $138 million or more for an Atlas 5.\n\nMusk, a 38-year-old emigre who was born in South Africa, earned millions of dollars through his involvement in early dot-com ventures such as PayPal. He's a top executive in start-ups focusing on electric cars (Tesla Motors) and solar power (SolarCity). But right now, it's his role as a space entrepreneur that's putting him most in the public eye. During a Cape Canaveral visit last month, President Barack Obama made a point of touring the Falcon 9's launch pad with Musk at his side.\n\nAll that attention just adds to the pressure as launch day approaches. The stakes are much higher for the Falcon 9 than they were for SpaceX's less powerful model, the Falcon 1, which went through three launches that were less than fully successful before reaching orbit on the fourth and fifth tries.\n\nSpaceX is currently waiting for the Air Force to sign off on the Falcon 9's flight termination system. \"We're not sure when that will finish - if the testing goes well or if there are additional issues,\" Musk said. The waiting game means that SpaceX's first opportunity for a launch won't come until the latter half of May at the earliest.\n\nEven then, Musk expects that the first countdown may not go all the way to zero. If anything looks the least bit suspicious, the count will be stopped and the launch will be rescheduled.\n\n\"There's a lot that has to go right on launch day, and we're also going to be extremely careful. ... We don't want to leave any stone unturned. We want to turn over stones two or three times, in fact,\" he said.\n\nSpaceX\n\nSpaceX's Dragon spacecraft, shown here in an artist's conception, is designed to carry cargo, scientific experiments or even astronauts into orbit.\n\nSpaceX has fallen behind its original schedule for developing the Falcon 9 and the Dragon, which has provided some ammunition for Musk's critics. But the company is aiming to launch three additional test flights of the Falcon-Dragon system by the end of this year, culminating in a berthing demonstration at the space station. That would open the way for robotic cargo deliveries that could earn SpaceX $1.6 billion through 2016.\n\nAlthough Musk's main focus right now is getting the first Falcon 9 off on a successful flight, he pointed out that the next rockets are already in production, with a new Falcon 9 rolling off the line every three to four months.\n\n\"It's not like this is just some one-off demonstration,\" he told me. \"There's a lot of weight placed on this first Falcon 9 flight, and there should be. But it's most important to bear in mind that there's a whole production line of vehicles coming out after that.\"\n\nDuring our interview, Musk not only discussed the upcoming launch but also touched upon the bigger picture for SpaceX and spaceflight. Here's an edited Q&A:\n\nCosmic Log: How has SpaceX's intiative been received, in the wake of the White House visit and the things that Sen. Shelby had to say? Has that complicated your life, or do you just try to keep your head down?\n\nElon Musk: It has complicated our life here at SpaceX, I suppose in a good way. That is, the president's decision to go with commercial astronaut transport in addition to commercial cargo transport ... we view that as a good thing.\n\nA: Yeah, and the emphasis is on \"could.\" If it does indeed herald a new era for spaceflight, and if it does indeed result in space being opened up to the masses, then I think it's fair to say that it would have an importance comparable to that of JFK's speech. Of course, the jury is out. That actually has to happen. But I think it will.\n\nQ: But when it comes to the criticism you've been facing, I assume you have things that you would say to members of Congress, to reassure them about SpaceX's role. What are you telling people when they raise questions?\n\nA: I think it's certainly a fair question to raise. But the thing that the opponents of the cancellation of Constellation have tried to do is, they've engaged in the classic straw-man fallacy, which is to reconstruct the other side's argument in a way that is intentionally weak or impaired and then knock it over. They do that by using SpaceX and saying, \"This is all dependent on SpaceX.\" Which is ridiculous.\n\nOf course, the biggest beneficiaries of commercial crew transport are going to be Boeing and Lockheed, and their Atlas and Delta vehicles. They've had something like 40 successes in a row. Delta and Atlas launch all the Air Force and NRO [National Reconnaissance Office] satellites, and they in fact launch all the NASA spacecraft. Moreover, before [former NASA Administrator] Mike Griffin came along, Atlas and Delta were planned to be the lifters for the successor to the space shuttle. The thing is that it's much harder for Constellation's proponents to attack the Atlas and Delta than to attack Falcon 9, which has not yet launched.\n\nI think the proper response to people who ask whether this is the best way to go forward is to say, \"Absolutely.\" It's the only way to go forward, because in the best-case situation, Ares 1 and Orion might be ready in ... 2016? So that's six years of depending on the Soyuz. You have to say, would commercial do it better? OK, you've got United Launch Alliance saying they can get it done in three or four years. We're saying we can do it in three years. Orbital Sciences is saying they can do it. All of these time frames are less than that required for the first flight of Ares 1 and Orion. If Boeing and Lockheed are saying they can do it, and they're launching these rockets right now, then I think probably they will succeed.\n\nAnd then, as it was put by [XCOR Aerospace CEO] Jeff Greason on the Augustine Commission, and seconded by [former astronaut] Sally Ride, \"Constellation is so expensive that even if Santa Claus gave it to us tomorrow for free, the operating costs are so high that the next thing we'd have to do is cancel it.\" The real question people should be asking is not \"Should we be canceling Constellation?\" It's \"Why wasn't Constellation canceled sooner?\" Why would you embark upon something where success was not one of the possible outcomes?\n\nQ: But it sounds as if elements of the Constellation program are being picked up again as time goes on. For example, now Orion is being supported as a lifeboat space vehicle, and the White House wants to push forward with the heavy-lift rocket development program. Some people are even talking about reviving Ares 1 hardware as a step toward heavy-lift development. If Congress decides to keep Constellation going under another name, does that affect anything you do?\n\nA: Well, the problem with Constellation hardware is that it's incredibly expensive. So if they continue those tests, then one of two things has to happen. They'd have to increase the NASA budget considerably, or they'd have to delay any replacement for the Soyuz. Which will it be?\n\nQ: And I suppose that would impact SpaceX, because Congress could say, \"Well, instead of giving $6 billion to commercial providers, let's give them $4 billion and use $2 billion to keep Constellation around.\"\n\nA: I just don't see the point of keeping Ares 1 around. You have to ask, \"Is success possible with Ares 1?\" And if it isn't, why are we bothering?\n\nQ: I'm sure a lot of people ask you why commercial providers, including Boeing and Lockheed and yourself, would be able to do this cheaper than NASA. That gets to the safety question: \"Well, it takes more money to get up to the safety standards that NASA requires.\" What's your answer to that \"why\" question?\n\nA: First of all, the answer there is that all of our air transport and road transport is managed by the private sector. And air transport has become incredibly safe. People have forgotten that what airlines used to compete on was actually their safety record, first and foremost. And then cost only afterward. It just got to the point that commercial airlines are so safe that saying you're safe is pointless. Everyone is safe.\n\nThe thing that people probably don't realize is that commercial will be much safer than government. And it'll be much cheaper, just as it is in the airline business: Who in their right mind would prefer to fly on Soviet Aeroflot vs. Southwest Airlines? One is a government monopoly, and the other is a competitive commercial entity.\n\nQ: Are you finding that a lot of the people who have been involved in the Constellation effort are aiming to come over to SpaceX? Is there a shift in personnel, or at least in the number of applications that you're getting?\n\nA: Yeah, we've actually gotten a lot of resumes from people working in the Constellation program. We've hired quite a few of them, and expect to do more of the same.\n\nQ: Any numbers you can share on how you expect employment to change at SpaceX?\n\nA: We expect SpaceX employment to rise from what it is right now, which is just under 1,000 employees, to several thousand employees eventually. But of course that's a function of what business we have. If we are doing a lot of astronaut transport, then our employment numbers will be much higher than if we're not. We can't afford to go hire a whole bunch of people in the hope that we'll have astronaut transport. We have to get from here to there.\n\nQ: How does this all fit in with your grand plan? You've talked many times about how you'd like to see humanity become a multiplanet species. Do you feel as if you're getting closer to this goal as a result of new space policies?\n\nA: Yes, I'm still focused on extending life beyond Earth, and that's why commercial crew is so important. I really think commercial crew could be as important as the decision to outsource air mail in the 1920s. That's what got Charles Lindbergh going, and all the other early airline pilots. If the Post Office hadn't outsourced air mail, I think there would have been a huge delay in the advent of everyday air travel.\n\nSo commercial crew is actually an important change, and will be really helpful. In the absence of this, we're going to have to try to self-fund all the way on crew transport. That's a much slower process, and there's greater financial risk. I think we'll succeed, but it's going to take us a much longer time.\n\nQ: Are you feeling any extra pressure because of all this, focusing on the first launch? Or is it the same level of pressure you always feel?\n\nA: We're probably red-lining on pressure. It certainly doesn't help. But people should know that SpaceX is around for the long haul. If the first launch goes well, that's great, we'll go on to the second launch. And if the first launch doesn't go well, we'll still go on to the second launch. ... People should take a look at my track record and realize that I always come through in the end. It may take more time than I expected, but I'll always come through."}
{"text":"My love affair with spiral galaxies is well documented here on this blog. Of course, I'm biased: I live in one.\n\nBut some of them demand a little more attention than others, like the oddly off-kilter NGC 2442, aka the Meat Hook Galaxy:\n\nThat gorgeous image (click to galactinate, or grab the ginormous 6756 x 5687 pixel version) is from the MPG\/ESO 2.2 meter telescope in Chile, and it definitely shows why NGC 2442 is a weird one. The one arm at the bottom is long and stretched out, the top one is thicker and dotted with pink star-forming regions, and the nucleus is way off-center. What the heck happened to this galaxy?\n\n[Note: this image is rotated 180\u00b0 from the one above.] Again, we see lots of red gas clouds glowing, fired up by massive stars forming in them. Interestingly, to me this view of the galaxy looks like a single bird feather, with the individual vanes arcing down. Those vanes are actually streamers of gas and dust pulled out like taffy from the main arm. Given all this, it's pretty clear that NGC 2442 suffered a very close pass or even a collision with another galaxy sometime in the relatively recent past.\n\nBut what galaxy? In the first image above you can see a small spiral galaxy off to the right. But in a much wider-scale image (reversed left to right of the one here) there is another galaxy above NGC 2442. It may have been either of these two\u2026 but I have my suspicions it's the one on the right. In the first picture above, see how the small galaxy has no red star-birth regions in it? Many times, when smaller galaxies ram through big ones, all their gas and dust is stripped out by the bigger galaxy. The lack of gas in the small spiral is something of a tell.\n\nIn the Hubble image you can actually see smaller galaxies right through NGC 2442, too! That always gets me. So cool. But those are almost certainly much more distant background galaxies \u2014 NGC 2442 is roughly 50 million light years away, and those are more like hundreds of millions of light years distant. Even if they are near NGC 2442, they're too small to have caused such a major disruption of the far larger galaxy anyway.\n\nI'll note that a radio survey of this region also detected a huge cloud of neutral hydrogen near NGC 2442 with about a billion times the mass of the Sun! That fits; it was probably free-floating hydrogen in the galaxy that got drawn or blown out by the passage of the smaller galaxy.\n\nPristine, symmetric spirals are so beautiful, but they are also lovely to behold when disrupted by a catastrophic collision, too. The energies and scales involved are mind-numbing, yet from a distance, and apparently frozen in time, they still possess a majesty and grand beauty.\n\nComments (17)\n\nLinks to this Post\n\nSo beautiful\u2026what gets me is how that edge on spiral in the distance is visible through the thicker core regions as if it's just a dirty window. I know it appears yellow because of the higher populations of red giants, older stars and the like toward the core (as it is with most galaxies of this type), but even here the stars must still be very spaced out (lol bad pun ) from each other.\nQuestion: in images like this, I've always suspected that the objects that appear to be individual stars in these galaxies at these distances are not actually individual stars, but clusters. Would this suspicion be true at all?\n\nA 180 degree rotation doesn't make sense\u2026 the long axis of the galaxy would still be at a mismatched viewing orientation compared to the first image. If I'm seeing this right, I'd say the Hubble image is rotated ~90 degrees clockwise from the first.\n\nAs usual, awesome images and awesome posts. I've always been curious though; are the images from Hubble and some of the larger telescopes like the Chilean one that gave us the first image color corrected or manipulated in any way to give us these beautiful images or is this a faithful image of what the universe and our galactic neighbors look like to the naked eye, but extremely magnified? Thanks!\n\nIf you ignore the foreground stars of the Milky Way and the background galaxies in the first picture, the view we are seeing in the first picture may be somewhat equivalent to our view of the Andromeda Galaxy. You can see the Andromeda Galaxy yourself IF you have clear, dark skies away from city lights and are in the northern hemisphere, but it more-or-less appears as a fuzzy star (which is basically the core). If you cheat a bit and use binoculars or even a largish (up to 10-inch in diameter) telescope, most of what you can see with your eyes will be a greenish-white haze surrounding the whiter core. Much of the details that you can get via astrophotography is more due to long exposure rather than magnification. These pictures from ESO and Hubble are further enhanced by the use of light filters to help bring out details of scientific interest such as the star-forming regions.\n\nStill purdy.\n\nAnd I agree with Tom (#4): you have to rotate the ESO picture roughly 90 degree clockwise rotation to get the Hubble view.\n\n@Arthur: Thanks! So\u2026if we could get up close enough to it, the colors would be true right? Nothing has been color enhanced artificially to turn a bunch of white stuff or stuff outside the visible spectrum visible or colorful for us?\n\nBecause it's a little guy it didn't perturb NGC 2442 as much as a lower mass-ratio interaction would have and NGC 2442 consequently doesn't show as significant a kinematic disturbance or increase in star formation.\n\nWhat would this be? I see nothing like that in any of the other galaxies in the image and it doesn't look like an artifact of processing. If this was the galaxy that interacted with NGC 2442, is this some sort of emission resulting from that?\n\n@15 That is almost certainly an image artifact (or satellite?), it is incredibly linear and extends the length of the field. Compare DSS images and the lovely color image in the article and you do not see the same structure."}

{"text":"Swift Redshift Measurements\n\nMeasurements of the gamma-ray spectra obtained during the prompt\nemission of the GRB have found little value as redshift indicators,\ndue to the lack of well-defined spectral features. However, optical\nobservations of GRB afterglows have produced spectra with identifiable\nlines, leading to precise redshift measurements (e.g., z = 0.835,\n3.418, and 0.966 for GRBs 970508, 971214, and 980703).\n\nThe UVOT has a grism which can produce spectra of objects\nbrighter than 15th magnitude. However, most GRB afterglows\nwill rapidly fade below this limit. For most GRBs, Swift\nattempts to measure redshifts by using the UVOT to find the Lyman edge\n(see below). Swift redshift estimates have a precision of\napproximately 0.1, compared to ground-based measurements with\naccuracies of approximately 0.001. At cosmological distances, the\nSwift redshift estimates are more accurate than the currently\nknown conversion between redshift and distance, so the reduced\nprecision has little scientific impact. The ability to use the UVOT\ngrism to determine the redshift of a GRB depends on the brightness of\nits afterglow, the absorbing material in front of the GRB, and the\nredshift of the GRB.\n\nThe amount of absorbing material is often parameterized by the\ncolumn density, NH, which is the number of hydrogen\natoms in a 1 cm square column between the observer and the\nsource. Since hydrogen is not always the material which absorbs the\nphotons, this is adjusted using estimates for the number of heavier\natoms and dust particles per hydrogen atom, which depends on the\nproperties of the interstellar medium. UVOT spectra can indicate if\nthe region around a GRB is full of the cast-off debris of older stars\nor the coalescing gas forming new stars, or even if the object that\nproduced the GRB had a history of blowing dusty winds into the space\naround itself.\n\nThe Lyman edge technique for determining the redshift requires\nthat the line-of-sight to be relatively dust-free, so that the visible\nand ultraviolet light is not clouded out. Ground-based optical\nmeasurements of faint sources require that strong spectral features be\nvisible in the wavelength range observable through the atmosphere, and\nso have trouble with the redshift range 1.3 < z < 2.5.\n\nFor 1 < z < 5, the Lyman edge (the wavelength beyond\nwhich hydrogen atoms block all ultraviolet light) is redshifted into\nthe wavelength band of the UVOT. With the six color filters of the\nUVOT, the location of the edge can be measured, as the GRB afterglow\nwill be visible with the redder filters but undetectable in the bluer\nfilters. The redshift can be measured with an accuracy of roughly 0.1.\nSteidel et al. (1996) have used this technique with two colors and\nfind it robust.\n\nThis is the result of a simulation of this technique, as applied\nto six-color (1000 s per exposure) observations of a 20th\nmagnitude GRB afterglow at z = 3, and with an extinction\ndue to dust of EB-V = 0.4. Dust preferentially\nblocks bluer light, and can obscure the Lyman edge in dim afterglows.\n\nThe brightness of the burst and afterglow, and its approximate\nredshift (if the afterglow is bright enough), are available shortly\nafter the BAT triggers on a GRB, allowing ground-based observers\nenough information to determine whether the GRB is worthy of follow-up\nstudies using over-subscribed and expensive ground-based instruments.\nBursts that are special in various ways, such as being extremely\nluminous, very distant, or excessively obscured, may be studied using\nvarious techniques and instruments to study the central engine of the\nGRB, its afterglow, and the nature of its environment.\n\nIf you have a question about Swift, please contact us via the Feedback form."}
{"text":"How To Stir Galaxy Disks\n\nHow To Stir Galaxy Disks\n\nSunday January 10, 2010\n\nTwo CNRS researchers at the Strasbourg Observatory have shown that in spiral galaxies containing a central bar \u2013 an elongated structure composed of stars \u2013 a vigorous mixing of stars in the disk takes place. They presented their work this week at the meeting of the American Astronomical Society.\nUntil now, astronomers have attributed this mixing process, named \"radial migration,\" solely to spiral structure, while ignoring the effects of the bar. Astronomers Ivan Minchev and Benoit Famaey have shown that in barred spiral galaxies, such as our own Milky Way, radial migration occurs much faster and in a different fashion than previously thought.\n\nIn this process, stars in the disk are displaced by thousands of light-years from their birth radii while preserving their circular orbits.\n\nThis new study indicates that our Sun could have experienced a similar fate: its path also traces a circular orbit while its chemical composition corresponds to that of a star ten thousand light-years closer to the galactic center.\n\nThis stirring of the disk results from chaotic regions caused by the proximity of the bar and spiral resonances. A common example of a resonance is when a person pushes a playground swing precisely in time with the frequency of the swing, which makes the swing go higher and higher.\n\nAt certain radii in galaxies, resonances occur between the frequency of the radial oscillations of stars and the rotation frequency of the bar and spiral. The ratio of the rotation frequencies of the bar and spiral determines the proximity of the resonance radii, and thus the strength of radial migration.\n\nThe results of this study could help explain why there is such a large variation in the chemical composition of stars near the Sun.\n\nIn addition, observations of spiral galaxies other than the Milky Way show that the presence of a central bar produces a more even chemical composition throughout the disk than galaxies which lack bars. This study suggests that the powerful mixing of stars in the disk in the case of barred galaxies blurs an otherwise steep chemical gradient, thus providing a theoretical explanation for these observations.\n\nA thorough knowledge of the interaction between the bar and the spiral is crucial for understanding the way the chemical composition of the galaxy evolves with time.\n\nWhen modeling the Milky Way or any other galaxy with a bar and a spiral pattern, one can thus no longer consider the phenomena linked to the presence of the bar and of the spiral separately. Instead, simulations must synthesize these features to make progress in our understanding of galaxy evolution."}
{"text":"Spitzer finds ancient clusters\n\nAstronomers have increased sixfold the number of distant galaxy clusters.\n\nBy\nLiz Kruesi \u2014\nPublished:\nJune 20, 2006\n\nThis full field view is a mosaic of thousands of infrared images from Spitzer. The newfound galaxy clusters are marked by orange dots. A zoom-in optical image of a cluster 8.7 billion light-years away is inset.\n\nPhoto by NASA \/ JPL-Caltech \/ M. Brodwin (JPL)\n\nJune 20, 2006 A team of astronomers co-led by Mark Brodwin and Peter Eisenhardt, both of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, has discovered almost 300 new galaxy clusters. Nearly 100 of these clusters are 8 billion light-years away or farther; they formed when the universe was less than half its present age. The discovery of nearly 100 distant galaxy clusters is a six-fold increase in the number of known galaxy clusters at these extreme distances.\n\nThe more distant the cluster, the younger it is, so these newfound galaxies are still in the early stages of formation. Clusters usually hold the most massive galaxies, which is where the earliest stars formed. By studying so many young clusters, astronomers can learn how the earliest stars formed and how clusters (and galaxies) evolved.\n\nThe team combined infrared data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and existing optical images from the National Optical Astronomy Observatory Deep Wide-field Survey collected at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona. The astronomers used the optical data to weed out small, intervening galaxies. To find the clusters, they searched through Spitzer data for dense clumps of distant objects. Eisenhardt explains: \"Distant galaxies show up best in infrared because during the billions of years it takes to reach us, their light expands along with the universe to long, infrared wavelengths.\"\n\nThe team presented their findings June 5 at the American Astronomical Society's meeting in Calgary, Canada.\n\nUser Comments\n\nBe the first to leave your comment below!\n\nOnly registered members of Astronomy.com are allowed to comment on this article.

{"text":"Search\n\nA team of astronomers led by the University of Leicester has uncovered new evidence that suggests that X-ray detectors in space could be the first to witness new supernovae that signal the death of massive stars.\n\nAstronomers have measured an excess of X-ray radiation in the first few minutes of collapsing massive stars, which may be the signature of the supernova shock wave first escaping from the star.\n\nThe findings have come as a surprise to Dr Rhaana Starling, of the University of Leicester Department of Physics and Astronomy whose research is published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nDr Starling said: \"The most massive stars can be tens to a hundred times larger than the Sun. When one of these giants runs out of hydrogen gas it collapses catastrophically and explodes as a supernova, blowing off its outer layers which enrich the Universe. But this is no ordinary supernova; in the explosion narrowly confined streams of material are forced out of the poles of the star at almost the speed of light. These so-called relativistic jets give rise to brief flashes of energetic gamma-radiation called gamma-ray bursts, which are picked up by monitoring instruments in Space, that in turn alert astronomers.\"\n\nGamma-ray bursts are known to arise in stellar deaths because coincident supernovae are seen with ground-based optical telescopes about ten to twenty days after the high energy flash. The true moment of birth of a supernova, when the star's surface reacts to the core collapse, often termed the supernova shock breakout, is missed. Only the most energetic supernovae go hand-in-hand with gamma-ray bursts, but for this sub-class it may be possible to identify X-ray emission signatures of the supernova in its infancy. If the supernova could be detected earlier, by using the X-ray early warning system, astronomers could monitor the event as it happens and pinpoint the drivers behind one of the most violent events in our Universe. continue reading"}

{"text":"Scientists have pieced together the key elements of a gamma-ray burst, from star death to dramatic black hole birth, thanks to a \"Rosetta stone\" found on March 29, 2003.\n\nThis telling March 29 burst in the constellation Leo, one of the brightest and closest on record, reveals for the first time that a gamma-ray burst and a supernova -- the two most energetic explosions known in the Universe -- occur simultaneously, a quick and powerful one-two punch.\n\nThe results appear in the June 19 issue of Nature. The burst was detected by NASA's High-Energy Transient Explorer (HETE) and observed in detail with the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n\n\"We've been waiting for this one for a long, long time,\" said Dr. Jens Hjorth, University of Copenhagen, lead author on one of three Nature letters. \"The March 29 burst contains all the missing information. It was created through the core collapse of a massive star.\"\n\nThe team said that the \"Rosetta stone\" burst also provides a lower limit on how energetic gamma-ray bursts truly are and rules out most theories concerning the origin of \"long bursts,\" lasting longer than two seconds.\n\nGamma-ray bursts temporarily outshine the entire Universe in gamma-ray light, packing the energy of over a million billion suns. Yet these explosions are fleeting -- lasting only seconds to minutes -- and occur randomly from all directions on the sky, making them difficult to study.\n\nA supernova is associated with the death of a star about eight times as massive as the Sun or more. Its core implodes, forming either a neutron star or (if there is enough mass) a black hole. The star's surface layers blast outward, forming the colorful patterns typical of supernova remnants. Scientists have suspected gamma-ray bursts and supernovae were related, but they have had little observational evidence, until March 29.\n\n\"The March 29 burst changes everything,\" said co-author Dr. Stan Woosley, University of California, Santa Cruz. \"With this missing link established, we know for certain that at least some gamma-ray bursts are produced when black holes, or perhaps very unusual neutron stars, are born inside massive stars. We can apply this knowledge to other burst observations.\"\n\nGRB 030329, named after its detection date, occurred relatively close, approximately 2 billion light years away (at redshift 0.1685). The burst lasted over 30 seconds. (\"Short bursts\" are less than 2 seconds long.) GRB 030329 is among the 0.2 percent brightest bursts ever recorded. Its afterglow lingered for weeks in lower-energy X-ray and visible light.\n\nWith the VLT, Hjorth and his colleagues uncovered evidence in the afterglow of a massive, rapidly expanding supernova shell, called a hypernova, at the same position and created at the same time as the afterglow. The following scenario emerged:\n\nA bluish Wolf-Rayet star -- containing about 10 solar masses worth of helium, oxygen and heavier elements -- rapidly depleted its fuel, triggering the Type Ic supernova \/ gamma-ray burst event. The core collapsed, without the star's outer part knowing. A black hole formed inside surrounded by a disk of accreting matter, and, within a few seconds, launched a jet of matter away from the black hole that ultimately made the gamma-ray burst.\n\nThe jet passed through the outer shell of the star and, in conjunction with vigorous winds of newly forged radioactive nickel-56 blowing off the disk inside, shattered the star. Meanwhile, collisions among pieces of the jet moving at different velocities, all very close to light speed, created the gamma-ray burst. This \"collapsar\" model, introduced by Woosley in 1993, best explains the observation of GRB 030329, as opposed to the \"supranova\" and \"merging neutron star\" models.\n\n\"This does not mean that the gamma-ray burst mystery is solved,\" Woosley said. \"We are confident that long bursts involve a core collapse, probably creating a black hole. We have convinced most skeptics. We cannot reach any conclusion yet, however, on what causes short gamma-ray bursts.\"\n\nShort bursts might be caused by neutron star mergers. A NASA-led international satellite named Swift, to be launched in January 2004, will \"swiftly\" locate gamma-ray bursts and may capture short-burst afterglows, which have yet to be detected.\n\nThe VLT is the world's most advanced optical telescope, comprising four 8.2-meter reflecting Unit Telescopes and, in the future, four moving 1.8-meter Auxiliary Telescopes for interferometry. HETE was built by MIT as a mission of opportunity under the NASA Explorer Program, with collaboration among U.S. universities, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and scientists and organizations in Brazil, France, India, Italy and Japan."}

{"text":"Why are there hot-dogs in the Milky Way?\n\n30\/08\/2012 6:04 pm\n\nNASA have informed us that they have pinpointed thousands of super massive black holes and other extreme objects that have formed galaxies in the cosmic zoo known as 'hot dogs'. So what does it all mean?\n\nBy Declan Whooley\n\nHold on\u2026.hot dogs? How on earth could they find their way into outer space?\n\nIf you read the intro properly I would not need to repeat myself. While you may be thinking of a tasty and distinctly American-esque food, these hot dogs are quite different.\n\nOK. That makes more sense than perishable food standing the test of time in outer space. Are these hot dogs close to us?\n\nNot yet anyway. Scientists believe that they are about 10 billion light years away and were formed when the universe was a fraction of its present age.\n\nSo how were these hotdogs formed?\n\nNASA offer quite a thorough and detailed explanation that would be fit to cure insomnia for even the lightest sleeper, but I'll condense the information.\n\nBasically they are formed when two spiral galaxies collide, creating a whirlwind of dust and stars that emits 100 trillion times the light of our sun. So it can be pretty powerful.\n\nSo what do hot dogs do?\n\nHot dogs fuse together surrounding matter at high speeds, eventually drawing nearby galaxies into a collision course with one another. With this in mind, the Milky Way and our nearest neighbour, the Andromeda galaxy (don't pretend like you never heard of it) may end up forming a hot dog in the distant future.\n\nSounds dangerous. Define 'distant future'.\n\nRachel Somerville, an astrophysicist at Rutgers University, estimates that this should not happen for another 2 billion years.\n\nAnd who are we to argue with a woman who researches this stuff for a living?\n\nI'll take her word for it. I think I still prefer the hot dogs of a food variety. Any interesting trivia about those hot dogs?\n\nWell officially, the world record for most hot dogs eaten in ten minutes is 68, held by Joey Chestnut, who has managed the feat twice. The Nathans Hot Dog Eating Contest is held annually and last year drew more than 40,000 spectators.\n\nUnofficially, the record goes to Takeru Kobayashi after he scoffed 69 hot dogs last year. He was not allowed compete in the official competition as he wouldn't sign a contract with Major League Eating, but here is the video proof of his feat. Highly impressive I think you will agree.\n\nBoth men are evenly poised with six world titles each, but a contractual dispute meant Kobayashi did not compete. Forget Pacquiao-Mayweather, Button-Hamilton or Messi-Ronaldo, Chestnut-Kobayashi is the duel people want to see."}

{"text":"A Study of Diffuse Hot Gas in NGC 3351 and NCG 4736\n\nIntroduction\n\nPrevious studies of background x-ray emission have suggested the existence of a Local Bubble of hot gas surrounding the sun. In the accepted model, the origin of this gas is largely supernovae, with some contribution from stellar winds. Supernovae create shocks which form dense shells of hot gas. Diffuse gas within these shells are heated by the shocks to temperatures of several million Kelvin. Because of the nature of its origin, we expect that diffuse x-ray emission will strongly correlate with regions of star formation. However, because of absorption, the bubbles and diffuse hot gas in our galaxy cannot be readily studied. Instead, we must study x-ray emission from nearby galaxies.\nTo study emission from diffuse gas, it is necessary to identify and remove point sources, which consist of x-ray binary star systems, supernova remnants, and background AGN. In the past, the poor angular resolution of ROSAT and Einstein made detection of point sources difficult or impossible. However, Chandra X-ray Observatory has an angular resolution of better than 1\", making it possible to identify and remove point sources.\nIn this project, we used archived Chandra data to study diffuse emission from two galaxies, NGC 3351 and NGC 4736.\n\nData\n\nNGC 3351\n\nWe obtained data from three observations, each with an exposure time of 40 ks (obs ID 5929, 5930, 5931, performed for Douglas Swartz on 8 February 2005, 8 May 2005, and 1 July 2005, respectively). For each exposure, NGC 3351 was centered on the S3 chip of Chandra's ACIS detector. The read mode was \"timed\", the data mode was \"faint\", and the focal plane temperature was -120 C.\n\nNGC 4736\n\nFor NGC 4736 we obtained data from one observation, with an exposure time of 50 ks (obs ID 808, taken on 13 May 2000 for Michael Eracleous). NGC 4736 was centered on the S3 chip of the ACIS detector. The read mode was \"timed\", the data mode was \"very faint\" and the focal plane temperature was -120 C.\n\nData Reduction\n\nTo analyze the data we used the Chandra data calibration package: CIAO 3.4, and calibration version 3.3.0. We started with the level 1 event file, which is the data file which has undergone limited processing through the Chandra pipeline.\n\nNGC 3351 Level 1 Event File\n\nNGC 4736 Level 1 Event File\n\nJust for comparison, the following are pictures of H alpha emission (an optical wavelength) from these two galaxies. I got these images from the NASA Extragalactic Database.\n\nNGC 3351 H alpha Emission\n\nNGC 4736 H alpha Emission\n\nClearly, the Level 1 X-ray data files need to be processed. The first step in cleaning up the data is to create a level 2 event file, applying the most recent instrument calibration files. We also need to filter the data to include only a certain energy range. At energies higher than about 8 keV, the detector is not accurate. We get a very increased count rate, but that data is not real. The response of the detector is also faulty at energies lower than about 0.3 keV. Knowing this, we filtered the data to include only the meaningful energy range.\nNot only must we filter over energy, we also need to filter over time. Chandra is known for having times of background flares. During these times, the count rate is much higher than average, so we can't trust the data that we get. To remove them from the data set, we extracted a light curve from a background region. This region has no source in it, so the count rate should be uniform.\n\nLightcurve from NGC 3351 Obs ID 5929\n\nIn this lightcurve, we can clearly see three spikes in the count rate, which represent the times of background flares. Once we have isolated these times, we can remove them from the data.\nThe cleaned up version of the data looks like this:\n\nNGC 3351 Level 2 Event File\n\nNGC 4736 Level 2 Event File\n\nIn NGC 3351 we notice a bright central source. This emission is coming from the central bulge of the galaxy. In NGC 4736 we can see a central bulge as well as some emission coming from the disk. However, in both images, we see several point sources. We needed to remove these sources before we could continue our analysis. To do this we used a CIAO package called wavdetect. Wavdetect finds potential point sources, and creates elliptical regions around them. However, the point source detection is not perfect; we still went through the regions that were created and used our own judgment as to whether or not the sources detected were actual point sources or simply clumps of diffuse gas. We ended up with an image that looked like this:\n\nNGC 3351\n\nAnalysis and Spectral Fitting\n\nOnce we located the point sources, we could remove them to extract spectra from the diffuse emission.\nWe needed to create instrument response files in order to extract accurate spectra. We also needed to extract spectra from the background, in order to analyze only emission from the source. Doing this, we are able to extract spectra from the bulge of NGC 3351, and spectra from the bulge and disk of NGC 4736.\n\nWe used a CIAO package called Sherpa to display and fit the spectra. The fits for NGC 3351 contain a powerlaw, two thermal components and a Gaussian. The Gaussian was used to fit the emission line which can be seen on the right. The power law fits the spectra from any unresolved point sources, like low mass X-ray binaries, which were not removed. Although Chandra resolution is good, it is still impossible to identify all of the point sources.\n\nApart from the power law and Gaussian, we fit two thermal components to the spectra. These components find the temperature of the hot gas (or rather, they find kT for each component). In fitting two thermals, we assumed that the hot gas is only at two different temperatures. This is clearly not physically accurate- the gas in the galaxies should be at a continuum of temperatures. However, it is impossible to fit a thermal continuum to the spectra, because we do not know much about the physical parameters of the gas, such as pressure and density. Without this a priori knowledge, we cannot find a continuum of temperatures. We chose to fit two thermal components because this gives a better fit than fitting only one component. However, fitting three does not drastically change the statistical accuracy. For NGC 3351, we had three different data sets. We fit all three of these independently, and found that the results were consistent between them. Moreover, the statistical values of the three fits were 24.6, 24.5, and 38.6, with 38, 40, and 45 degrees of freedom, respectively. So we can be fairly confident that the kT's for the two thermal components are 0.28 and 0.77 keV. We also found an average flux of 1.01e-13 ergs\/cm^2\/s from the bulge of NGC 3351.\n\nNGC 3351 ObsID 5929\n\nNGC 3351 ObsID 5930\n\nNGC 3351 ObsID 5931\n\nThe fits for the bulge and disk of NGC 4736 were a little more difficult than those for NGC 3351. In the disk of NGC 4736, the data was not very accurately fit by two thermal components and a power law. We attempted several different combinations of two power laws and three thermal components, but all of the fits had approximately the same statistical error. More analysis should be done to truly determine the components of the spectra for the disk of NGC 4736. However, the bulge of NGC 4736 was fit seemingly accurately by a power law and two thermal components. So, we were able to say with some confidence that the bulge contained two thermal components with kT's of 0.39 and 0.71 keV. However, more analysis must be done to compare the thermal emission from the disk with these results. We also found the flux of the bulge of NGC 4736 to be 2.44e-13 ergs\/cm^2\/s.\n\nNGC 4736 Bulge emission\n\nNGC 4736 Disk emission\n\nCalculations\n\nKnowing the temperature and flux of the diffuse emission from each galaxy, we can calculate the emission measure, electron density, and pressure of the gas, using these formulas:\n\nEM=2.75(I\/R)(T\/10^4)^0.9\n\nIn this equation, I is the intensity in Raleighs, and T is the temperature of the gas in Kelvin. This formula applied to emission from the H alpha line, but we used it here as a first approximation for our data.\n\nn(e)=(EM\/(fh))^0.5\n\nHere, f is the filling factor, and h is the path length. For the purpose of our calculations, we assumed a filling factor of 1 and a path length of 200pc. In actuality, gas at two different temperatures should not have the same path length, but at high temperatures the filling factor can be approximated as 1.\n\nP\/k=2Tn(e)\n\nIn this equation, k is Boltzmann's constant.\n\nResults for NGC 3351\n\nat 0.28 keV:\n\nT=3.25 million Kelvin\nEM=19.7\nne=0.313\nP\/k=2.0e6\n\nat 0.77 keV:\n\nT=8.94 million Kelvin\nEM=49.0\nne=0.495\nP\/k=8.8e6\n\nResults for NGC 4736\n\nat 0.39 keV:\n\nT=4.53 million Kelvin\nEM=145.2\nne=0.85\nP\/k=7.7e6\n\nat 0.71 keV:\n\nT=8.24 million Kelvin\nEM=248.9\nne=1.12\nP\/k=18.4e6\n\nSo What?\n\nThis summer I was able to explore some of the properties of the diffuse hot gas in NGC 3351 and NGC 4736, but the project does not end here. As with any research, there is still a lot that can be done. For instance, it would be very beneficial to find temperature gradients in each galaxy. I could do this by extracting spectra from annular regions, starting at the center of the galaxy. With this, we would be able to plot temperature as a function of radius, which could give more insight into the conditions of the diffuse gas.\nAlso, we could verify the assumption that the diffuse X-ray emission follows regions of star formation. To do this, we would need to obtain H alpha optical data, and improve the astrometry of our X-ray data in order to compare the two.\nApart from these things, it would be very helpful to do more calculations with the data that we have. For example, we need to calculate cooling times for the gas. The diffuse gas should expand and cool, and this process could affect its fate. Ultimately, we wish to determine whether or not the gas has enough energy and pressure to escape the bulge of the galaxy. However, to come to this result, a more rigorous analysis must be done."}

Hot, young stars are forming from the gas and dust inside the interstellar cloud.\n\n\"The gas in the clouds of NGC 6559, mainly hydrogen, is the raw material for star formation,\" ESO officials wrote in a statement \"When a region inside this nebula gathers enough matter, it starts to collapse under its own gravity. The center of the cloud grows ever denser and hotter, until thermonuclear fusion begins and a star is born. The hydrogen atoms combine to form helium atoms, releasing energy that makes the star shine.\"\n\nThe two colors of the cloud represent a pair of nebulas. Once the young stars are born, they \"energize\" the hydrogen surrounding them, ESO officials said. The gas then creates the red wispy cloud \u2014 known to astronomers as an \"emission nebula\" \u2014 in the center of the image.\n\nThe blue section of the photo \u2014 representing a \"reflection nebula\" \u2014 shows light from the newly formed stars in the cosmic nursery being reflected in all directions by the particles of dust made of iron, carbon, silicon and other elements in the interstellar cloud.\n\nThe new photo of this star-forming region of the universe also hides other celestial surprises.\n\n\"In regions where it is very dense, the dust completely blocks the light behind it, as is the case for the dark isolated patches and sinuous lanes to the bottom left-hand side and right-hand side of the image,\" ESO officials wrote.\n\nAstronomers used the 5-foot (1.54 meters) Danish Telescope at the La Silla Observatory in Chile to image the interstellar cloud.\n\nFifteen countries make up the European Southern Observatory project. It is considered the most productive ground-based astronomical observatory in the world, officials said."}

{"text":"Forget what you thought the Milky Way looked like. The galaxy is\nfar from the simple and elegant spiral-armed structure so often\nportrayed. New observations, presented today at the 212th meeting\nof the American Astronomical Society in St. Louis, Missouri,\nreveal, among other things, that the Milky Way is missing two of\nthe four spiral arms it was thought to have. The findings should\nforce a significant rethinking about how the Milky Way evolved and\nhow its stars formed.\n\nMapping the Milky Way is extremely difficult. William Herschel\nfirst tried it in 1765 by counting stars with his small optical\ntelescope. But even with improved modern instruments, astronomers\nhave faced several challenges. For starters, our solar system sits\non the Milky Way's outskirts, along a branch of one of the spiral\narms, so there isn't a panoramic view of the main structure. In\naddition, our vantage point is obscured by many stars and large\nclouds of interstellar dust.\n\nNow two teams have pierced that veil with unprecedented clarity.\nOne team used the Spitzer Space Telescope, which can see through\ndust, to chart the positions and orbital speeds of more than 110\nmillion stars. They discovered a big surprise: Two of the galaxy's\nfour spiral arms are actually just small side-branches. On the\nother hand, the central bar of the galaxy turns out to be nearly\ntwice as big as previously thought, Spitzer team member Robert\nBenjamin of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, said at a\nteleconference today.\n\nMeanwhile, another team probed the galaxy with the Very Long\nBaseline Array, which comprises a telescope of such power that you\ncould use it to read a newspaper on the moon. They have learned\nthat many young stars in the spiral arms orbit the galactic center\nslower than calculations suggest. Analyses of their motions reveal\nwhat happened: The stars were born when gravity compressed\ninterstellar gas clouds. The new stars got kicked out of the\ncircular orbit of their parent clouds and into more elliptical\npaths.\n\n\"The new data give a much, much better picture of what's going\non,\" says theoretical astrophysicist Avi Loeb, of the\nHarvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge,\nMassachusetts, who was not involved in the survey.

Discovering more of these lenses will allow astronomers to determine the masses of quasars' host galaxies. CREDIT: F. Courbin\/S. G. Djorgovski\/G. Meylan\/Caltech\/EPFL\/WMKO\n\nA giant black hole spouting energy from inside a galaxy is\nacting like a cosmic magnifying glass, giving astronomers a clear view of an even\nmore distant galaxy behind it.\n\nIt is the first time a quasar ? the central region of a\ngalaxy dominated by an energy-spewing\nblack hole ? has been discovered acting as a gravitational\nlens. The cosmic lens phenomenon was first predicted by Albert Einstein's theory\nof general relativity.\n\nThe discovery gives astronomers a glimpse at two galaxies at\nonce, allowing researchers to photograph the distant object while weighing and\nmeasuring the intervening galaxy and the bright powerhouse at its core.\n\nThe quasar is known as SDSS J0013+1523 and located about 1.6\nbillion light-years from Earth.\n\nWarped space-time\n\nAccording to the theory, very large masses warp the\nspace-time around them, even causing light to bend as it travels through the\nregion. Thus, light from faraway\nobjects sometimes can be magnified by the bent space-time to provide a\nlarger and brighter ? though also distorted and curved ? view.\n\nIn this case, scientists are more interested in studying the\nlens itself than the magnified image.\n\nGalaxies that host quasars are hard to study because their\nlight is often overpowered by the blaring radiation from material falling onto\nthe supermassive\nblack holes in their centers. A single quasar can be 1,000 times brighter\nthan an entire galaxy of 100 billion stars.\n\n\"It is a bit like staring into bright car headlights\nand trying to discern the color of their rims,\" lead researcher Fr?d?ric\nCourbin of the Ecole Polytechnique F?d?rale de Lausanne in Switzerland said in\na statement. By studying the way a quasar magnifies light as a gravitational\nlens, he said, \"we now can measure the masses of these quasar host\ngalaxies and overcome this difficulty.\"\n\nWeighing quasars\n\nThe newfound lens, and similar ones being sought by researchers,\ncould provide an opportunity to learn about the galaxies that shelter quasars\nin their centers.\n\nBy studying the way the quasar magnifies the distant light ?\nincluding the shape of its distortion and the number of magnified images the\nlens produces ? scientists can measure how matter is distributed in the lens\ngalaxy. They can even calculate the total matter of the quasar and its host\ngalaxy.\n\nOften quasars\nare discovered when their light is being magnified by an intervening galaxy\nacting as a gravitational lens. Scientists set out to look for a case of this\nreverse lensing of a galaxy's light by a quasar by looking through the data\nobtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ? a detailed map of a quarter of the\nsky.\n\nIt was through that study that researchers found the quasar SDSS\nJ0013+1523 acting as a cosmic lens.\n\n\"We were delighted to see that this idea actually\nworks,\" said Georges Meylan, a professor of physics at Ecole Polytechnique\nF?d?rale de Lausanne.\"This discovery demonstrates the continued utility of\ngravitational lensing as an astrophysical tool.\"\n\nThe researchers published their findings July 20 in the\njournal Astronomy & Astrophysics."}
{"text":"New evidence from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory suggests that a\nknown pulsar is the present-day counterpart to a supernova that exploded\nin 386 AD, a stellar explosion witnessed by Chinese astronomers. If\nconfirmed, this will be only the second known pulsar to be clearly associated\nwith a historic event.\n\nIn roughly the past 2,000 years, less than 10 reports of probable supernovae\nhave been archived, mostly by Asian astronomers. Until now, the Crab Nebula\nhas been the only pulsar whose birth is associated with a historic event, the\nsupernova of 1054 AD, making it the only neutron star with a firm age.\n\n\"Determining the true ages of astronomical objects is notoriously difficult,\"\nsaid Victoria Kaspi of the McGill University, Montreal, Canada, \"and for this\nreason, historical records of supernova are of great importance.\"\n\nThese results were presented today by Kaspi and Mallory Roberts, also of McGill\nUniversity, at the American Astronomical Society meeting in San Diego, Calif.\nAlso participating in the research were Gautum Vasisht from NASA's Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory, Pasadena, Calif.; Eric Gotthelf from Columbia University, New York\nCity; Michael Pivovaroff from Thermawave, Inc., Fremont, Calif.; and Nobuyuki\nKawai from the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, Japan.\n\nScientists used Chandra to locate the pulsar exactly at\nthe geometric center of the supernova remnant known as G11.2-0.3. This location\nprovides very strong evidence that the pulsar, a neutron star spinning 14 times\nper second, was formed in the supernova of 386 AD, making it 1,615 years old.\n\nSince pulsars move rapidly once they are formed, Chandra's\nability to pinpoint the pulsar at the remnant's center implies the system must\nbe very young. \"We believe that the pulsar and the supernova remnant G11.2-0.3\nare both likely to be left over from the explosion seen by the Chinese observers\nover 1,600 years ago,\" said Roberts. \"While this is exciting by itself, it also\nraises new questions about what we know about pulsars, especially during their\ninfancies.\"\n\nThese questions arose when the research team of the Japanese\nAdvanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA) applied the present\nspin rate to current models to determine the pulsar's estimated lifetime and\ncompared it to the age of G11.2-0.3. The result was an age of roughly 24,000\nyears -- far predating the birth year of 386 AD. To explain this contradiction,\nthe Chandra team argues that this pulsar may have had\n\nApproximately the same spin rate today as it did at its\nbirth. If true, this could have important implications for conventional wisdom\nregarding pulsars, which may be spinning more slowly than previously thought.\n\nBetween mid-April and mid-May in the year 386 AD, the sudden\nappearance of a new star, presumably a supernova, was recorded by Chinese observers\nin the direction of the sky now known as the constellation of Sagittarius. In\nthe 1970s, radio astronomers discovered an expanding nebula of gas and high-energy\nparticles, called G11.2-0.3, believed to be the remnant of that explosion. In\n1997, a team of X-ray astronomers used ASCA to discover a pulsar in the same\narea of the sky.\n\nChandra observed G11.2-0.3 with the Advanced CCD Imaging\nSpectrometer at two points in time: Aug. 6, 2000, and Oct. 15, 2000, for approximately\n20,000 and 15,000 seconds respectively.\n\nNASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.,\nmanages the Chandra program.

{"text":"Herbig-Haro objects are small patches of nebulosity associated with newly-born stars, and are formed when gas ejected by young stars collides with clouds of gas and dust nearby at speeds of several hundred kilometres per second. Herbig-Haro objects are ubiquitous in star-forming regions, and several are often seen around a single star, aligned along its rotational axis.\n\nHH objects are transient phenomena, lasting only a few thousand years at most. They can evolve visibly over quite short timescales as they move rapidly away from their parent star into the gas clouds in interstellar space (the interstellar medium or ISM). Hubble Space Telescope observations reveal complex evolution of HH objects over a few years, as parts of them fade while others brighten as they collide with clumpy material in the interstellar medium.\n\nThe objects were first observed in the late 19th century by Sherburne Wesley Burnham, but were not recognised as being a distinct type of emission nebula until the 1940s. The first astronomers to study them in detail were George Herbig and Guillermo Haro, after whom they have been named. Herbig and Haro were working independently on studies of star formation when they first analysed Herbig-Haro objects, and recognised that they were a by-product of the star formation process.\n\nDiscovery and history of observations\n\nThe first Herbig-Haro object was observed in the late 19th century by Burnham, when he looked at the star T Tauri with the 36-inch refracting telescope at Lick Observatory and noted a small patch of nebulosity nearby. However, it was catalogued merely as an emission nebula, later becoming known as Burnham's Nebula, and was not recognised as a distinct class of object. However, T Tauri was found to be a very young and variable star, and is the prototype of the class of similar objects known as T Tauri stars which have yet to reach a state of hydrostatic equilibrium between gravitational collapse and energy generation through nuclear fusion at their centres.\n\nFifty years after Burnham's discovery, several similar nebulae were discovered which were so small as to be almost star-like in appearance. Both Haro and Herbig made independent observations of several of these objects during the 1940s. Herbig also looked at Burnham's Nebula and found that it displayed an unusual electromagnetic spectrum, with prominent emission lines of hydrogen, sulphur and oxygen. Haro found that all the objects of this type were invisible in infrared light.\n\nFollowing their independent discoveries, Herbig and Haro met at an astronomy conference in Tucson, Arizona. Herbig had initially paid little attention to the objects he had discovered, being primarily concerned with the nearby stars, but on hearing Haro's findings he carried out more detailed studies of them. The Soviet astronomer Viktor Ambartsumian gave the objects their name, and based on their occurrence near young stars (a few hundred thousand years old), suggested that they might represent an early stage in the formation of T Tauri stars.\n\nStudies showed that HH objects were highly ionised, and early theorists speculated that they might contain low-luminosity hot stars. However, the absence of infrared radiation from the nebulae meant there could not be stars within them, as these would have emitted abundant infrared light. Later studies suggested that the nebulae might contain protostars, but eventually HH objects came to be understood as material ejected by nearby young stars, and colliding at supersonic speeds with the interstellar medium (ISM), with the resulting shock waves generating visible light [1].\n\nIn the early 1980s, observations revealed for the first time the jet-like nature of most HH objects. This led to the understanding that the material ejected to form HH objects is highly collimated (concentrated into narrow jets). Stars are often surrounded by accretion disks in their first few hundred thousand years of existence, which form as gas falls onto them, and the rapid rotation of the inner parts of these disks leads to the emission of narrow jets of partially ionizedplasma perpendicular to the disk, known as polar jets. When these jets collide with the interstellar medium, they give rise to the small patches of bright emission which comprise HH objects [2].\n\nPhysical characteristics\n\nHH objects HH1 and HH2 lie about a light year apart, symmetrically opposite a young star which is ejecting material along its polar axis\n\nEmission from HH objects is caused by shock waves when they collide with the interstellar medium, but their motions are complicated. Spectroscopic observations of their doppler shifts indicate velocities of several hundred kilometres per second, but the emission lines in the spectra of HH objects are too weak to have been formed in such high speed collisions. This probably means that some of the material they are colliding with is also moving outwards, although at a slower speed [3].\n\nThe total mass being ejected to form typical HH objects is estimated to be of the order of 1\u201320 Earth-masses, a very small amount of material compared to the mass of the stars themselves [4]. The temperatures observed in HH objects are typically about 8000\u201312,000 K, similar to those found in other ionized nebulae such as H II regions and planetary nebulae. They tend to be quite dense, with densities ranging from a few thousand to a few tens of thousands of particles per cm\u00b3, compared to generally less than 1000\/cm\u00b3 in H II regions and planetary nebulae [5]. HH objects consist mostly of hydrogen and helium, which account for about 75% and 25% respectively of their mass. Less than 1% of the mass of HH objects is made up of heavier chemical elements, and the abundances of these are generally similar to those measured in nearby young stars[4].\n\nNear to the source star, about 20\u201330% of the gas in HH objects is ionised, but this proportion decreases at increasing distances. This implies that the material is ionised in the polar jet, and recombines as it moves away from the star, rather than being ionised by later collisions. Shocking at the end of the jet can re-ionise some material, however, giving rise to bright \"caps\" at the ends of the jets.\n\nNumbers and distribution\n\nOver 400 individual HH objects or groups are now known. They are ubiquitous in star-forming H II regions, and are often found in large groups. They are typically observed near Bok globules (dark nebulae which contain very young stars) and often emanate from them. Frequently, several HH objects are seen near a single energy source, forming a string of objects along the line of the polar axis of the parent star.\n\nThe number of known HH objects has increased rapidly over the last few years, but is still thought to be a very small proportion of the total number existing in our galaxy. Estimates suggest that up to 150,000 exist [6], the vast majority of which are too far away to be resolved with current technological capabilities. Most HH objects lie within 0.5 parsecs of their parent star, with very few found more than 1 pc away. However, some are seen several parsecs away, perhaps implying that the interstellar medium is not very dense in their vicinity, allowing them to travel further from their source before dispersing.\n\nProper motions and variability\n\nImages taken over five years reveal the motion of material in HH object HH47. view detail.\n\nSpectroscopic observations of HH objects show that they are moving away from the source stars at speeds of 100 to 1000 km\/s. In recent years, the high optical resolution of Hubble Space Telescope observations has revealed the proper motion of many HH objects in observations spaced several years apart. These observations have also allowed estimates of the distances of some HH objects via the expansion parallax method.\n\nAs they move away from the parent star, HH objects evolve significantly, varying in brightness on timescales of a few years. Individual knots within an object may brighten and fade or disappear entirely, while new knots have been seen to appear. As well as changes caused by interactions with the ISM, interactions between jets moving at different speeds within HH objects also cause variations.\n\nThe eruption of jets from the parent stars occurs in pulses rather than as a steady stream. The pulses may produce jets of gas moving in the same direction but at different speeds, and interactions between different jets create so-called \"working surfaces\", where streams of gases collide and generate shock waves.\n\nSource stars\n\nHerbig-Haro object HH32 is one of the brightest HH objects\n\nThe stars which are behind the creation of Herbig-Haro objects are all very young stars, the youngest of which are still protostars in the process of forming from the surrounding gases. Astronomers divide these stars into classes 0, I, II and III, according to how much infrared radiation the stars give off [7]. A greater amount of infrared radiation implies a larger amount of cooler material surrounding the star, which indicates that it is still coalescing. The numbering of the classes arises because class 0 objects (the youngest) were not discovered until classes I, II and III had already been defined.\n\nClass 0 objects are only a few thousand years old, so young that they are not yet undergoing nuclear fusion reactions at their centres. Instead, they are powered only by the gravitational potential energy released as material falls onto them [8]. Nuclear fusion has begun in the cores of Class I objects, but gas and dust are still falling onto their surfaces from the surrounding nebula. They are generally still shrouded in dense clouds of dust and gas, which obscure all their visible light and mean that they can only be observed at infrared and radio wavelengths. Infall of gas and dust has largely finished in Class II objects, but they are still surrounded by disks of dust and gas, while class III objects have only trace remnants of their original accretion disk.\n\nStudies have shown that about 80% of the stars giving rise to HH objects are in fact binary or multiple systems (two or more stars orbiting each other), which is a much higher proportion than that found for low mass stars on the main sequence. This may indicate that binary systems are more likely to generate the jets which give rise to HH objects, and evidence suggests that the largest HH outflows might be formed when multiple systems disintegrate. It is thought that most stars form as multiple systems, but that a sizable fraction are disrupted before they reach the main sequence, by gravitational interactions with nearby stars and dense clouds of gas [9].\n\nInfrared counterparts\n\nHerbig-Haro (HH) objects associated with very young stars or very massive protostars are often hidden from view at optical wavelengths by the cloud of gas and dust from which they form. This surrounding natal material can produce tens or even hundreds of magnitudes of extinction at optical wavelengths. Such deeply embedded objects can only be observed at infrared or radio wavelengths [10], usually in the light of hot molecular hydrogen or warm carbon monoxide emission.\n\nIn recent years, infrared images have revealed dozens of examples of \"infrared HH objects\". Most look like bow waves (similar to the waves at the head of a sailing ship), and so are usually referred to as molecular \"bow shocks\". Like HH objects, these supersonic shocks are driven by collimated jets from the two poles of a protostar. They sweep up or \"entrain\" the surrounding dense molecular gas to form a continuous flow of material, which is referred to as a Bipolar outflow. Infrared bow shocks travel at hundreds of kilometers per second, heating gas to hundreds or even thousands of degrees. Because they are associated with the youngest stars, where accretion is particularly strong, infrared bow shocks are usually associated with more powerful jets than their optical HH cousins.\n\nThe physics of infrared bow shocks can be understood in much the same way as that of HH objects, since these objects are essentially the same - it is only the conditions in the jet and surrounding cloud that are different, causing infrared emission from molecules rather than optical emission from atoms and ions [11].\n\nSee also\n\nnebula (from Latin: \"mist\" [1] ; pl. nebulae or nebul\u00e6, with ligature) is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen gas and plasma.

{"text":"Science News\n\nHubble Sees a Spiral Within a Spiral\n\nMay 28, 2012 \u2014 NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured a new image of the spiral galaxy known as ESO 498-G5. One interesting feature of this galaxy is that its spiral arms wind all the way into the center, so that ESO 498-G5's core looks like a bit like a miniature spiral galaxy. This sort of structure is in contrast to the elliptical star-filled centers (or bulges) of many other spiral galaxies, which instead appear as glowing masses.\n\nShare This:\n\nAstronomers refer to the distinctive spiral-like bulge of galaxies such as ESO 498-G5 as disc-type bulges, or pseudobulges, while bright elliptical centers are called classical bulges. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, which does not have to contend with the distorting effects of Earth's atmosphere, have helped to reveal that these two different types of galactic centers exist. These observations have also shown that star formation is still going on in disc-type bulges and has ceased in classical bulges. This means that galaxies can be a bit like Russian matryoshka dolls: classical bulges look much like a miniature version of an elliptical galaxy, embedded in the center of a spiral, while disc-type bulges look like a second, smaller spiral galaxy located at the heart of the first -- a spiral within a spiral.\n\nThe similarities between types of galaxy bulge and types of galaxy go beyond their appearance. Just like giant elliptical galaxies, the classical bulges consist of great swarms of stars moving about in random orbits. Conversely, the structure and movement of stars within disc-type bulges mirror the spiral arms arrayed in a galaxy's disc. These differences suggest different origins for the two types of bulges: while classical bulges are thought to develop through major events, such as mergers with other galaxies, disc-type bulges evolve gradually, developing their spiral pattern as stars and gas migrate to the galaxy's center.\n\nESO 498-G5 is located around 100 million light-years away in the constellation of Pyxis (The Compass). This image is made up of exposures in visible and infrared light taken by Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys. The field of view is approximately 3.3 by 1.6 arcminutes."}

Image credit Chandra.\n\nThe Cat's Eye nebula, also known as NGC 6543, is a planetary nebula in the Draco constellation and is about 3300 light years from Earth. It is one of the most complex nebulae known. High resolution observations from the Hubble space telescope reveal remarkable structures like knots, jets, bubbles and sinewy arc features. At the center of the nebula there is a bright, hot star. Around 1000 years ago, this star lost its outer envelope and produced the nebula.\n\nThe Cat's Eye nebula was discovered in mid-February, 1786 by William Herschel. Also, it was the first nebula whose spectrum was explored by an amateur astronomer named William Huggins. The results of his investigation proved that planetary nebulae consist of hot gases, but not stars. Currently, nebula have been observed across the full electromagnetic spectrum, from far infrared to X-rays. Modern studies have revealed several mysteries about the nebula. The intricate structure may have been caused by materiel from a central binary star, but there is no concrete evidence of the companion star. Hubble Telescope observations revealed a number of faint rings around the Cat's Eye. These rings are spherical shells ejected by the central star in the distant past. No one seems to be able to figure out the mechanism of those past ejections.\n\nThe Cat's Eye nebula is a well-studied planetary nebula. It is fairly bright with a magnitude of 8.1. It has a high surface brightness. The constellation is situated at right ascension 17h 58 m 33.4 s and declination +66\u00b037'59?. The Eye's high declination means it is easily observable from the Northern Hemisphere. NGC 6543 is almost exactly in the direction of the North Ecliptic Pole. The bright inner nebula itself is rather small. The major axis of the inner ellipse is 16.1 arcseconds. The distance between the condensations is 24.7 arcseconds. It has an extended halo of matter that the creating star ejected during its red giant phase. This halo extends over a diameter of about 5 arcminutes. The Cat's Eye really covers a nice chunk of the galaxy.\n\nThe central star of the Cat's Eye nebula is a WR type star. It has a temperature of approximately 80,000 degree kelvin. It is approximately 10,000 times as luminous as our Sun and its radius is about 0.65 times that of Sol. Spectroscopic analysis shows that the star is currently losing mass in a fast stellar wind at a rate of about about 20 trillion tons per second. The velocity of this wind is about 1900 km\/s. Calculations indicate that the central star currently weighs just over one solar mass, but theoretical calculations show that it may have had an initial mass of five solar masses."}

It was produced by combining exposures through six different filters from the Wide Field Imager (WFI), attached to the 2.2 m ESO\/MPG telescope at ESO's La Silla Observatory, in Chile.\n\nThe Carina Nebula is located about 7500 light-years away in the constellation of the same name (Carina; the Keel). Spanning about 100 light-years, it is four times larger than the famous Orion Nebula and far brighter. It is an intensive star-forming region with dark lanes of cool dust splitting up the glowing nebula gas that surrounds its many clusters of stars.\n\nThe glow of the Carina Nebula comes mainly from hot hydrogen basking in the strong radiation of monster baby stars. The interaction between the hydrogen and the ultraviolet light results in its characteristic red and purple colour. The immense nebula contains over a dozen stars with at least 50 to 100 times the mass of our Sun. Such stars have a very short lifespan, a few million years at most, the blink of an eye compared with the Sun's expected lifetime of ten billion years.\n\nOne of the Universe's most impressive stars, Eta Carinae, is found in the nebula. It is one of the most massive stars in our Milky Way, over 100 times the mass of the Sun and about four million times brighter, making it the most luminous star known. Eta Carinae is highly unstable, and prone to violent outbursts, most notably the false supernova event in 1842.\n\nFor just a few years, Eta Carinae became the second brightest star in the night sky and produced almost as much visible light as a supernova explosion (the usual death throes of a massive star), but it survived. Eta Carinae is also thought to have a hot companion that orbits around it in 5.54 years, in an elliptical orbit. Both stars have strong winds, which collide, leading to interesting phenomena.\n\nIn mid-January 2009, the companion was at its closest distance to Eta Carinae. This event, which may provide a unique insight into the wind structure of the massive stars, has been followed by a flotilla of instruments on several of ESO's telescopesour-composite image of the Carina Nebula, revealing exquisite details in the stars and dust of the region. Several well known astronomical objects can be seen in this wide field image: to the bottom left of the image is one of the most impressive binary stars in the Universe, Eta Carinae, with the famous Keyhole Nebula just adjacent to the star. The collection of very bright, young stars above and to the right of Eta Carinae is the open star cluster Trumpler 14. A second open star cluster, Collinder 228 is also seen in the image, just below Eta Carinae. North is up and East is to the left. The field of view is 0.55 x 0.55 degrees, covering a 144 x 144 light-year region at the distance of the nebula. (Credit: Image courtesy of European Southern Observatory - ESO)"}

{"text":"The universe is constantly being created\u2014and destroyed. It hides nothing. You've seen these colorful, wondrous images of galaxies, nebulae and supernovas before but have you ever wondered how these images are collected? Here's some truth about the process with the most-ess.\n\nFirst of all, a little history to put things in perspective. The first full photograph of planet Earth wasn't captured until 1972, when the Apollo 17 crew left Earth en-route to the moon on December 7th. Since the moon was behind them, they had a perfectly lit view of, well, us! And this photograph was taken so that we can marvel at, well, ourselves!\n\nThe leading photograph shown above is of Spiral Galaxy NGC 3982. To achieve this image as we see it, there's first over 1400 screen captures taken, one every 10 seconds, from the Hubble telescope over the course of 3 weeks. This amounts to 10 hours of processing, beginning with black and white images from 3 Hubble cameras.\n\n\"Creating color images out of the original black-and-white exposures is equal parts art and science\" - hubblesite.org\n\nHubble doesn't use film, it's cameras record light from the universe with special electronic detectors. Finished color images, as we see them, are actually combinations of two or more black and white exposures to which color has been added during images processing. So, not to shatter any or all illusion, but these colorful and dazzling images are not exactly what we would see in outer space with our own eyes. Hubble can detect all the visible wavelengths of light plus many more that are invisible to human eyes, such as ultraviolet and infrared light.\n\nThe images, in order, are Spiral Galaxy NGC 3982 (I personally would have called it something cooler), The Crab Nebula, The Eskimo Nebula, The Helix Nebula, an old star giving up the ghost, The Eagle Nebula, and the last two are the great Carina Nebula."}

The winding spiral\narms of this gorgeous island universe are loaded with luminous young star clusters and dark dust lanes.\n\nIt is comparatively bright and can be seen well in moderate-sized telescopes.\n\nNGC 3621 is flat and pancake-shaped.\n\nApparently, it hasn\u00edt yet experienced a galactic collision with another galaxy.\n\nMerging with other galaxy would have disturbed the thin disc of stars.\n\nOver time, this should create a bulge in the galaxy's center.\n\nThis galaxy is of further interest to astronomers because its relative proximity allows them to study a wide range of\nastronomical objects within it, and use some of its brighter stars as standard candles to establish important estimates\nof extragalactic distances and the scale of the Universe.\n\nPreviously, astronomers thought, that bulgeless galaxies should not be able to host an Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).\nAnd yet, several observations of AGN in bulgeless galaxies currently indicate that a classical bulge is not a requirement\nfor a nuclear black hole.\n\nToday, they know much more about NGC 3621 and other flat galaxies.\n\nNGC 3621 - is a galaxy full of surprises. It is bulgeless but has three central black holes. Credits: ESO\n\nAccording to data gathered by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, which observed this \"slender galaxy with robust black hole\",\nNGC 3621 has a feeding, supermassive black hole lurking within it, a surprise considering that astronomers thought\nthis particular class of super-thin galaxies lacked large black holes.\n\nAnother interesting feature is that there are also thought to be two smaller black holes, with masses of a few\nthousand times that of the Sun, near the nucleus of the galaxy.\n\nTherefore, NGC 3621 is an extremely interesting object which, despite not having a central bulge, has a system of three\nblack holes in its central region.\n\nNGC 4395 is about 55 thousand light years across\n\nThe results of the observations challenge current theories, which hold that supermassive black holes require the bulbous\ncentral bulges that poke out from many spiral galaxies to form and grow.\n\nNGC 3621 is the second disk galaxy without any bulge found to harbor a supermassive black hole.\nAnother bulgeless galaxy named NGC 4395, was found much earlier in 2003. It is the least luminous galaxy located some\n14 million light-years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Canes Venatici (The Hunting Dogs).\n\nIt is essentially flat and has no central bulge, but it harbors the smallest known central black hole as estimated by\na group led by astronomers from Ohio State University and the Technion Institute of Technology who have\nmeasured the mass of this unique black hole.\n\nEarly results indicate that the black hole weighs in at less than a million times the mass of our sun \u0116 which would make\nit as much as 100 times smaller than others of its type.\n\nGalactic black holes typically weight in at a million to a billion solar masses. NGC 4395's black hole is only 300,000 to 400,000\nsolar masses.\n\nA series of observations conducted by astronomers using Chandra X-ray Observatory\nprovide more confirmation for the presence of an AGN in this galaxy, adding to the growing evidence that black holes do\nform and grow in isolated bulgeless disk galaxies.\n\nAstronomers have also used Spitzer to find six other mega black holes in thin spirals with only minimal bulges.\nTogether, the findings indicate that, for a galaxy, supermassive black holes are not associated exclusively with bulges conclusion the discovery had shattered his world view."}

(Ned) Wright, a UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and the mission's principal investigator, who began working on the mission in 1998.\n\nA 10-foot unmanned satellite weighing 1,400 pounds, WISE was launched into space on Dec. 14, 2009, and mapped the sky in 2010. Like a powerful set of night-vision goggles, WISE surveyed the cosmos with infrared detectors about 300 times more sensitive than those used in previous survey missions, said Wright, who holds UCLA's David Saxon Presidential Chair in Physics. WISE collected 15 trillion bytes of data and more than 2.7 million images taken at four infrared wavelengths of light \u2014 invisible to the unaided human eye \u2014 capturing everything from nearby asteroids to distant galaxies.\n\nThe individual WISE exposures have been combined into an atlas of more than 18,000 images and a catalog listing the infrared properties of more than 560 million objects found in the images. Most of the objects are stars and galaxies, with roughly equal numbers of each; many of them have never been seen before.\n\nWISE observations have already led to many discoveries, including elusive failed stars, or Y-dwarfs. Astronomers had been hunting for Y-dwarfs for more than a decade. Because they have been cooling since their formation, they do not shine in visible light and could not be spotted until WISE mapped the sky with its infrared vision. WISE has also found that there are significantly fewer mid-size near-Earth asteroids than astronomers had previously feared. With this data, now more than 90 percent of the largest of the asteroids have been identified.\n\nOne image released today (see the online version of this news release) shows a surprising view of an \"echo\" of infrared light surrounding an exploded star. The echo was etched in the clouds when a flash of light from the supernova explosion heated surrounding clouds. More discoveries are expected now that astronomers have access to the WISE images.\n\nIn another image (also posted with the online version of this news release), moving objects such as asteroids and comets were removed, but residuals of the planets Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars are visible in this image as bright red spots off the plane of the galaxy at the 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock and 7 o'clock positions, respectively.\n\n\"With the release of the all-sky catalog and atlas, WISE joins the pantheon of great sky surveys that have led to so many remarkable discoveries about the universe,\" said Roc Cutri, who leads the WISE data processing and archiving effort at the Infrared and Processing Analysis Center at the California Institute of Technology."}

Spiral galaxies are represented by the letter S and are divided into four subgroups. These are S0, Sa, Sb, and Sc. S0 galaxies have a bright nucleus but have no spiral arms. Sa galaxies have spiral arms that are wound tightly around the nucleus while the arms of Sc galaxies are wound much more loosely.\n\nBarred Spiral Galaxy - A barred spiral galaxy is very similar to a spiral with one important difference. The arms spiral out from a straight bar of stars instead of from the center. About one third of all spiral galaxies are barred spiral in shape. Barred spiral galaxies are represented by the letters SB and are arranges into three subgroups according to the openness of the arms. These subgroups are labeled DBa, SBb, and SBc. SBa galaxies have a short bar of stars extending from the center while SBc galaxies have a long, well-defined bar.\n\nElliptical Galaxy - Elliptical galaxies vary in shape from completely round to extremely elongated ovals. Unlike spiral galaxies, they have no bright nucleus at their center. Elliptical galaxies are represented by the letter E and are divided into seven subgroups according to their shape. These subgroups are labeled E0 to E7. E0 galaxies nearly circular in shape while E7 galaxies are extremely elongated or stretched out.\n\nIrregular Galaxy - A fourth type of galaxy is known as the irregular galaxy. These galaxies have no discernable shape or structure. Irregular galaxies are divided into two classes, Im and IO. Im class galaxies are the most common and show just a hint of structure. Sometimes the faint remnants of spiral arms can be seen. IO class galaxies are completely chaotic in form. The large and small Magellanic Clouds are examples of Im class irregular galaxies."}

{"text":"The most massive black hole in the universe tips the cosmic scales at 18 billion times more massive than the sun, astronomers suggest today at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society. Even though researchers suggested black holes up to this mass might exist in quasars, this is the first direct confirmation of such a behemoth. The hefty gravity well is six times more massive than the previous record and is orbited by a smaller black hole, which allowed the measurement of the giant's mass."}
{"text":"'Point of no return' found\n\nPeering to the edge of a black hole\n\nHarvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics\n\nTuesday, October 2, 2012\n\nCredit: Chris Fach\/Perimeter Institute and University of Waterloo\n\nThis artist's conception shows the region immediately surrounding a supermassive black hole (the black spot near the center). The black hole is orbited by a thick disk of hot gas. The center of the disk glows white-hot, while the edge of the disk is shown in dark silhouette. Magnetic fields channel some material into a jetlike outflow \u2014 the greenish wisps that extend to upper right and lower left. A dotted line marks the innermost stable circular orbit, which is the closest distance that material can orbit before becoming unstable and plunging into the black hole.\n\nUsing a continent-spanning telescope, an international team of astronomers has peered to the edge of a black hole at the center of a distant galaxy. For the first time, they have measured the black hole's \"point of no return\" \u2014 the closest distance that matter can approach before being irretrievably pulled into the black hole.\n\nA black hole is a region in space where the pull of gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. Its boundary is known as the event horizon.\n\nThe team examined the black hole at the center of a giant elliptical galaxy called Messier 87 (M87), which is located about 50 million light-years from Earth. The black hole is 6 billion times more massive than the sun. It's surrounded by an accretion disk of gas swirling toward the black hole's maw. Although the black hole is invisible, the accretion disk is hot enough to glow.\n\n\"Even though this black hole is far away, it's so big that its apparent size on the sky is about the same as the black hole at the center of the Milky Way,\" says co-author Jonathan Weintroub of the CfA. \"That makes it an ideal target for study.\"\n\nAccording to Einstein's theory of general relativity, a black hole's mass and spin determine how close material can orbit before becoming unstable and falling in toward the event horizon. The team was able to measure this innermost stable orbit and found that it's only 5.5 times the size of the black hole's event horizon. This size suggests that the accretion disk is spinning in the same direction as the black hole.\n\nThe observations were made by linking together radio telescopes in Hawaii, Arizona, and California to create a virtual telescope called the Event Horizon Telescope, or EHT. The EHT is capable of seeing details 2,000 times finer than the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nThe team plans to expand its telescope array, adding radio dishes in Chile, Europe, Mexico, Greenland, and the South Pole, in order to obtain even more detailed pictures of black holes in the futureAt first glance, the center of the Milky Way seems like a very inhospitable place to try to form a planet. New research by astronomers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics shows that planets still can form in this cosmic maelstrom.\n\nHarvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics' astronomers have detected for the first time jets of gamma rays extending thousands of light years from the Milky Way's core, confirming expectations based on observations of other galaxies."}
{"text":"News and Updates\n\nThe 302nd Carnival of Space arrived late this week, but I can't complain since I was even later in reporting it! This week's host is Steve Nerlich of Cheap Astronomy and he brings us a nice full plate of news and articles from the world of space science and astronomy. To enjoy the carnival, click here to find articles ranging from the fate of the Kepler mission to the evolution of Black Holes, the continuing mission of the Mars Science Lander (Curiosity to the likes of us) to astrobiology, and so much more.\n\nThe first scientific paper based on observations performed with South Africa's new KAT-7 radio telescope, has been accepted for publication by the prestigious journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomy Society. \"This is a significant milestone for South Africa's SKA project, proving that our engineers are able to deliver a cutting-edge scientific instrument, and that our scientists are able to use it for frontier science,\" says Derek Hanekom, South Africa's Minister of Science and Technology. \"It bodes well for the delivery of our 64-dish MeerKAT telescope, currently under construction in the Karoo, and for our ability to play a key role in building and commissioning thousands of SKA antennas over the next ten years.\" Using of the flares are visible only in radio waves. Circinus X-1 is an X-ray binary (or two-star system) where one of the companion stars is a high-density, compact neutron star (a neutron star is an extremely dense and compact remnant of an exploded star, only about 20 km in diameter.) The two stars orbit each other every 16.5 days in an elliptical orbit. When the two stars are at their closest, the gravity of the dense neutron star pulls material from the companion star. A powerful jet of material then blasts out from the system. During the time that KAT-7 observed Circinus X-1 (13 December 2011 to 16 January 2012), the system flared twice at levels among the highest observed in recent years. KAT-7 was able to catch both these flares and follow them as they progressed. This is the first time that the system has been observed in such detail during multiple flare cycles. \"One way of explaining what is happening is that the compact neutron star gobbles up part of its companion star and then fires much of this matter back out again,\" explains Dr Richard Armstrong, an SKA Fellow at the University of Cape Town and lead author of the paper reporting these results. \"The dramatic radio flares happen when the matter Circinus X-1 has violently ejected slows down as it smashes into the surrounding gas.\" At the same time Circinus X-1 was being observed at HartRAO at two higher frequencies as part of a long-term study of this object. \"The flares are much stronger at the higher frequencies and by combining the three sets of measurements, we could study how each flare evolved as time progressed and investigate details of the turbulent interactions of the jet,\" adds HartRAO Emeritus Astronomer Dr George Nicolson, a pioneer of radio astronomy in South Africa. \"These types of observations help us to understand how matter is accreted onto extremely dense systems, such as neutron stars and black holes,\" Armstrong says. \"They also shed light on how neutron stars are able to generate these powerful outflows and associated radio bursts.\" \"KAT-7 was really intended as an engineering test bed to refine the design and systems for the MeerKAT telescope that we are working on now, but we are absolutely delighted that it has turned out to be a top quality science instrument, capable of producing significant science,\" says Professor Justin Jonas of Rhodes University, who is also the associate director for science and engineering at the SKA South Africa Project Office. \"We plan to continue using KAT-7 to do science until at least 2015 when part of the 64-dish MeerKAT telescope will become available to researchers.\" Scientists from the SKA Project in South Africa and local and international universities worked together on both the observations and the analysis. This work is part of the development for the ThunderKAT project on MeerKAT, which will find many more of these types of systems in the galaxy, and search for new types of radio systems that change rapidly with time. The two leaders of the ThunderKAT project, Professor Rob Fender of the University of Southampton and Professor Patrick Woudt of the University of Cape Town, explain that the ThunderKAT project searches for all types of radio bursts and flashes in KAT-7 and MeerKAT data on timescales from seconds to years. Finding and studying the systems that produce these outbursts will allow us to test the extremes of physics, and are beyond anything achievable in any laboratory on Earth. \"These systems provide a unique glimpse of the laws of physics operating in extraordinary regimes\", Woudt says, \"and nearly all such events are associated with transient radio emission.\" The ThunderKAT project is already well under way, and besides these observations, has made targeted observations of other exciting systems including the flaring black hole candidate Swift J1745.1-2624, the diffuse radio structure around the black-hole binary GRS 1915+105, as well as a system that is very close to our Sun, the brown dwarf binary WISE 1049-5319.\n\nUpdate: The weather is not looking good, and the event has just been cancelled. But I spoke to organiser Alec Jamieson, and he seems upbeat about the whole thing and will simply try again later. I'll be sure to keep you all updated!\n\nIf you've never looked through a telescope, if you've always wanted to see the rings of Saturn or the craters of the Moon with your own eyes, then get down to Brightwater Commons in Randburg tonight. The Johannesburg centre of the Astronomical Society of South Africa are trying out a bit of Sidewalk Astronomy on the lawn facing the skateboard ramps, meaning that they're bringing their telescopes and making them available for casual passer's by to have a quick look and see what it is they do. They will be setting up from about 17h30, so there should be something to see as soon as it gets dark. They are a very friendly and approachable bunch, and always keen to share the universe with anybody who shows an interest, so don't be shy!\n\nThe most famous sidewalk astronomy group was founded in San Francisco in the 1980's by the iconic John Dobson, who pioneered the use of cheap materials and simple designs to let anybody build their own telescope. It makes for great outreach, simply because it brings astronomy to the people, rather than waiting for them to visit an observatory or a planetarium.\n\nThis is the first time the JHB centre is trying out sidewalk astronomy, and they are keen to see how many people are interested. Please show your support and make the trip!\n\nEvery week, a new host takes the reigns and brings us the Carnival of Space. This week, Gadi Eidelheit of The Venus Transit put together the 301st carnival, and packed it with the usual collection of space science and astronomy, scooped out from the best blogs and websites on the internet. Highlights this week include new nuclear reactor designs that could be used on spaceships, discussions on a manned mission to Mars, and of course the music video everybody's talking about: ISS station commander Chris Hadfield performing a cover of David Bowie's Space Oddity the night before he headed back home to Earth.\n\nToday we start the 19th week of 2013, and the 300th Carnival of Space. This milestone issue is brought to us by Brian Wang of Next Big Future, and features a whole lot of writing on astronomy and space science, picked out from the internet's best blogs. Click through here to visit this extra-special edition of the carnival.\n\nThis particularly bright meteor was photographed by Paola Castillo on her cameraphone. Most eta Aquarids are significantly dimmer than this, though\n\nThe Earth is currently passing through a belt of debris left behind by Halley's comet, and as small stones and bits of grit plough into our atmosphere at speeds of 66 kilometers per second, they will briefly flare and burn up as a meteor. At this point in our orbit, we're pointed towards the faint star Eta Aquarii, so each meteor in the shower will appear to shoot away from that star. This is why the meteor shower is called the Eta Aquarids, and it happens every year around this time.\n\nThis is a particularly good year, as the Moon will only rise early in the morning, making the sky dark and meteors easy to spot. South African observers can expect to see about 55 meteors per hour when the shower peaks on 5 - 6 May.\n\nUsing a precision formation-flying technique, the twin GRAIL spacecraft mapped the moon's gravity field, as depicted in this artist's rendering. Radio signals traveling between the two spacecraft provided scientists the exact measurements required to produce the most accurate gravity map of the moon ever made.\nThe mission answered longstanding questions about Earth's moon, and provided scientists with a better understanding of how Earth and other rocky planets in the solar system formed. GRAIL was a part of NASA's Discovery Program.\nImage credit: NASA\/JPL-Caltech\n\nLate last year, a pair of spacecraft completed their mission to probe the hidden inner structure of the Moon by precisely mapping out its gravitational field. The Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission revealed details and features that had never been seen before like tectonic structures, volcanic landforms, basin rings, crater central peaks and many simple bowl-shaped structures.\n\nThe GRAIL mission worked by sending two small spacecraft (GRAIL-A and GRAIL-B) into the same orbit around the Moon, each about the size of a washing machine. The craft were equipped with a device called the Lunar Gravity Ranging System, to measure the distance between them (which varied from 65 to 225 kilometers as the mission progressed through different stages) to an accuracy of microns. If the leading spacecraft were to pass through a region of slightly higher gravity, it would speed up by a very small amount, causing the gap between the two craft to open up slightly. By measuring these subtle changes, scientists can accurately map the Moon's gravity field, and from this calculate its mass distribution, which in turn reveals the structure beneath the surface.\n\nThis image shows the final flight path for NASA's twin Gravity\nRecovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission spacecraft, which\nimpacted the moon on Dec. 17, 2012. Their successful prime and\nextended science missions having been completed, the twin GRAIL\nspacecraft Ebb and Flow were sent purposefully into the moon\nbecause their low orbit and fuel state precluded further scientific\noperations.\nImage credit: NASA\/JPL-Caltech\/GSFC\/ASU\n\nAnd the results? It turns out that the Moon's crust is a lot less dense than had previously been thought. \"With our new crustal bulk density determination, we find that the average thickness of the moon's crust is between 21 and 27 miles (34 and 43 kilometers), which is about 6 to 12 miles (10 to 20 kilometers solar system history.\"\n\nThe GRAIL mission ended 17 December 2012 when, having completed mapping the Moon's gravity field, the two craft were deorbited and crashed into a mountainside in order to blast material upwards and give us a glimpse of what lies beneath the surface.\n\nThis artist's illustration shows an enormous halo of hot gas (in blue) around the Milky Way galaxy. Also shown, to the lower left of the Milky Way, are the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, two small neighboring galaxies. The halo of gas is shown with a radius of about 300,000 light years, although it may extend significantly further. Credit: Illustration: NASA\/CXC\/M.Weiss; NASA\/CXC\/Ohio State\/A Gupta et al\n\nRecent observations by NASA's Chandra have found much of the Milky Way's missing mass in the form of a vast halo surrounding the galaxy.\n\nIt has been known for many decades that the amount of material which we can see in a galaxy is not enough to account for the speeds at which various stars and clouds orbit the centre. Objects towards the edge should move slowly and objects near the core should move rapidly, which is what we observe in our Solar System. In reality, though, we see that the outer edges move significantly faster than simple orbital mechanics would suggest, and the most likely explanation is that there is a lot of mass unaccounted for, spread throughout the galaxy and upsetting the calculations. Current leading cosmological theories predict something called Dark Matter, which is a form of matter that does not interact with the rest of the universe in any way except through gravity, making it invisible and intangible. But even when dark matter is taken into account, the Milky Way galaxy still spins too fast.\n\nThe Chandra Observatory, a space telescope designed to observe the universe in X-rays, has now solved the mystery by spotting a vast cloud of normal matter spread in a halo around the entire Milky Way galaxy. This matter is in a gas form, and so thinly spread out that it is invisible to direct observations. However, when Chandra observed a number of known X-ray sources in the sky, an analysis of the colour spectrum of their light revealed absorption lines caused by oxygen ions in the light path. Astronomers estimate the temperature of this hot gas at between 1 and 2.5 million Kelvins, or several hundred times hotter than the surface of the Sun. It is also huge, containing a mass of gas of at least 10 billion Suns, and possibly as much as 60 billion Suns.\n\nThis gas halo is distinct from a smaller halo of less hot gas which astronomers have known about for some time - this warm halo is well studied, and others like it have been seen around other galaxies.\n\nThe image on the left shows the newly discovered Phoenix Cluster, located about 5.7 billion light years from Earth. This composite includes an X-ray image from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory in purple, an optical image from the 4m Blanco telescope in red, green and blue, and an ultraviolet (UV) image from NASA's Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) in blue. The Chandra data show hot gas in the cluster and the optical and UV images show galaxies in the cluster and in nearby parts of the sky.\n\nThe largest structures in the universe are galactic clusters, spanning millions of light years in diameter. Typically, the galaxies at the centre of these clusters are very old, with little new star formation taking place. But new observations by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, the National Science Foundation's South Pole Telescope, and eight other world-class observatories have shown that this is not always the case. Galaxies at the centre of the Phoenix cluster, located about 5.7 billion light years away and with a diameter of 7.3 million light years, are spawning new stars at a record-breaking pace. The region is also pumping out X-rays more powerfully than any other cluster.\n\nIt has been known for some time that galactic clusters contain vast reservoirs of gas, holding more material than all the actual galaxies combined. This gas is so hot that it emits X-rays which can be seen by the Chandra orbital X-ray telescope, which is the only way it can be seen from such a great distance. Scientists had long expected that this gas should gradually sink to the centre of the cluster under gravity, and provide material to fuel star formation, but observations had always shown the central regions to instead be dormant, populated entirely with old stars. The hypothesis was that jets of expelled material from the supermassive black hole (SBH) at the core of the central galaxy add enough energy to the system to keep the cloud from collapsing. This has been observed happening in other galactic clusters, like the Perseus cluster.\n\nBut the Phoenix cluster shows that this mechanism does not necessarily work in all cases. Phoenix's central galaxy has a relatively quiet SBH which is not jetting enegetically enough to stop the gas cloud from collapsing. As a result, the galaxy is producing new stars at a rate of about 740 per year -- more than two brand new stars every single day!\n\nThis cannot continue for long though, as much of the in-falling gas will end up near the SBH. Some of this material will fall into the black hole, but the rest will be whipped around by tidal forces and ejected at extremely high speeds, causing the jets to flare up and restore the balance to the cluster. The question now is whether this is a normal cycle for galactic clusters, or if Phoenix is just having a temporary blip in the natural order.\n\nThe Phoenix cluster originally was detected by the National Science Foundation's South Pole Telescope, and later was observed in optical light by the Gemini Observatory, the Blanco 4-meter telescope and Magellan telescope, all in Chile. The hot gas and its rate of cooling were estimated from Chandra data. To measure the star formation rate in the Phoenix cluster, several space-based telescopes were used, including NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and Galaxy Evolution Explorer and ESA's Herschel."}
{"text":"W49B Supernova Remnants\n\n\nThe remnant, called W49B, is about a thousand years old as seen from Earth and located about 26,000 light-years away.\n\n\"W49B is the first of its kind to be discovered in the galaxy,\" said Laura Lopez, who led the study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"It appears its parent star ended its life in a way that most others don't.\"\n\nUsually when a massive star runs out of fuel, the central region of the star collapses, triggering a chain of events that quickly culminate in a supernova explosion.

By tracing the distribution and amounts of different elements in the stellar debris field, researchers were able to compare the Chandra data to theoretical models of how a star explodes.\n\nFor example, they found iron in only half of the remnant while other elements such as sulfur and silicon were spread throughout. This matches predictions for an asymmetric explosion.\n\n\"In addition to its unusual signature of elements, W49B also is much more elongated and elliptical than most other remnants,\" said co-author Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz of the University of California at Santa Cruz. \"This is seen in X-rays and several other wavelengths and points to an unusual demise for this star.\"\n\nBecause supernova explosions are not well understood, astronomers want to study extreme cases like the one that produced W49B. The relative proximity of W49B also makes it extremely useful for detailed study.\n\nThe authors examined what sort of compact object the supernova explosion left behind. Most of the time, massive stars that collapse into supernovas leave a dense, spinning core called a neutron star.\n\nAstronomers often can detect neutron stars through their X-ray or radio pulses, although sometimes an X-ray source is seen without pulsations. A careful search of the Chandra data revealed no evidence for a neutron star. The lack of such evidence implies a black hole may have formed.\n\n\"It's a bit circumstantial, but we have intriguing evidence the W49B supernova also created a black hole,\" said co-author Daniel Castro, also of MIT. \"If that is the case, we have a rare opportunity to study a supernova responsible for creating a young black hole.\"\n\nSupernova explosions driven by jets like the one in W49B have been linked to gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in other objects. GRBs, which have been seen only in distant galaxies, also are thought to mark the birth of a black hole.\n\nThere is no evidence the W49B supernova produced a GRB, but it may have properties -- including being jet-driven and possibly forming a black hole -- that overlap with those of a GRB.\n\nThe new results on W49B, which were based on about two-and-a-half days of Chandra observing time, appear in a paper in Sunday's issue of the Astrophysical Journal. The other co-author was Sarah Pearson from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark."}
{"text":"Sep 14, 2011\n\nIncoming third impact of the Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy (blue stream of stars) with our Milky Way Galaxy (multicolored disk) was simulated by supercomputer and rendered by Erik Tollerud against a background of galaxies seen in the Hubble Deep Field. Note the simulated disk's ring-like spiral extensions in the outer Milky Way (upper left), which strongly resemble actual streams found at low latitudes with respect to the disk plane, in the nearby region of the Milky Way viewed from the Earth in the opposite direction from the center of the Galaxy. Those spiral arms began to emerge after the initial impact of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy nearly two billion years ago; they have been amplified until the present day, into the many spiral arms observed in the Milky Way. Credit: Chris Purcell\/HI-PACC\n\nThe signature spiral arms of the Milky Way galaxy were likely formed by an epic collision between the Milky Way and the Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy, according to a University of Pittsburgh researcher and his collaborators, published today in the prestigious British journal Nature.\n\nSupercomputer simulations by Christopher W. Purcell, postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Physics and Astronomy in Pitt's School of Arts and Sciences, and colleagues report their findings in a paper titled \"The Sagittarius Impact as an Architect of Spirality and Outer Rings in the Milky Way.\"\n\nThis paper is the first to identify Sagittarius as the architect of spiral structure in our Milky Way. \"It presents a new and somewhat unexpected way of thinking about why the galaxy we live in looks the way it does,\" says Purcell.\n\n\"Cosmologically speaking, it demonstrates the idea that relatively small impacts like this can have a dramatic impact on the structure of galaxies throughout the universe,\" he adds. This idea had been assumed theoretically, but never demonstrated.\n\nPurcell's collaborators include University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center (UC-HIPACC)-affiliates James S. Bullock, Erik J. Tollerud, and Miguel Rocha, all at the University of California at Irvine. The fifth coauthor is Sukanya Chakrabarti at Florida Atlantic University.\n\nIn the field of cosmology, supercomputer simulations are the only laboratories for scientific experimentation. With supercomputers, astronomers can recreate a small-scale simulation or model of distant, violent events that occurred over billions of years, and observe that model in sped-up time, in order to make predictions that can be tested by actual observations of the universe.\n\nPurcell's findings are based on supercomputer simulations he conducted for his PhD at the University of California, Irvine, and in the lab of Pitt professor of physics and astronomy Andrew Zentner.\n\nInterestingly, Purcell's simulations revealed that even more important than the stars of the Sagittarius Dwarf was its halo of invisible \"dark matter\"\u2014equal in mass to all the stars in the Milky Way.\n\nVisible matter makes up less than five percent of the universe, while nearly a quarter of the universe is made of transparent dark matter. Its existence is felt only through its gravitational influence. It is now known that every galaxy, including the Sagittarius Dwarf (precollision) and our own Milky Way, resides at the center of a giant halo of dark matter several times larger in radius and many times greater in mass.\n\n\"When all the dark matter smacked into the Milky Way, 80 to 90 percent of it was stripped off,\" Purcell says. That first impact\u2014more than two billion years ago\u2014produced instabilities that were quickly amplified, eventually forming the spiral arms and ring structures in the outskirts of our own galaxy.\n\nIn his dissertation, Purcell focused on the question: What effects have the repeated collisions with the Sagittarius Dwarf had on the Milky Way?\n\nThroughout the past few decades, conventional wisdom has been that the Milky Way was relatively unperturbed for the past several million years. Whatever spiral structure exists, these arms, were just a result of the Milky Way disc evolving in isolation.\n\nSince the Sagittarius Dwarf was discovered, astronomers have tried to match up debris from that galaxy to what they saw in the universe. In 2003, infrared telescopes and supercomputers that traced the orbital motions of its stars has revealed that the Sagittarius Dwarf had actually collided with the Milky Way twice\u2014once 1.9 billion years ago and again 0.9 billion years ago.\n\nComputer simulations visualized the disk of the Milky Way Galaxy for three cases: no impact with a dwarf galaxy, impact with a Sgr dwarf galaxy of lower mass, and impact with a Sgr dwarf galaxy of higher mass. Our Galaxy is shown both edge-on and face-on in the inset panels, and the sun's location is marked as a yellow dot, and the present location of the Sagittarius dwarf's remnant core is marked as a pink dot, as shown after more than two billion years of isolated evolution. Shown in the background is a global rendering of the \"light Sgr\" tidal debris and the Milky Way disk. Credit: Chris Purcell\/HI-PACC\n\n\"But what those collisions did to the Milky Way hadn't been simulated at all,\" says Purcell. \"Ours was the first ever to try to do that.\"\n\nResearchers found that the collision set up instabilities\u2014fluctuations in density of stars\u2014in the flat disk of the rotating Milky Way. Our galaxy rotates faster toward its center than toward its edges, so those instabilities were stretched and sheared, leading to the formation of spiral arms.\n\nThe simulations also revealed that the impact gave rise to ring-like structures found at the edges of our galaxy.\n\nThe second impact affected the Milky Way less, giving rise to only milder, less dense spiral-creating waves, because the Sagittarius Dwarf had by then lost most of its dark matter mass.\n\nWithout the dark matter to hold the dwarf galaxy together, its visible stars began to be pulled apart by the Milky Way's huge gravitational field and tidal forces.\n\n\"The dominant cosmology in astrophysics is one that's very violent on small scales. Galaxies like the Milky Way are constantly being bombarded by these small dwarf galaxies. It had not been appreciated prior to our work just how dramatic those impacts could be on the stellar disc itself,\" says Purcell. \"We expected to find some more subtle signatures of an impact like this\u2014a flare in the outer disc, like bell-bottom jeans. We expected to see some mild morphological changes to the Milky Way. But we did not expect to see a spiral structure begin to emerge as a result of these impacts. That was something we didn't foresee.\"\n\nIndeed, Purcell and collaborators delayed publication for several months while they made sure they understood why they were seeing these results. \"We had to convince ourselves that we weren't crazy,\" he jokes.\n\nToday, long streamers of stars from the dismembered dwarf galaxy arch over and around the Milky Way, and \"right now, billions and billions of dark matter particles from the Sagittarius Dwarf are raining down onto the Earth,\" said Purcell. \"Meantime, the Sun itself is revolving around the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, in a complex and still-evolving system of multiple spiral arms.\"\n\nWe're just a few million years short of a third impact, Purcell says. But how can the researchers tell?\n\n\"We can tell when we look toward the center of the Milky Way,\" says Purcell. \"Immediately on the opposite side of us, we can see this blob of stars crashing into the southern face of the disc from beneath. We can measure the velocities of these stars. We know that the dwarf galaxy is just about to smash the disc\u2014in only another 10 million years.\"\n\nRelated StoriesA new map of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy reveals a night sky criss-crossed with streams of stars, left behind by smaller satellite galaxies and star clusters ripped apart by the parent galaxy's gravity.\n\nIn the new ESO image, Barnard's Galaxy glows beneath a sea of foreground stars in the direction of the constellation of Sagittarius (the Archer).

X-ray observations from Chandra (green) and XMM-Newton (purple) have been combined with infrared data from the 2MASS project and optical data from the Digitized Sky Survey (colored red, green and blue, but appearing in the image as white).\n\nThe large area of diffuse X-rays seen by XMM-Newton was produced when a massive star exploded as a supernova, leaving behind a debris field, or supernova remnant known as SNR MSH 11-16A. Shocks waves from the supernova have heated surrounding gas to several million degrees Kelvin, causing the remnant to glow brightly in X-rays.\n\nThe Chandra image shown in the inset (\"X-ray close-up\") or INTEGRAL, and is called IGR J11014-6103 (or IGR J11014 for short). It may be a rapidly spinning, super-dense star (known as a \"pulsar\", a type of neutron star) (A similar case was seen in another object known as PSR B1957+20 [ astronomers estimate that the age of MSH 11-61A (\n\nThe high speeds estimated for both IGR J11014 and the neutron star candidate in G350.1-0.3 are preliminary and need to be confirmed. If they are confirmed, explaining the high speeds of the neutron star presents a severe challenge to existing models for supernova explosions.\n\nOne important caveat in the conclusion that IGR J11014 may be the fastest moving pulsar is that pulsations have not been detected in it during a search with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) Parkes radio telescope. This non-detection is not surprising for a pulsar located about 30,000 light years away.\n\nHowever, there are other pieces of evidence that support the pulsar interpretation. First, the lack of detection of a counterpart to the X-ray source in optical or infrared images supports the idea that it is a pulsar, since such objects are very faint at these wavelengths. Also, there are no apparent differences in the brightness of the source between XMM-Newton observations in 2003 and the Chandra observations in 2011, behavior that is expected if IGR J11014 is a pulsar. Finally, the X-ray spectrum of the source, that is, its signature in energy, is similar to what astronomers expect to see for a pulsar"}

{"text":"Black holes \u2013 the ultimate cosmic vacuum cleaners \u2013 are no longer obscure to the general public and are understood to be common in our galaxy and throughout the universe. But while many have been identified and studied in detail by astronomers, black holes remain difficult to understand.\n\nThe largest stars will undergo a catastrophic, gravitational collapse when they 'die'. When an old star has burned up most of its atomic 'fuel', or a great deal of matter has fallen into it without raising the core temperature, the star's internal pressure can no longer resist the star's own gravity and it will begin to collapse under its own weight. A violent explosion and violent implosion will occur simultaneously. Supernovae become visible as massive amounts of dust and gas are ejected into space and are easily observed at visible wavelengths. A massive star can easily lose up to 3\/4 of its matter. A very different new star, in which matter is extremely condensed, will be formed from the atoms and molecules not blown into space. If the mass of the material not blown out into space is greater than 3-4 times that of our sun, the degeneracy pressure of neutrons cannot stop the collapse and the implosion does not stop until a black hole is created. Astronomers now assume that all black holes in the universe were formed by catastrophic stellar collapse, although extremely unusual conditions in the very early universe might reveal other processes that can form black holes.\n\nCollapse of Massive Star Image: R.J. Hall\n\nBlack Holes are often said to be 'powered' by the dust and gas in their accretion disk. As this material crosses the event horizon and is drawn into the black hole, the immense gravitational field breaks matter down to elementary particles and atomic fragments. The search for black holes is often a search for the radiation emitted by this violent activity at the accretion disk boundary and event horizon. In a binary star system, a black hole can continually capture matter from its stellar companion. If the companion star is in close orbit, a black hole might absorb it entirely. Super massive black holes that are in the center of galaxies grow by capturing dust, gas and many stars. Some astrophysicists have theorized that black holes in the center of galaxies would slowly grow to enormous size as they gradually suck in all galactic matter, stars, planets, dust etc. After hundreds of millions of years at a minimum, the visible galaxy ceases to exist; it has 'disappeared' into the giant black hole. Think of a cosmic vacuum cleaner gone amok. In this model, an extremely old universe would be nearly dark, populated by massive black holes that have nothing left to eat.\n\nThe famous physicist Stephen Hawking believes that black holes emit thermal radiation and thereby lose mass. (Energy is just highly condensed matter according to the Theory of Relativity.) Therefore, black holes should shrink and disappear over time. However, the temperature of their thermal radiation is proportional to their surface gravity, which is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole. A black hole 5 times the sun's mass is extremely cold, much colder than the cosmic background radiation left over from the Big Bang. This temperature difference allows black holes to absorb mass from the cosmic microwave background. Black holes 5 times the sun's mass or greater will grow, not shrink. On the other hand, very small black holes below this weight limit do not grow and are not stable. A black hole the size of a human would evaporate in an instant. A black hole the weight of a typical car would disappear in a nanosecond. There are 200 to 400 billion stars in the Milky Way, which has a massive black hole in its center, and our galaxy is at least 12 billion years old. These basic facts make clear that our galaxy is not in any danger of being consumed by the massive black hole at its center.\n\nBlack Hole and accretion disk Image: NASA\n\nQuasars, Active Galactic Nuclei and Star Formation\n\nQuasars were a spectacular phenomenon when first discovered in 1967. While only a small fraction of distant galaxies have quasars embedded at their interior, the majority do have black holes of a quieter type at their centers. First believed to be extremely high energy, very young, very distant galaxies, quasars are now understood to be the accretion disks of super massive black holes that are located at the center of the most distant galaxies. More than 100,000 quasars have been cataloged. The nearest is 780 million light years away and the most distant is 28 billion light years from our solar system. The majority are more than 3 billion light years away and therefore more than 3 billion years old. We can never see a quasar as it is today, only at the moment in the distant past when we captured a record of the quasar's spectra. (Remember that a light year is both a distance and time unit of measurement.) No object except a black hole can be modeled to produce such extreme emissions across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Quasar spectral emissions are often very strong for visible light and radio noise. This allows them to be 'seen' and 'heard' at great distances. The 'glare' produced by the extremely strong, visible, light emission makes it very difficult to observe the stars in a far away galaxy that has a quasar at the center.\n\nQuasar 3C-273 Photograph: Hubble ESA\n\nAnother observational fingerprint that discloses black holes are gravitational lenses. If light from a very distant object passes near a black hole, it will be bent around it by the extreme gravitational force of the black hole singularity. This is an example of the warping of space time. Both earth based and space telescopes that are in the line of sight of the black hole will photograph images that are peculiar and specific to gravitational lenses. The object far behind the black hole, that emit light that passes close to the black hole, will often appear as multiple images to astronomers on or near earth. If telescopes are in an exact straight line alignment with the distant object, it will be seen as a ring behind the black hole. An exceptional data set has been obtained from the gravitational lens study of the Einstein Cross, a famous mirage 1 billion light years distant that is composed of four images of a distant quasar about 10 billion light years from earth. This data revealed that most energy emissions from a super massive black hole come from a region only a light day or less in diameter (the quasar accretion disk diameter), and that this energy decreases with distance exactly as predicted by theory.\n\nDistant Galaxies \u2013 Cluster of Gravitational Lenses Photograph: NASA\n\nThe analysis of gravitational lens effects is very difficult because such effects can also be produced by light passing near very large galaxies which have gravitational fields strong enough to bend light. In this latter situation, astronomers are not studying the bending of light by the immense gravitational field of a black hole but an analogous phenomenon which is the bending of light by the immensely strong gravitational field produced by a very large, young galaxy. A few of these young galaxies are found not only in pairs, but also colliding with each other. In this situation, one galaxy of the pair will often have much more gas and dust that its companion, a feature that indicates that this galaxy is actively giving birth to new stars. As these galaxy pairs age, they will merge to form a giant elliptical galaxy that has an extremely massive black hole at its center. At this stage of the galaxy's evolution and aging, the quasar structure at its center will have disappeared.\n\nBlack holes are not simplistic destructive objects that suck in everything within reach of their immense gravitational field. Most importantly, they regulate star formation. The material that crosses the event horizon cause the black hole to emit sporadic bursts of energy in a gentle, rhythmic pattern. These bubbles of hot plasma are sent into space. Their heat slows the formation of new stars, and also slows down the growth of the black hole. Interstellar gas will only start coalescing into stars when the temperature is low enough. This black hole heating effect helps to stabilize its galaxy and regulate star formation.\n\nIt is now widely believed that every large galaxy has a massive black hole at its center. A galactic center black hole has a size proportional to the size of the galaxy. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) appear to be massive black holes that can contain billions of times the sun's mass. AGNs also have accretion disks, gas and dust in orbit around the massive black hole, and two gas jets of enormous size perpendicular to the accretion disk. The Einstein Cross gravitational lens study tells us that the accretion disk diameter of a super massive black hole may be only one light day in diameter. The near region of a black hole is dynamic and cannot stabilize as gravity, magnetism, and explosive pressure interact. Light emitted at these high temperatures varies in brightness and does not have a discernible pattern. Research data from two black holes that were intensively studied recently suggests that their rapid light flickering and X-ray emissions may both originate in extremely strong magnetic fields. These magnetic fields soak up and then hold energy, releasing it later as a multi-million degree X-ray emitting plasma, or as streams of charged particles moving at near the speed of light.\n\nSuper Massive Black Holes Photograph: Harvard University \/ NASA\n\nOur own galaxy \u2013 the Milky Way \u2013 has a super massive black hole at its center in a region called Sagittarius A* that is 26,000 light years from the sun. This massive black hole was first detected by strong radio and infrared emissions. It is now understood to be originating in the material moving through the event horizon and into the black hole. The black hole itself only emits very low temperature Hawking Radiation. Sagittarius A* contains 3.7 million solar masses and this enormous mass is packed into a sphere with a radius of no less than 6 light hours (6.7 billion km). In December 2008, a 16 year long research program that studied 28 stars closest to Sagittarius A* came to an end. The data revealed that the stars closest to Sagittarius A* were buzzing around the galactic center like bees. Further out stars were able to move in stable orbits. It is likely that the tidal forces of the massive black hole catalyzed the formation of these stars.\n\nIn late January 2009, important research news was announced about massive black holes and star formation. A large study of 177 galaxies revealed that AGN's with massive black holes do not stop star formation. It had been widely theorized that the continual absorption of material by massive black holes in the center of galaxies would cause them to emit excessive heat (as light), thereby raising the temperature to a level where star formation was prevented. In the galaxies studied, star formation stopped several hundred million years before the massive black holes in these galaxies would 'turn on' and reach their maximum size and strength of emissions. Coincidentally, astronomers cannot find bright AGNs in the centers of galaxies that are actively producing new stars. Cessation of star formation appears not to be dependent upon a galaxy's massive black hole, and may begin before the formation of an AGN. Furthermore, massive black holes have now been found in galaxies without the distinctive central 'bulge' of a large AGN. This discovery points to a role of little understood dark matter in the formation of massive black holes, quest that is now a priority in several astrophysics research projects.\n\nThe Smallest Black Holes\n\nThere are two intermediate size black holes confirmed in the Milky Way. One of these is only 3 light years away from Sagittarius A* and contains the equivalent of 1300 solar masses. It may be the remains of a large star cluster that has been stripped down by the massive black hole in the Milky Way's center. In 2007, astronomers found a small black hole of 10 solar masses in a globular cluster that resides in a galaxy 55 light years distant from the Milky Way. Black holes of this size may be among the smallest that can be detected in the universe. Nonetheless, we can speculate that a black hole the size of the planet Mercury might exist. It would have a temperature of 2.73 K, which is equal to the cosmic background radiation. A black hole more massive than Mercury will be colder than the background radiation. It will gain energy from the cosmic background radiation faster than it gives off energy through Hawking radiation and it will become still colder. For less massive black holes, they are expected to lose mass through time and slowly evaporate while becoming hotter and hotter. Micro-size black holes can be modeled and predicted but have never been found.\n\nSimulation of Mini Black Hole Decay Image: CERN\n\nWhen first predicted, black holes were assumed to not exist in nature. When first found, they were assumed to be extremely rare, although their extraordinary identity as a 'singularity' could be described. In 2009 we now understand that black holes, often super massive, are common. Indeed as quasars they are found at the galactic center of more than 100,000 young, distant galaxies. Other types of AGNs may be even more common. Black holes appear to be central to galactic evolution and star formation throughout the universe. Nonetheless, fascinating mysteries remain. What exactly happens to the material that enters a black hole over time? Are black holes 'doorways' to tunnels that end at a white hole which is an entrance into another universe ?"}

{"text":"The phenomenon of black holes is one of the stranger consequences of General Relativity. The interest in these objects originates from two quite distinct perspectives.\n\nMassive black holes in context\n\nFrom the perspective of basic theoretical physics, black holes are essentially elementary macroscopic objects, since their internal structure is causally disconnected from us. They can be fully characterized by three ``quantum'' numbers: mass, angular momentum and electrical charge. Black holes serve as ``gedanken-laboratories'' in attempts to reconcile quantum mechanics and General Relativity (e.g. Hawking radiation) and to explore the fundamentals of statistical mechanics and information theory (e.g. black hole entropy). Such thought experiments frequently require a microscopic black hole, where quantum effects are significant, or an isolated black hole in vacuum, where adiabatically slow thermodynamic processes can occur. Unfortunately, Nature does not appear to provide us with such black holes. All black holes that have been discovered so far are very massive, and are surrounded by, and interacting strongly with a hot radiating plasma (which also neutralizes any electric charge they may have). Thus, there is little hope of making an experimental connection between actual black holes and these fundamental questions of interest.\n\nThe questions of interest from the astrophysical perspective are very different from those of the fundamental physics perspective. Two classes of black holes are known to exist. The first consists of stellar black holes of roughly 10solar masses, which emerge from the collapsing core of massive stars (>30 solar masses) that have exhausted their nuclear fuel. The second consists of super-massive black holes with masses in the range of 106to 109solar masses, which are found at the centers of galaxies, one in each galaxy. It is not exactly clear how super-massive black holes are formed. A third class of yet undiscovered intermediate mass black holes is also thought to exist. These may be the missing link between the stellar black holes and the super-massive ones. This web essay will focus on super-massive black holes, and specifically on the one in the center of our home galaxy, the Milky Way. Black holes play a wide range of roles in current astrophysical research.\n\nMassive black holes as extreme energy sources\n\nThe accretion of mass into black holes powers many astrophysical phenomena. It is a seeming paradox that black holes are in fact the most efficient persistent sources of energy in the universe (second in efficiency only to direct matter-antimatter annihilation). The source of the energy is the gravitational potential energy of the matter falling into the black hole. Since the matter reaches the speed of light as it crosses the event horizon (the ``edge'' of the black hole--the point of no return), its kinetic energy is of the order of its rest-mass energy. The effective friction of the inflowing gas on itself as it is squeezed into the small ``drain'' of the event horizon converts a significant fraction of the kinetic energy into radiation and energetic particles. Up to 42% of the gas rest-mass energy can be extracted until the gas finally reaches the point (close to the black hole but still outside the event horizon) where the orbits become unstable due to General relativistic effects and it plunges straight in and disappears forever inside the black hole. This high efficiency far exceeds the <1%efficiency of nuclear fusion that powers the Sun.\n\nThe more massive a black hole is, the faster it can accrete before the radiation pressure of the accretion luminosity becomes so high that it wins over gravity and blows the gas away. Therefore of all black holes, it is the super-massive ones that achieve the highest luminosities. The most spectacular persistent accretion-powered phenomenon in the universe are quasars, which are super-massive black holes in the centers of distant galaxies. Quasars produce so much light that they outshine their entire host galaxy (Figure1). Understanding the complex magneto-hydrodynamics of accretion flows and understanding why only a minority of massive black holes are luminous while the majority are dim is an important subfield of theoretical astrophysics.\n\nFigure 1:Left: A Hubble Space Telescope image of a disk of gas and dust in the inner 1000 light-years of active galaxy NGC4261. The gas is illuminated by an accreting massive black hole in the center. Right: The accretion also powers strong radio jets that extend well into intergalactic space.

See Hubble Space Telescope press release.\n\nMassive black holes, galactic dynamics and galaxy formation\n\nA super-massive black hole was found in every galactic center that was observed with high enough precision. It is now widely assumed that all galaxies contain one. The mass of the black hole is always about 0.1% of the mass of spheroidal component of the host galaxy (the galactic bulge in disk galaxies like our own, or the entire galaxy in elliptical galaxies like the one shown in Figure1) (Magorrian et al. 1998; H\u00e4ring and Rix 2004). This relation between the central black hole and its host galaxy suggests a causal connection between the formation of the two. However, the physical mechanism behind this correlation is still unknown. The connection likely involves the feedback effect of the intense radiation from the accreting black hole on the star-forming gas in the galaxy around it. Galaxies grow by successive collisions and mergers with other galaxies, and the massive black holes in them must also eventually merge, while somehow preserving the black hole--bulge correlation. There is at present little direct evidence that black holes mergers actually occur. The next generation of space-borne gravitational wave observatories will hopefully detect the energetic bursts of gravitational waves that are emitted in the course of such mergers.\n\nMassive black holes as astrophysical research tools\n\nIrrespective of the unanswered questions about the formation mechanisms of the massive black holes, or the physics of accretion, massive black holes can serve as tools to study various other astrophysical questions. Two well-established techniques use quasar light to trace the distribution of matter in the universe. In one technique quasars serve essentially as lamps in a ``shadow theater'', which illuminate from behind filaments of inter-galactic gas, the leftover material from the epoch of galaxy formation. The gas is detected then by the absorption features it imprints in the quasar's spectrum. A second technique probes the gravitational potential of intervening galaxies, clusters of galaxies and the dark matter associated with them by the effects of gravitational lensing, where gravity causes light rays to bend. As a result, instead of seeing the actual quasar, several distorted images of the quasar are observed. A massive black hole, specifically the Galactic one, can also serve as a tool for studying stellar physics and stellar dynamics, since it is essentially a ``stellar collider''. This is further discussed below.\n\nInfrared observations of the Galactic center\n\nLike all galaxies, the Milky Way harbors a massive black hole. It is the lowest mass black hole discovered to date, with ''only'' ~ 106 solar mass (Eisenhauer et al. 2005; Ghez et al. 2005), in keeping with the atypically small bulge of the Milky Way. Like central black holes in many other galaxies, the Galactic black hole is very dim. What makes this black hole unique is its proximity. It is about 100 times closer than the black hole in the nearest large galaxy, Andromeda, and about 2000 times closer than those in the galaxies of the nearest cluster of galaxies, the Virgo cluster. For this reason it is possible to observe the environment of the Galactic black hole at a level of detail that will not be possible for any other galaxy in the foreseeable future.\n\nFigure 2:Composite infrared image of the Milky Way and its center. Large scale: COBE\/DIRBE satellite image (1.25, 2.2 and 3.5 micron). Small scale: a 2MASS survey (1.25 and 2.17 micron) image combined with one from the MSX\/SPIRIT satellite (6-11 micron).\n\nThe first hint of its existence was provided by the discovery, 30 years ago, of the unusual radio source Sagittarius A (SgrA*) at the dynamical center of the Galaxy (Balick and Brown 1974). It took almost three decades to obtain decisive observational evidence that SgrA*is indeed a massive black hole. There were several reasons for the long wait. The faint radio luminosity of SgrA*could be easily explained in terms of other, less exotic alternatives. Accreting massive black holes typically emit most of their luminosity in the UV to soft X-ray range of the spectrum (the more massive the black hole, the less energetic the typical wavelength). However, most of this spectral range is not accessible to observations, since the line of sight to the Galactic center is completely opaque to optical to UV light (Figure2) due to the large amount of intervening interstellar dust (smog-like micron-sized particles made of graphite and silicates). To see anything, it is necessary to observe in either longer or shorter wavelengths. It is only recently that the Galactic black hole was observed in the IR (Genzel et al. 2003a) and X-ray (Baganoff et al. 2001) bands. Unfortunately, even these impressive observational achievements are insufficient determine the nature of SgrA*--the physics of accretion are still not understood well enough for the detection of this emission to be considered strong evidence of the existence of a black hole.\n\nFigure 3: Adaptive optics-assisted infrared images of the the central light year taken by the Very Large Telescope (Genzel et al., 2003a). The false colors correspond to temperature. Blue stars are hot and short-lived (therefore must be young). Red stars are old, less massive giant stars at the last stages of their lives. It should be emphasized that what seems to be the size of the stars is just an artifact due to light ``leaking'' around bright sources. At a distance of about 24000 light years all the stars are actually point-like sources well below the telescope's angular resolution.\n\nMost of the light emitted by the stars that orbit the black hole is also obscured by the inter-stellar dust. However, stars can be observed in the infrared, albeit with more difficulty (Figure3). Recent technological advances in infrared astronomy enabled deep and precise observations of these stars as they orbit the black hole (Eisenhauer et al. 2005; Ghez et al. 2005). It was these observations that finally delivered the most convincing evidence for the existence of the massive black hole. This is because the stars are clean, direct probes of the gravitational potential, whereas gas can be affected by other forces, such as radiation pressure, thermal pressure and magnetic fields.\n\nFigure 4: Stellar orbits around the massive black hole in the Galactic center, observed in the infrared (2.2 micron) with the Very large Telescope (Sch\u00f6del et al. 2002; Eisenhauer et al. 2005). The actual measurements (points with error bars) are shown only for the star named ``S2''. S2 has the shortest orbital period (15.2 years) of the stars detected to date. Its distance of closest approach to the black hole is only 17 light-hours, at which point it is traveling at almost 2% of the speed of light. For more information see MPE's Galactic Center web page.\n\nFigure4 shows the reconstructed orbits of several of the stars near SgrA*that were monitored over about a decade. The stars appear to be in orbit around an empty spot in space. The one star with the shortest period, S2, (15.2 yr) singly provided enough information to resolve several key questions about the mysterious dark mass in the center of the Galaxy (Figure5).\n\nFigure 5:\n\nWhat is the dark mass?\n\nor\n\n?\n\nWhere is the dark mass?\n\nHow far is the dark mass?\n\nWhat is the dark mass?\n\nCan it be a compact, but non-singular distribution of dark objects? Any spherical distribution of mass will affect the motions of the stars as if it were all concentrated in the center, as long as they do not pass through it. Possible candidates range from dark stellar objects: stellar black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs or planets to particle dark matter, perhaps the same dark matter that is indirectly detected on cosmic scales. The good fit of the orbit of S2 to a Newtonian (Keplerian) orbit--a closed ellipse--implies that all the mass that is pulling on S2 (3.6 x 106solar masses, as derived from the orbital solution) is entirely enclosed inside the point of closest approach, 17 light-hours from the center. If it were not so, the orbit of S2 would have displayed signs of retrograde precession (rosette-like orbits) because the gravitational force on it would have deviated from exact r^-2 dependence. Such a tight upper limit on the volume containing the central mass rules out any dense cluster made of stellar mass objects on the grounds of dynamical stability (Maoz 1998). S2's orbit also rules out some elementary particle alternatives, such as the ``universal Fermi ball'', where all dark matter is explained by heavy fermionic particles, and where the central massive objects are in fact dense concentrations (``balls'') of fermions held against gravity by quantum degeneracy pressure (Munyaneza et al. 1998).The only remaining viable explanation for the dark central mass is that it is a black hole (Sch\u00f6del et al. 2002).\n\nWhere is the dark mass?\n\nUntil very recently there was no sign of accretion emission from the black hole in any other band apart for the radio. A blind search for the faint infrared emission that is expected to accompany the radio emission is very difficult because there are so many faint stars at the center. Stellar orbits can pinpoint the position of the black hole, since the measured projected acceleration vectors should all point to the central mass. The close proximity between the dynamically detected center of acceleration and the position of the recurrent infrared flares (Figure6) that were discovered a few years later was key evidence in confirming that the flares are indeed coming from an accreting massive black hole (Ghez et al. 2000).\n\nHow far is the dark mass?\n\nBecause we observe our Galaxy from the inside (Figure2), it is actually harder to reconstruct its structure than it is to reconstruct the structure of other galaxies seen from the outside. The distance of the solar system from the center of the Galaxy is a key parameter for Galactic cartography and for calibrating the luminosities of bright stars that can be used as ``standard candles'' to measure distances on cosmological scales. Stellar orbits can measure the distance to the MBH by a classical method long-used for measuring distances to binary stars (Salim and Gould 1999). The essence of the idea is that the motion of the star on the plane of the sky (the ``apparent motion'') is measured in terms of radians\/year, whereas the line-of-sight velocity is measured via the Doppler shift of the stellar spectrum in terms of km\/s. The orbital solution ties the angular and true velocities together through the distance to the black hole. The latest orbital determination fixes the distance to the Galactic center at 25000 +1000 light years (Eisenhauer et al. 2005).\n\nOne of the prime motivations for exploring the Galactic black hole is to observe General relativistic phenomena close to a super-massive object. The accretion luminosity is emitted by gas at distances only a few times larger than the event horizon (the strong-field limit). Not long after the center of acceleration was pinpointed, the black hole was finally revealed when it flared in the infrared (Figure6). Such flares are now known to be fairly frequent, occurring a few times per day, and typically lasting about an hour. It is thought that the flares are triggered by temporary peaks in the mass supply rate to the black hole, perhaps due to the presence of a denser than average clump of gas in the accretion flow. Two of these flares displayed an almost periodic fluctuation in their luminosity while the flare lasted (Figure7). The quasi-period of about 17 minutes is almost half as short as would be expected for gas orbiting at the last stable circular orbit of a 3.6 x 106 MO, non-spinning black hole. The black hole's spin affects the structure of space-time around it in a way that draws the last stable circular orbit closer and shortens its period. Thus, if indeed the flares arise from gas orbiting for a few periods close to the last stable orbit, and if the quasi-periodicity indeed reflects the orbital period, it is possible to translate the 17 minutes period to a lower limit the spin of the black hole, which must be spinning at half of its maximal possible value (Genzel et al. 2003a). This is not surprising; since the black hole absorbs the angular momentum of the matter that falls in it, it is expected to spin quite substantially. Thus, it is possible that the temporal structure of the flares is probing how space-time is twisted by the spinning black hole.\n\nFigure 6: First observed infrared (2.15 microns) flare from the Galactic black hole, as detected by the Very Large Telescope. The animation is looped: one cycle corresponds to half an hour (Genzel et al. 2003a). For more information see MPE's Galactic Center web page.\n\nFigure 7:A 17 minute quasi-period in the flux during an accretion flare, possibly originating in a hot clump of gas that orbits right at the last stable orbit for a few times before finally falling into the black hole. The period at the last stable orbit of a non-rotating black hole with the mass of the Galactic black hole is predicted by theory to be 27 minutes. The shorter 17 minutes period is explained by the fact that spacetime warps differently when the black spins, resulting in a smaller last stable orbit and a shorter orbital period. (Genzel et al. 2003a)\n\nTypical stars cannot approach the Galactic black hole as close as the emitting gas without being destroyed by the tidal field of the black hole. Thus, stars can mostly probe the weak-field limit of General relativity. Though less spectacular than the strong-field limit, stars orbiting a million solar mass class object at up to a few percents of the speed of light nevertheless probe a virtually unexplored regime of relativistic celestial mechanics. One effect that will be hopefully detected with continued monitoring is the slow-down of time near the black hole (gravitational red-shift), as expressed by the Doppler shift of the stellar spectra. This effect is substantially larger at the orbits' point of closest approach than it is on the surface of a white dwarf. Another effect that may be eventually detected is the advancing rosette-like orbits that are predicted by General Relativity (Figure7) as a consequence of the deviation from the Newtonian g-2 gravitational force law.\n\nFigure 8: A schematic comparison of a classical Newtonian orbit around a point central mass (red) and a General Relativistic one (blue). In Newtonian physics the gravitational force falls exactly as the distance squared, and the orbital ellipse closes on itself. Close enough to the central black hole General Relativistic effects deviating from Newton's law of gravitation cause the point of closest approach to advance, leading to a rosette-shaped orbit (blue).\n\nFigure 9: Gravito-hydrodynamic simulations of fast stellar collisions in the dense stellar cusp near a massive black hole. Left: two equal mass stars (orange) in a grazing collision are momentarily deformed and evaporate a few percents of their mass (yellow clouds). Right: A neutron star (blue) in a penetrating collision with a normal star.\n\nDynamical studies of the way stars respond to the growth and presence of a massive black hole in a galactic center all predict that the stellar density will grow toward the center and settle into a (formally) diverging, high density ``stellar cusp''. The observed stellar density near the black hole is about a billion times higher than near the Sun, and the stars move up to a 100 times faster relative to each other than they do elsewhere in the Galaxy (Alexander 1999; Genzel et al. 2003b). Such extreme and unique conditions effectively make the inner stellar cusp into a ``stellar collider'', where stellar properties can be probed when stars closely interact with each other or with the black hole. Many theoretical ideas involving stellar dynamics and stellar physics have been proposed to explain various aspects of the unusual stellar population that are observed near the Galactic black hole. The picture is still far from clear. We conclude this article by briefly mentioning just three of the many possible processes.\n\nTidal destruction\n\nStars that approach too close to the black hole are destroyed. They are either swallowed whole, or, as is more typical of the relatively small massive black hole in our Galaxy, first disrupted by the strong tidal field and then get accreted. Figure10 show a Gravito-hydrodynamic simulation of an extreme case of tidal disruption where the tidal ``squeeze'' raises the central density of the star by so much that the resulting accelerated nuclear reactions may cause the star to explode as a supernova (Carter and Luminet 1982).\n\nCollisional destruction\n\nPhysical star-star collisions (Figure9) are predicted to be frequent in the high-density cusp. Such destructive collisions may be responsible for the absence of bright, large giant stars in the very central region around the black hole (Figure3) (Alexander 1999).\n\nExchange interactions\n\nOne of the consequences of the steep gravitational potential around the black hole is ``mass segregation'', a dynamical process whereby massive stars tend to ``sink'' to the bottom of the potential well, whereas the light stars ``float'' out. As a consequence, the inner light-year of the Galaxy is expected to contain a large, dense cluster of stellar black holes (of about 10 MO). Such black holes may be responsible for the presence of young stars of about 10 MO very close to the black hole (S2 is one of them), by capturing there via the dynamical process of ``3-body exchange'' (Figure11), where the young star ``knocks out'' a stellar black hole of a similar mass and takes it's place (Alexander and Livio 2004).\n\nClick to see the animation in full size: Figure 10: A gravito-hydrodynamic simulation of an extreme tidal interaction between a star and a massive black hole, that may lead to a nuclear run-away and a supernova explosion. Top left: a view of the stellar trajectory (orange) around the black hole (red dot) from above the orbital plane. Top right: An edge-on view of the orbit. Note how the star (black blob) is squeezed into a two-dimensional pancake as it passes through the point of closest approach. Bottom: a plot of the changes in the central density as function of time. The higher the central density, the faster the nuclear reaction rate.\n\nFigure 11: A schematic depiction of a celestial billiards ball game. The orbit of a hot young star (blue dot following dashed trajectory) approaching close to the black hole (big central black dot) intersects with the tight orbit of a stellar mass black hole (small black dot following solid trajectory) of roughly the same mass. As a result of a 3-body exchange, the young star ``knocks'' the stellar black hole away (the interaction is gravitational--the two don't actually touch each other) and takes its place in a tight orbit very close to the massive black hole.\n\nThe Galactic black hole provides a uniquely accessible laboratory for studying in detail a massive black hole in its interactions with its environment: how it feeds and grows by accreting gas and stars and how the extreme density, high velocity and strong tidal fields affect the stars near it. The gas and stars probe the nature of the central dark mass and probe post-Newtonian gravity in the weak- and strong-field limits. These issues are relevant for understanding the massive black hole phenomenon in general. The wealth of observed phenomena near the Galactic black hole provides the impetus to study the physics of gas and stellar processes in such an extreme environment. These studies prove to be very fruitful, yielding valuable insights even in cases where they do not fully succeed to explain the observations (Alexander 2005). Many questions remain--the most exciting science still lies ahead.\n\nAbout the Author\n: Dr. Tal Alexander is a theoretical astrophysicist.

One of the possible explanations for this phenomenon is that the two populations of clusters have different spatial distributions. We test this idea by comparing clusters observed in unusually deep, high signal-to-noise images of M87 with a simulated globular cluster population in which the red and blue clusters have different spatial distributions, matching the observations. We compare the overall distribution of cluster effective radii as well as the relationship between effective radius and galactocentric distance for both the observed and simulated red and blue subpopulations. We find that the different spatial distributions does not produce a significant size difference between the red and blue subpopulations as a whole, or at a given galactocentric distance. These results suggest that the size difference between red and blue globular clusters is likely due to differences during formation or later evolution"}
{"text":"Researchers at the Institut d'Astrophysique de Canarias (IAC), the University of La Laguna (ULL) and the Center for Physics of the Cosmos of Aragon (CEFCA) have discovered a massive star cluster near the Earth.The new cluster, called Masgomas-1, has about 20,000 solar masses, twice the mass of Trumpler 14, the star cluster known to be closer to our planet. In the Milky Way at present only about a dozen of these massive clusters (of more than 10,000 solar masses) are known, and about a hundred are estimated to exist. It is these clusters that set the pace of star formation activity and are ideal for studying the structure and the processes taking place in our galaxy.\n\nMasgomas-1 is a massive open cluster that contains more than 60 young, massive stars held together by force of gravity. It is located in the Milky Way at 11,500 light years from Earth, towards the galactic center in the Scutum-Centaurus arm ( Scutum-Centarus ) and is somewhat remote from the base that connects the arm to the bar of the galaxy.\n\nStar clusters are groups of stars that formed in the same time from the same cloud of molecular gas and dust. Open clusters, such as the recently discovered Masgomas-1, contain fewer and younger stars and are less dense than other existing clusters such as the globular with higher density and hundreds of thousands of old stars (evolved). An open star cluster that can be seen with the naked eye from Earth are the Pleiades in the constellation Taurus.\n\nUntil recently, it was assumed that our galaxy, the Milky Way was forming stars at a slower pace than other galaxies that corresponded to it in size and features. It was, in terms of star formation, thought to be \"a lazy galaxy,\" says astrophysicist Artemio Herrero IAC.\n\nThis began to change in the mid-nineties, when they discoveries began to proliferate as a result of data taken in the infrared spectrum. \"The infrared light can pass through clouds of dust obscure the plane of our galaxy, which concentrates the formation of new stars. This formation is revealed by the most massive stars, which are short-lived, and thus mark the place where stars have recently formed or are forming yet, \"explains Smith.\n\nThe discovery of Masgomas-1 has been realized thanks to observations with the infrared spectrograph LIRIS, installed on the William Herschel Telescope of the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the IAC, La Palma. This discovery is part of a systematic search for massive clusters, developed by a team of astrophysicists at the IAC and CEFCA.\n\nThe findings of the study were published in the May issue of the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. are part of the doctoral thesis carried out at ULL Joy Sebastian Ramirez, directed by Smith, also a researcher of the IAC is a professor at the ULL, and Antonio Marin-Franch, CEFCA investigator.\n\nOur galaxy, a 'machine' to form stars\n\nInfrared data of recent years have uncovered new young star clusters and indicate that the Milky Way is actually a very efficient machine in the formation of new stars. As described by Joy Ramirez, IAC astrophysicist, \"our galaxy is vigorous and full of activity.\"\n\nWe will not know what level of star formation activity exists in the Milky Way until we have a complete idea of \u200b\u200bhow many clusters it contains. Clusters can take any size, but it is the more massive clusters that make for the star formation activity.There is an implicit consensus, but generalized to consider a very massive star cluster as if the combined mass of its stars exceeds 10,000 solar masses.\n\nDespite being very massive objects, hardly more than a dozen of these clusters are known in the Milky Way, but at least a hundred are expected to exist if we compare our results with other spiral galaxies. For this reason, Joy Ramirez says: \"The discovery of this massive cluster by our group is an important contribution to the census of massive clusters and gives a strong boost to our search method.\"\n\nThe search method uses IAC team star catalogs in the infrared (2MASS catalogs or as UKIDSS) to find clusters of stars (overdensities) in certain portions of the sky. \"Instead of making the search using all the stars in the catalog, first we filter photometry to stay with stars that could be of spectral type OB, ie massive stars, and then look for clusters. Thus, we find groups of candidates for massive stars, with the rest of the stars that surround it, are the candidate cluster, \"says the astrophysicist"}
{"text":"Milky Way's black hole gets extreme close-up\n\nThe Milky Way's central black hole may not be able to hide for much longer. Observations have been made three times closer to the centre of our galaxy than ever before, strengthening the case that a supermassive black hole lurks there.\n\nThe Milky Way's centre hosts a bright object called SgrA*, which may be a disc of swirling gas and dust surrounding a heavyweight black hole.\n\nMeasuring the size and shape of SgrA* could help confirm the existence of the black hole. But a blur of clouds between the galactic centre and the Earth has prevented astronomers from getting a clear view of the object's shape.\n\nNow, a team has managed to get three times closer than previous studies in viewing SgrA*. They did it by looking for the object's higher frequency radio signals, which cut through intervening gas and dust.\n\nLinked telescopes\n\nThe size of SgrA* suggests the matter it contains is about 10 times denser than previous measurements, bolstering the idea that the object harbours a black hole, says astronomer Sheperd Doeleman of MIT's Haystack Observatory: \"Our results are more evidence that we are looking at a black hole.\"\n\nTo image SgrA*, Doeleman and colleagues linked radio telescopes in Hawaii, Arizona, and California to create a telescope that was effectively 4500 kilometres wide. They used it to zoom in on the bright centre of the Milky Way with a resolution 1000 times that of Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nSo far, the team cannot produce dramatic pictures of SgrA*. But Doeleman says the technique could allow astronomers to clearly discern the shape of the disc within three to five years.\n\nThat's because future radio telescopes, such as Chile's Atacama Large Millimetre Array, due to become operational in 2010, will allow astronomers to use even shorter wavelengths to pierce through the galaxy's dust.\n\nBlack hole shadow\n\nThe images could reveal whether SgrA* has a 'shadow', a region in its centre where light is dimmed and reddened because it is pulled towards the black hole.\n\nIf SgrA* is indeed a disc of material swirling into the black hole, future observations could reveal how it is aligned.\n\nAstronomers expect it may not spin in the plane of the Milky Way, since that would hint that the black hole at the disc's centre is actually the result of the merger of two galaxies. After the galaxies merged, their central black holes would have united as well, and the galaxy's gravity might not have had enough time to pull the disc around them into alignment with the galactic disc.\n\nFurther observations could measure elusive features, like the black hole's spin, by tracking the progress of flares of radiation - created when matter collides with the black hole - that whip around as the black hole spinsMilky Way's Black Hole Gets Extreme Close-up\n\nWed Sep 03 22:07:44 BST 2008 by Chris Wininger\n\nGood science doesnt usually make good press.

There is controversy over virtually everything in Science. It is only bad press articles that claim certainty because it makes for attention grabbing headlines. Good science builds its case over time and is always subject to scrutiny. There is lots of evidence that there is a black hole at the center of our galaxy.

However, quantum mechanics is well established and places an upper limit on the pressure and temperature at which electrons can maintain themselves as separate entities before they are statistically \"all\" compressed into the nucleus, and simularly neutrons compressed into quark matter.\n\nPerhaps the object is a non-singularity with a radius under the radius of the computed event horizon, yet still not a real \"bkack hole\".\n\nRolls Eyes Yet Again\n\nThu Sep 04 06:06:55 BST 2008 by David Wilson\n\nEyeroller wrote:\n\n\"I find it truly amazing how many \"articles\" there are that are based on nothing than guesswork and overly active imaginations.\"\n\nThats how the leading edge of science works - \"overly active imaginations\" which come up with hypotheses, which suggest required observations\/testing.

{"text":"Release No.: 2005-31For Release: Thursday, September 22, 2005 Ferreting Out The First Stars Cambridge, MA - What did the very first stars look like? How did they live and die? Astronomers have ideas, but no proof. The first stars are so distant and formed so long ago that they are invisible to our best telescopes.\n\nUntil they explode. Hypernovas (more powerful cousins of supernovas) and their associated gamma-ray bursts offer astronomers the possibility of detecting light from the first generations of stars.\n\nNASA's Swift satellite already has seen a gamma-ray burst (GRB) with a redshift of 6.29, meaning that the progenitor star exploded about 13 billion years ago, when the universe was less than a billion years old. Theorists Volker Bromm (University of Texas at Austin) and Avi Loeb (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics) predict that one-tenth of the blasts Swift will spot during its operational lifetime will come from stars at a redshift of 5 or greater, that lived and died during the first billion years of the universe.\n\n\"Most of those GRBs will come from second generation or later stars,\" said Loeb. \"But if we get lucky, Swift may even detect a burst from one of the very first stars that formed -- a star made of only hydrogen and helium.\"\n\nCalculations suggest that such stars, which are called Population III for historical reasons, would have been behemoths weighing 50-500 times as much as the Sun. A Population III star would have gulped its nuclear fuel faster than an SUV, dying quickly and explosively.\n\n\"Our best guess right now is that the recent GRB was not from a Pop III star. However, its redshift is high enough to make it very interesting,\" said Bromm.\n\nOne key question examined by Bromm and Loeb is whether a Pop III star could have generated a GRB -- a blast powerful enough to be seen from a distance of more than 13 billion light-years.\n\nThe answer they derived is a qualified yes. Pop III stars were massive enough to explode violently, leaving behind a black hole in most cases. However, a Pop III star likely would have to be part of a tight binary system to generate a GRB.\n\nA close binary companion could strip the outer layers of a dying Pop III star, leaving less material to block the star's explosive death throes. Jets of material generated from the newborn black hole therefore could punch their way out more easily, creating a burst of gamma-ray energy detectable across the universe.\n\nAbout half of all nearby stars are members of binary or multiple star systems. The frequency of binaries, particularly close binaries, among Pop III stars remains unknown.\n\n\"Astronomers will address this question of the Pop III binary frequency using a dual approach, both observational and theoretical,\" said Bromm. \"By searching for high-redshift GRBs, we can constrain that number empirically. We also will try to improve simulations and make them detailed enough to model those details of star formation.\"\n\nIf binary star systems are common among Pop III stars, then high-redshift GRBs could offer astronomers an ideal opportunity to study the first generation of stars.\n\n\"If Pop III binaries are common, Swift will be the first observatory to probe Population III star formation at high redshifts,\" said Loeb.\n\nNote: This release is being issued jointly with The University of Texas at Austin"}

The work also confirms that the dramatic merging of two or more galaxies when they collide on the galactic highway is responsible for more recent galaxy evolution, such as disrupting their alignment and triggering bouts of intense star formation.\n\n\"It is very exciting to see this result from Galaxy Zoo \u2013 now it is time to go back to theory and simulations and understand better what it all means!\" says project leader Raul Jimenez.\n\nEarlier Galaxy Zoo results provide support for the theory that spiral galaxies which form in the same environment share the same spin direction, and that later interactions and merger events might randomise these spin directions.

{"text":"Friday, July 1, 2011\n\nGalaxies once thought of as voracious tigers are more like grazing cows, according to a new study using NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope.\n\nAstronomers have discovered that galaxies in the distant, early universe continuously ingested their star-making fuel over long periods of time. This goes against previous theories that the galaxies devoured their fuel in quick bursts after run-ins with other galaxies.\n\nThis split view shows how a normal spiral galaxy around our local universe (left) might have looked back in the distant universe, when astronomers think galaxies would have been filled with larger populations of hot, bright stars (right).\n\nNASA's Spitzer Space Telescope discovered that distant populations of galaxies formed massive, bright stars more commonly than today's \"diet-conscious\" galaxies. Such early galaxies would have been brighter, bluer and more irregular than spiral galaxies today due to the large proportion of massive stars.\n\nThe Spitzer observations also demonstrate that these distant galaxies fed off steady streams of gas, rather than bursts of gas stirred up from collisions with other galaxies.\n\nThis artist's rendering is derived from the Hubble image of NGC 1309.\nImage credit: NASA\/JPL-Caltech\/STScI\n\n\"Our study shows the merging of massive galaxies was not the dominant method of galaxy growth in the distant universe,\" said Ranga-Ram Chary of NASA's Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif. \"We're finding this type of galactic cannibalism was rare. Instead, we are seeing evidence for a mechanism of galaxy growth in which a typical galaxy fed itself through a steady stream of gas, making stars at a much faster rate than previously thought.\"\n\nChary is the principal investigator of the research, appearing in the Aug. 1 issue of the Astrophysical Journal. According to his findings, these grazing galaxies fed steadily over periods of hundreds of millions of years and created an unusual amount of plump stars, up to 100 times the mass of our sun.\n\n\"This is the first time that we have identified galaxies that supersized themselves by grazing,\" said Hyunjin Shim, also of the Spitzer Science Center and lead author of the paper. \"They have many more massive stars than our Milky Way galaxy.\"\n\nGalaxies like our Milky Way are giant collections of stars, gas and dust. They grow in size by feeding off gas and converting it to new stars. A long-standing question in astronomy is: Where did distant galaxies that formed billions of years ago acquire this stellar fuel? The most favored theory was that galaxies grew by merging with other galaxies, feeding off gas stirred up in the collisions.\n\nChary and his team addressed this question by using Spitzer to survey more than 70 remote galaxies that existed 1 to 2 billion years after the Big Bang (our universe is approximately 13.7 billion years old). To their surprise, these galaxies were blazing with what is called H alpha, which is radiation from hydrogen gas that has been hit with ultraviolet light from stars. High levels of H alpha indicate stars are forming vigorously. Seventy percent of the surveyed galaxies show strong signs of H alpha. By contrast, only 0.1 percent of galaxies in our local universe possess this signature.\n\nPrevious studies using ultraviolet-light telescopes found about six times less star formation than Spitzer, which sees infrared light. Scientists think this may be due to large amounts of obscuring dust, through which infrared light can sneak. Spitzer opened a new window onto the galaxies by taking very long-exposure infrared images of a patch of sky called the GOODS fields, for Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey.\n\nFurther analyses showed that these galaxies furiously formed stars up to 100 times faster than the current star-formation rate of our Milky Way. What's more, the star formation took place over a long period of time, hundreds of millions of years. This tells astronomers that the galaxies did not grow due to mergers, or collisions, which happen on shorter timescales. While such smash-ups are common in the universe -- for example, our Milky Way will merge with the Andromeda galaxy in about 5 billion years -- the new study shows that large mergers were not the main cause of galaxy growth. Instead, the results show that distant, giant galaxies bulked up by feeding off a steady supply of gas that probably streamed in from filaments of dark matter.\n\nChary said, \"If you could visit a planet in one of these galaxies, the sky would be a crazy place, with tons of bright stars, and fairly frequent supernova explosions"}
{"text":"Flickering Crab\n\nJust because a star is dead doesn't mean it isn't still interesting. In fact, some dead stars are a lot more interesting than the ones that are still tickin'.\n\nConsider an object known as the Crab Nebula. It's to the upper left of the Moon this evening, along one of the \"horns\" of Taurus, the bull. You need a telescope to see it, though, and even then it's little more than a hazy, jagged patch of light.\n\nThat wasn't the case in the year 1054, though. That year, a dazzling star appeared at that spot: a supernova -- a giant star that blasted itself to cosmic dust.\n\nMuch of that \"dust\" is still around -- it forms the nebula, which is spreading out as it expands into space. And at the center of the nebula is the star's crushed core -- a neutron star. It's more massive than the Sun, yet no bigger around than a city. It spins about 30 times a second, producing a flash of energy on each spin like a cosmic lighthouse.\n\nThe neutron star generates strong \"winds\" of electrically charged particles. When the wind rams into the gas and dust around it, it produces shock waves, which can sometimes produce powerful flares of X-rays and gamma rays. The flares can last for days.\n\nScientists can't fully explain how this process works, though. So they're using several space telescopes to keep a close eye on the Crab. They hope the telescopes can catch more of the flares -- powerful events that make this dead star one of the most interesting around"}
{"text":"Cosmic eye sheds light on early galaxy formation\n\nA Cosmic Eye has given scientists a unique insight into galaxy formation in the very early Universe.\n\nUsing gravity from a foreground galaxy as a zoom lens the team was able to see a young star-forming galaxy in the distant Universe as it appeared only two billion years after the Big Bang.\n\nScientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), USA, and Durham University and Cardiff University, UK, are behind the research published today (Thursday, October 9) in the prestigious scientific journal Nature.\n\nThe researchers, led by Dr Dan Stark, of Caltech, say their findings show for the first time how the distant galaxy might evolve to become a present-day system like our Milky Way.\n\nAnd they say their study also provides a taste of what astronomers will be able to see in the distant Universe once projects such as the planned European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) and the American Thirty Metre Telescope (TMT) come into use.\n\nThe Cosmic Eye is so called because the foreground galaxy, which is 2.2 billion light years from Earth, appears in the centre of an arc created by the distant galaxy \u2013 giving it the appearance of a human eye.\n\nThe distant galaxy, which lies 11 billion light years from Earth, was originally identified using the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nThe team then used the ten metre Keck telescope, on Hawaii, which is equipped with laser-assisted guide star adaptive optics (AO) to correct for blurring in the Earth's atmosphere, to carry out their observations.\n\nBy coupling the telescope with the magnifying effect of the gravitational field of the foreground galaxy \u2013 a technique called gravitational lensing - they were able to study the distant star system.\n\nGravitational lensing, the distortion of light rays by massive objects as predicted by Einstein, enlarged the distant galaxy by eight times.\n\nThis allowed the scientists to determine the galaxy's internal velocity structure and compare it to later star systems such as the Milky Way.\n\nResearch co-author Dr Mark Swinbank, in The Institute for Computational Cosmology, at Durham University, said: \"This is the most detailed study there has been of an early galaxy. Effectively we are looking back in time to when the Universe was in its very early stages.\n\n\"This technique of using gravitational lensing provides us with a glimpse of what we will commonly achieve when the next generation of telescopes, which are still a decade away, come on-line.\"\n\nDr Dan Stark, of Caltech, said: \"Gravity has effectively provided us with an additional zoom lens, enabling us to study this distant galaxy on scales approaching only a few hundred light years.\n\n\"This is ten times finer sampling than previously. As a result for the first time we can see that a typical-sized young galaxy is spinning and slowly evolving into a spiral galaxy much like our own Milky Way.\"\n\nData from the Keck Observatory was combined with millimetre observations from the Plateau de Bure Interferometer, in the French Alps, which is sensitive to the distribution of cold gas destined to collapse to form stars.\n\nDr Swinbank added: \"Remarkably the cold gas traced by our millimetre observations shares the rotation shown by the young stars in the Keck observations.\n\n\"The distribution of gas seen with our amazing resolution indicates we are witnessing the gradual build up of a spiral disk with a central nuclear component"}
{"text":"How are stars formed?\n\nUp Next\n\nHow are stars formed?\n\nIt's easy to see why so many world religions deify the sun. It powers life on Earth and holds our entire solar system together. Yet despite all its awe-inspiring brilliance, the sun's formation follows a specific pattern of cosmic happenstance.\n\nLike so many things in the universe, stars begin very small --When the protostar becomes hot enough (7 million kelvins), its hydrogen atoms begin to fuse, producing helium and an outflow of energy in the process. We call this atomic reaction nuclear fusion. However, the outward push of its fusion energy is still weaker than the inward pull of gravity at this point in the star's life. Think of it like a struggling business that still costs more to operate than it makes.\n\nMaterial continues to flow into the protostar, providing increased mass and heat. Finally, after millions of years, some of these struggling stars reach the tipping point. If enough mass (0.1 solar mass) collapses into the protostar, a bipolar flow occurs. Two massive gas jets erupt from the protstar and blast the remaining gas and dust clear away from its fiery surface.\n\nAt this point, the young star stabilizes and, like a business that finally becomes lucrative, it reaches the point where its output exceeds its intake. The outward pressure from hydrogen fusion now counteracts gravity's inward pull. It is now a main sequence star and will remains so until it burns through all its fuel.\n\nWhat is the life span of a star? It all depends on its mass. A star the size of our sun takes roughly 50 million years to reach main sequence and maintains that level for approximately 10 billion years [source: NASA]. Astronomers classify the sun as a g-type main sequence star -- the \"g\" indicates the sun's temperature and color.\n\nLarger, brighter stars burn out far faster, however. Wolf-Rayet stars boast masses at least 20 times that of the sun and burn 4.5 times as hot, yet go supernova within a few million years of reaching main sequence [source: NASA].\n\nExplore the links on the next page to learn even more about life and death in the cosmos."}

This cosmic pair is set against millions of glowing stars from the brightest part of the Milky Way -- a region so dense with stars that barely any dark sky is seen across the picture. Credit: ESO\n\nThis part of the constellation of Sagittarius (The Archer) is one of the richest star fields in the whole sky -- the Large Sagittarius Star Cloud.\n\nThe at ESO's La Silla Observatory in Chile.\n\nThis object, a small, isolated dark nebula known as a Bok globule [1], was described as \"a drop of ink on the luminous sky\" by its discoverer Edward Emerson Barnard [2], an American astronomer who discovered and photographed numerous comets, dark nebulae, one of Jupiter's moons, and made many other contributions. An exceptional visual observer and keen astrophotographer, Barnard was the first to use long-exposure photography to explore dark nebulae.\n\nThrough a small telescope Barnard 86 looks like a dearth of stars, or a window onto a patch of distant, clearer sky. However, this object is actually in the foreground of the star field -- a cold, dark, dense cloud made up of small dust grains that block starlight and make the region appear opaque. It is thought to have formed from the remnants of a molecular cloud that collapsed to form the nearby star cluster NGC 6520, seen just to the left of Barnard 86 in this image.\n\nNGC 6520 is an open star cluster that contains many hot stars that glow bright blue-white, a telltale sign of their youth. Open clusters usually contain a few thousand stars that all formed at the same time, giving them all the same age. Such clusters usually only live comparatively short lives, on the order of several hundred million years, before drifting apart.\n\nThe incredible number of stars in this area of the sky muddles observations of this cluster, making it difficult to learn much about it. NGC 6520's age is thought to be around 150 million years, and both this star cluster and its dusty neighbour are thought to lie at a distance of around 6000 light-years from our Sun.\n\nThe stars that appear to be within Barnard 86 in the image above are in fact in front of it, lying between us and the dark cloud. Although it is not certain whether this is still happening within Barnard 86, many dark nebulae are known to have new stars forming in their centres -- as seen in the famous Horsehead Nebula (eso0202 -  the striking object Lupus 3 (eso1303) and to a lesser extent in another of Barnard's discoveries, the Pipe Nebula (eso1233 -  However, the light from the youngest stars is blocked by the surrounding dusty regions, and they can only be seen in infrared or longer-wavelength light.\n\nNotes\n\n[1] Bok globules were first observed in the 1940s by astronomer Bart Bok.

{"text":"Release No.: 2006-04For Release: Monday, January 09, 2006 Scientists Find Black Hole's 'Point of No Return' Washington, DC - By a score of 135 to zero, scientists using NASA's Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer have compared suspected neutron stars and black holes and found that the black holes behaved as if each one has an event horizon, the theoretical border from beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.\n\nThe team found that X-ray light emitted from these two types of regions behaved differently. As expected, the neutron stars appeared to have a hard surface, which erupts in an X-ray explosion every several hours. The black holes appeared to have no surface. Matter falling toward the black hole seems to disappear into the void.\n\nRon Remillard of the MIT Kavli Institute in Cambridge, Mass., led the analysis and discusses his team's result today at a press conference at the 207th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington. His colleagues are Dacheng Lin of MIT, and Randall Cooper and Ramesh Narayan of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge.\n\n\"Event horizons are invisible by definition, so it seems impossible to prove their existence,\" said Remillard. \"Yet by looking at objects that pull in gas, we can infer whether that gas crashes and accumulates onto a hard surface or just quietly vanishes. For the group of suspected black holes we studied, there is a complete absence of surface explosions called X-ray bursts. The gas that would fuel such bursts appears to vanish.\"\n\nUsing the Rossi Explorer, the team observed all of the transient sources that have appeared in the X-ray sky over the last nine years. In all of these sources, a suspected neutron star or black hole accretes gas from a companion star in a tight binary system.\n\nGas can accumulate on a neutron star surface. When conditions are ripe, the gas will ignite in a thermonuclear explosion that is visible as a one-minute event called a type I X-ray burst. The suspected black holes - that is, the more massive types of compact objects in this study - behave as if they had no surface and were located behind event horizons.\n\nThe idea of using the absence of X-ray bursts to confirm the presence of event horizons in black holes was proposed in 2002 by Narayan and Jeremy Heyl of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.\n\n\"It was a very simple but powerful idea,\" said Narayan. \"Type I bursts are easy to identify, and we can compare burst statistics with the quantitative predictions of our burst model for a variety of compact objects with a hard surface. With this new analysis, the argument for black hole event horizons has become much stronger.\"\n\nBlack holes form when very massive stars run out of fuel. Without energy to support its mass, the star implodes. If the star is over 25 times more massive than our sun, the core will collapse to a point of infinite density with no surface.\n\nWithin a boundary of about 50 miles from the black hole center in all directions, gravity is so strong that not even light can escape its pull. This boundary is the theoretical event horizon. Slightly less massive stars - about 10 to 25 solar masses - will collapse into compact spheres about 10 miles across, called neutron stars. These objects have a hard surface and no event horizon.\n\nBlack holes and their neutron star cousins are sometimes located in binary systems, orbiting a relatively normal star companion. Gas from these stars, lured by gravity, can flow toward the compact object. This process, called accretion, releases large amounts of energy, predominantly in the form of X-rays, as gas moves quickly and heats to high temperatures.\n\nTwo important aspects of this new study are the ability to model the conditions that produce X-ray bursts and to count the neutron star bursts as a function of the amount of gas raining down on the surface. The extensive computer modeling separates this analysis from similar comparisons in recent years. The model predictions computed for neutron stars roughly matched the measured burst rate function for the neutron star group. This increased the scientists' confidence that they have a reasonably good model for X-ray bursts, while decreasing the chance that the heavy compact objects can somehow hide their bursts if they did have a hard surface.\n\nThe Rossi Explorer, launched on December 30, 1995, is managed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md"}
{"text":"A neutron star is a type of degenerate star composed mostly of densely packed neutrons, generally about 25 km in diameter and as massive as an average star. Stars that are more than about 8 times more massive at birth than the Sun collapse into neutron stars when they become supernovae. Neutron stars thus represent a middle ground between white dwarfs and black holes. Neutron stars were among the first major astronomical objects whose existence was first predicted from theory (1933) and later (1967) found to exist, at first as radio pulsars.\n\nContents\n\nStructure\n\nNeutron stars have a typical mass about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun. Their size (radius) is of order 12 km, about 60,000 times smaller than the Sun. So a neutron star's mass is packed in a volume 60,0003; or approximately 2x1014 times smaller than the Sun and the average mass density can be 1014 times higher than the density in the Sun. Such densities have yet to be produced in the laboratory. In fact, the density of a neutron star is about the density of an atomic nucleus.\n\nDue to its small size and high density, a neutron star possesses a surface gravitational field about 2\u00d71011 times that of Earth. One of the measures for the gravity is the escape velocity, the velocity one would need to give an object, such that it can escape from the gravitational field into infinity. For a neutron star, such velocities are typically 150,000 km\/s, about 1\/2 of the velocity of light. Conversely: an object falling onto the surface of a neutron star would strike the star also at 150,000 km\/s. To put this in perspective, if an average human were to encounter a neutron star, he or she would impact with roughly the energy yield of a 100 megatonnuclear explosion.\n\nNeutron stars are one of the few possible endpoints of stellar evolution. They are formed in a supernova as the collapsed remnant of a massive star (a Type II or Ib\/c supernova).\n\nNeutron stars are typically about 25km in diameter, have greater than 1.4 times the mass of our Sun (the Chandrasekhar limit, below which they would be white dwarfs instead) and less than about 3 times the mass of our Sun (otherwise they would be black holes), and spin very rapidly (one revolution can take anything from thirty seconds to one six-hundredth of a second).\n\nCurrent understanding of the structure of neutron stars is defined by existing mathematical models, which of course are subject to revision. Based on current models, the matter at the surface of a neutron star is composed of ordinary nuclei as well as electrons. The \"atmosphere\" of the star is roughly one meter thick, below which one encounters a solid \"crust\". Proceeding inward, one encounters nuclei with ever increasing numbers of neutrons; such nuclei would quickly decay on Earth, but are kept stable by tremendous pressures. Proceeding deeper, one comes to a point called neutron drip where free neutrons leak out of nuclei. In this region we have nuclei, free electrons, and free neutrons. The nuclei become smaller and smaller until the core is reached, by definition the point where they disappear altogether. The exact nature of the superdense matter in the core is still not well understood. While this theoretical substance is referred to as neutronium in science fiction and popular literature, the term \"neutronium\" is rarely used in scientific publications, due to ambiguity over its meaning. The term neutron-degenerate matter is sometimes used, though that term incorporates assumptions about the nature of neutron star core material. Neutron star core material could be a superfluid mixture of neutrons with a few protons and electrons, or it could incorporate high-energy particles like pions and kaons in addition to neutrons, or it could be composed of strange matter incorporating quarks heavier than up and down quarks, or it could be quark matter not bound into hadrons. However so far observations have neither indicated nor ruled out such exotic states of matter.\n\nHistory of discoveries\n\nIn 1933 Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky (Phys. Rev. 45 \"Supernovae and Cosmic rays\") proposed the existence of the neutron star, only a year after Chadwick's discovery of the neutron. In seeking an explanation for the origin of a supernova, they proposed that the neutron star is formed in a supernova. Supernovae are suddenly appearing new stars in the sky, whose luminosity in the optical might outshine an entire galaxy for days to weeks. Baade and Zwicky correctly proposed at that time that the release of the gravitational binding energy of the neutron stars powers the supernova: \"In the supernova process mass in bulk is annihilated\". If the central part of a massive star before its collapse contains (for example) 3 solar masses, then a neutron star of 2 solar masses can be formed. The binding energy E of such a neutron star, when expressed in mass units via E=mc\u00b2, is the equivalence of 1 solar mass. It is ultimately this energy that powers the supernova.\n\nIn 1967 Jocelyn Bell and Anthony Hewish discover radio pulses from a pulsar, later interpreted as originating from an isolated, rotating neutron star. The energy source is rotational energy of the neutron star. The largest number of known neutron stars are of this type.\n\nIn 1971 Riccardo Giacconi, Herbert Gursky, Ed Kellogg, R. Levinson, E. Schreier, and H. Tananbaum discover 4.8 second pulsations in an X-ray source in the constellation Centaurus, Cen X-3. They interpret this as resulting from\na rotating hot neutron star in orbit around another star. The energy source is gravitational and results from a rain of gas falling onto the surface of\nthe neutron star.\n\nSome neutron stars that can be observed\n\nX-ray burster - a neutron star with a low mass binary companion from which matter is accreted resulting in irregular bursts of energy from the surface of the neutron star.\n\nPulsar - general term for neutron stars that emit directed pulses of radiation towards us at regular intervals due to their strong magnetic fields.\n\nNeutron stars rotate extremely rapidly after their creation due to the conservation of angular momentum; like an ice skater pulling in his or her arms, the slow rotation of the original star's core speeds up as it shrinks. A their own immense gravity (an equatorial bulge).\n\nOver time, neutron stars slow down because their rotating magnetic fields radiate energy; older neutron stars may take several seconds for each revolution.\n\nThe rate at which a neutron star slows down its rotation is usually constant and very small: the observed rates are between 10-10 and 10-21 second for each rotation. In other words, for a typical slow down rate of 10-15 seconds per rotation, then a neutron star now rotating in 1 second will rotate in 1.000003 seconds after a century, or 1.03 seconds after 1 million years.\n\nSometimes a neutron star will undergo a glitch: a rapid and unexpected increase of its rotation speed (of the same, extremely small scale as the constant slowing down). Glitches are thought to be the effect of a sudden coupling between the superfluid interior and the solid crust.\n\nNeutron stars also have very intense magnetic fields - typically about 1012 times stronger than Earth's. Neutron stars may \"pulse\" due to particle acceleration near the magnetic poles, which are not aligned with the rotation axis of the star. Through mechanisms not yet entirely understood, these particles produce coherent beams of radio emission. External viewers see these beams as pulses of radiation whenever the magnetic pole sweeps past the line of sight. The pulses come at the same rate as the rotation of the neutron star, and thus, appear periodic. Neutron stars which emit such pulses are called pulsars.\n\nPulsars\n\nWhen pulsars were first discovered, the fast time scale of radio pulses (about 1 s, uncommon to astronomy in the 1930s) was\nhalf-seriously considered to be caused by extraterrestrial intelligence, later jokingly referred to as LGM-1, for \"Little Green Men.\" The discovery of many pulsars, spread all over the sky with different rotation periods quickly excluded this option.\nThe discovery of a pulsar associated with the Vela supernova remnant, soon followed by the further discovery of a pulsar which appeared to be powering the Crab Nebula, produced compelling arguments for the neutron star interpretation.\n\nMagnetars\n\nAnother class of neutron star, known as the magnetar, exists. These have a magnetic field of about 100 gigateslas, strong enough to wipe a credit card on Earth from the Moon's orbit. By comparison, the Earth's natural magnetic field is about 60 microteslas. A small neodymium based rare earth magnet has a field of about a tesla, and most media used for data storage can be erased with milliteslas.\n\nMagnetars occasionally produce bursts of X-ray emission. About once per decade, a magnetar somewhere in the Galaxy produces a giant flare of gamma-rays. Magnetars have long rotation periods, typically 5 to 12 seconds, because their strong magnetic fields have caused them to slow down."}
{"text":"massive black holes...\n\nI am not trying to be ATM or anything, I always get these question after I was Supermassive Blackholes. In trying to get a progressive visual of the universe I start with a star the size of our sun. After it is finished it collapses into a white dwarf about the size of the Earth.\n\nIn stars with more than 4 times the mass of our sun, become a supernova then collapse into Neutron stars which are drastically smaller, and far more dense then a white dwarf.\n\nStars more than ten times the mass of our sun become a supernova then collapse into black holes.\n\nBoth stars more than 4 times the mass of our sun and stars more than 10 times the mass of our sun produce next generation stars. Wouldn't the logical path to study be that supermassive black holes are the remnants of stars more massive than we can imagine? In the program it discusses the relationship between each galaxy and it's core supermassive black whole. The evidence, as presented in the show, at least, suggests that the Supermassive Blackhole triggered the collapse of gas into stars thus creating the galaxies we know today. Am I correct in remembering assuming that the more massive the star, the older it is? If so, why is it impossible to conclude that galaxies, like stellar nurseries are not the result of some emmense star, that collapsed into a supermassive black hole and leaving plenty more nebula to form it's surrounding stars?\n\nThis is where it sounds like I am really trying to be ATM but in all seriousness, I am asking why it is wrong. Assuming that far more intellectual minds have probably explored this idea, I feel safe to say that there are reasons why my idea doesn't fit and I am asking for those reasons. Why is the possibility not mentioned that all the galaxies in the universe are not products of bigger collapses?\n\nMuch information has been gained and a understanding of what drives a galaxy has been well tested. Star forming nebular and exploding stars have all been well documented and much study of these objects has been under taken. Your giant nova does not fit the information we see for the formation of galaxies and or the planetary disks within them. Not all stars are born out of Nova events or the resultant shock waves. The super massive black hole at the core of most galaxies is not what started the galaxy. It is a buy product of all that gravity and mass. Just as the planetary disk may give birth to all the planets and the central star of any solar system. One does not rule out the other. Gravity mass and density all play there roll in this creation of the systems. Stability came later.\n\nAm I correct in remembering assuming that the more massive the star, the older it is?\n\nNo this is not correct. Massive stars live short lives, and all stars lose mass throughout their lives.\n\nOne possible (hand-waving) explanation for SMBHs is that huge amounts of matter collapsed to try and form a hypermassive star early in the history of the universe, and that the material blown out of that star itself turned into massive stars, many of which were in orbits that brought them back into the original giant star, but now gravitationally bound to tightly to be blown away by Eddington pressure. The original star was probably a large stellar mass black hole by this time, and over a few tens of millions of years grew by the consumption of inbound stars, neutron stars and stellar mass black holes (no time for white dwarfs to form).Wouldn't the logical path to study be that supermassive black holes are the remnants of stars more massive than we can imagine?\n\nThere may be technical physical reasons for a maximum size star. There are also observational constraints. But it seems there were some very big stars very early in the universe's history. Still, some supermassive black holes are hundreds of millions of solar masses. It is extremely unlikely these formed out of a single star. More likely they are due to mergers.\n\nAfter all is said and speculated, this large question of early structure formation in the universe is an ongoing unsolved problem in astrophysics. If you figure it out and receive a Nobel prize, I hope you'll mention that you used the BAUT Forum as a sounding board for your early ideas.\n\nI believe I've seen the show(s) you are referring to, they were titled \"Supermassive Black Holes\". There are actually two versions of the show with basically the same infomation but different narrations and slightly different interviews and graphics.\n\nIt seems that the shows have been dated somewhat by newer research, things can change fast in this field. I don't think there's strong consensus about the details of early galaxy formation yet. It does seem that large black holes may have been instrumental in the formation of some, but not all, galaxies. Basically an early supermassive star could have gone supernova and produced the original BH. The black hole would have been large, but not yet a SMBH. The original supernova could have helped trigger star formation in the early galaxy. That's not saying that the galaxy would not have formed without the trigger, just that it helped it along. Those galaxies would have been small compared to the Milky Way, but those galaxies could have combined, resulting in the central BH getting larger and larger along with the surrounding galaxy.\n\nThat scenario may, or may not, help explain the close relation between the size of the central SMBH and the surrounding galaxy. The show implied a more direct relationship, that the orignal SN directly produced a larger galaxy right from the start.\n\nOne side note is that a star which collapses to a white dwarf,\nneutron star, or black hole always or almost always loses a large\nfraction of its mass (often well over half its mass) before and\/or\nduring the collapse. The material may form a planetary nebula\nor other supernova remnant (SNR). This material of course is\nwhat eventually is incorporated into later generations of stars.\nPlease look up the details elsewhere."}

I don't think I'll be going too far out on a limb to speculate about the nature of their discovery.\n\nGarth Illingworth and Rychard Bouwens investigate galaxies that are as far out as we can see. One of the most fundamental tenets of modern astronomy is that objects distant from us in space are equally distant from us in time. When we see objects that are billions of light years distant, we are seeing them as they were billions of years ago. A telescope is essentially a time machine, and very powerful ones like the Hubble can reach back to the very earliest epochs of the universe's 13.75 billion-year history. Dr. Bouwens has a very nice web site here talking about his work with these first galaxies.\n\nA very quick summary of some of those early epochs:\n\n\u2022 After the Big Bang, the expanding universe is so hot that its matter is ionized. Electrons are too energetic to settle down and combine with atomic nuclei, and these free electrons scatter light willy-nilly in all directions. As a result, the universe is opaque.\n\u2022 About 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe has cooled enough for electrons to recombine with nuclei to form neutral atoms (mostly hydrogen). Light is now free to move through space unimpeded, and the universe is now transparent. The light from this era of recombination is what we see as the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\u2022 There follows a period known as the \"dark ages,\" because there is no source of light other than the fading cosmic background radiation. Over time, clumps of slightly denser matter grow and eventually become dense enough to ignite nuclear reactions at their cores\u2014the first stars are born. The time for this era of reionization is thought to be around 500 million years after the Big Bang, or to put it another way, when the universe was less than 4% of its current age.\n\nSo what am I betting on? It is that Drs. Illingworth and Bouwens have reached all the way back to this early era to see one of the very first galaxies, containing some of the very first stars. This would be a remarkable achievement, and would be possible only because of the newly refurbished Hubble instruments installed by Space Shuttle astronauts in 2009.\n\nThis is fascinating stuff, in many ways beyond the comprehension of a layman such as me. But if nothing else, it tells us that there is so much \"out there\" that we are still learning about \u2014 and that we must be open to all manner of revelations and explanations, not constrained by rigid, narrow \"beliefs\" like those that are held on Candler's Mountain and elsewhere\u2026."}
{"text":"Infant Stars\nBaby stars glow reddish-pink in this infrared image of the Serpens star-forming region, captured by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. Our sun may have looked like one of these baby stars when it formed 4.5 billion years ago. NASA\/JPL-Caltech\/L. Cieza (University of Texas at Austin\n\nWe are all star stuff, as Carl Sagan once so eloquently put it--we come from remnants, the leftover pieces of long-dead stars and the elements forged inside of them. But a new theory says we came together as the result of a slow agglomeration, not a titanic explosion. Our solar system was born like a snowdrift on a blustery day, particles slowly clustering together in ever-increasing groups until something notable forms.\n\nThis flies in the face of most solar system formation scholarship, which holds that shockwaves from a nearby supernova triggered the collapse of the dust cloud that eventually became our star and our planets. Computer models and 3-D simulations have confirmed that theory for at least the past couple of years. Now comes a new analysis of heavy elements by researchers at the University of Chicago.\n\nTags\n\nAuthors Haolan Tang and Nicolas Dauphas looked at concentrations of iron-60, a radioactive isotope of the metal that forms in an exploding star. Previous research has found high levels of this material in meteorites, early solar system leftovers that serve sort of like time capsules. An abundance of iron-60 is strong evidence for a supernova in the nearby cosmic neighborhood.\n\nBut Tang and Dauphas say it is well-mixed and in low abundance in our solar system, which casts doubt on that assumption. Tang and Dauphas examined the same meteorites, but used a different method--dissolving the meteorites to examine their contents--which reportedly reduced their error rates. To double-check it, they also looked for iron-58, an isotope that supernovas also produce. That isotope is also sparsely distributed, which confirmed the scarcity of iron-60 because the isotopes are so closely related.\n\nIf they're right, and there's not an abundance of iron-60, then there's no need to say a supernova shockwave collapsed our nascent solar system's dust cloud. So what did provide the push? Perhaps a massive star shed its gassy outer layers, spewing the material that would eventually become our solar system, according to these researchers. These materials coalesced and formed our sun, with some remaining mass eventually becoming the planets.\n\nIt remains to be seen how other planetary geologists will feel about this new wrinkle. But iron abundances will have to be taken into account when scientists try to describe how we got here, Tang said. The paper appears in Earth and Planetary Science Letters.\n\n10 Comments\n\nNeanderthals dominated the Earth landscape for 250,000 years and live in groups of 5 to 10. They made weapons and tools and yes had vocal cords. The style of how they lived remained mostly unchanged for their existence on Earth.\n\nThen unlike evolutions style the modern human shows up, communicating better, making tools better, dominates the landscape and eliminates the Neanderthal. Yes some tiny interbreeding did happen between Neanderthals and modern human; this is in our genes.\n\nThere is still no scientific explanation for the sudden existance of humans. It was as if, POOF, we were created from a more intelligent source from above\\GODS.\n\nWhich bring me back to what was taught to the Sumerians? Their writing history came from beings from above and their stories have no prior history, so are not passed down myths.\n\nIf you want to understand the making of the solar system, Earth and Gods, look so the Sumerian text; its all there.\n\nBy the way, if you just accept for one second an outside source tweak the Neanderthal gene to make a human, they science continues to be correct and evolution past is correct too. It all fits together nicely.\n\nPerhaps. It is actually easier to predict the 60Fe and 26Al results from a sequential process in the nascent molecular cloud, where the 60Fe is produced by rapid, ~ 10 Ma, 1st gen supernovas and the 26Al is produced by slower, ~ 100 Ma, 2nd gen massive stars akin to proposed here. [ http is  ]\n\n@Robot: You are trolling, since your comment on biology has nothing to do with the article on astronomy.\n\nYou are also lying, likely willfully so, because human ancestry has a well known explanation, evolution. It is no different than other organisms. We even know the ancestral species (H. heidelbergensis.)\n\nIt isn't easy to correct a fractally wrong comment, but here goes:\n\nNeanderthals were coexisting with anatomically modern humans, as was Denisovans, look it up, and _all of them_ ended up in the genome that constitutes humans today. We were all human apes before and after, the distinguishing characteristics to non-human apes diverging way before. Yes, you can look that up too.\n\nThe 2nd gen massive star 26Al seeder is important because of what the linked paper describes. Such a spherical shell it blows up, creating ~ 600 stars together with the Sun, predicts the outer characteristics of the solar system: the Kuiper belt outer dimensions, some of its specific objects, and the Oort cloud size.\n\nThese are exactly the missing characteristics that the Nice model with the 5th giant modification _can't_ predict! (The inner terrestrials, as well as their ice line & carbon line, are of course best predicted by specific disk aggregation models.)\n\nSo any which way, we now have good handles on how the whole system arose. That is clearly some awesome astronomical archaeology!\n\nD13,\nYes I do get excited, lol, that current science suggests possibilities there is intelligent life in the cosmos and just didn't exist currently as the idea popped into their heads now in science, but existed long before, too.\n\nJust considering the vast distances in space and if one old intelligence in the cosmic void had the ability to travels about the cosmos, they could easily live to be very old and have visited us often in the extreme past, recent past and current times.\n\nAnd as modern humans tweak with DNA now, it would have been Childs play for a super cosmic traveling intellect.\n\nLife around us in the ever so small and the great cosmos is just WoWzers and just Amazing!!\n\nTorbj\u00f6rn Larsson_OM, the Sumerians invented writing and do you think in this first invention of the hard work of putting their thoughts on stone, they just recorded fantasy made up stories or would it be more likely from such a highly intelligence culture, they recorded what was most important to them, the realities to be recorded in stone for future generations to know..\n\nTraditionally when a person decided to tell another person a fictional story, they tell them in advance this is fictional story and when it is history, they say hey this is history and true. The Sumerians wrote down their history as true and they have a real account of the making of our solar system as they were told from being that came from above.\n\nI just wish our current scientist would read the Sumerian account of our history and then feed it into their super computers and see how that pans out. That would be an interesting read"}
{"text":"Three thousand light-years away, a dying star throws off shells of glowing gas. This image from the Hubble Space Telescope reveals the Cat's Eye Nebula to be one of the most complex planetary nebulae known. In fact, the features seen in the Cat's Eye are so complex that astronomers suspect the bright central object may actually be a binary star system. The term planetary nebula, used to describe this general class of objects, is misleading. Although these objects may appear round and planet-like in small telescopes, high resolution images reveal them to be stars surrounded by cocoons of gas blown off in the late stages of stellar evolution.\n\nA nearby star has exploded and telescopes all over the world are turning to monitor it. The supernova, dubbed PTF 11kly, was discovered by computer only two days ago as part of the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) sky survey utilizing the wide angle 1.2-meter Samuel Oschin Telescope in California. Its rapid recovery makes it one of the supernovas caught most soon after ignition. PTF 11kly occurred in the photogenic Pinwheel galaxy (M101), which, being only about 21 million light years away, makes it one of the closest supernovas seen in decades. Rapid follow up observations have already given a clear indication that PTF 11kly is a Type Ia supernova, a type of white dwarf detonation that usually progresses in such a standard manner than it has helped to calibrate the expansion history of the entire universe. Studying such a close and young Type Ia event, however, may yield new and unique clues. If early indications are correct, PTF 11kly should brighten to about visual magnitude 10 in the coming weeks, making it possible to monitor with even moderately sized telescopes.\n\nWhile hunting for comets in the skies above 18th century France, astronomer Charles Messier diligently kept a list of the things he encountered that were definitely not comets. This is number 27 on his now famous not-a-comet list. In fact, 21st century astronomers would identify it as a planetary nebula, but it's not a planet either, even though it may appear round and planet-like in a small telescope. Messier 27 (M27) is an excellent example of a gaseous emission nebula created as a sun-like star runs out of nuclear fuel in its core. The nebula forms as the star's outer layers are expelled into space, with a visible glow generated by atoms excited by the dying star's intense but invisible ultraviolet light. Known by the popular name of the Dumbbell Nebula, the beautifully symmetric interstellar gas cloud is over 2.5 light-years across and about 1,200 light-years away in the constellation Vulpecula. This impressive color composite highlights details within the well-studied central region and fainter, seldom imaged features in the nebula's outer halo. It includes narrowband images recorded using filters sensitive to emission from oxygen atoms, shown in blue-green hues, and hydrogen atoms in red.\n\nThe Great Nebula in Orion, also known as M42, is one of the most famous nebulae in the sky. The star forming region's glowing gas clouds and hot young stars are near the center of this colorful deep sky image that includes the smaller nebula M43 and dusty, bluish reflection nebulae NGC 1977 and friends on the left. Located at the edge of an otherwise invisible giant molecular cloud complex, these eye-catching nebulae represent only a small fraction of this galactic neighborhood's wealth of interstellar material. Captured with very modest equipment, the gorgeous skyscape was awarded Best in Show at the 2009 Starfest International Salon of Astrophotography. Judges commented that the detail and shading were exquisite in this version of a classic astronomical image. The field spans nearly 3 degrees or about 75 light-years at the Orion Nebula's estimated distance of 1,500 light-years.\n\nStars come in bunches. Of the over 200 globular star clusters that orbit the center of our Milky Way Galaxy, 47 Tucanae is the second brightest globular cluster (behind Omega Centauri). Light takes about 13,000 years to reach us from 47 Tuc which can be seen on the sky near the Small Magellanic Cloud in the southern constellation of Tucana. Also known as NGC 104, the dense cluster is made up of several million stars in a volume only about 120 light-years across. The cluster's red giant stars are particularly easy to see in this picture. The globular cluster is also home to exotic x-ray binary star systems.\n\nThis coming Tuesday, our Moon will appear to disappear. A similar total lunar eclipse is seen above in a time lapse image captured in 2003 over North Carolina, USA. As the Earth moves between the Moon and the Sun, the Earth's shadow fell on the moon, making it quite dark. In the above picture the Earth's rotation, multiple exposures, and digital enhancements are used to create a time-lapse effect that dramatizes how the Moon looked as it faded out and re-appeared during the three hour lunar eclipse. As the Earth's shadow engulfed the Moon, the lunar images became less and less bright, practically disappearing during totality. At this time, the Moon, which normally shines by reflecting direct sunlight, shone only by sunlight refracted through the Earth's atmosphere. The next total lunar eclipse won't be visible from Earth until February 2008.\n\nGet out your red\/blue glasses and check out this stereo scene from Taurus-Littrow valley on the Moon! The color anaglyph features a detailed 3D view of Apollo 17's Lunar Rover in the foreground -- behind it lies the Lunar Module and distant lunar hills. Because the world was going to be able to watch the Lunar Module's ascent stage liftoff via the rover's TV camera, this parking place was also known as the VIP Site. In December of 1972, Apollo 17 astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt spent about 75 hours on the Moon, while colleague Ronald Evans orbited overhead. The crew returned with 110 kilograms of rock and soil samples, more than from any of the other lunar landing sites. Cernan and Schmitt are still the last to walk (or drive) on the Moon.\n\nJuly's Full Moon looks strangely darkened and distorted in this remarkable telescopic view. The image is one of a series recorded when the Moon was very near the horizon. The long sight-line through a turbulent atmosphere gives rise to the tantalizing optical effects, including the thin \"mirage\" shape that seems to float just above the Moon's upper edge. Also seen (more easily in the inset), along the Moon's upper edge is a noticeable green rim. Substantial atmospheric refraction produces this prism-like effect -- related to the more commonly witnessed green flash of the setting Sun. Careful inspection of the full image reveals a corresponding red rim along the lower edge, another intriguing signature of atmospheric refraction.\n\nOne million seconds of x-ray image data were used to construct this view of supernova remnant Cassiopeia A, the expanding debris cloud from a stellar explosion. The stunningly detailed image from the Chandra Observatory will allow an unprecedented exploration of the catastrophic fate that awaits stars much more massive than the Sun. Seen in false-color, Cas A's outer green ring, 10 light-years or so in diameter, marks the location of the expanding shock from the original supernova explosion. At about 10 o'clock around the ring, a structure extends beyond it, evidence that the initial explosion may have also produced energetic jets. Still glowing in x-rays, the tiny point source near the center of Cas A is a neutron star, the collapsed remains of the stellar core. While Cas A is about 10,000 light-years away, light from the supernova explosion first reached Earth just over 300 years ago.\n\nMars won't look this good. Tonight and over the next few days, when Mars is at its closest approach to Earth in nearly 60,000 years, you might get your best view ever of our planetary neighbor. Please, though, don't expect to see this much structure, or expect to see Mars rotate so much in so brief a period. The above 20-frame movie was created from 1000 frames of a backyard webcam that were meticulously aligned, added, and digitally sequenced. Pictured, Mars appears to rotate in a time-lapse sequence, with each frame separated by 30 minutes of real time. In reality, one full Martian rotation -- a Martian day -- is only about 40 minutes longer than an Earth day. For those with access to a small telescope, here is how mars will really look.\n\nThe ancient text has no known title, no known author, and is written in no known language: what does it say and why does it have many astronomy illustrations? The mysterious book was once bought by an emperor The book remains in Yale's rare book collection under catalog number \"MS 408.\"\n\nUranus is the third largest planet in our Solar System after Jupiter and Saturn. Uranus is composed mostly of rock and ices, but with a thick hydrogen and helium atmosphere. The blue hue of Uranus' atmosphere arises from the small amount of methane which preferentially absorbs red light. This picture was snapped by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1986 - the only spacecraft ever to visit Uranus. Uranus has many moons and a ring system. Uranus, like Venus, has a rotation axis that is greatly tilted and sometimes points near the Sun. It remains an astronomical mystery why Uranus' axis is so tilted. Uranus and Neptune are quite similar: Uranus is slightly larger but less massive.\n\nThis dream-like image of Mir was recorded by astronauts as the Space Shuttle Atlantis approached the Russian space station prior to docking during the STS-76 mission. Sporting spindly appendages and solar panels, Mir resembles a whimsical flying insect hovering about 350 kilometers above New Zealand's South Island and the city of Nelson, near Cook Strait. In late March 1996, Atlantis shuttled astronaut Shannon W. Lucid to Mir for a five month visit, increasing Mir's occupancy from 2 to 3. It returned to pick Lucid up and drop off astronaut John Blaha during the STS-79 mission in August of that year. Since becoming operational in 1986, Mir has been visited by over 100 spacefarers from the nations of planet Earth including, Russia, the United States, Great Britain, Germany, France, Japan, Austria, Kazakhstan and Slovakia. After joint Shuttle-Mir training missions in support of the International Space Station, continuous occupation of Mir ended in August 1999. Mir is still in orbit and its operation is now being pursued by commercial interests.\n\nConnect the dots and you'll trace the path of the Cassini spacecraft as it took a final turn by Earth on its way to the outer solar system. The dots (in a horizontal row just below center) are actually successive images of the spacecraft. The picture was produced by making exposures at 10 minute intervals as Cassini moved rapidly through Earth's night sky on August 18 - around the time of its closest approach. Cassini's ultimate destination is Saturn, but so far its voyage has consisted of a series of fuel saving \"gravity assist\" flybys of Venus and Earth, each designed to result in an increase in the spacecraft's speed. During this Earth flyby Cassini received about a 12,000 mile- per-hour (5.5 km\/sec) boost. Cassini is now being maneuvered toward yet another slingshot encounter, this time a December 2000 flyby of of gas giant Jupiter, to received a final boost toward Saturn. The wayfaring spacecraft is slated to arrive at long last in the Saturnian system in 2004.\n\nSpanning the sky behind the majestic Clouds of Magellan is an unusual stream of gas: the Magellanic Stream. The origin of this gas might hold a clue to origin and fate of our Milky Way's most famous satellite galaxies: the LMC and the SMC. Two leading genesis hypotheses have surfaced: that the stream was created by gas stripped off these galaxies as they passed through the halo of our Milky Way, or that the stream was created by the differential gravitational tug of the Milky Way. Measurements of slight angular motions by the Hipparcos satellite have indicated that the Clouds are leading the Stream. Now, recent radio measurements have located fresh gas emerging from the Clouds, bolstering the later, tidal explanation. Most probably, in a few hundred million years, the Magellanic Clouds themselves will fall victim to this same tidal force.\n\nSometimes the sky itself seems to glow. Usually, this means you are seeing a cloud reflecting sunlight or moonlight. If the glow appears as a faint band of light running across the whole sky, you are probably seeing the combined light from the billions of stars that compose our Milky Way Galaxy. But if the glow appears triangular and near the horizon, you might be seeing something called zodiacal light. Pictured above, zodiacal light is just sunlight reflected by tiny dust particles orbiting in our Solar System. Many of these particles were ejected by comets. Zodiacal light is easiest to see in September and October just before sunrise from a very dark location.\n\nWhat's a Wolf-Rayet star, and how did it create that spherical bubble and sweeping arc? A Wolf-Rayet star is a star that originated with a mass over 40 times that of our Sun. An extremely hot, luminous star, it has since expelled shells of material through its strong stellar wind which could account for the bubble shaped nebula that surrounds it. But astronomers are unsure how the central Wolf-Rayet created both the bubble and the arc seen above, and even whether it acted alone in doing so. Together, this bubble and the arc are known as NGC 2359.\n\nHere Comet West is seen showing two enormous tails that wrap around the sky. The ion tale of a comet usually appears more blue and always points away from the Sun. The dust tail trailing the comet's nucleus is the most prominent. Comet West was a visually spectacular comet, reaching its most picturesque in March of 1976. A comet this bright occurs only about once a decade. Comets are really just large dirty snowballs that shed material when they reach the inner solar-system. Many astronomers are hopeful that Comet Hale-Bopp will look as spectacular as this in the spring of 1997."}
{"text":"Discovery Triples Total Number of Stars in Universe\n\nKamuela, HI - Astronomers have discovered that small, dim stars known as red dwarfs are much more prolific than previously thought\u2014so much so that the total number of stars in the universe is likely three times bigger than realized.\n\nBecause red dwarfs are relatively small and dim compared to stars like our Sun, astronomers hadn't been able to detect them in galaxies other than our own Milky Way and its nearest neighbors before now. As such, they did not know how much of the total stellar population of the universe is made up of red dwarfs.\n\nNow astronomers have used powerful instruments on the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to detect the faint signature of red dwarfs in eight massive, relatively nearby galaxies called elliptical galaxies, which are located between about 50 million and 300 million light years away. They discovered that the red dwarfs, which are only between 10 and 20 percent as massive as the Sun, were much more bountiful than expected.\n\n\"This important study, which uses information at the red end of the optical spectrum, was aided by advances in detector technology that have been implemented at Keck,\" said Keck Observatory Director Taft Armandroff.\n\n\"No one knew how many of these stars there were,\" said Pieter van Dokkum, a Yale University astronomer who led the research, which is described in Nature's Dec.1 Advanced Online Publication. \"Different theoretical models predicted a wide range of possibilities, so this answers a longstanding question about just how abundant these stars are.\"\n\nThe team discovered that there are about 20 times more red dwarfs in elliptical galaxies than in the Milky Way, said Charlie Conroy of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who was also involved in the research.\n\n\"We usually assume other galaxies look like our own. But this suggests other conditions are possible in other galaxies,\" Conroy said. \"So this discovery could have a major impact on our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.\"\n\nFor instance, Conroy said, galaxies might contain less dark matter\u2014a mysterious substance that has mass but cannot be directly observed\u2014than previous measurements of their masses might have indicated. Instead, the abundant red dwarfs could contribute more mass than realized.\n\nIn addition to boosting the total number of stars in the universe, the discovery also increases the number of planets orbiting those stars, which in turn elevates the number of planets that might harbor life, van Dokkum said. In fact, a recently discovered exoplanet that astronomers believe could potentially support life orbits a red dwarf star, called Gliese 581.\n\n\"There are possibly trillions of Earths orbiting these stars,\" van Dokkum said, adding that the red dwarfs they discovered, which are typically more than 10 billion years old, have been around long enough for complex life to evolve. \"It's one reason why people are interested in this type of star"}

{"text":"January 10, 2011: A ghostly, glowing, green blob of gas has become one of astronomy's great cosmic mystery stories. The space oddity was spied in 2007 by Dutch high-school teacher Hanny van Arkel while participating in the online Galaxy Zoo project. The cosmic blob, called Hanny's Voorwerp (Hanny's Object in Dutch), appears to be a solitary green island floating near a normal-looking spiral galaxy, called IC 2497. Since the discovery, puzzled astronomers have used a slew of telescopes, including X-ray and radio observatories, to help unwrap the mystery. Astronomers found that Hanny's Voorwerp is the only visible part of a 300-light-year-long gaseous streamer stretching around the galaxy. The greenish Voorwerp is visible because a searchlight beam of light from the galaxy's core illuminated it. This beam came from a quasar, a bright, energetic object that is powered by a black hole. An encounter with another galaxy may have fed the black hole and pulled the gaseous streamer from IC 2497. Now, with the help of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have uncovered a pocket of young star clusters (colored yellow-orange in the image) at the tip of the green-colored Hanny's Voorwerp.\""}

This discovery, made by the EPFL's Laboratory of Astrophysics in cooperation with Caltech, represents an advance in the field, since it will allow scientists to weigh and measure a galaxy that contains a quasar. The news is published today in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.\n\nGravitational lenses are common throughout the universe. They are caused by massive objects such as stars or galaxies that bend rays of light passing nearby. If these objects are between the earth and a more distant light source, the light will therefore be brighter and easier to observe, but also very distorted. If the alignment of the various stellar bodies is almost perfect, the image of the source will be multiplied.\n\nThe lens phenomenon is not only an interesting result of Einstein's theory of general relativity; it has also been a valuable astrophysical tool with important applications in the search for extrasolar planets and the study of stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies and quasars. For example, the nature of the distortion, the number of images of the most distant objects and their position in the sky provide essential information about the distribution of matter in the lens galaxy and allow a measurement of its total matter, including dark matter, to be made.\n\nA quasar is the heart of a galaxy, consisting of a supermassive black hole. The small fraction of the galaxy's mass that is close enough to be swallowed up by the black hole emits light before disappearing forever, giving rise to this extremely bright and transient phenomenon.\n\nTo date, about a hundred of these quasars emitting light that is concentrated by a lens galaxy located between them and the earth have been discovered. However, this is the first time that the opposite case has been observed, where the quasar is in the foreground and the galaxy behind it. The interest of this discovery lies in the fact that it provides an unprecedented opportunity to \"weigh\" a galaxy containing a quasar.\n\nThis video is not supported by your browser at this time.\n\nEPFL and Caltech researchers have discovered a quasar acting as a cosmic lens, magnifying a 7.5 light year distant galaxy.

For the\noutcome of the evolution, we only consider the Chandrasekhar-mass SN\nIa explosion of the white dwarf with an initial mass less than\n. The companion star is assumed to be\nlobe-filling, and mass transfer occurs through Roche-lobe overflow.\nDetached systems like symbiotic stars, in which the companion star of\nthe white dwarf loses mass via a wind, are not taken into account, due\nto the deficiency of massive white dwarfs among such systems, and\nhence the low frequency ( yr-1) of\nSNe Ia (Yungelson et al. 1995).\n\nThe system can be specified by three parameters: the initial white\ndwarf mass , the initial donor mass\nand the orbital period\nat the beginning of mass transfer.

{"text":"Disruption of giant molecular clouds by massive star clusters\n\nJun 02, 2011 past, these new results show how, even before a single star explodes as a supernova, massive stars carve out huge bubbles and limit the star formation rates in galaxies.\n\nThe findings are being presented by Dr. Elizabeth Harper-Clark and Prof. Norman Murray of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) at the 2011 meeting of the Canadian Astronomical Society (CASCA) in London, ON, Canada.\n\nGalaxies are the birthplace of stars. As the stellar population changes, so the galaxy evolves. Yet, the stately pace of this evolution remains unexplained. It is generally believed that the pace of star formation is regulated by the outflow of energy from other stars and possibly black holes.\n\nThe lifetime of a Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC, a large star-forming nebula) and the total mass of stars that form within it are crucial to the understanding of star formation rates across a galaxy. In particular, the stars within a GMC can disrupt their host and consequently quench further star formation. Indeed, observations show that our own galaxy, the Milky Way, contains GMCs with extensive expanding bubbles but without supernova remnants, indicating that the GMCs are being disrupted before any supernovae occur.\n\nRadiation from stars interacts with the gas in the surrounding GMC in two main ways: ionization and radiation pressure. Ionization works by forcibly ejecting electrons from atoms at high speed; these electrons then heat up the gas, increasing the gas pressure. Radiation pressure is more subtle and often ignored -- the momentum from the light is transferred to the gas atoms when light is absorbed. These momentum transfers add up, always pushing away from the light source, and produce the most significant effect, according to these simulations.\n\nThe simulations performed by Harper-Clark represent the first calculations of the effects of radiation pressure on GMCs and show that this pressure is capable of disrupting such clouds, the main star-forming units in galaxies. \"The results suggest that the slow rate of star formation seen in galaxies across the universe may be the result of radiative feedback from massive stars,\" says Professor Murray, Director of CITA.\n\nSimulating entire GMCs is challenging, due to the large variety of physics that needs to be included and the computational power required to accurately simulate a GMC over tens of millions of years. Using the radiative-magneto-hydrodynamic code Enzo, Harper-Clark ran multiple simulations of GMCs under different conditions.\n\nHarper-Clark robustly found that with only the light emitted by the stars (radiation) during their lifetimes the GMC could be completely blown apart, cutting off star formation after a percentage between 5% and 20% of the original cloud's mass had been converted into stars.\n\nInterestingly, when supernovae were included in the simulations they were found to be unimportant. Both with and without the light from stars, supernovae were not significant on the disruption of the GMC, nor did they alter the subsequent star formation. With no radiation feedback, supernovae exploded in a dense region leading to rapid cooling. This robbed the supernovae of their most effective form of feedback, hot gas pressure. When radiative feedback is included, the supernovae explode into an already evacuated (and leaky) bubble, allowing the hot gas to expand rapidly and leak away without affecting the remaining dense GMC gas. \"These simulations suggest that it is the light from stars that carves out nebulae, rather than the explosions at the end of their lives,\" says Dr. Harper-Clark.\n\nFound in the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud, 30 Doradus is one of the largest massive star forming regions close to the Milky Way.

Where does the first stars come from? Are they implying that galaxies appear suddenly in one massive POP, spewing out stars at prodigious rates, before the birth of stars and supernovas can disrupt any further star formation by blowing the gas away? So then they don't really know where stars come from and hence by implication where galaxies come from. This means that the current theories of cosmology and cosmogony are really a lot of hot air as far as explanatory power is concerned. If you cannot explain where stars and galaxies come from or how they are created, you cannot explain anything else. But of course it doesn't mean they should stop trying, just stop pretending they know it all.\n\n@kevinrtrs The article clearly states that 5% to 20% of the GMC mass is converted into stars before the GMC is crippled by radiation. The remaining gass does not dissappear, some of it may condense into new clouds at later stages unless it is blown entirely out of the galaxy by some extreme star burst formation or perhaps an active galactic nucleus.\n\nAlthough this is only \"a computer simulation\", it may explain how a glowing ball of waste products (photosphere) can accumulate and be suspended above neutron stars to produce ordinary-looking stars like the Sun.\n\nCan't happen since there is no neutron star in the Sun.

{"text":"Michael K. Barker\n\nAbstract.

{"text":"Finding the Failed Supernovae\n\nby Jon Voisey on April 2, 2011\n\nWant to stay on top of all the space news? Follow @universetoday on Twitter\n\nCredit: chandra.harvard.edu\n\nWhen high mass stars end their lives, they explode in monumental supernovae. But, when the most massive of these monsters die, theory has predicted that they may not even reveal as much as a whimper as their massive cores implode. Instead, the implosion occurs so quickly, that the rebound and all photons created during it, are immediately swallowed into the newly formed black hole. Estimates have suggested that as much as 20% of stars that are massive enough to form supernovae collapse directly into a black hole without an explosion. These \"failed supernovae\" would simply disappear from the sky leaving such predictions seemingly impossible to verify. But a new paper explores the potential for neutrinos, subatomic particles that rarely interact with normal matter, could escape during the collapse, and be detected, heralding the death of a giant.\n\nPresently, only one supernova has been detected by its neutrinos. This was supernova 1987a, a relatively close supernova which occurred in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy to our own. When this star exploded, the neutrinos escaped the surface of the star and reached detectors on Earth three hours before the shockwave reached the surface, producing a visible brightening. Yet despite the enormity of the eruption, only 24 neutrinos (or more precisely, electron anti-neutrinos), were detected between three detectors.\n\nThe further away an event is, the more its neutrinos will be spread out, which in turn, decreases the flux at the detector. With current detectors, the expectation is that they are large enough to detect supernovae events around a rate of 1-3 per century all originating from within the Milky Way and our satellites. But as with most astronomy, the detection radius can be increased with larger detectors. The current generation uses detectors with masses on the order of kilotons of detecting fluid, but proposed detectors would increase this to megatons, pushing the sphere of detectability to as much as 6.5 million light years, which would include our nearest large neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy. With such enhanced capabilities, detectors would be expected to find neutrino bursts on the order of once per decade.\n\nAssuming the calculations are correct and that 20% of supernova implode directly, this means that such gargantuan detectors could detect 1-2 failed supernovae per century. Fortunately, this is slightly enhanced due to the extra mass of the star, which would make the total energy of the event higher, and while this wouldn't escape as light, would correspond to an increased neutrino output. Thus, the detection sphere could be pushed out to potentially 13 million lightyears, which would incorporate several galaxies with high rates of star formation and consequently, supernoave.\n\nWhile this puts the potential for detections of failed supernovae on the radar, a bigger problem remains. Say neutrino detectors record a sudden burst of neutrinos. With typical supernovae, this detection would be quickly followed with the optical detection of a supernova, but with a failed supernova, the followup would be absent. The neutrino burst is the beginning and end of the story, which could not initially positively define such an event as different from other supernovae, such as those that form neutron stars.\n\nTo tease out the subtle differences, the team modeled the supernovae to examine the energies and durations involved. When comparing failed supernovae to ones forming neutron stars, they predicted that the failed supernovae neutrino bursts would have shorter durations (~1 second) than ones forming neutron stars (~10 seconds). Additionally, the energy imparted in the collision that makes up the detection would be higher for failed supernovae (up to 56 MeV vs 33 MeV). This difference could potentially discriminate between the two typesWow, could these failed SN's (now BH's) make up a good share of the DM that we're trying to account for? ~13 billion years of SN's events is a lot of un-detectable matter.\n\nManu\n\n\"the neutrinos \u2026 reached detectors on Earth three hours before the shockwave reached the surface\"\n\nNo: before the shockwave was seen (from Earth) to reach the surface. Nitpick, but it could confuse readers.\n\nDon Alexander\n\n@wjwbudro: Of course not. These were stars beforehand. normal baryonic matter. Dark Matter must have a non-baryonic origin, as it is way more than can be accounted for by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.\n\nwjwbudro\n\nThanks Don,\nI was considering the \"missing\" matter and not distinguishing it's makeup.\n13 billion years of star birth and death (via this failed SN scenario) could produce a whole lot of dark blobs that hide behind their horizons. I just hope we don't detect one in our backyard in the near future.\n\n Jon Voisey\n\nTo build on that answer: If there were large numbers of such things as black holes, and very low mass stars (referred collectively as Massive Astronomical Compact Halo Objects), we should be able to detect them via gravitational lensing. Searches for such events have found a few, but not near enough the scale required to make up for the 75% of the mass that's \"dark\".\n\nwjwbudro\n\nThanks Jon, I'll go away again\u2026for awhile. lol\n\nwjwbudro\n\nOh, forgot to say I was considering the 20 some percent of missing matter, not the dark energy's 75%.\nOkay, I'm gone.\n\n Jon Voisey\n\nYou're thinking of the overall mass AND energy of which 75% is dark energy. If you consider JUST the matter (ie, stuff with mass), again, about 75% of that is dark matter.\n\nTorbjorn Larsson OM\n\nNow *that* is what I call an optimistic project, waiting one or two centuries to confirm a prediction. At the same time, the first one on that time scale could collect funds and interest moonlighting as a social project.\n\nI'm not convinced it will be done, but the idea must be entertained if nothing else because it is, um, entertaining.

In addition, SRI's new COLED device has the potential to be two times more efficient than compact fluorescent lights, which contain mercury and present a disposal problem.\n\n\"With our new cavity design, SRI has significantly increased the efficiency of OLED devices,\" said Philip von Guggenberg, director of business development, SRI International. \"These new results validate our strategy of focusing on new device architectures to improve the performance of OLED devices\".\n\nA combination of SDK's light-emitting polymer materials and SRI's COLED technology has enabled scientists to achieve an output of 30 lumen (a measure of light output) per watt for blue light - higher than any other reported polymer OLED result. For green light, the team has achieved more than 80 lumen per watt - about three times higher than a traditional OLED. To produce white light that is acceptable for illumination, a mix of red, green, and blue light is mandatory - with blue being the most technically challenging to produce.

Heymsfield, NCAR\n\nA team of UC San Diego-led atmospheric chemistry scientists moved closer to what is considered the \"holy grail\" of climate change science when it made the first-ever direct detection of biological particles within ice clouds.\n\nThe team, led by Kerri Pratt, a Ph.D. student of atmospheric chemistry Professor Kim Prather, who also holds appointments at Scripps Institution of Oceanography as well as the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at UCSD, sampled water droplet and ice crystal residues at high speeds from an aircraft flying through clouds in the skies over Wyoming in fall 2007. Analysis of the ice crystals revealed that they were made up almost entirely of either dust or biological particles such as bacteria, fungal spores and plant material.

More recently, the National Institutes of Health called for cutting the cost to $1,000 or less, which may enable sequencing as part of routine medical care.\n\nThe obstacles to reaching that goal have been primarily technological: Researchers have struggled to figure out how to accurately read the 3 billion base pairs - the amount of DNA found in humans and other mammals - without time-consuming, inefficient methods.\n\nPhysicists at Brown University may have an answer. They introduce a novel procedure to vastly slow the DNA's movement through openings that are used to read the code. In the journal Nanotechnology, the physicists report the first experiment to move DNA through a solid-state nanopore using magnets. The approach is promising because it allows multiple segments of a DNA strand to be threaded simultaneously through numerous tiny pores and for each fragment to move slowly enough through the opening so that the base pairs can be accurately read.\n\nXinsheng Sean Ling \"When it comes to sequencing anyone's genome, you need to do it cheaply, and you need to do it quickly,\" explained Xinsheng Sean Ling, professor of physics, who joined the Brown faculty in 1996. \"This is a step in that direction\".........\n\nComplex nucleation processes using DNA origami seeds\n\nThe first three seeds each present a distinct pattern (000000, 100001, or 011010) and were incubated with a set of tiles that copy the pattern from layer to layer; the fourth seed was incubated with a set of tiles that constructs each diagonal layer to represent a binary number one larger than the previous layer.

{"text":"Back in the 18th century, scientists like Laplace has already pointed out that highly compact objects might prevent their nearby light from escaping. Soon after Einstein published his General Theory of Relativity in the beginning of 20th century, Karl Schwarzschild found a mathematical solution of the theory to describe the spacetime structure of such object with spherical symmetry. That was the prelude to the study of black holes. Later on, Oppenheimer and others through calculation proved that supermassive stars under gravitational force could really collapse to form black holes. By the 70's, astronomers started to carry out systematic observations to look for evidence of black holes in binary system. The flush of observational evidence from the Hubble Space Telescope launched at the end of the 20th century further convinces us that black holes really exist. To the surprise of astronomers, black holes come in various sizes and origins, and are far more complicated than we can think of. For example, the sizes of black holes can vary immensely from a few to a few billions of solar masses! What is more important, the existence of these different kinds of black holes and the respective astronomical phenomena associated with them always brings far-reaching revelation to our understanding of the evolution of stars, galaxies and at last the whole Universe.\n\nIn the early days, man turned their eyes to the binary systems to look for black holes. From the spectral analysis of the orbit, if the invisible companion of a star in a binary system is 3.5 times heavier than that of the Sun, this dark celestial object is most probably a black hole. We take 3.5 solar masses as the benchmark for judging whether something is a black hole because we know that theoretically the mass of other compact objects (like neutron star) cannot exceed that maximum threshold. Otherwise those bodies will collapse under their own gravitational force into black holes. However, it is never an easy task to determine the mass of companion stars in binary systems just by way of spectral analysis. Miscalculations did always happen, as it is difficult to accurately measure factors like the luminosity of the visible stars in the pairs and the tilting of the orbits. Accretion disks formed when compact objects suck in matters of companion stars may also betray the existence of black holes. For neutron stars and black holes, accretion disk will emit high-energy X-rays when matters are spiraling in the compact objects, since immense gravitational force can cause substantial heat up of the matters. Searching for X-ray sources in the sky becomes the most important ways to locate neutron stars and black holes among binary system."}
{"text":"NASA prepping Black Hole Hunting Telescope\n\nBlack holes are interesting beasts. For a long time, they were considered to be a mathematical novelty, something that the math shows is possible but not something that actually exists.

It turns out that spotting something that eats up all light is quite hard. Who knew?\n\nNuSTAR's Russian Doll-like Mirrors\n\nBlack holes can be spotted by analyzing the orbit of stars, however. The proof of their existence is largely down to suns speeding around impossibly small gravitational wells. The suns get too close to the source of the gravity, and go to fast, for the well to be anything but a black hole.\n\nThe new telescope that NASA is prepping, dubbed the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, is designed specifically to spot black holes by their energy signature rather than by planetary orbits. This is one of the most sophisticated telescopes on the planet, featuring more processing power, more than 100 times the sensitivity of earlier generations, ten times the resolution and a complex design of 133 mirrors nested together like Russian stacking dolls. Of course, all this sensitivity is for an energy spectrum that we can't see, so this might seem to be a bit esoteric.\n\nBlack holes are considered to be fundamental players in the formation of the universe, driving the creation of galaxies and providing the gravitational disturbances needed to make stars coalesce.

{"text":"How Much Mass Makes A Black Hole\n\nHow Much Mass Makes A Black Hole\n\nThursday August 19, 2010\n\nUsing ESO's Very Large Telescope, European astronomers have for the first time demonstrated that a magnetar \u2013 an unusual type of neutron star \u2013 was formed from a star with at least 40 times as much mass as the Sun. The result presents great challenges to current theories of how stars evolve, as a star as massive as this was expected to become a black hole, not a magnetar.\nThis now raises a fundamental question: just how massive does a star really have to be to become a black hole?\n\nTo reach their conclusions, the astronomers looked in detail at the extraordinary star cluster Westerlund 1, located 16 000 light-years away in the southern constellation of Ara (the Altar).\n\nFrom previous studies (eso0510),).\n\n\"If the Sun were located at the heart of this remarkable cluster, our night sky would be full of hundreds of stars as bright as the full Moon,\" says Ben Ritchie, lead author of the paper reporting these results.\n\nWesterlund 1 is a fantastic stellar zoo, with a diverse and exotic population of stars. The stars in the cluster share one thing: they all have the same age, estimated at between 3.5 and 5 million years, as the cluster was formed in a single star-formation event.\n\nA magnetar (eso0831) is a type of neutron star with an incredibly strong magnetic field \u2013 a million billion times stronger than that of the Earth, which is formed when certain stars undergo supernova explosions.\n\nThe Westerlund 1 cluster hosts one of the few magnetars known in the Milky Way. Thanks to its home in the cluster, the astronomers were able to make the remarkable deduction that this magnetar must have formed from a star at least 40 times as massive as the Sun.\n\nAs all the stars in Westerlund 1 have the same age, the star that exploded and left a magnetar remnant must have had a shorter life than the surviving stars in the cluster.\n\n\"Because the lifespan of a star is directly linked to its mass \u2013 the heavier a star, the shorter its life \u2013 if we can measure the mass of any one surviving star, we know for sure that the shorter-lived star that became the magnetar must have been even more massive,\" says co-author and team leader Simon Clark.\n\n\"This is of great significance since there is no accepted theory for how such extremely magnetic objects are formed.\"\n\nThe astronomers therefore studied the stars that belong to the eclipsing double system W13 in Westerlund 1 using the fact that, in such a system, masses can be directly determined from the motions of the stars.\n\nBy comparison with these stars, they found that the star that became the magnetar must have been at least 40 times the mass of the Sun. This proves for the first time that magnetars can evolve from stars so massive we would normally expect them to form black holes.\n\nThe previous assumption was that stars with initial masses between about 10 and 25 solar masses would form neutron stars and those above 25 solar masses would produce black holes.\n\n\"These stars must get rid of more than nine tenths of their mass before exploding as a supernova, or they would otherwise have created a black hole instead,\" says co-author Ignacio Negueruela. \"Such huge mass losses before the explosion present great challenges to current theories of stellar evolution.\"\n\n\"This therefore raises the thorny question of just how massive a star has to be to collapse to form a black hole if stars over 40 times as heavy as our Sun cannot manage this feat,\" concludes co-author Norbert Langer.\n\nThe formation mechanism preferred by the astronomers postulates that the star that became the magnetar \u2013 the progenitor \u2013 was born with a stellar companion. As both stars evolved they would begin to interact, with energy derived from their orbital motion expended in ejecting the requisite huge quantities of mass from the progenitor star.\n\nWhile no such companion is currently visible at the site of the magnetar, this could be because the supernova that formed the magnetar caused the binary to break apart, ejecting both stars at high velocity from the cluster.\n\n\"If this is the case it suggests that binary systems may play a key role in stellar evolution by driving mass loss \u2013 the ultimate cosmic 'diet plan' for heavyweight stars, which shifts over 95% of their initial mass,\" concludes Clark."}

Evidence for a bizarre state of matter has been found in the dense core of the star left behind, a so-called neutron star, based on cooling observed over a decade of Chandra observations. The artist's illustration in the inset shows a cut-out of the interior of the neutron star where densities increase from the crust (orange) to the core (red) and finally to the region where the \"superfluid\" exists (inner red ball).

Weiss\n\nThe discovery of the rapid decline in the temperature of an ultra-dense star has provided the first evidence for a bizarre state of matter in the core of a star. Two independent research teams have used data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory to show that the interior of a neutron star contains superfluid and superconducting matter, a conclusion with important implications for understanding nuclear interactions in matter at the highest known densities.\n\nThis news comes from studies of the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A), the remains of a massive star that exploded about 330 years ago in Earth's time frame. A sequence of Chandra observations of the neutron star, the ultra-dense core that remained after the supernova, shows that this compact object has cooled by about 4 percent over a 10-year period.\n\n\"This drop in temperature, although it sounds small, was really dramatic and surprising to see,\" said Dany Page from the National Autonomous University in Mexico. \"This means that something unusual is happening within this neutron star.\" Neutron stars contain the densest known matter that is directly observable. One teaspoon of neutron star material has a mass of 6 billion tons. The pressure in the star's core is high enough that most of the electrons there are forced to merge with protons, producing neutrons. This leaves a star composed mostly of neutrons, with some protons, electrons, and other particles.\n\nTheoretical physicists have come up with detailed models for how matter should behave at such high densities, including the possibility that superfluids may form. Superfluidity is a friction-free state of matter, and superfluids created in laboratories on Earth exhibit remarkable properties, such as the ability to climb upward and escape airtight containers. Superfluids made of charged particles are also superconductors, which allow electric current to flow with no resistance. Materials like this on Earth have widespread technological applications like producing the superconducting magnets used for the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines found in hospitals from the Ioffe Institute in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\nBoth teams show that this rapid cooling is explained by the formation of a neutron superfluid in the core of the neutron star within about the last 100 years as seen from Earth. Theory predicts a neutron star should undergo a distinct cool-down during the transition to the superfluid state as nearly massless, weakly interacting particles called neutrinos are copiously formed and then escape from the star, taking energy with them. The rapid cooling is expected to continue for a few decades and then it should slow down.\n\nThe onset of superfluidity in materials on Earth occurs at extremely low temperatures near absolute zero, but in neutron stars, it can occur at temperatures near a billion degrees because interactions of particles are via the strong nuclear force. This force binds quarks together to make protons and neutrons, and protons and neutrons together to make the nuclei of atoms. However, until now, there was a large uncertainty in estimates of this critical temperature. This new research constrains it to between half a billion and just under a billion degrees Celsius.\n\n\"It turns out that Cas A may be a gift from the universe because we would have to catch a very young neutron star at just the right point in time,\" said Madappa Prakash from Ohio University in Athens. \"Sometimes a little good fortune can go a long way in science.\"\n\nThe observed rate of cooling strongly suggests that the relatively few remaining protons in the core of the neutron star made the transition to the superfluid state much earlier. Because the protons are charged, they will also be superconducting.\n\n\"Previously, we had no idea how extended superconductivity of protons was in a neutron star,\" said Dmitry Yakovlev from the Ioffe Institute.\n\n\"Depending on their composition, superconductors created in laboratories on Earth stop working at anything warmer than \u2013100\u00b0 to \u2013200\u00b0 Celsius [\u2013148\u00b0 to \u2013328\u00b0 Fahrenheit],\" said Wynn Ho from the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom. \"In contrast, the incredible densities in neutron stars allow superconductivity at close to a billion degrees Celsius.\"\n\nBecause models for superfluidity in neutron stars incorporate the physics of the strong nuclear force, the detailed features of the strong interaction in ultra-dense matter can be tested in the Cas A neutron star. These results are also important for understanding a range of behavior in neutron stars, including glitches \u2014 these are small sudden changes in highly magnetized rotating neutron stars, objects known as pulsars \u2014 neutron star precession and pulsation, magnetar outbursts, and the evolution of neutron star magnetic fields.\n\nGlitches have previously given evidence for superfluid neutrons in the crust of a neutron star where densities are below the nuclear values seen in the core of the star. The research on Cas A provides the first direct evidence for superfluid neutrons and protons in the core of a neutron star.\n\nCraig Heinke from the University of Alberta, Canada, and Wynn Ho first discovered the cooling in the Cas A neutron star in 2010. It was the first time that astronomers had measured the rate of cooling of a young neutron star.\n\nWhat is the correlation between superconductivity at low temps and at high temps,is there a condition at which superconductor occurs at say zero degrees C.?\n\nSubmitted: 3\/21\/2011 12:04:03 AM (CST)\n\nCRISTINE MINCHEFFfrom CALIFORNIA\nsaid:\n\nI am not a physicist, but does the superconductivity have a bearing on the physics of a neutron star?

{"text":"Microlensed stars in the Galactic bulge\n\nThe central regions of our Galaxy are dominated by the crowded stellar bulge. Although stars in the bulge are typically observed to be almost as abundant in metals as the sun, the bulge is generally considered to have been one of the earliest parts of the Galaxy to form.\n\nThis project is on microlensed stars in the Galactic bulge. Microlensing occurs when a \"lens\" object (typically a low-mass star) becomes closely aligned with a more distant \"source\" star, whose image it magnifies and brightens. In the case of the bulge, the source stars are dwarfs which become bright enough while they are being microlensed (typically for a couple of weeks) to allow high resolution spectroscopy. So far, about 48 examples have been observed in this way, and some of them appear to be quite young. This does not fit into the usual picture of an old bulge.\n\nThe geometry of microlensing suggests that at least some of these stars may lie in the Galactic disk, on the far side of the bulge. That would be more consistent with the young ages. The aim of this project is to use the best available models of the bulge and inner disk of the Galaxy to calculate where the microlensed dwarfs are most likely to be located - do they belong to the bulge, or do they preferentially lie in the disk on the far side of the bulge?"}
{"text":"Astronomers have uncovered patterns of light that appear to be from the first stars and galaxies that formed in the universe. The light patterns were hidden within a strip of sky observed by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. Image credit: NASA, JPL-Caltech, GSFC.\n\nThe be seen individually, but Spitzer has captured new, convincing evidence of what appears to be the collective pattern of their infrared light.\n\nThe observations help confirm the first objects were numerous in quantity and furiously burned cosmic fuel.\n\n\"These objects would have been tremendously bright,\" said Alexander \"Sasha\" Kashlinsky of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., lead author of a new paper appearing in The Astrophysical Journal.\n\n\"We can't yet directly rule out mysterious sources for this light that could be coming from our nearby universe, but it is now becoming increasingly likely that we are catching a glimpse of an ancient epoch. Spitzer is laying down a roadmap for NASA's upcoming James Webb Telescope, which will tell us exactly what and where these first objects were.\"\n\nSpitzer first caught hints of this remote pattern of light, known as the cosmic infrared background, in 2005, and again with more precision in 2007. Now, Spitzer is in the extended phase of its mission, during which it performs more in-depth studies on specific patches of the sky. Kashlinsky and his colleagues used Spitzer to look at two patches of sky for more than 400 hours each.\n\nThe team then carefully subtracted all the known stars and galaxies in the images. Rather than being left with a black, empty patch of sky, they found faint patterns of light with several telltale characteristics of the cosmic infrared background. The lumps in the pattern observed are consistent with the way the very distant objects are thought to be clustered together.\n\nKashlinsky likens the observations to looking for Fourth of July fireworks in New York City from Los Angeles. First, you would have to remove all the foreground lights between the two cities, as well as the blazing lights of New York City itself. You ultimately would be left with a fuzzy map of how the fireworks are distributed, but they would still be too distant to make out individually.\n\n\"We can gather clues from the light of the universe's first fireworks,\" said Kashlinsky. \"This is teaching us that the sources, or the \"sparks,\" are intensely burning their nuclear fuel.\"\n\nThe universe formed roughly 13.7 billion years ago in a fiery, explosive Big Bang. With time, it cooled and, by around 500 million years later, the first stars, galaxies and black holes began to take shape. Astronomers say some of that \"first light\" might have traveled billions of years to reach the Spitzer Space Telescope.\n\nThe light would have originated at visible or even ultraviolet wavelengths and then, because of the expansion of the universe, stretched out to the longer, infrared wavelengths observed by Spitzer.\n\nThe new study improves on previous observations by measuring this cosmic infrared background out to scales equivalent to two full moons - significantly larger than what was detected before. Imagine trying to find a pattern in the noise in an old-fashioned television set by looking at just a small piece of the screen.\n\nIt would be hard to know for certain if a suspected pattern was real. By observing a larger section of the screen, you would be able to resolve both small- and large-scale patterns, further confirming your initial suspicion.\n\nLikewise, astronomers using Spitzer have increased the amount of sky examined to obtain more definitive evidence of the cosmic infrared background. The researchers plan to explore more patches of sky in the future to gather more clues hidden in the light of this ancient era.\n\n\"This is one of the reasons we are building the James Webb Space Telescope,\" said Glenn Wahlgren, Spitzer program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Spitzer is giving us tantalizing clues, but James Webb will tell us what really lies at the era where stars first ignited.\"\n\nOther authors are Richard Arendt of Goddard and the University of Maryland in Baltimore County; Matt Ashby and Giovanni Fazio of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.; and John Mather and Harvey Moseley of Goddard.

Well we have an angle (0.05 arcsec) and one side of triangle (11.5Mly). This is simple trig (tan theta = opp \/ adj), and we can make it even simpler by using the small angle approximation (tan theta ~ theta). And 0.05 arcsec is a very small angle indeed. First we convert our angle to radians by dividing 0.05 by 206265 (the number of arcseconds in a radian). This gives us 0.0000002424 radians as our angle. Back to our trig, 11.5Mly * 0.0000002424 = 0.0000027876Mly ~ 2.8ly. So 1 pixel in an HST ACS\/WFC image corresponds to 2.8ly at the distance of M82. Or, in terms of area, ~7.8ly^2\/pixel. For the work I do I care more about the separation between objects so I don't usually consider the area of a pixel so much as its width, but either way is valid as long you're explicit with your units.\n\nSo where did you go wrong? By assuming that the image you were given is a full resolution HST image. It is not. But to answer your initial question, the way to do it would be to integrate the stellar volume density profile along the line of sight through the galaxy center. This would give you a stellar surface density which you would then multiply by the surface area of the HST ACS\/WFC pixel to give you the number of stars per pixel. I leave this as an exercise for the reader.I'm happy to have been so incorrect -- your explanation was terrific.\n\nWhat will be the pixel scale of the Webb scope (if it ever gets going)?\n\nWhat kinds of work do you do that lets you play with this kind of calculation on a regular basis?\n\nWe're looking at images of galaxies that existed something like 10 to 12 billion years ago; what would the view have been like from them, looking out in our direction? Would it have been appreciably different from what we see now?\n\nWe're at the edge of someone else's observable universe, after all; what does the Milky Way look like for someone 10 billion light years away?\n\nI think I saw mentioned there's an estimated 10,000 galaxies visible in that image, you just drill down to the resolution limits and realize almost every smudge of light is another galaxy:\n\nI just want to thank you, personally, for the Total Perspective Vortex effect that picture just had on me.

{"text":"Space\n\nNASA'S Galex reveals the largest yet-known spiral galaxy\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The spectacular barred spiral galaxy NGC 6872 has ranked among the biggest stellar systems for decades. Now a team of astronomers from the United States, Chile and Brazil has crowned it the largest-known spiral, based on archival data from NASA's Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) mission. GALEX has since been loaned to the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif.\n\nMeasuring tip-to-tip across its two outsized spiral arms, NGC 6872 spans more than 522,000 light-years, making it more than five times the size of our Milky Way galaxy.\n\n\"Without GALEX's ability to detect the ultraviolet light of the youngest, hottest stars, we would never have recognized the full extent of this intriguing system,\" said lead scientist Rafael Eufrasio, a research assistant at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and a doctoral student at Catholic University of America in Washington. He presented the findings Thursday at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Long Beach, Calif.\n\nThe galaxy's unusual size and appearance stem from its interaction with a much smaller disk galaxy named IC 4970, which has only about one-fifth the mass of NGC 6872. The odd couple is located 212 million light-years from Earth in the southern constellation Pavo.\n\nAstronomers think large galaxies, including our own, grew through mergers and acquisitions \u2014 assembling over billions of years by absorbing numerous smaller systems. Intriguingly, the gravitational interaction of NGC 6872 and IC 4970 may have done the opposite, spawning what may develop into a new small galaxy.\n\n\"The northeastern arm of NGC 6872 is the most disturbed and is rippling with star formation, but at its far end, visible only in the ultraviolet, is an object that appears to be a tidal dwarf galaxy similar to those seen in other interacting systems,\" said team member Duilia de Mello, a professor of astronomy at Catholic University. The tidal dwarf candidate is brighter in the ultraviolet than other regions of the galaxy, a sign it bears a rich supply of hot young stars less than 200 million years old.\n\nThe researchers studied the galaxy across the spectrum using archival data from the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope, the Two Micron All Sky Survey, and NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, as well as GALEX.\n\nBy analyzing the distribution of energy by wavelength, the team uncovered a distinct pattern of stellar age along the galaxy's two prominent spiral arms. The youngest stars appear in the far end of the northwestern arm, within the tidal dwarf candidate, and stellar ages skew progressively older toward the galaxy's center. The southwestern arm displays the same pattern, which is likely connected to waves of star formation triggered by the galactic encounter.\n\nA 2007 study by Cathy Horellou at Onsala Space Observatory in Sweden and Baerbel Koribalski of the Australia National Telescope Facility developed computer simulations of the collision that reproduced the overall appearance of the system as we see it today. According to the closest match, IC 4970 made its closest approach about 130 million years ago and followed a path that took it nearly along the plane of the spiral's disk in the same direction it rotates. The current study is consistent with this picture.\n\nAs in all barred spirals, NGC 6872 contains a stellar bar component that transitions between the spiral arms and the galaxy's central regions. Measuring about 26,000 light-years in radius, or about twice the average length found in nearby barred spirals, it is a bar that befits a giant galaxy. The team found no sign of recent star formation along the bar, which indicates it formed at least a few billion years ago. Its aged stars provide a fossil record of the galaxy's stellar population before the encounter with IC 4970 stirred things up.\n\n\"Understanding the structure and dynamics of nearby interacting systems like this one brings us a step closer to placing these events into their proper cosmological context, paving the way to decoding what we find in younger, more distant systems,\" said team member and Goddard astrophysicist Eli Dwek.\n\nThe study also included Fernanda Urrutia-Viscarra and Claudia Mendes de Oliveira at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil and Dimitri Gadotti at the European Southern Observatory in Santiago, Chile. The GALEX mission is led by the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, which is responsible for science operations and data analysis. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, also in Pasadena, manages the mission and built the science instrument.

{"text":"N49- One of the most extraordinary events in all of Astronomy is the inevitable violent death of massive stars. What is known as a supernova, this event is the very reason why you and I are alive right now. Because massive stars explode violently, the heavy elements they have fused deep within the star are hurtled through space at incredible speeds. Located 160,000 light years away, within the Large Magellanic Cloud, N49 did just that; explode through a core-collapse supernova. We are able to detect x-rays, seen in blue, as well as view N49 through infrared. The reason we can see this supernova in x-ray is because of the million degree gas located in the center. Infrared is seen in wavelengths that are third longest, only to radio and microwaves. Slightly smaller wavelengths than infrared result in visible light, what you and I see at this very moment. It is also worth noting that something called a magnetar exists in the center of this explosion. It is the solid neutron core of a dead, high-mass star. It is rotating at an unbelievable speed. Try hundreds of times per second!! It emits powerful electromagnetic radiation in the form of x-rays and gamma-rays.\n\nThe super star cluster named R136 is located within the Tarantula Nebula and is seen as the numerous blue stars in this image.

{"text":"What is a Hypernova?\nA hypernova is the most destructive force in this universe. The power is almost incomprehensible and they seem to produce so much energy they defy the laws of physics. When one sets off it is the brighter than everything else you can see in the sky.\n\nOne hypernova releases millions of times more light than the all of the billions of stars in our galaxy put together.\n\nWhat causes hypernovae?\nHypernovae are, like supernovae, formed from dying stars. In supernovae, a star grows rapidly, into a huge star called a red giant, but runs out of fuel. This means it suddenly collapses into a dense core, but then explodes outwards releasing a tremendous amount of energy. This blasts of the outer parts, leaving a neutron star. This doe not happen with most stars; only very heavy stars have sufficient energy for this.\n\nA supernova is awesomely powerful, but nothing compared to a hypernova. Hypernova are only formed by incredibly heavy and fast burning stars. A normal star may live for 10 billion years, but one that will become a hypernova will collapse in just 1 million. To burn this quickly they need a huge amount of fuel. The stars find this in what are called 'stellar nurseries', huge clouds of gas that combine to form stars. If a star can get enough gas it will have enough fuel to go through its whole life cycle in a tiny fraction of other stars. To do this these stars need to be around 20x the mass of our sun.\n\nUnlike in a supernova the outer layers of the star are not blown off in an explosion. Instead, the star has so much gravity, because of its mass, that it continues to contract very rapidly. This converts all the gravitational potential energy of the star into heat and light. All the energy in the largest type of star is quickly converted into a form of radiation called 'gamma rays', and then unleashed on the rest of the universe. The effect of these is therefore called a 'gamma ray burst' (GRB). What is left behind is an incredibly dense lump of matter, called a black hole.\n\nWhat would happen if a hypernovae occurred near Earth?\nHere, 'near' is a relative term. 300 light years (almost 10,000 billion kilometres) is close enough for it to appear 1,000,000 times brighter than the sun. The destruction would be total: it would be like 1 million 1-megaton hydrogen bombs going off all over the world at once. That is very approximately 100 times the entire world's nuclear arsenal. The first thing that would happen would be that the enormous heat would convert the nitrogen in the upper atmosphere to nitrous oxides.\n\nThis would destroy the ozone layer that protects us from ultra violet light. Then the rest of the atmosphere would become superheated. It would be like Hiroshima all over the world. This would also trigger other forms of destruction: the high temperatures would cause cyclones, tsunamis and hurricanes all over the Earth.\n\nAn electro-magnetic pulse would also hit. If enough energy is released without there being matter to absorb it, it is converted to electro-magnetic energy. The size of the pulse from a hypernova would instantly destroy every electronic circuit on one half of the Earth.\n\nThe effect on the earth would be identical to a microwave. Invisible and silent rays would roast the atmosphere. If you were deep underground you could survive all this. But then what? All the plants and livestock would have burnt to death and going outside would be impossible because with no ozone layer, our own sun would continually bombard us with harmful rays. Most importantly of all, all the algae would die. Algae are tiny organism that produce most of the Earth's oxygen and are at the bottom of the food chain. With these dead, what life remained on Earth would slowly starve or choke to death. Earth would become a scorched, dead, uninhabitable planet.\n\nThere is absolutely no defence to any of this. We wouldn't even see it coming, as the gamma rays travel at the speed of light so the first time we detected them would be when they hit us.\n\nHow often to hypernovae occur?\nHypernovae occur frighteningly often. Every night more and more gamma ray bursts are located across the universe. They are so powerful we can see them 10 billion light years away, on the other side of the space. At this distance they are no threat, but if one were to occur even a few thousand light years away then the ozone layer would be destroyed and EMP would fry every electronic circuit on one half of the planet. Hypernovae are constantly occurring all over the universe, one day our luck will run out.\n\nMR.G\n\nMay 18th, 2004, 10:45 PM\n\nThey are a factor in why many scientists think there is only a limited zone of possible life in any galaxy. Too close to the center and these firecrackers go off far too regularily and with the density of stars if there is any life forming on any planets withing a couple of thousand light years they get \"defrosted\" as explained above. Mostly gamma rays would sterilize all forms of what we consider life.\n\nOut here on the edge of the galaxy there is a much better chance that if one of these does pop it'll be far enough away just based on the law of averages and the fact that there are only a few dozen star systems within 1,000 light years of our sun.\n\nI firmly believe that given the tiniest chance of life forming , it will. Life is likely popping up all over the galaxies. It is the NORM and not the exception however the reality of things is that our galaxy ain't all that friendly to life. If there are very few advanced species in our galaxy (and I certainly don't include us in that list) it is because they got cooked somewhere along the line by a neighbor star burping enouigh gamma at them to wipe out ALL life within 100 or 10,000 nearby systems.Ghostrider ESP\n\nMay 19th, 2004, 7:27 AM\n\nI thought the distance of 7500 light years was a major factor but they think this one could be so big as to do some damage.

{"text":"January 24, 2012\n\nA team of astronomers published in Nature their \"discovery\" of another invisible galaxy, perhaps made of dark matter. How do astronomers see galaxies that are completely invisible? They used the finest optical instruments located on the Keck II telescope. Keck II has a ten-meter mirror with instruments that are sensitive to visible and near infrared light. It also has a new adaptive optics system with state of the art wave front controllers. Adaptive optics continually adjusts the shape of the mirrors to minimize atmospheric distortion. Of course, instruments cannot detect invisible galaxies. So how do they detect what is invisible?\n\nActually they only saw a giant elliptical galaxy, JVAS B1938+666, surrounded by a ring. The central galaxy shines at 53% of the frequencies emitted by modern hydrogen. Radio telescopes detect several linked-together small galaxies imbedded in the northern part of the ring. In the southern part of the ring, two small galaxies are lined up radially with the central galaxy. The small galaxies shine at 33% of the frequencies emitted by modern hydrogen. Scientists adjust what is visible to fit their mathematical models of reality. They explain that the small galaxies are really an optical illusion. Allegedly the light from a single background galaxy is bent into a ring and split into several parts by the intense gravity of the central object. In their attempts to explain the scene as an optical illusion, scientists encountered some mathematical difficulties. It was necessary to mathematically add the gravity from a massive invisible galaxy to bend the light into the appearance of linked-together small galaxies in the northern part of the ring.\n\nWhat if astronomers could just accept the visible evidence that small galaxies are orbiting the elliptical, leaving trails of gas in their wake?\n\nWe observe rings around all the giant outer planets within the solar system. The spacecraft Cassini repeatedly photographed the rings and moons of Saturn, some of which are imbedded in the rings. Cassini also photographed the E ring being formed right now today as streams of fine ice and gas are visibly ejected from the south pole of Enceladus. They even detected a huge thin ring of charged particles connecting Enceladus to Saturn that lies at right angles to the rings.\n\nIn the neighborhood of the Milky way, radio telescopes detect rivers of gas connected to miniature orbiting galaxies. A river of neutral hydrogen connects the south pole of our galaxy to two miniature companions, the Magellanic galaxies. This suggests that the Magellanic miniatures were ejected from the Milky Way. When a star, or assembly of stars, moves it leaves behind a wake of ejected gas and dust. Evidently companion galaxies were ejected and orbit the parent galaxy.\n\nTelescopic long exposures of the distant sky find a wallpaper of ancient galaxies as they appeared long ago. The light from these ancient galaxies shines at fractional rates of those from modern, local atoms. Some of the ancient galaxies appear to be primordial one-armed spirals. They look like tadpoles with tails made of discrete, equally-spaced clumps. At close ranges we observe how the arms have rotated around more, accelerated out more as the clumps spread out, following each other out in lanes. The closer galaxies shine at bluer spectral frequencies than the primordial ones. Evidently both the star streams and the atomic clocks accelerated together as the stars came out, rotated out, taking up more volume as galaxies intrinsically grew from the insides outwards. We also observe clusters of miniature galaxies packed around a large elliptical. The clusters often contain streaks of gas, evidently the trails left as the miniature galaxies move around their massive parents. In general, the arms of early spirals and the clusters of miniature galaxies shine with different spectral colors than the core of each galaxy or the giant elliptical in the heart of the cluster.\nWhy is it so hard for astronomers to accept the only history that is visible as it happened, galactic history? Why do they need to invent galaxies made entirely of invisible matter? The scientific universe is 99% made of magical things, such as invisible matter, never detected anywhere. People don't invent invisible things unless they have some basic creed that motivates them to do so. The Bible predicts that in the last days mockers will come saying all things remain the same. They will obfuscate the age of the plural heavens with this idea - that the properties of all things are fixed. Indeed, science was founded on this very idea, that the essence of substance is changeless. Generations of scientists used this basic assumption to define various entities, such as mass, energy and time, and symbolical ways of \"measuring\" these undetectable things. Our system works, says the scientist. It works locally because the definitions and most measuring units were contrived with the one assumption: that atoms are immutable and dither with perpetual motion. None of their mathematical constants work in the distant universe without the need for inventing undetectable things like black holes and invisible matter.\nWhat we see in the universe is creation and cosmic history, exactly as described in the biblical text. He created the plural heavens and the Earth first. Yet at that stage the earth was without form until He continued to command light to continue to be. Apparently that is when matter began to take up space as a relation with light. Later He formed the Sun, Moon and stars and placed them in the spreading place, the raqiya. He continues to call the stars to come out in unbroken continuity and no star goes missing. Since we see biblical creation and biblical cosmic history, we can be sure that the Creator will make foolish science, the system that was founded on the idea that all things remain the same. Carefully examine the basic creed of all scientists, that the properties of matter are fixed, not emerging. We see the opposite everywhere in the universe.\n\nRadio image of JVAS B1938+666 come from the Merlin radio telescope. Infrared photos of the ringed system come from the Keck II telescope. The article on the invisible galaxy was produced by Dr. Simona Vegetti and a team of other astronomers.\n\nTuesday, January 17, 2012\n\nThe early philosophers struggled with the problem of change. Their verbal way of referring to things reinforced what they observed in nature, that everything is changing. The problem is that if everything physical is really changing, what is true today would not be the same in some other era and man could not invent a rational science. Only in the west, did philosophers finally \"solve the problem of change\" by assuming, based on Aquinas and the ticking of clocks, that the essence of all substance is changeless. In the western system, change is limited by the force of this dogma, which I call the western first principle. Scientifically, everything can change. Matter can combine, change state, fuse into new forms, disintegrate through radioactivity or highly energetic collisions. Everything can change except the kind of change Paul describes, which is not allowed in the western system. Lets look at Pauline physics in Romans 8:19 - 22. Paul's use of Greek verbs demonstrates how his physics works.\n\nPaul used two hupotasso verbs. Hupo means under. Tasso means to appoint, to order, to arrange. Polybius used hupotasso for troops under the command of their general. They would instantly, as a unit, together, obey orders because they were arranged in orderly ranks under his command, such as the command to \"Charge!\"\n\nThe first hupotasso verb is aorist (we are not told when), passive, indicative. The creation is under a command to passive transitiveness (mataiotes). This noun is dative, the indirect object. Transitivity was not its original nature, since it is not voluntary, it is commanded to passively arrange itself under the orders of its Creator. (By the way, God's curse is also passive in Genesis 3. He cursed the ground and the animals passively, they were commanded to naturally degenerate).\n\nThe second hupotasso verb is also aorist (no reference is made to time with this verb form) but it is active and a participle. We do not know when or for how long, but the universe actively continues to obey in an orderly manner God's command to become transitive.\n\nIn verse 21 Paul mentions a future liberation, when the sons of God are revealed (see 19). The universe, ktisis, will be freed from its slavery to change (phthora). The philosophers used the word phthora for fundamental change. Aristotle used it for change of a city's constitution. Plato used this for the ongoing change that affects all thing since the beginning, genesis ka phthora. The universe is presently enslaved to an orderly, active change that affects all things, yet it is part of nature, since God's command was passive, \"Universe do it to yourself - become transitory.\"\n\nIn verse 22 Paul uses two Greek together verbs, sustenazo and sunodino, to illustrate how the universe is enslaved to change. Both verbs are present active indicative, showing that the universe continues to actively act in a together manner. The first verb is to moan jointly. If the Romans breached the walls of a city, the population would moan together, because everyone would experience the same horror - communal suffering. The whole universe is communally suffering this enslavement to change. The second together verb is used for simultaneous pangs, concerted together pain, such as the pains of childbirth where many muscles act together, in concert. Every individual part of the universe is changing in a together manner. Actions that work together are known as relational. Relational changes are not logical, since they are not following the laws of cause and effect. Instead everything changes together. For example, when a cell divides, billions of processes of extreme complexity act together to replicate the cell. No part of a cell is indifferent to the actions, all parts work together, relationally.\n\nWhat is Paul referring to? Origen, a Greek scholar of the 3rd century, in his commentary on Romans believed this is qualitative changes in all things, including the Sun and stars. Modern Christians try to understand this text using the 2nd law. Is Paul predicting the second law of thermodynamics? Not hardly! No one in that era could even imagine such a law. Furthermore, (1) the second law is not universal. Scientists never apply it to the internals of atoms. (2) The second law is not orderly, it is random disorder. (3) The second law is not concerted, simultaneous relational change. We observe what Paul stated locally and in the distant sky. Every atom in billions of galaxies is enslaved to change, to becoming transitive. The change is concerted and relational. Ancient atoms clocked tiny fractions of the frequencies of modern atoms. We confirm that this goes on even today because when we sent the Pioneers out of the solar system, their clock signals transmitted hours ago kept changing with distance in the same direction and at approximately Hubble's ratio. Astronomers use this ratio to estimate the distance to a galaxy using its observed atomic clock frequencies. Evidently every atoms, near and far, is changing in a together, relational manner, as we observe.\n\nIt is not just the light that changes. We also observe what God says He continues to do, call the stars to come out and spread out the plural heavens (the galaxies) in unbroken continuity. We observe that many early galaxies were tiny and naked, without starry appendages. These early galaxies are often clustered in the neighborhood of massive elliptical galaxies, from which they evidently emerged. We observe at many ranges how galaxies intrinsically grew, the stars continuing to come out and spread out, orbits accelerating along with the atomic clocks.\n\nClearly there is order in the universe. Every atom has an orderly nature. Yet atoms and their properties are both observed to change, the space matter takes up and its inertial properties appear to change along with the light frequencies as galaxies intrinsically spread out. Look at the heavens and you will see the glory of God. He is powerful and wise, so wise that He makes foolish the wise of this age.\n\nThe picture is a painting from Rafael, painted in 1515. He depicts the Apostle Paul arguing before the assembled Athenian philosophers, the assembly of Areopagus on Mars Hill.\n\nWednesday, January 11, 2012\n\nWe sometimes interpret ancient documents with concepts that did not exist in that era. Translators insert thousands of tensed verbs into our translations of the Old Testament even though ancient Hebrew had no verb tenses. Reading the Creation account with continuing action verbs is quite different from reading modern exegeses. We also read into the writings of the Greeks, ideas that did not develop until centuries later. The verbal way the Greeks expressed what a thing \"is\" prevented them from thinking about matter the way we do. Translators render one of Aristotle's verbal expressions as \"being qua being\" as though this is a noun. They translate ousia as substance, although such a concept came from the medieval age. 1. Early people had non linear ideas about time. Flavius Josephus lists several historians from the classical age who agreed that the record showed the first generations lived for a thousand years. Ovid wrote that the first people lived before new seas formed and slept their lives away. Hesiod recorded that children from the silver generation played at their mother's knee for a hundred years. He groaned that in the iron age people never stopped laboring by day and dying by night. He believed this deterioration would continue until children were born with graying temples. Jacob stated in Genesis 47:9 that the days and years of the children are shorter and worse than the days and years of the fathers. Job, in chapter 14, moaned that man who is born of woman is of few days, yet he ascribed geological ages to those days. He mentions moving mountains, water wearing away stones, the dust of the earth washing away and the dried sea (Hebrew west) as markers for the shortness of life. Drill cores show layers of deep sea oozes alternating with gypsum and salt, showing that the Mediterranean dried repeatedly. In some deep basins the salt layers are more than a thousand meters thick. Cores from Cairo show that the Nile was once a 8200-foot deep canyon cut through rock as it flowed down into a largely empty Mediterranean basin. Job described dinosaurs in the rushing waters of the Jordan. He mentions people's faces deformed, shanah paniym, before they died. The skull is the only part of our skeleton that keeps growing with age. If we lived for geological ages, we would grow Neanderthal brows. Is it significant that Neanderthal children had skulls more like ours than those of their elders?\n\n2. Those who think that the first generations lived for eons cannot imagine that matter has an unchanging essence. Ovid told a story of the second Roman king traveling to Croton to meet Pythagoras. The story is factually unlikely, since they lived in different centuries, yet it encodes the way of thinking of that era. Ovid has Pythagoras state, \"Nothing keeps its original shape and nature, ever renewing the world, creates new forms from the old ones endlessly. Believe me when I say that nothing perishes, ever, anywhere in the world. Rather, things change; they make their forms anew; and to be born simply means that something is other than it was before; to die, that it has ceased to be what it was. While things change from one state to another, now to this one, now to that one, the sum of things stays constant. But truly, nothing keeps the same for long, or so I believe. Thus it is, O ages past, that you have gone from gold to iron . . . Metamorphosis Book 15.\" Claudius Ptolemy agreed that mathematics tracks with the changing nature of things. \"It is an attribute of all existing things without exception, both mortal and immortal: for those things which are perceptually changing in their inseparable form, it (mathematics) changes with them, . . .\" \"physics (is guesswork) because of the unstable and unclear nature of matter; hence there is no hope that philosophers will ever be agreed about them.\" (Ptolemy's Almagest Book 1).\nThe idea that substance has an intrinsic fixed nature took centuries to develop even after Thomas' invented the notions of being and essence. The ticking of pendulum clocks was instrumental in bringing on the idea that the essence of all substance is changeless. Newton's time was mathematical, no longer heralded by crowing roosters and the setting sun, but by the assumption that clocks are linear, made of matter whose essence is changeless. Modern scientists derive most of their empirical definitions, measuring units and mathematical constants by assuming that atoms are intrinsically immutable and dither with perpetual motion. Almost everything scientists do and think is based on the notion that things have an intrinsic essence, an unchanging being.\n\nWe can test the scientific first principle with the light from ancient galaxies. Not a single only of the hundreds of billions of ancient galaxies shone with the light frequencies of modern hydrogen atoms. The most-distant spectra analyzed to date shone at one tenth the frequencies of today's atoms. When we sent calibrated clocks out of the solar system on the Pioneers, the frequencies transmitted hours ago increased their differences, compared to NASA's hydrogen maser clocks of the moment, with distance. The ratio of how the Pioneer clocks kept changing with distance approximated the Hubble ratio that astronomers use to estimate the distance to far way galaxies using the observed atomic clock rates. Scientists have filled the universe with ridiculous vacuums that stretch light and four times as much invisible matter as the natural kind because atoms are not supposed to intrinsically change their essence as they age.\nThe only place where we see history as it happened is in galactic history. Not only did ancient atomic clocks tick at slower rates, but ancient orbits also accelerated. We observe how many ancient galaxies were naked and tiny, without starry appendages. We observe, at closer ranges, how equally spaced globs came out, spread out, rotated out as innumerable galaxies grew into huge growth spirals. Evidently the atomic clocks accelerated along with the accelerating star streams as galaxies grew, intrinsically taking up more volume. Visibly, the properties of all matter keep on changing relationally throughout cosmic history.\nThis is a composite picture of ACT-CL J0102-4915, from NASA. It shows an enormous galaxy cluster nicknamed El Gordo, shining from the ancient universe. Two tails of small galaxies spread out from a large elliptical at one end. The blue in the picture is from intra cluster gas shining in X-rays, as recorded by Chandra. Red and green represent infrared taken by Spitzer and visible light recorded by the VLT telescope. Gas trails are observed among the dozens of small spiral galaxies in the twin tails of the cluster. Scientists claim that galaxy clusters have 10 times as much invisible matter as what we see from light. Some astronomers claim the invisible matter is bending the light from more distant galaxies so that they only appear to be in the neighborhood of the cluster. Others think that the invisible matter is also causing small galaxies to fall inwards, forming the twin tails. How much simpler to accept that matter is intrinsically changing its properties throughout cosmic history as galaxies spread out. The earliest matter was tohu bohu, compact and formless. We confirm this on our own planet because the continents only fit together on a tiny globe, without major seas. New sea floor continues to emerge from the molten interior of the Earth along a global expansion seam. The theory of subduction is clearly denied by the layered undisturbed sediments in the subduction zones. Evidently Thomas was wrong; being and essence were figments of his imagination.\n\nFriday, January 06, 2012\n\nClassical Greek did not have a simple noun for being. Instead they used various conjugations of the Greek verb to be: esti, einai, on. The present tense of einai has continuity - becoming, whereas in English \"is\" only describes what exists now. Perhaps because einai calls to mind continuing activity, the philosophers thought the elements were changing, passing through transformative stages, coming-to-be. Twenty-five hundred years ago, Parmenides insisted that if what \"is\" continues to change, the philosophers would fail in their efforts to invent a natural science. He used the present participle of einai, on, to suggest that what a thing \"is\" does not change. The Greeks used a related adverb, ontos, for \"really, indeed, actually.\" Our word ontology, the study of being, came from this Greek word.\nThe Greeks also did not have a simple word for the nature of material things. Aristotle used the verbal phrase \"on e on\" to refer to the properties of things as well as the things themselves. He used wood (hyle) for matter and morphe for its form. He thought hyle continued to change its form like a child growing in the womb. The Greeks used a noun, ousia, formed from the present participle of einai, to show things participating in some property. A person might participate in the property of being wealthy.\n\nBecause Parmenides insisted that things cannot be actually changing, the philosophers began searching for something unchanging. However, everything visible was changing. The atomists imagined that indivisible things (atoms) are not changing. Yet they admitted that everything continues to wear out with old age because the tiny bits of stuff collide and degrade their structured arrangements. Aristotle claimed that hypokeimenon (what lies under) does not change. Hypokeimenon, like an atom, is undetectable. Because ancient Greek had no simple nouns for unchanging being and fixed essence, the philosophers were unable to resolve the problem of continuing change, that everything in nature is in flux.\n\nToday we can describe the state of existing with the noun \"being.\" We also use the noun \"essence\" to describe a substance's fixed, predominant properties. How did we arrive at noun concepts about unchanging being and essence that did not exist for the first philosophers?\n\nSeven hundred fifty years ago, Friar Thomas wrote voluminously promoting Aristotle's system as the basis for a Christianized philosophy. His book \"On Being and Essence\" begins by explaining that a small initial error leads to big errors in the end. This is why it is important to understand ente and essentia, being and essence. Thomas wrote in Summa Theoligica that God's name, I AM, shows that He is pure, unchanging Being, perfectly good. He does not just posses goodness, as a one possesses property. Created beings, however, participate in the ten Aristotelian categories and therefore have separate characteristics of being and essence. Later, Friar Scotus argued that we never see a thing apart from its properties, so being and essence are one and the same. The Latin notions of being and essence simplified Aristotelian metaphysics. Western science was founded on the notion of the enduring stability of being and essence.\nOne invention contributed greatly to the western notion that the essence of substance is changeless. During the thirteenth century, monks built weight driven clocks for calling the faithful to prayer, however, they were quite irregular. In the seventeenth century, pendulum clocks constructed with verge escapements, balance wheels and deadbeat escapements ticked with monotonous regularity. The regular ticking suggested to western ears that the essence of substance is changeless. Newton used the idea that matter is intrinsically unchanging to imagine that time runs at a fixed rate, independent of anything else. His calculus was based on the notion that some things change independently. Indeed, when scientists used clocks to measure orbits, they found that they are clock-like. Today most scientific empirical units are scaled from atomic seconds, such as the length of a meter, velocities, accelerations, the mathematical laws of motion. The idea that the essence of substance is changeless became the foundational principle for western empirical science.\n\nNineteen hundred fifty years ago, Peter predicted that mockers will come in the last days claiming that all things remain the same (panta houtos diamenei). They will use this idea to obfuscate (lanthano) the history (age) of the plural heavens (evidently the galaxies) and Earth's watery geology. This prophecy has come true. Scientists cannot accept what is visible, that every atom shining from billions of ancient galaxies clocks a different frequency from modern atoms. They claim that space time, something never detected, is stretching the vacuum of space which allegedly alters the frequencies of passing light. They claim that the universe contains four times as much invisible matter as the visible kind because the orbits in billions of galaxies are violating their gravity laws. They claim 70% of all cosmic processes come from an expanding vacuum that pulls energy out of the vacuum to expand itself. The expanding vacuum pushes distant galaxies away at near light speed. They even believe that a tiny bit of vacuum exploded and created everything out of nothing. The scientific universe is 99% magical and invisible because the structure of empirical, mathematical science was built on the idea that the essence of substance, its being, what it intrinsically is, is not continuing to change in an orderly manner.\n\nWhere did this idea come from? The Greeks tried to invent science but they failed because of their verbal, dynamic notions of reality. The Friars modified Aristotelian thinking with their nouns for being and essence. The monotonous ticking of clocks allowed scientists to invent an empirical mathematical system, based on their firm faith that the essence of all substance is intrinsically unchanging.\nThe Bible states the opposite. Paul used Greek verbs for orderly submission and together changes to illustrate how the creation is enslaved to change (Greek phthora Romans 8:19 - 22). Indeed, we see with sight that the universe is eons old, just like the Bible so plainly states. We see with our eyes how billions of orbits spread out, accelerated out, as galaxies grew into huge growth spirals. The Creator claims that He is spreading out the plural heavens in unbroken continuity. How could galaxies grow in only 6,000 years? We observe that the properties of matter continue to emerge as the orbits and the clocks both accelerate together. We even see on our planet that the continents only fit together on a tiny globe. The Bible states three times that the earth spreads out in unbroken continuity. Job mentioned how the sea, Hebrew west, dried during one lifetime during the dinosaur age. We verify with drill cores that the Mediterranean dried repeatedly. We even find the skulls of our ancestors with huge thick brows as though they lived for geological eons.\nCarefully test the first principle of western science by observing galactic history. How great will be the triumph of the word of God over science, the system that was founded on an elementary creed that the essence of substance is changeless. We observe the opposite - that everything is in flux.\n\nThe illustration if from Huygens second pendulum clock published in 1673."}

Vela-C is the most massive component of the Vela Molecular Ridge, a vast star-forming complex in the plane of our Galaxy, the Milky Way.\n\nLocated roughly 2300 light years away, Vela-C saw the onset of star formation less than a million years ago \u2013 relatively recently on astronomical timescales. Massive, as well as low- and intermediate-mass, stars are being born in this region, making it an ideal laboratory to study the birth of different populations of stars.\n\nThis image reveals previously unseen detail in the cold mixture of gas and dust that pervades the region. The coldest and densest portions of the cloud complex release most of their radiation at the longest wavelengths probed by Herschel, shown in red in this image. The cloud material is organised in a highly sub-structured network, with tangled and less organised material alternating with more defined and elongated filaments. Intricate bundles of material can be seen on the left, centre and right of the image. These nest-like structures are linked to one another by dense, ridge-like filaments.\n\nA number of white flecks dot the clouds and, in particular, the prominent ridge-like filaments in Vela-C. These flecks are in fact pre-stellar cores \u2013 compact clumps of matter that might eventually give rise to star formation \u2013 and proto-stellar cores, whose density is high enough for star formation to have already begun, eventually resulting in fully-fledged stars.\n\nNot only does Vela-C host seeds of future stellar generations, it also comprises a handful of objects that have already evolved into young, massive stars. Embedded in the central part of the image is a stellar cluster whose stars are not visible in the Herschel image, but their effects are. The butterfly-shaped structure at the centre of the image, known as RCW 36 (or Gum 20), is a result of winds and radiation released by the hot stars in this cluster. RCW 36 is an HII region \u2013 a pocket of gas that is being energised and ionised by the action of nearby young, massive stars. Due to its higher temperature relative to the colder material in the cloud, RCW 36 shines brightly at the shortest wavelengths probed by Herschel, indicated in blue in this image. In the lower right corner of the image is another HII region called RCW 34 (or Gum 19); it is unclear whether RCW 34 and the hot stars that illuminate it are part of the Vela-C molecular cloud or whether they are located farther away.\n\nThis false-colour image combines data acquired with the PACS instrument at 70 micron (shown in blue) and 160 micron (shown in green) and with the SPIRE instrument at 250 micron (shown in red)."}

Now, Russell and his colleagues report on the strongest evidence yet for Venusian lightning (2012).In order to remove interference from magnetometer data collected previously by Venus Express, Russell and his team devised a new algorithm that uses the inboard sensor to detect interfering signals and then removes the same signals from the outboard sensor data, resulting in a \"cleaned\" signal covering the frequency rane from 0 to 64 Hz.Using the improved data collected during periapsis of the Venus Express spacecraft on April 15th of 2007, the researchers detected magnetic signals that led them to believe the craft had flown over an electrical storm.Of note are two very different signals the authors believe are associated with electrical activity in the atmosphere of Venus:1. a waveform that follows the prevailing magnetic field in the ionosphere and occurs at 20 Hz or above in the Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) range, and2. a second signal that occurs at Ultra-low (ULF) frequencies (and are thus not restricted to moving along the magnetic field) and which propagates upward through the atmosphere. The likely source is electrical activity beneath the spacecraft.In addition, the data revealed the presence of whistler waves (which would be expected if lightning were present), and is consistent with previous studies (Russell et al. 2007).Why is lightning on Venus important? Knowing it is there can help in comparative studies between Earth and Venus, but more importantly it can help assist in the understanding of the chemical processes at work in the Venusian atmosphere. The temperatures and pressures present in a lightning discharge provide a significant amount of energy that can drive chemical reactions, such as those that produce nitrous oxide. Lightning is a proposed energy source for the creation of amino acids on the primordial Earth, the building blocks of life.REFERENCESTaylor, W. W. L., Scarf, F. L., Russell, C. T., & Brace, L. H.

Even the ESA website poses the news as a question. So, does Venus have active volcanism? First, let's talk about the paper and what it reports.Emmanuel Marcq and colleagues used ultraviolet spectrometer data collected from 2007 to 2012 using the SPICAV instrument aboard the Venus Express spacecraft to examine the density of sulphur dioxide above the clouds of Venus. They found that SO2 column densities increased prior to 2007, and then decreased by a factor of 5 over the next five years.This finding is quite similar to observations made by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter in the 1970s and 1980s, which revealed a ten-fold decrease in SO2 column density. At the time, Larry Esposito (1984) of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics in Boulder interpreted this decline to have occurred following an episode of volcanogenic upwelling from the lower atmosphere (it is important to note that SO2 is abundant and ubiquitous in the lower atmosphere of Venus).Marcq, et al. conclude that the SO2 variability observed from the 1970s to the present is the result of long-timescale fluctuations in upward transport from the troposphere to the mesosphere.What they do not know is whether this is the result of 1) episodic increased buoyancy from volcanic plumes, or 2) intrinsic dynamic variability in the upward component of the global circulation.Back to our original question: Does Venus possess active volcanoes? This study cannot answer that question. The authors seem to want it to be so, but say in their conclusion: \"By Occam's razor, we are inclined to think that this variability originates from intrinsic dynamical variability in the ascending sub-solar branch of the global circulation at cloud-top level on a decennial timescale rather than from an external forcing such as extra buoyancy caused by volcanic eruptions, but we cannot dismiss a volcanic forcing through our study alone.\"It's pretty clear that most people want active volcanoes on Venus, but the jury is still out, I'm afraid.REFERENCES:Esposito, L.

Theoretical calculations negate the presence of structures larger than 1.2 billion light-years.

(One AU, or astronomical unit is nearly 93 million miles, or 150 million kilometers i.e. the distance from Earth to the sun).\n\nBinary star systems, in which two stars are revolving around one another, are as common in our galaxy as the single stars. Recently, scientists have found planets in those binary star systems presenting two stars in the sky of those planets. In those, many of the systems are wide binaries i.e. the distance between the stars is 1000 AU or more, and the orbits of those circulating bodies change with time due to their distance from each other.\n\n\"The stellar orbits of wide binaries are very sensitive to disturbances from other passing stars as well as the tidal field of the Milky Way,\" Kaib said in a statement. \"This causes their stellar orbits to constantly change their eccentricity, their degree of circularity. If a wide binary lasts long enough, it eventually will find itself with a very high orbital eccentricity at some point in its life.\"\n\nResearchers performed nearly 3,000 computer simulations and found that the eccentric orbits could bring the two stars quite close together resulting in huge disturbances to the orbits of the planets in those systems. In a series of computer simulations, researchers added a wide-binary companion to our own solar system and found that at least one giant planet, i.e. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus or Neptune, ejected into the space in half of thoseResearchers have also found that the planetary ejection is not always the result of such destabilization but the exoplanets could be moved from the near circular orbits to the more eccentric orbits.\n\n\"We also found that there is substantial evidence that this process occurs regularly in known extrasolar planetary systems,\" Queen's University physics professor Martin Duncan, saidSimulations also showed that such disturbances occur only in the planets that are 10 AU or so from the host star.\n\n\"Given that most planet-detection campaigns cannot detect planets beyond 5-10 AU from their host stars, our results provide new clues about the characteristics of planetary systems in a regime that is poorly constrained by current observations,\" Kaib told SPACE.com. \"We believe that planets orbiting at distances of 10 AU or further from their host stars are common.\"\n\nWhy is this post inappropriate?\n\nEarth is the only planet in our solar system with a long-term, stable supply of liquid water \u2013 essential for the formation and evolution of all organic life.

As a result of these variations in the plasma, weak magnetic fields are formed, which are referred to as random fields. In this research, Prof. Schlickeiser calculated the strength of the fields in fully ionized plasma of protons and electrons especially for the gas densities and temperatures that occurred in the plasmas of the early universe.\n\nIt has been found that the magnetic field varies with the position in the plasma.\n\nA strength of 10-20 Tesla, i.e. 10 sextillionth of a Tesla, has been calculated in the luminous gas of the early universe that is very weak as for comparison Earth's magnetic field has a strength of 30 millionths of a Tesla. Although the early magnetic field was very weak but it was sufficient to cover almost every part of the plasma volume.\n\nThose fields were strengthened and aligned on a wide-scale as a result of the shock waves generated by the stellar winds or supernova explosions of the first huge stars.

{"text":"Where will new Fermi telescope find dark matter?\n\nIt may be the closest thing astronomers have to a betting pool: Where will NASA's new Fermi gamma-ray telescope detect its first hint of dark matter?\n\nSome believe the best chance of a detection lies in nearby dwarf galaxies, since they should contain dense nuggets of dark matter that could be relatively easy to pinpoint.\n\nBut a new study argues that a diffuse dark matter 'halo' surrounding the Milky Way offers an even better shot at glimpsing the mysterious stuff.\n\n\"I would bet on it,\" says lead author Volker Springel of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany. \"And I'd be willing to risk a bit of money as well.\"\n\nNo one knows what dark matter is, since its presence is inferred only by its gravitational pull on normal matter. But researchers believe it is made up of particles that annihilate when they collide with each other. This produces gamma-ray photons that could be detected by telescopes such as Fermi (formerly called GLAST), which launched in June.\n\nThe question is, where is the best place to observe these photons?\n\nSome say it is the mammoth cloud, or halo, of dark matter that surrounds the Milky Way. Such giant halos are thought to have coalesced from clumps of dark matter that formed soon after the big bang.\n\nBut small clumps of dark matter - weighing as little as the Earth - should still exist. They are expected to cluster in the halos of low-mass dwarf galaxies, a number of which orbit the Milky Way.\n\nDiffuse glow\n\nTo find out where Fermi is likely to spot a dark matter signal, Springer and colleagues ran detailed computer simulations of dark matter in a Milky Way-like galaxy. They found that the best chance of a detection came from the diffuse halo itself, and in particular its central region, within the orbit of the Sun (see images at right).\n\nThe diffuse halo does produce the highest number of gamma rays from dark matter annihilation, says J\u00fcrg Diemand of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved in the study. \"That's simply because we are only [26,000 light years] away from the centre of the massive main halo, while dwarf galaxies have much smaller halos and are further away,\" Diemand told New Scientist.\n\nBut he disagrees with the team's conclusion that the halo offers the best chance of a dark matter detection. That's because ordinary matter can also produce a diffuse glow of gamma rays - for example, when gas is hit by charged particles called cosmic rays - and researchers do not yet know how to tease apart the two different signals.\n\nPinpointing the source\n\n\"Current models of diffuse gamma-ray signals from ordinary matter have uncertainties in the spatial and energy distribution which are much larger than the expected diffuse dark matter signal,\" he says.\n\nIt would be easier, he says, to distinguish between the two types of signal in dwarf galaxies. Unlike the diffuse gamma-ray glow expected from the main halo, dwarf galaxies would appear like single \"point sources\" of radiation to Fermi.\n\nSo astronomers could observe the sky around them at a variety of wavelengths to see if other, ordinary sources - such as gas clouds - could be responsible for the gamma rays.\n\n\"In principle, it's possible to make sure there's not enough gas along that line of sight to give you such a point source,\" Diemand says, adding that a dark matter signal might be seen by Fermi within its first year of operation.\n\nMystery particle\n\nBut team member Carlos Frenk of Durham University in the UK says it should be possible to distinguish between dark matter and normal, 'foreground' matter in the halo, as well.\n\n\"The foreground should not be a show-stopper,\" Frenk told New Scientist.\n\n\"Fermi is able to measure the intensity of gamma rays at different energies,\" he says. \"The dark matter signal is expected to have a very different 'energy spectrum' from the foregrounds and this will greatly ease the task of subtracting the unwanted foreground.\"\n\n\"The key question that remains is how intense the dark matter radiation will be in the first place,\" he continues. \"And this depends on the largely unknown properties of the elementary particles that we are looking for\n\nMore than a billion particles were included in a simulation of dark matter in a Milky Way-like galaxy.

The whole process will take thousands of years, however.\n\nThe European Space Agency's Herschel telescope has snapped a new image of Betelgeuse, which is in the Orion constellation, in the visible night sky, showing an obstacle in the path of the brightly shining sun.\n\nThe orange-red star is a thousand times the diameter of our Sun and shines a hundred thousand times more brightly, but its expansion into supergiant hunk has come at a cost. The body has shed a significant amount of its outer layers, which can be seen in Hershel's picture.\n\nThe infrared view shows how the star's fierce winds are whipping across the surrounding space, creating a bow shock around Betelgeuse as it hurtles through the cosmos at 30km a second. This series of broken dusty arcs lie in front of the star, showing its direction of motion. Around the star itself lies a lopsided halo of material, likely to have resulted from localised, clumps of dusty debris.\n\nBut further out in space, a bar of what appears to be more dust is lying right across Betelgeuse's path. Boffins have previously thought that this bar could also have originally come from the star, but analysis of this image suggests that it's either a linear filament linked to the galaxy's magnetic field or the edge of a nearby interstellar cloud, lit up by the star's bright light.\n\nIf the bar is a completely separate object, Betelgeuse's outer arc will crash into it in just 5,000 years and the red star itself will follow, around 12,500 years later.\n\nThe supergiant is expected to approach supernova within the next million years. \u00ae"}

(NASA)\n\n\"Although dark energy accounts for more than 70 per cent of the energy of the universe, we know very little about it, so each clue is precious,\" he said in a NASA release.\n\nThe finding that dark energy has existed for most of the universe's history will help scientists by ruling out a competing explanation that held that the force changed over time.\n\nAstrophysicists are particularly interested in two of dark energy's fundamental properties: its strength and its permanence.\n\nThe new observations show it was present and countering the force of gravity long before dark energy began to force the universe apart.\n\nPrevious Hubble observations show that gravity was slowing the expansion of the universe. But the expansion rate began to speed up about five to six billion years ago, when dark energy's repulsive force overcame gravity's attraction, astronomers believe.\n\nHubble studied dark energy by looking at the behavior of the 24 most distant supernovae, most found in the past two years. The supernovae, stars that exploded eons ago, are too far away to be studied by ground-based telescopes.\n\nThe change in supernovae can be used to trace the universe's expansion, NASA said, likening them to the marks parents make on a door frame to measure a child's growth.\n\nThe Hubble observations are consistent with a prediction made nearly a century ago by Albert Einstein. He thought there must be energy coming from empty space forcing the universe apart, or else gravity would cause the universe to collapse on itself.\n\nEinstein's \"cosmological constant\" was only a hypothesis until 1998, when Riess and others figured out that space was expanding at an increasing rate, based on supernovae observations"}

{"text":"The oldest star yet discovered is HE 1523-0901, HE 1523-0901 is the designation given to a red giant star in the Milky Way galaxy approximately 7500 light years from Earth. It is thought to be a second generation Population II, or metal-poor, star ([Fe\/H] = \u22122.95). The star was found in the sample of bright metal-poor halo stars from the Hamburg\/ESO Survey by Anna Frebel and collaborators. The group's research was published in the May 10 2007 issue of The Astrophysical Journal. The star's age, as measured by ESO's Very Large Telescope, is 13.2 billion years. This makes it the oldest object yet discovered in the galaxy, and nearly as old as the estimated age of the universe itself (13.7 billion years as measured by WMAP). HE 1523-0901 is the first star whose age was determined using the decay of the radioactive elements uranium and thorium in tandem with measurements of several neutron capture elements. It is believed to have formed directly from the remnants of the first-generation stars that reached the end of their longevity and exploded as supernovae early in the history of known matter.\n\nFacts: The Northern Lights are discharged particles from the sun that comes in different colors.\n\nThe Northern Lights or Aurora Borealis are discharged particles from the sun that pass through the magnetic shield of earth and create light when they mix with atoms and molecules such as nitrogen and oxygen gases on entering into the earth's atmosphere. These particles travel 149 million kms or 93 million miles through space towards planet earth being drawn towards the earth's magnetic north and south polar regions. As the solar wind particles enter the earth's atmosphere they collide with molecules of nitrogen and oxygen which relinquish their agitated energy in the form of light. Oxygen typically produces green and yellow light while nitrogen produces reds, violets and occasionally blue. Violets typically form a boarder around curtains of green aurora shapes in lower altitudes.\n\nMany astronomers consider Saturn the most beautiful planet in the solar system Primarily because of its distinctive, amazing rings. In fact, Saturn's nickname is \"the jewel of the solar system.\" Most gas giants have rings made of dust and other particles, but they're typically hard to see and are not a prominent feature of the planets. Rings like the ones Saturn has, which are large and very visible through a telescope, are incredibly rare among planets in our galaxy. The solar system is an amazing place because it boasts not just the only known life-sustaining planet Earth, but also a beautiful gas giant like Saturn, which would likely be the first planet noticed by extraterrestrial life forms if they happened upon our system (gas giants are much easier to detect from distance than rocky planets like Earth).\n\nFact: The Earth gets 100 tons heavier every day due to falling space dust.\n\nThe earth is a closed system and as such does not gain or lose any weight. However, around 100 tons of space dust falls to earth every day, and when shuttles or satellites are launched, technically the earth is losing some weight from it. But this is negligible and as such should be disregarded. The most weight the earth has ever lost is when the moon was formed by a collision with another proto-planet.\n\nOn the first moon landing, US astronaut Alan Shepard swung a six iron four times. His first swing moved the ball less than a meter; his second swing missed and kicked up some dust. The third swing hit that same first ball about 200 yards - a slice. Then he dropped a second ball, and his fourth swing hit the ball about 400 yards.\n\nIf you've ever gazed at the night sky, you've probably wished upon a shooting star (which are really meteors). But shooting stars do exist, Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) and they're stars with a velocity so great that they are able toescapethe gravitational pull of the galaxy. They're extremely rare, currently, sixteen are known, one of which is believed to originate from the Large Magellanic Cloud rather than the Milky Way. All of the currently known HVSs are over 50,000 parsecs away and are unbound from the galaxy. It is believed that about 1000 HVSs exist in our Galaxy.Considering that there are around 100 billion stars in the Milky Way, this is a minuscule fraction (~0.000001%).\n\nThe existence of HVSs was first predicted in 1988,and their existence confirmed In 2005, astronomers discovered the first \"hypervelocity\" star careening out of a galaxy at nearly 530 miles per second (10 times faster than ordinary star movement). Ordinary stars in the galaxy have velocities on the order of 100 km\/s, while hypervelocity stars (especially those near the center of the galaxy, which is where most are thought to be produced), have velocities on the order of 1000 km\/s.\n\nWe have ideas about what flings these rare stars into deep space, but aren't certain; anything from off-kilter supernova explosions to supermassive black holes might be responsible.\n\nThe Sun, like most other astronomical objects (planets, asteroids, galaxies, etc.), rotates on its axis. Unlike Earth and other solid objects, the entire Sun doesn't rotate at the same rate. Because the Sun is not solid, but is instead a giant ball of gas and plasma, different parts of the Sun spin at different rates.\n\nWe can tell how quickly the surface of the Sun is rotating by observing the motion of structures, such as sunspots, on the Sun's visible surface. The regions of the Sun near its equator rotate once every 25 days. The Sun's rotation rate decreases with increasing latitude, so that its rotation rate is slowest near its poles. At its poles the Sun rotates once every 36 days!\n\nThe interior of the Sun does not spin the same way as does its surface. Scientists believe that the inner regions of the Sun, including the Sun's core and radiative zone, do rotate more like a solid body. The outer parts of the Sun, from the convective zone outward, rotate at different rates that vary with latitude. The boundary between the inner parts of the Sun that spin together as a whole and the outer parts that spin at different rates is called the \"tachocline\".\n\nThe behavior of the Sun's magnetic field is strongly influenced by the combination of convective currents, which bring the charged plasma from deep within the Sun to the Sun's surface, and the differential rotation of the outer layers of the Sun. The complex, swirling motions that result make a tangled mess of magnetic field lines at the Sun's surface. Differential rotation is apparently the main driver of the 11-year sunspot cycle and the associated 22-year solar cycle. The notion that differential rotation and convective motion drive these cycles was first put forth in 1961 by the American astronomer Horace Babcock, and is now known as the Babcock Model. seem to be seen. Since its discovery, at least three other similar asteroids have been discovered. These types of objects are also found in similar relationships to other planets in our Solar System.Travel INSIDE a Black Hole\n\n\"Black holes are the seductive dragons of the universe, outwardly quiescent yet violent at the heart, uncanny, hostile, primeval, emitting a negative radiance that draws all toward them, gobbling up all who come too close. Once having entered the tumultuous orbit of a black hole, nothing can break away from its passionate but fatal embrace. Though cons of teasing play may be granted the doomed, ultimately play turns to prey and all are sucked haplessly\u2015brilliantly aglow, true, but oh so briefly so\u2015into the fire-breathing maw of oblivion.

Such paradoxes characterize these strange galactic monsters, for whom creation is destruction, death life, chaos order. And darkness illumination: for, as dragons are also called worms, so black hole are known as wormholes, offering a mystical and intimate pathway to the farthest reaches of the cosmos, thus bring light as they consume it.\" \u2015 Robert Coover, A Child Again"}

Mould\n& Kristian 1986,\nDavidge 1993). Based on a\nCFHT\nstudy of a halo field 10' from the nucleus (Durrell et al. 1994) , we have noted\na rather high metallicity ([Fe\/H] = -0.6) for the halo stars, suggesting a\nhigher level of metal enrichment than present in the (for example) Milky Way\nhalo. These results have been confirmed by HST studies of fields at\nother locations in the M31 halo (Rich et\nal. 1996, Holland\net al. 1996). Although there are\nseveral hundred globular clusters in the M31 halo, there are not enough\nto fully explore the outermost regions of the halo. There are plenty\nof halo stars, but they are just so faint...An excellent recent review on the chemical evolution of the M31 halo has been done by Rich (2004).\n\nM31 image, courtesy of Raja Guhathakurta\n\nMore recently, there have been a number of very exciting results by a number of groups have found many coherent streams of stars in the M31 halo, which are likely the disrupted remains of satellite galaxies that were once part of the M31 system. An ongoing question is how much of the M31 halo is formed by the disruption of such satellites?\n\nAs part of a large scale survey\nof the M31 halo, we (C. Pritchet, W. Harris and myself) have taken\nlarge (32') CCD mosaic images (with the CFHT UH8K camera of outer regions of the halo in order to (a) trace the extent of the\nhalo (to levels far below what is possible from standard surface photometry),\n(b) the shape of the halo by studying fields at different locations\nof the halo, and (c) the metallicity of the stellar populations, looking\nfor (perhaps) a metallicity gradient if one exists.

It rotates around a companion white dwarf star, turning at 317 revolutions per second while emitting radio pulses, making it a \"pulsar.\" The proximity of the white dwarf slows the pulses down, similar to ticks on a clock, in a phenomenon called the \"Shapiro Delay.\" The pulses, combined with the delay and period of its orbit allowed scientists to measure its mass.\n\nNeutron stars are made up of the remnants of regular stars after they explode. This discovery has helped scientist learn more about the type of matter that comprises these types of bodies.

{"text":"That may not sound so huge on its face, but it actually is the first high-resolution simulation of its kind that has turned out a galaxy similar to the Milky Way, and it has rescued the prevailing \"cold dark matter\" cosmological model of how our disc galaxy formed from a good deal of doubt.\n\nThat doubt arose from the fact that when previous, lower-resolution models were run based on that cosmological model, a huge central bulge emerged in the galaxy--a bulge that is absent from all but the center of the Milky Way (another way of saying that: there was more bulge and less disc, whereas the Milky way is more disc, less bulge). This had some physicists thinking that perhaps there was a flaw in the cosmological model itself, which seemed incapable of producing via simulation the flat, spiral-armed qualities consistent with observations of our galaxy.\n\nTags\n\nBut the problem wasn't with the model, it turns out, but with the simulation of star formation. In reality, star formation happens in clusters, where dense clouds of gas feed the process of star birth in fairly tightly defined regions. But in low-resolution simulations(resolution in this sense means the ability to track individual particles), gas densities tended to spread out over relatively large areas, showing stars forming throughout the galaxy rather than in clusters. This led to a larger galactic bulge--and a less accurate picture of how Milky Way-like galaxies came into being.\n\nTo get the high resolution necessary to make the model work took a great deal of computing power, including 1.4 million processor-hours on NASA's Pleiades supercomputer as well as additional time on supercomputers at UC Santa Barbara and the Swiss National Supercomputing Center. And at the time, the researchers had no idea if their added resolution would really make a difference.\n\nIt turns out it did. The simulated galaxy, Eris, shares the shape, bulge-to-disk ratio, star content, brightness, and various other characteristics with the Milky Way, demonstrating that the \"cold dark matter\" model can produce spiral-armed disc galaxies like the one we call home after all.\n\n22 Comments\n\nThis is amazing.

{"text":"Monday, November 29, 2010\n\nIt's Filamentary, Watson\n\nA recent find allowed scientists some of their best views yet of the structures or filaments of gas in space that link galaxy clusters to each other over unimaginable distances.\n\nFrom your basic elementary school astronomy, you probably remember that our planet is part of a solar system, organized around the star we call the sun. Galaxies are groups of thousands or millions of stars that are themselves organized around a center, which is sometimes thought to be a gigantic black hole, although no one knows for sure. Galaxies take different shapes, depending on how the stars are distributed and the effects of gravity among them. Galaxies themselves will tend to clump together to form clusters, which are made up of galaxies that are held together by the interplay of their own gravitation.\n\nAll of these systems and groups are held together by gravity. It used to be thought that the space in between galaxies -- \"intergalactic\" space -- was pretty much empty -- that the gravitational field produced by each galaxy was strong enough that stars or objects wandering around in it would be gradually pulled into one galaxy or another. The space in between the clusters was thought to be relatively empty as well, for mostly the same reasons.\n\nBut it isn't. There are huge filaments of gas that link the clusters to each other. And when astronomers call them \"huge,\" that's exactly what they mean. Imagine there's a tunnel through the center of the earth with one end at the North Pole and another at the South Pole (It couldn't be done, which is why we're imagining it). Say a person at the North Pole end holds a flashlight over the tunnel and turns it on. A person at the South Pole would see the light go on just about .07 seconds later. Light from our sun takes about eight minutes to reach us. But galaxy clusters are so far apart from each other that the same action would yield a light that might take millions or even billions of years to reach us. That's how huge these gassy filaments are.\n\nThey're also apparently extremely hot. Obviously nobody's stuck a turkey thermometer into one of them to see, but the radiation they emit gives scientists some clues, and the best estimate is that they may be as much as a million degrees Celsius, or 1.8 million Fahrenheit. By comparison, the surface of our sun is a frigid wasteland, not quite nudging 10,000 Fahrenheit. To get hotter than these celestial filaments, you have to hang out in the cores of stars -- our sun's center is about 27 million degrees Fahreneheit.\n\nDespite their size, the filaments are difficult to \"see,\" because the radiation they give off is washed out by the immense amounts of the same radiation given off by the galaxies and galaxy clusters. So to recap -- galaxy clusters are irregular clumps that are connected by immense, superhot streams of gas that are very difficult to see clearly because of the emissions of the clusters themselves."}

{"text":"In answering a question about the orbital path of Omega Centauri, I learned that it has a distinct chemical signature from the rest of the Milky Way. Basically, it is very rich in s-process elements, which I think are primarily produced in Asymptotic Giant Branch stars. It is not totally clear to me why that would be the case. Are AGB stars dominating metallicity in Omega Centauri, and if so, why? If it is not what, what is the cause?\n\nI'm no expert but Omega Centauri is a fairly exceptional object so you might have a hard time getting answers about its properties. For example, it isn't even clear whether it's a globular cluster or the core of a former galaxy that lost its surrounding stars through interactions with the Milky Way. \u2013 WarrickFeb 28 '12 at 9:19\n\nThe reason for the dwarf spheroidal galaxies having different metallicities is thought to be due to two factors: they form stars at lower efficiency than the Milky Way, and the material for star formation (that is, gas) is more easily driven out of dwarf spheroidals by galactic winds. Chemical Abundances for 855 Giants in the Globular Cluster Omega Centauri (NGC 5139) says that in this respect, Omega Centauri differs even from dwarf spheroidals, in that Type Ia supernovae played a minimal role in enriching the stars in the Omega Centauri system. Instead, its metallicity is dominated by the injection of elements produced by Type II supernovae early in the system's history, and \"pollution\" caused by intermediate mass stars in the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, where certain elements found preferentially in Omega Centauri can form, and then are ejected because AGB stars are unstable.\n\nWell, I was curious enough to ask in the first place, so I figured I'd look myself if no one had the answer at the ready.

Concentrations of matter have gravity; they PULL on things. The Local Void, on the other hand, is empty. It seems to PUSH on things, including our galaxy. Tully explains it as the absence of a pull. If an object is surrounded by matter in all directions, except for one empty sector, then the absence of a pull from that sector is actually the same as a push. And, it can have a large effect on our region of space, in effect turning us into void riders moving along the edge of the Local Void.\n\nIt's quite fascinating that we (all of us in the Milky Way Galaxy) should live on the edge of such a huge gap of nothingness; and, we ride along not really feeling our motion across the depths of space and time.\n\nThe astronomy profession is a small community of kindred souls all focusing on dozens of different ways to understand the science of the cosmos. I go to astronomy meetings pretty frequently (well, at least once or twice a year), to catch up on the latest and greatest in astronomy research. Mr. Spacewriter has accompanied me to a couple of meetings because I wanted him to experience the science being presented, and so he could meet some of the same folks. At the opening reception of the meetings, we've run into many, many people I've worked with or went to school with \"back in the day.\" And, marvelled at the fresh infusion of new blood into the profession. Of course there are folks from NASA and many research institutions at the meetings, but also people like Pamela Gay and Fraser Cain, who are the main drive behind Astronomy Cast. Pamela (who is also a university professor) is doing a lot more than research and teaching in astronomy. Like me, she loves to share astronomy with the public, in any way she can.\n\nThere are also a good many very talented science writers who attend AAS meetings, reporting on the science \"hot off the presses.\" It's been an honor to meet some of them, too. Where else could I have met New York Times science writer John Noble Wilford? He attended a great many AAS meetings, always asking the astute questions and subtly drawing out an education in astrophysics through his questions. Or Dutch writer Govert Schilling? Or many others who have attended these sessions over the years.\n\nAs a writer, I've found many outlets for the material I learn at astronomy meetings. Of course, I use the science in my documentary shows. But, for the past few years, in addition to my fulldome show production work through Loch Ness Productions, I've been contracted by various observatories to work as an editor and outreach person. The work runs the gamut from writing and\/or editing press releases to creating exhibits. Lots of fun, and I'd love to do more of it.\n\nAnd, so I shall. To wit: in a very short time, Mr. Spacewriter and I will be starting production on some vodcasts under a NASA grant with MIT Haystack Observatory. And, much of the material we're going to talk about is from papers I've heard and read about at AAS meetings, as well as from direct contact with astronomers in their research settings. Through all my \"productions,\" I hope to excite the downloading public about the science these guys are doing. I want to show their enthusiasm and love of subject to the rest of the world, because astronomers really are as much the stars of my work as the stars they research and explore.\n\nI'm a member of the International Dark-Sky Association. These guys are the light pollution authorities of the world. If you visit their website, you can find all kinds of information about the importance of dark skies (and not just to astronomers), as well as how to make your block, your community, your city, your state, a dark-sky site. They have a link to lighting practices and equipment that will help preserve dark skies while maintaining safety in your community. And, many of their suggestions help preserve energy expenses (an important factor).\n\nThe community I live in has some energy- and light-pollution-cutting lighting practices, although some neighbors still think it's great to throw light up to the sky indiscriminately. In our neighborhood we managed to get our local utility to put up \"screens\" around the nearest streetlight so that the light shines down on the street, like it's supposed to, and not in our bedroom window, or bathing our yard.\n\nOne of the more illustrative pages on their site is a series of links to various places on Earth, showing the light pollution from satellite's-eye views. Check it out, and do your part to reduce light pollution, save energy, and preserve the beauty of the night skies for everyone to appreciate"}

The further you go the further it is to see anything, due to redshift and to the fact that there's a lot more to get in the way.\n\nLuckily, scientists aren't limited by what their eyes are capable of seeing and go way beyond that.\n\nScientists at the University of Cambridge have been using infrared imaging to go back 11 billion years, at the edge space and time.\n\nTheir studies\n\nhave discovered several objects that were undetectable in visible light among them several supermassive black holes, some of the biggest ever observed.\n\n\"Most black holes of this kind are seen through the matter they drag in.

{"text":"A European research team has published the results of a 30-year study of an extraordinary hypergiant star. They have found that the surface temperature of the super-luminous star HR 8752 increased by about 3000 degrees in less than three decades, while it went through an extremely rare stage called the 'Yellow Evolutionary Void'. The discovery marks an important step closer to unravelling the evolution of the most massive stars.\n\nA team of astronomers from six European countries, including the Royal Observatory of Belgium (ROB), has investigated the hypergiant star HR 8752 for 30 years while it traversed the 'Yellow Evolutionary Void'. The 'Void' is a short stage in the lives of the most massive stars when they become very unstable. The team finds that the surface temperature of HR 8752 rose surprisingly fast from 5000 to 8000 degrees in less than 30 years. The research results were very recently published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. The discovery is an important step forward to resolve the enigma of the hypergiants, the most luminous and massive stars of the Galaxy.\n\nHypergiants can shine millions of times brighter than the Sun, and they often have a diameter several hundred times greater. HR 8752 is a quarter million times more luminous than the Sun. The powerhouse is therefore visible with normal binoculars at large distance from the Earth in the Northern constellation of Cassiopeia. There are currently only 12 hypergiants known in our Galaxy.\n\nThe 'Yellow Evolutionary Void' is a unique stage in the short life of a hypergiant when its temperature and luminosity can quickly change. The team has discovered that the atmospheres are very unstable inside the Void because outwardly directed forces act equal or sometimes even stronger than the force of gravity. Due to the unstable atmosphere, hypergiants lose tremendous weight in this 'forbidden zone', which can sometimes amount to the mass of the Sun in a year. When a hypergiant enters the 'Evolutionary Void' the star tries to it leave as quickly as possible. That is why almost all hypergiants are found outside the Void.\n\nThe team finds that HR 8752 is a very rare hypergiant which has partly traversed the Void. The changes of its atmosphere were closely monitored with regular observations over 30 years.\n\nAlex Lobel, co-author of the study and ROB scientist explains that \"HR 8752 was around 1980 identical to the eruptive hypergiant Rho Cas of spectral type F, but then the temperature of HR 8752's atmosphere rapidly increased by 3000 degrees and now shows the spectral properties of a hotter A-type star. We are baffled about the tremendous changes of HR 8752 in that period of time.\"\n\nHR 8752 had to struggle through the Void which has changed the physical properties of its atmosphere\", Lobel adds.\n\nThe team further demonstrates that the Void actually consists of two parts in which the atmosphere of the hypergiant is unstable. They result from ionization of large amounts of hydrogen and helium gas in the atmosphere, divided by a small zone around 8000 degrees where it becomes more stable.\n\nThe fate of HR 8752 is currently unclear but there are strong hints that these massive hypergiants may perish in a powerful supernova explosion. Or they quickly traverse the Void and transform into a hotter type of erratic stars known as the \"Luminous Blue Variables\". In either case that will not pass unnoticed according to Kees de Jager and Hans Nieuwenhuijzen, the astronomers of the Netherlands Institute for Space Research in Utrecht who directed the research of HR 8752 over the past three decades.\n\nThe discovery is an important new step for explaining the existence of these extreme stars. A number of other hypergiants with similar spectacular properties is expected to exist in the Milky Way. The search for these remarkable stars with dramatic changes over human timescales has just begun, but has been forever put on track.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(Phys.org)\u2014A team of scientists from six European countries reported today they have finalized a thirty years long investigation of a hypergiant star that crossed the Yellow Evolutionary Void.

{"text":"Cosmologists Enter Exciting New Era of Galaxy Exploration\n\nAN astronomical satellite that senses radiation left over from the universe's birth has given cosmologists a major finding.\n\nIt has revealed the earliest traces of the underlying structure that produced the distribution of matter in the universe that is seen today.\n\nNow those scientists look forward to the satellite's next expected discovery - the primordial glow of the very first galaxies and other luminous objects that formed along the lines of that structure.\n\nThe satellite is the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE). Since its Nov. 18, 1989, launch by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, it has opened an exciting new era of exploration for cosmologists who previously had little opportunity to test their theories.\n\nAstrophysicist Stephen Maran of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., explains that, before COBE, cosmologists had only three observational facts to work with:\n\n1. The universe is expanding. This is consistent with theories that the universe originated 10 billion to 20 billion years ago in the \"Big Bang\" explosion of a super-dense primodial mass that was smaller than the period at the end of this sentence.\n\n2.

{"text":"The Physics of Milagro\n\nMilagro is a fundamentally new type of detector. It is\nthe first instrument capable of continuously viewing the entire overhead\nsky in the TeV energy regime. As such it is uniquely suited to study\nthe transient Universe and to discover new phenomena. Its physics reach\nis large. On this page we will begin discussing some of the physics\ntopics that Milagro will address. As time permits new topics will be\nadded to this page.\n\nActive\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN)\n\nActive Galaxies are believed to be supermassive black holes\n(100 million times the mass of the sun) surrounded by an accretion disk.\nThe accretion disk is composed of a hot gas made from stars that have\nbeen torn apart by the tremendous tidal forces exerted by the black\nhole. Through a poorly understood mechanism the black hole emits beams\nof high energy particles along its rotation is, perpendicular to the\ndisk. On the left in the photograph one can see the beams of high energy\nparticles, known as jets. On the right is a high-resolution photograph\ntaken by the Hubble Space Telescope of the accretion disk.\n\nActive Galaxies have been observed to emit trillion volt photons. In\nfact the bulk of their energy output occurs at energies above a billion\nvolts. The mechanism by which the particles are accelerated to such\nhigh energies are not completely understood. However, it is not surprising\nthat these objects are highly variable, they can change their energy\noutput (luminosity) by a factor of 10 in a few days.\n\nThe picture below is a cartoon of a model of particle acceleration\nin an AGN.\n\nGamma-Ray\nBursts (GRBs)\n\nGamma-Ray Bursts were discovered by scientists at Los Alamos\nNational Laboratory in the 1960's. The Vela satellite was put in orbit\nto monitor Soviet nuclear tests. When the satellite was over the United\nStates the scientists looked upward, towards the heavens. What they\nsaw were mysterious flashes of x-rays coming from random points in the\nsky, with no point ever repeating itself.\n\nThe picture shown here is from the BATSE\ninstrument on the Compton\nObservatory. The direction of over 1000 bursts is plotted in galactic\ncoordinates. If the bursts originated within the Milky Way one would\nexpect to see a horizontal clustering of points in the middle of the\ngraph. No such clustering is evident. At present there is no agreed\nupon model for what causes these bursts. In fact scientists even disagree\nover where the bursts are coming from. A few think they may originate\nwithin our solar system, some believe that they are associated with\na large extended halo around the Milky Way, and others believe that\nthey are very distant objects.\n\nThe EGRET\ninstrument (also on the Compton Observatory) has detected photons with\nenergies up to 20 billion volts (GeV) from gamma-ray bursts. Thus there\nis a good chance that gamma-ray bursts emit particles energetic enough\nfor Milagro to detect. If so Milagro may be able to estimate the distance\nto these objects. This can be accomplished by studying the shape of\nthe energy spectrum at energies near 1 trillion volts. If they are distant\nobjects then these photons will be absorbed by interactions with starlight\nas they travel towards the earth. In this case we will not see many\nphotons above 1 trillion volts. However if they are \"close\"\nto earth, that is within our galactic neighborhood, we should see photons\nwith energies above a trillion volts.\n\nSolar Physics\n\nWhile it may appear that our Sun is a relatively quiet star, in fact\nthe surface of the Sun can be violent. As we enter a period of increased\nsolar activity (known as solar maximum), the violence on the Sun's surface\nis increasing. In some cases, huge quantities of plasma are ejected\nthrough the corona at speeds ranging from ~10 to ~2000 km\/s. These events\nare known as coronal mass ejections, or CMEs. Due to driven shocks and\nreconfigurations of the solar magnetic field structure, these events\nare often associated with energetic particle acceleration. When the\ncharged particles reach the earth they interact high in our ionosphere\nand can wreak havoc on our power grid, communications, and satellites.\nWhile the exact mechanism is not completely understood, the particles\nthat accompany a CME can be very energetic. To date the highest energy\nparticles observed from the Sun have had energies of several GeV (billion\nelectron-Volts). Follow this link for a\nslideshow of a CME by P. Charbonneau and O.R. White of the High\nAltitude Observatory (NCAR) in Boulder Colorado. This series of pictures\nbelow of a CME is taken from their slide show.\n\nOperating in a different mode than that normally used to detect air\nshowers (Milagro can and does operate in both modes simultaneously)\nMilagro can have significant sensitivity to protons and neutrons with\nenergies as low as 4 GeV. We call this mode of operation \"scaler\nmode\". Here we simply count how many times all of the PMTs in the\npond are struck by light each second. Thus, even if only a single particle\nfrom an air shower reaches the pond it can be detected. This is how\nwe gain sensitivity at such low energies. The drawback of this technique\nis that we can not reconstruct the direction from which the particle\narrived. So our \"background\" (the constant data rate over\nwhich signal must be observed) rate is quite high, being integrated\nover the entire overhead sky. Nonetheless, Milagro is the world's most\nsensitive detector of multi-GeV particles from the Sun."}

This object has been nicknamed Pandora's Cluster because of the many different and strange phenomena that were unleashed by a huge collision that occurred over a period of 350 million years. A simultaneous pile-up between at least four separate clusters has produced strange effects that have never been seen together before.\n\nCredit: NASA, ESA and D. Coe (STScI)\/J. Merten (Heidelberg\/Bologna)This image combines visible light exposures of galaxy cluster Abell 2744 taken by the NASA\/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope, with X-ray data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and a mathematical reconstruction of the location of dark matter. The galaxies in the cluster, while they are the only part that is visible in the optical part of the spectrum, actually only provide around 5 percent of the mass in the cluster. Hot intracluster gas (shown in pink) is visible through its X-ray emissions, observed by NASA's Chandra satellite. The blue overlay shows a map of the mass in the cluster. This is reconstructed based on detailed analysis of the way that the cluster bends light from galaxies in the distant background. Evidence of this light bending can be seen in arc-like distortions in parts of this image. Since dark matter makes up the lion's share of mass in the cluster -- around 75 percent -- this blue overlay reveals the location of the otherwise invisible dark matter.\n\nAnalysis of this data has allowed scientists to observe some strange phenomena in Abell 2744, including a pocket of dark matter with no gas or galaxies, and a clump of galaxies with no associated gas. Astronomers believe that Abell 2744 formed from the simultaneous pile-up of at least four separate clusters.\n\nJulian Merten, one of the lead scientists for this new study [1]This animation shows how the remarkable merger event that created the galaxy cluster Abell 2944, nicknamed Pandora's Cluster, may have happened. The red regions are clouds of very hot gas, detected by their X-ray emission. The blue clouds are regions rich in dark matter that can only be discovered indirectly by their gravitational influence.

This isn't speculation. NASA astronomers say with certainty it will happen. That's the bad news. The good news is that it won't happen for about four billion years - give or take.\n\nAnd when the two do collide, it will be a stupendous galactic crash with the Milky Way getting a major makeover during the smashup. It is likely the sun will be flung into a new region of our galaxy, but our Earth and solar system are in no danger of being destroyed.\n\nThe findings came through painstaking NASA Hubble Space\nTelescope measurements of the motion of Andromeda, which also is (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nAnd that scenario is a lot like a baseball batter watching an oncoming fastball-except it's one that will take 4 billion years to connect.\n\nAndromeda is moving toward the Milky Way at about 250,000 miles per hour. For perspective that is fast enough to travel from the Earth to the moon in one hourWhy do such collisions occur? The universe is expanding and accelerating, and collisions between galaxies in close proximity to each other happen because they are bound by the gravity of the dark matter surrounding them. The Hubble Space Telescope's deep views of the universe show such encounters between galaxies were more common in the past when the universe was smaller. \"\n\nM31 is on its way to rearrange our Solar System and is gradually being pulled by gravity and there will be a giant Fourth of July kinds of explosions as Andromeda comes careening into our galaxy, the Milky Way, about four billion years from now. M31 is 2.5 million light years away, traveling at 250,000 mph, and will take about four billion years to arrive.\n\nAlthough the galaxies will hit each other, the stars inside each galaxy are too far apart to cause damage, but the sun will be flung into different parts of our galaxy so our climates will change.\n\nAfter the initial impact the stars will have been thrown into different orbits around a new center which will take another two billion years for it to form around a single galaxy again with the usual orbiting planets with their hosts of moons and stars.\n\nIt would be fun to take a cruise in a ship near light speed, which would enable you to use time dilation in order to survive until the two galaxies actually meet. But, yeah, you'd be screwed big-time as far as getting back to Earth. I suppose the situation would be more akin to Star Trek Voyager, wandering the (newly reformed) galaxy in search of home And that home would likely have to be a different world, because the sun will have gone red giant at least by that time, if not beyond. I think white dwarf was predicted to follow, after it sloughs its expanded exterior. Actually, I wonder how long there will be earth-like planets around at all. The cooler a star, the longer its life will tend to be, but none of them capable of supporting earths will last forever. Eventually, they and planets will also stop forming. The requisite energy will eventually be lost to entropy..\n\nScience is always reinventing itself. At one time not too long ago you would be laughed at if you suggested the moon was part of the earth and formed from a collision. The same goes for almost all science. Most of what is science truth today will likley be myth a hundred years from now. As for M31 colliding with our milky way, that sounds probable. Observational astronomy is a hobby of mine. You guys know you can see M31 with the naked eye eh? FYI ; \"The Andromeda Galaxy is the most distant object you can see with your naked eyes, two million light years away.

It's the threat of a gravitational pulls disrupting the orbits of the planets in our solar system, possibly loosing one or more of them from orbit around the sun. It would also knock a bunch of comets and asteroids all over the place, greatly increasing the chance that we'll be hit with one big enough to cause an extinction level event.\n\nPlus, the timing on this is wrong compared to every article I've read about it. This article claims 4 billions years, whereas everything I've read says 6 billion or more. Our sun is predicted to exhausted it's fuels supply by then, increased it's size to the point that it swallows up Mercury and Venus, with the Earth either burning up, or getting sucked into the sun as well. Earth likely won't even be here when we start getting close to Andromeda1) The biggest threat to Earth from this isn't that we'll run into a star, or that a star will run into our sun...2) Plus, the timing on this is wrong compared to every article I've read about it.

But we earthlings do have the capacity to f**k up our planet...we are busy each day killing ourselves on a host of things that are bad for our health, and our quality of life, and it is all from selfish greed, money and power.\n\n2) The time doesn't matter; Earth will still be in orbit, but dead. It will be but a shell of what it once was. The pollution plus the breakage of the ozone layers will have allowed all the harmful rays into Earth destroying the air, water, soil quality, thus the ability of animals and humans to adapt and survive. All that will be left are old plastic Pepsi bottles, McDonald's quarter-pounder paper food wrappers, and old used tires.\n\n3) Earth will still be rotating as if nothing has happened to it's inhabitants thru greed, and not understanding sufficiently the marvelous mechanism called our physical environment. Earth was given the precise recipe for success, and humans blew it.\n\nInhabitants from other planets will gaze up into the night skies at Earth, knowing that it used to be inhabited but somehow went extinct and wonder aloud if they are the only humans on planets in the overwhelmingly beautiful universe."}
{"text":"New Hubble Discovery May Help Explain The Formation Of Supermassive Black Holes\n\nIf you follow astronomy much, you've probably heard of the idea that our galaxy has an enormous black hole at the center of it. Sort of like a donut, if the hole in the middle swallowed up all light and deformed spacetime in the vicinity. (Come to think of it, I actually have eaten a few donuts like that\u2026) Our galaxy isn't alone in this feature, either; scientists believe that many galaxies sport one of these interstellar road hazards at their center. Aside from rendering the plot of Star Trek V even more nonsensical, this raises the question of how these supermassive black holes are formed. Now a new discovery by NASA's Hubble space telescope may help scientists understand this process, as well as providing a snapshot of the development in action.\n\nThe subject in question is a mid-sized black hole residing near \"the edge of the galaxy ESO 243-49, 290 million light-years from Earth.\" This is one of the first medium-sized black holes ever discovered, and scientists believe that it may have once served as the core of a small dwarf galaxy, one which has since slammed into ESO 243-49 (pictured above). That collision would have shredded and cannibalized the dwarf galaxy, stripping away its stars and leaving the black hole trapped on its outer edge. The idea is that the supermassive black holes are formed from collisions like this one, when smaller black holes impact and merge with each other.\n\nThe idea of this galactic fender-bender is supported by the observation of a cluster of young, blue stars, possibly less than 200 million years old, near the mid-sized black hole. These baby stars would have been formed by the impact of the two galaxies. Sean Farrell, of the Sydney Institute for Astronomy in Australia, explains:\n\nBefore this latest discovery we suspected that intermediate-mass black holes could exist, but now we understand where they may have come from. The fact that there seems to be a very young cluster of stars indicates that the intermediate-mass black hole may have originated as the central black hole in a very-low-mass dwarf galaxy. The dwarf galaxy might then have been swallowed by the more massive galaxy, just as happens in our Milky Way.\n\nTo give you a sense of scale, this \"mid-sized\" black hole \"has an estimated weight of about 20,000 solar masses.\" That's 20,000 times the mass of our own sun. To make your head swim even more, the black hole at the center of our galaxy is believed to have a mass of more than 4 million solar masses."}

But astronomers may have already detected signs of dark matter in the heart of our own Milky Way galaxy, a pair\nof astrophysicists now says.\n\nData from NASA's space-borne Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope reveal an excess of gamma-rays coming from the galactic center that could be produced as particles of dark matter\nannihilate one another, Kevork Abazajian and Manoj Kaplinghat of the University of California, Irvine, report in a paper posted to the arXiv preprint\nserver. \"There's definitely some source there, and it fits with the dark matter interpretation,\" Abazajian says. But other researchers say the excess could\nbe an artifact of the way Abazajian and Kaplinghat model the gamma-ray flux, or it could originate from more-mundane sources.\n\nAstronomers have ample evidence that dark matter provides most of the gravity that keeps stars from flying out of the galaxies. And cosmologists have shown\nthat it makes up 85% of all matter in the universe. But physicists don't know what dark matter is.\n\nThe leading hypothesis is that dark matter could be made up of weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs, which are predicted by some theories. WIMPs\nwould be massive enough to produce lots of gravity but would otherwise interact with ordinary matter only very weakly. Each galaxy would form within a vast\ncloud of WIMPs.\n\nPhysicists are searching for WIMPs in several ways. Some are trying to spot them using exquisitely sensitive underground detectors. Others hope to produce\nWIMPs at the world's largest atom smasher, the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland. WIMPs might also annihilate one another when they collide to produce\nordinary particles such as gamma rays, and astrophysicists are combing the heavens for signs of such annihilations.\n\nAbazajian and Kaplinghat say that the more than 400 researchers working with the Fermi satellite may have already found that evidence. The two theorists\nanalyzed data collected between August 2008 to June 2012, focusing on a 7-degree-by-7-degree patch of sky around the galactic center. For each of four\nenergy ranges, they mapped the emission across the sky. They fit each map with a \"baseline model\" that included 17 point-like sources of gamma rays that\nFermi had already found in that area, a \"diffuse\" background that accounts for the general emission from the galactic center, and a spatially uniform\nbackground.\n\nThey then fit the data with another model that included a contribution from dark matter annihilations, including theoretical estimates of the dark matter's\ndistribution and how the particle annihilations produce gamma rays. Adding the dark matter annihilations greatly improved the fit, they found, suggesting\nthat there is an excess of gamma rays that come from dark matter.\n\nOther researchers, including Daniel Hooper of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois, have made similar claims. In fact, Abazajian had previously argued against that interpretation. But the new analysis shows that the dark-matter hypothesis fits the data\nin three key ways, Abazajian says: It has the right energy distribution, the right spatial distribution, and the right intensity. \"When I saw that I was\nlike, 'Holy cow!' \" he says. Abazajian cautions, however, that the gamma rays could emanate from a less exotic source, such as previously undetected\npulsars.\n\nThey might also be explained in an even easier way, says Stefano Profumo, a theoretical astrophysicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a\nmember of the Fermi-satellite team. Abazajian and Hooper's analyses depend critically on the model of the diffuse galactic background, Profumo says. That\nmodel had been derived to describe a much bigger area around the galactic center, he says, and is \"completely blind to the details at the galactic center.\"\nSo its use the fits to the data could produce misleading results, he cautions. Still, Profumo agrees that the galactic center is a prime place to look for\nevidence of dark matter."}

The wispy, colorful arc-shaped features are remnants of the explosion, called a supernova.\nLocated in the constellation Cygnus, this supernova remnant, called the Veil nebula, was created when a massive star exploded some 5,000 to 8,000 years ago, sending out shock waves that continue to interact with the gas and dust between the stars. This is among the largest of the WISE images featured so far, covering an area equivalent to nearly nine by nine full moons.\n\nThe Veil nebula is the name that generally refers to the visible sections of the whole supernova remnant that was seen in its entirety in radio light and called the Cygnus Loop. The portion of the nebula to the right is known as the Witch's Broom nebula. It can be seen in this WISE image as a reddish, long, vertical wispy cloud of dust. The unrelated star 52 Cygni, seen in bright blue, appears to ride the nebula as if a witch on a broom.\n\nThe colors of the Veil nebula are the result of shock waves from the supernova energizing the gas and the dust in the region and making it glow across the electromagnetic spectrum. Some astronomers suggest that the Veil nebula represents not one, but two supernova remnants that are interacting with each other.\n\nThere are several noteworthy bright stars in the image. The bright yellow star to the left of center is the star UX Cygni, a giant star in the late stages of its life. UX Cygni varies in brightness every 565 days as its surface puffs up and falls back down. Such stars create a large amount of dust in their outer atmospheres as the star moves toward becoming what is called a planetary nebula, a dying star surrounded by its shed layers. The dust surrounding UX Cygni gives it the yellow appearance in this WISE image. Towards the top and a little to the right of the image is a bright cyan star, AM Cygni, which is another variable star nearing the end of its life. On the right edge of the image we see an unidentified bright orange object. It is possibly a red giant star that is also in the last phase of its life, casting off its atmosphere as it becomes a planetary nebula.\n\nColor in this WISE image represents specific wavelengths of infrared light. Blue and cyan (blue-green) represent 3.4-micron and 4.6-micron wavelengths, which is primarily from light emitted from stars. Green and red represent 12-micron and 22-micron wavelengths, which is mainly light from warm dust"}
{"text":"Sagitarius is probably the most dense cloud in our\nmilkyway. Lots of molecules are found in this cloud. (Royal Observatory Edinburgh)\n\nInterstellar matter distinguishes its presence\nin obvious ways. We can observe them as shining nebula, like the Orion nebula,\nthat mainly consist of hydrogen atoms that are ionized by the radiation\nof young, hot stars.\nAlso they are visible as dark, black spots in the sky, dark silhouettes\na midst the stars.\n\nAtom and molecular clouds. Interstellar matter consists mainly of hydrogen\n(90%) and helium (approx. 10%). Only one out of one thousand particles\nin the clouds contain other elements, like carbon, nitrogen and oxygen.\nThe dust particles, that form only a small part of the cloud, consist mainly\nof silicates (sand like matter) and graphite which are often surrounded by\na small layer of ice.\n\nThe dark interstellar clouds are the most dense and are cold concentrations\nof interstellar gas. They are this dark because they contain dust particles\nthat extinguish the light of the stars that they lay behind. In these dark clouds\nmost molecules are found, besides the dust. Because of the presence\nof molecules these clouds are called molecular clouds, to distinguish\nthem from ordinary atom clouds.\nOften the dark clouds are\njoined with luminous nebula, since from molecular clouds new\nstars are formed. These young stars emit lots of ultraviolet\nradiation that light up the surrounding gas.\nThe new stars that are formed from molecular clouds are called second\ngeneration stars. Because of the molecules and more complex atoms,\noften astroids and planets come into being around these stars.\nOur Sun is an example of a second generation star with a planetary system orbiting it.\n\nGiant Molecular Clouds. Giant Molecular Clouds, that contain more than one million sun masses\nof matter, are the heaviest objects in our Milkyway.\nThe total mass of molecular clouds is comparable with the mass of the atom\nclouds that are observable through the\n21-cm radiation of the hydrogen atom.\nTogether they hold between five to ten percent of the mass of the stars\nin the Milkyway. Although astronomers\nspeak about 'dense' clouds, these areas are very thin, the average density\nin interstellar clouds is much lower than that of the best vacuum we can\ncreate on Earth. Besides the temperature of these clouds is enormously\nlow, only a few degrees above the absolute zero point. Chemical activity\nseems impossible under these conditions, still we find a rich variety of\nchemical compounds.\n\nObservation of molecules. In\nthe so called diffusion clouds we can see the atoms and molecules\nthrough the absorbtion lines\nat visible and ultraviolet\nwavelengths in the spectrum\nof a star in the background.\nThese absorbtion lines are very slim because of the very low temperature\nof the cloud. In this way it is possible to determine exactly at which\nwavelengths molecules in the cloud absorb the starlight.\nBetween 1937 and 1941 by means of this technique the first interstellar\nmolecules CN, CH and CH+ were detected.\nWith dark clouds this way of detection is not applicable, since\nvisible light cannot penetrate them.\nHere the molecules are determined via molecular emmision lines.\nThrough collision with other particles molecules reach a higher energy level.\nWhen it eventually falls back again to a lower level it emits a photon\n(light particle).This photon is detectable with a radio or microwave telescope.\n\nThe most frequent molecule H2 however is very\nhard to determine, the emission lines are too weak to detect.\nThe second most fequent molecule after H2 is carbon-monoxide,\nCO, which emits very strong radiation. The ratio in the quantities of\nthese molecules in interstellar matter is rather constant so detecting\nthe quantity of CO in a cloud gives a good indication of the quantity of\nH2.\nNowadays about 80 different molecules are found in the universe, amongst\nwhich also rather large ones like ethanol (CH3CH2OH).\n\nThe chemical cycle. The interstellar material forms a dynamic reservoir from which stars\nare formed and to which they return their remnants. The cycle starts\nwith the most diffused atom clouds, the interstellar cirrus.\nThese are mainly composed of atoms and contain only very few molecules.\nIn the next phase the atom cloud develops into diffusedmolecular\nclouds, where simple molecules like H2, CO, CH, CH+,\nC2, CN and OH frequently occur. These clouds evolve\nto more dense clouds, then the most dense parts are contracting, which\neventually leads to a new star formation.\n\nHere two different possibilities can be distinguished: the formation\nof stars with low density (comparable with that of the Sun) and\nthe formation of stars with a much larger mass.\n\nWhen low mass stars are\nformed the temperature remains rather low. In clouds of very low temperatures\nand large density the molecules condense at the surface of the dust particles.\nThese finally turn up at the planets and comets that are formed\nin the nebula near the newly born star.\nAfter its long lifetime the star\nultimately becomes a red giant, at which stage they loose a part of their\nmass. They shed mass in due of peels that expand in space. From these peels\nnew dust particles are formed, in which large molecular elements are present.\n\nThe lifecycle of clouds that form larger\nstars is much faster. In these clouds the temperatures are higher\n(50 to 200 kelvin). When the clouds are near a young heavy star the chemical\nreactions take place under influence of ultraviolet light and shockwaves,\nhere new molecular combinations are formed. After a short while the\nheavy stars develop into supernovas where the\nmatter is expelled and blasted into space.\nNow the chemical cycle is finished, the freshly formed elements and dust particles\nreassemble to diffused clouds and the process restarts."}

{"text":"Hubble images detail galactic \"mergers and acquisitions\"\n\nJune 5, 2008 AstronThe Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys snapped these red-light images of 29 post-starburst quasars. All objects are 3.5 billion light-years away, and each image is 10\" \u2014 or about 120,000 light-years \u2014 on a side.\n\nPhoto by NASA\/M. Brotherton (Univ. of Wyoming)\n\nAstron\"The images started coming in, and we were blown away,\" Brotherton says.\n\nLong before galaxies merge, they interact gravitationally. This distorts their appearances and compresses their gas clouds, igniting intense pulses of star formation astronomers call starbursts. The most massive stars formed in starbursts blow up as supernovae in relatively short time. The dust these stellar explosions produce tend to shroud the infant starbursts from astronomers' prying eyes. Then, another event occurs that completely outshines the galaxy.\n\nDuring the last decade, astronomers have established that just about every galaxy harbors a supermassive black hole at its center. Astronomers believe that galactic mergers so shake up young galaxies that their central black holes experience the equivalent of a smorgasbord. Gas and stars stirred up in the interaction feed the black holes, which eventually merge themselves. The fueling and growth of black holes powers a variety of phenomena in young galaxies. The most luminous manifestation of this activity is a quasar, which is so bright the underlying galaxy becomes all but invisible.\n\nSo, mergers in massive galaxies first trigger starbursts, which gradually fade out, and then fuel a central black hole, which turns on a quasar. The quasar blows away the dust obscuring the starburst, but it also effectively blinds astronomers to detailed study of the underlying galaxy.\n\nBrotherton reasoned that there should be transition galaxies in which the fading starburst and the quasar can be seen at the same time. In the late 1990s, he found a candidate for one of these objects. Its spectral signature indicated the presence of both a quasar and a starburst that was already 400 million years old. Brotherton dubbed the object a \"post-starburst quasar\" and imaged it with the Hubble Space Telescope. The images revealed an object that was clearly the result of galaxy mergers.\n\nTo find more of these rare galaxies, Brotherton and his colleagues turned to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the largest catalog of quasar and galaxy spectra in existence. They found 600 objects with the characteristic signatures of post-starburst quasars.\n\nUsing the Hubble Space Telescope and its Advanced Camera for Surveys, the team observed the galaxies in their sample that showed the strongest stellar component. The galaxies all are located 3.5 billion light-years away, but Hubble can resolve details just a few thousand light-years across, which enables astronomers to see structural details. Hubble imaged 29 post-starburst quasars using a red-light filter that emphasized starlight and suppressed the quasar's glare.\n\nThe galaxies are an untidy lot. \"We see not only merger remnants as in the prototype of the class, but also post-starburst quasars with interacting companion galaxies, double nuclei, starbursting rings, and all sorts of messy structures,\" Brotherton says.\n\nThe Hubble images also provide a look at different phases of the process. \"These images provide us tremendous insight into the complexity of galaxy evolution,\" said team member Rajib Ganguly at the University of Wyoming. \"We see nuclear activity and post-starbursts simultaneously in systems from pre-merger to post-merger and in between.\"\n\nThe astronomers hope to characterize each galaxy's physical properties, such as the masses and ages of the post-starbursts and the masses and fueling rates of the central black holes. Brotherton says team member Gabriella Canalizo has already obtained high-quality spectra from the Keck Observatory in Hawaii for this purpose.\n\n\"Key aspects of galaxy evolution do seem to be driven by mergers and interactions, at least in the most massive systems,\" Brotherton says. \"And the picture is a lot more complicated than anyone thought.\""}

Here, the movement of water has been frozen and carved out as a sculpture.\n\nWhen a very massive star, reaching the final stage of its life, exhausts its nuclear fuel it explodes as a supernova. The outer parts of the star are expelled violently into space, while the core completely collapses under its own weight. The outer gaseous layers, mainly hydrogen, still surrounding the core would rush outward, generating a shock wave.\n\nIf the core remaining after the supernova is very massive (more than 2.5 times the mass of the Sun), no known repulsive force inside a star can push back hard enough to prevent gravity from completely collapsing the core into a black hole"}

{"text":"Armed with the computational power of ORNL's National Leadership Computing Facility, now capable of 40 trillion calculations per second, computational astrophysicists with the ORNL-led TeraScale Supernova Initiative have made new scientific discoveries regarding the explosions of massive stars.\n\nJohn Blondin of North Carolina State University and Tony Mezzacappa, TSI's leader and a corporate fellow in ORNL's Physics Division, used Blondin's computer code to produce a three-dimensional (3D) simulation of a core-collapse supernova on 5000 processors of NLCF's Cray X1E supercomputer. Their discoveries relate to the shock wave generated when a star collapses and the core's inner part rebounds into matter falling inward. They discovered that, in 3D as well as 2D simulations, the shock wave becomes unstable, and this \"standing accretion shock instability\" induces rotation in what was previously a spherically symmetric configuration.\n\n\"The SASI induces counter-rotating flows of stellar matter on the inside of the star,\" Mezzacappa explains. \"As matter spins and accretes on the central object of the simulated star, the process deposits angular momentum on the central object, spinning it up. We started with no spin and our simulation generated an object that spins at tens of milliseconds\u2014just like a pulsar, which is a rotating neutron star.\"\n\nScientists have known for some time that supernovae are dying stars reborn as neutron stars. Pulsars are like lighthouse beacons, but their pulses are radio waves rather than visible light. The TSI simulation provides a plausible mechanism for explaining how a supernova can morph into a newly born, fast-spinning pulsar after forming and flinging into space elements responsible for life on Earth.\n\n\"We predict that SASI, along with neutrino transport and the magnetic field from within the star, will affect how the shock wave generates the explosion,\" says Mezzacappa.\n\nBlondin and Mezzacappa also found that 3D simulations of supernovae are far more realistic than 2D and 1D simulations. In a 1D simulation the only dimension is the radius. In a 2D simulation, the radius and latitude are the dimensions. A 3D simulation adds longitude. \"In our multidimensional simulations we also take into account neutrino direction, neutrino energy, and time,\" Mezzacappa adds.\n\nThe 3D models run thus far at ORNL simulate only fluid dynamics. Mezzacappa and his colleagues plan to add neutrino transport, magnetic fields, and more realistic particle and nuclear physics to the models.\n\nORNL's Raphael Hix, who was recently selected for the 2006 Young Investigator Award by Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society, has shown that understanding reactions involving neutrinos and nuclei in supernovae can help astrophysicists get a better grasp on both how shock waves disrupt the star and which chemical elements are formed in the process. During core collapse, electrons captured by nuclei slam protons, resulting in the emission of electrically neutral, almost massless neutrinos. These events significantly affect the location of the birth of the shock wave.\n\nDuring the explosion, neutrinos are also involved in nucleosynthesis\u2014the formation of new elements in varying abundances in supernovae, including many elements found in our bodies and our planet. Proper consideration of the neutrinos interacting with nuclei in the outer layers results in predicted nuclear compositions much more like those observed.\n\nTSI is a five-year research program funded by the Department of Energy. The proposed, five-year Petascale Supernova Initiative will include at least 37 investigators from 15 universities and 4 DOE national laboratories, led by ORNL.\n\nThe initiative's proposal is to simulate supernovae even more realistically by developing codes that will run on NLCF's planned petascale supercomputer\u2014a machine that would make a thousand trillion calculations per second\u2014in about three years. What has not been promised is a real supernova in our Galaxy, which would supply observational data to neutrino and gravitational wave detectors on Earth that could be used to validate the astrophysicists' codes.

For example, you may think you're sitting still, but by some reckoning, you are moving incredibly fast\u2014as Earth spins and orbits within the Solar System and as the Sun makes its way around the Milky Way. In fact, for us to make a full rotation around the galactic center every 250 million years, we have to be moving at the brisk pace of half a million miles an hour!\n\nBut as fast as we are moving, it's a leisurely stroll compared to some stars that have made recent headlines. These so called \"hypervelocity stars\" are allowing scientists a first hand view of the incredible and mysterious super-massive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy. Since we cannot observe the black hole directly, we study the motion of nearby matter\u2014stars, gas, and dust\u2014to learn much about the black hole's mass and how it distorts space around it. These observations grant astrophysicists an opportunity to test the inner workings of Einstein's theory of relativity on a grand scale.\n\nAnother group of super-fast superstars out there seems to be related. They are not gravitationally bound to the black hole, or anything else in the galaxy. In fact, they have been flung out from the Milky Way at speeds so great that they will actually escape it entirely! Some scientists have speculated that these \"runaway\" or \"rogue\" stars may have once been the companions of the very same hypervelocity stars that orbit within the Milky Way, but these rogue stars were flung off long ago when their partners were pulled into the supermassive black hole's gravitational influence.\n\nAnother possible origin for the stellar speedsters could be a companion or nearby star that went supernova and blasted them out into the great beyond. Astronomers search for these stars before they exit the galaxy by looking for the tell-tale bow shock they create as they pass through the thin gas of the Milky Way, much like the wake a speedboat creates on a calm lake.\n\nNo matter their origins, hypervelocity stars and any other super speedy things provide critical windows into relativity and the nature of space and time. Special relativity predicts the ways in which physics will change as something approaches the speed of light; general relativity describes the behavior of objects in intense gravitational fields (like you might find near a black hole, hmm\u2026).

Therefore, the few neutron stars\nwhich are hot enough to emit X-rays can be seen by X-ray telescopes, such\nas ESA's XMM-Newton.\n\nOne such neutron star is 1E1207.4-5209. Using the longest ever\nXMM-Newton observation of a galactic source (72 hours), Professor Giovanni\nBignami of the Centre d'Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements (CESR) and his team\nhave directly measured the strength of its magnetic field. This makes it the\nfirst ever isolated neutron star where this could be achieved. All previous\nvalues of neutron star magnetic fields could only be estimated indirectly.\nThis is done by theoretical assumptions based on models that describe the\ngravitational collapse of massive stars, like those which lead to the\nformation of neutron stars. A second indirect method is to estimate the\nmagnetic field by studying how the neutron star's rotation slows down,\nusing radio astronomy data.\n\nIn the case of 1E1207.4-5209, this direct measurement using XMM-Newton\nreveals that the neutron star's magnetic field is 30 times weaker than\npredictions based on the indirect methods.\n\nHow can this be explained? Astronomers can measure the rate at which\nindividual neutron stars decelerate. They have always assumed that 'friction'\nbetween its magnetic field and its surroundings was the cause. In this case,\nthe only conclusion is that something else is pulling on the neutron star,\nbut what? We can speculate that it may be a small disc of supernova debris\nsurrounding the neutron star, creating an additional drag factor.\n\nThe result raises the question of whether 1E1207.4-5209 is unique among\nneutron stars, or it is the first of its kind. The astronomers hope to\ntarget other neutron stars with XMM-Newton to find out.\n\nX-rays emitted by a neutron star like 1E1207.4-5209, have to pass through\nthe neutron star's magnetic field before escaping into space. En route,\nparticles in the star's magnetic field can steal some of the outgoing X-rays,\nimparting on their spectrum tell-tale marks, known as 'cyclotron resonance\nabsorption lines'. It is this fingerprint that allowed Prof. Bignami and\nhis team to measure the strength of the neutron star's magnetic field.\n\nThese results are being published in this week's issue of Nature.

Cal\u00e7ada\/S.E. de Mink\n\nThe Universe is a diverse place, and many stars are quite unlike the Sun. An international team has used the VLT to study what are known as O-type stars, which have very high temperature, mass and brightness. These stars have short and violent lives and play a key role in the evolution of galaxies.\n\nThey are also linked to extreme phenomena such as \"vampire stars\", where a smaller companion star sucks matter off the surface of its larger neighbour, and gamma-ray bursts.\n\n\"These stars are absolute behemoths,\" says Hugues Sana (University of Amsterdam, Netherlands), the lead author of the study. \"They have 15 or more times the mass of our Sun and can be up to a million times brighter. These stars are so hot that they shine with a brilliant blue-white light and have surface temperatures over 30 000 degrees Celsius.\"\n\nThe astronomers studied a sample of 71 O-type single stars and stars in pairs (binaries) in six nearby young star clusters in the Milky Way. Most of the observations in their study were obtained using ESO telescopes, including the VLT.\n\nBy analysing the light coming from these targets in greater detail than before, the team discovered that 75% of all O-type stars exist inside binary systems, a higher proportion than previously thought, and the first precise determination of this number. More importantly, though, they found that the proportion of these pairs that are close enough to interact (through stellar mergers or transfer of mass by so-called vampire stars) is far higher than anyone had thought, which has profound implications for our understanding of galaxy evolution.\n\nO-type stars make up just a fraction of a percent of the stars in the Universe, but the violent phenomena associated with them mean they have a disproportionate effect on their surroundings. The winds and shocks coming from these stars can both trigger and stop star formation, their radiation powers the glow of bright nebulae, their supernovae enrich galaxies with the heavy elements crucial for life, and they are associated with gamma-ray bursts, which are among the most energetic phenomena in the Universe. O-type stars are therefore implicated in many of the mechanisms that drive the evolution of galaxies.\n\n\"The life of a star is greatly affected if it exists alongside another star,\" says Selma de Mink (Space Telescope Science Institute, USA), a co-author of the study. \"If two stars orbit very close to each other they may eventually merge. But even if they don't, one star will often pull matter off the surface of its neighbour.\""}

{"text":"Researchers are creating a detailed blueprint that will guide other scientists searching for merging black holes, using ordinary visible light and existing telescopes.\n\nBy\nRochester Institute of Technology, New York \u2014\nPublished:\nNovember 15, 2010\n\nAn artist's rendition of two spiral galaxies \u2014 each with supermassive black holes at their center \u2014 about to collide. Illustration by NASA\/CXC\/M. Weiss\n\nScientists pursuing supermassive black holes suspect that these giants merge somewhere in the universe roughly once a year, but they don't know how to find them. They think the evidence is hidden in the powerful gravitational waves and strong bursts of electromagnetic radiation created when the black holes collide.\n\nUsing computer models, astrophysicists from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in New York and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, are tracing electromagnetic signatures back to the impact. They are creating a detailed blueprint that will guide other scientists searching for merging black holes, using ordinary visible light and existing telescopes. Simulated models of these mergers will also aid the discovery of gravitational waves, confirming a key prediction of Einstein's general theory of relativity.\n\nThe team, led by Manuela Campanelli from RIT, has won a $2 million grant from the cyber-enabled discovery and innovation program of the National Science Foundation. Julian Krolik is leading the collaboration's efforts at Johns Hopkins. Both institutions received $1 million awards for the 5-year project.\n\nThe scientists will use computer models to simulate what happens to an accretion disk \u2014 a doughnut-shaped ring of gas and dust \u2014 as a pair of black holes within it approach each other and merge. According to Campanelli, the surrounding gas and dust mixture is heated and will likely produce electromagnetic radiation \u2014 light \u2014 that could be detected with conventional telescopes, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, even before sufficiently sensitive gravitational wave telescopes are built.\n\n\"By being able to model this for the first time in a realistic scenario, with realistic conditions, we should be able to predict signals of binary black hole mergers that can be seen in the electromagnetic sky,\" said Campanelli. \"It's a big deal because nobody has ever attempted a consistent and long-term project to model such a phenomenon.\"\n\n\"The goal is to get a very accurate and consistent model of the electromagnetic emission from something that is also emitting strong gravitational waves,\" said Scott Noble from RIT. \"And I think the significance of the project is that we're doing this in a very careful, methodical way.\"\n\n\"Our project will make use of combined expertise in the simulation of generic black hole binaries with magneto-hydrodynamics simulations to model the accretion disk physics during the last phases of the binary,\" said Yosef Zlochower from RIT, \"when both space and time are very dynamical.\"\n\nThe problem requires solving the equations describing the behavior of ionized gases threaded by magnetic fields along with the equations comprising Einstein's general theory of relativity, Campanelli said. Looking at binary black hole mergers through complementary signals \u2014 gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves \u2014 introduces a new type of astronomy.\n\n\"From the electromagnetic radiation, you can clearly determine direction,\" Campanelli said. \"We'd be able to connect a lot of the physics happening within the gaseous environment and accretion disk to the binary black hole merger to the gravitational radiation. It will be multi-messenger astronomy because it's electromagnetic combined with gravitational radiation.\"\n\nKrolik's team at Johns Hopkins will model the premerger stage of the binary black holes using Newton's law of gravity to describe masses that are far apart. Campanelli's group at RIT will look at what happens when Newtonian physics breaks down and the black holes draw closer together and actually merge. Both teams will address the post-merger physics.\n\n\"We want to marry the two regimes and use the far-field results to feed into the close-field results to get a consistent picture of how these systems evolved in time,\" Noble said.\n\nThe multilayered problem describes various stages of the merger in gaseous environments. Both teams are trying to \"connect the dots\" in this massive problem that draws on gravitational radiation and magneto-hydrodynamics, the theory that governs the dynamics of gas or plasma in strongly gravitating systems.\n\n\"The effort is therefore strongly multidisciplinary because of the multiple kinds of expertise needed: numerical relativity; magneto-hydrodynamical simulation; advanced computational techniques, including parallel computing; the use of very large data sets; scientific visualization; and observational astronomy,\" Campanelli said.\n\n\"It's a very challenging computational problem,\" she said. \"It's huge. If you think of how complicated these black hole coalescences are without any gas or electric fields, you can imagine \u2014 when you add electromagnetic radiation and gas \u2014 that we will have very demanding simulations.\"\n\nSimulating the merger of binary black holes in gaseous environments requires access to considerable computer power. The RIT team will run the actual merger on its own computer, NewHorizons, and make use of additional resources.\n\n\"The project will generate a much larger amount of data than we are currently generating,\" said Lousto from RIT. \"Money allocated in the grant will add 200 terabytes of storage and processing power to the center's computer.\""}

A nearby gamma-ray burst could sterilize a planet like Earth.\n\nCredit: David Aguilar \/ Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics\n\nMankind is safe--at least from the devastating, destructive\npower of long-lasting gamma-ray bursts (GBR). Although these\npowerful cosmic flashes pack more energy than the sun will release\nin its entire 10-billion-year lifetime, astronomers have concluded\nthat our Milky Way galaxy has enough metal to preclude such a\ndetonation.\n\nA long gamma-ray burst, which lasts a few seconds to tens of\nminutes, is the birth cry of a black hole, produced when a massive,\nwhirling star explodes as a supernova (ScienceNOW,\n5 October 2005). Just about every day, a long burst flares up,\nusually in a remote galaxy. Astronomers had assumed that thousands\nof them must have lit up in the Milky Way over the past few billion\nyears, and perhaps close enough to Earth to pelt it with lethal\nradiation. So could they have caused mass extinctions?\n\nNo, says Krzysztof Stanek, an astronomer at Ohio State\nUniversity in Columbus. He and colleagues analyzed four\nlong-duration gamma-ray bursts that lit up nearby galaxies,\nincluding one detected by NASA's Swift satellite on 18 February\nthis year. All four galaxies contained almost no\n\"metals\"--astronomical parlance for atoms heavier than hydrogen and\nhelium that are produced over the eons by stellar evolution.\nApparently, long bursts only occur in pristine galaxies. This\nobservation nicely fits in with theories saying metal-rich stars\nlose too much mass and rotational punch during their lives to blow\nup as gamma-ray bursts when they die.\n\nAccording to Stanek and his team, by the time the sun and Earth\nformed, our Milky Way galaxy was already metal-rich enough not to\nhost any long gamma-ray bursts. In a paper submitted for\npublication in The Astrophysical Journal, they write: \"We\ncan probably cross GRBs off the rather long list of things that\ncould cause humankind to 'join the dinosaurs' on the extinct\nspecies list.\"\n\n\"It's a reasonable argument,\" says physicist Adrian Melott of\nthe University of Kansas, Lawrence, who has suggested that the mass\nextinction at the end of the Ordovician period, 443 million years\nago, was caused by a gamma-ray burst. Still, he thinks Stanek's\nconclusions may be a bit too strong. After all, every few hundred\nmillion years or so the Milky Way gobbles up a dwarf galaxy that's\npoor in metals, he says, and those might still produce long\ngamma-ray bursts."}

Provided by the Institute of Astronomy, Honolulu, Hawaii\n\nPublished:\nMay 31, 2007\n\nThe spiral galaxy NGC 300. The green circles and squares indicate the blue supergiant stars measured in this experiment. The objects within the circles are 50 to 100 percent hotter than the sun, whereas the objects in the squares have a temperature at least 300 percent that of the Sun.\n\nPhoto by Institute for Astronomy\n\nMay 31, 2007 Astronomers have discovered a new method used to measure extragalactic distances accurately based on the stellar gravities and effective temperatures of blue supergiant stars in galaxies beyond the Local Group. The paper will be presented at the meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) in Honolulu.\n\nRolf-Peter Kudritzki of the Institute for Astronomy (IfA) and his collaborators observed the galaxy NGC 300, which is about 6 million light-years away and located in the constellation Sculptor, to test this new method of measuring distances between galaxies. They took spectra to measure the atmospheric temperature of the stars and their surface gravity. With these measurements, they were able to determine the intrinsic brightness of each star and then to compare the apparent brightness with intrinsic brightness to find the distance.\n\nThey then compared their distance measurements to those made using Cepheid variable stars, the traditional way to measure the distance to nearby galaxies. \"This new method works excitingly well,\" says Kudritzki. \"It seems that we can determine distances to other galaxies with an accuracy of five percent, which opens a complementary way to constrain the Hubble constant more precisely.\" The Hubble constant denotes the current rate of expansion of the universe.\n\nTheir observations consisted of medium- and low-resolution spectra taken with the Focal Reducer Spectrograph (FORS) on the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Paranal, Chile. Kudritzki was instrumental in designing FORS while at the University of Munich before coming to Hawaii in 2000. In its most recent work on other galaxies, the project team has also used the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) on the Keck I telescope at Mauna Kea Observatories in Hawaii. Both FORS and LRIS are very efficient spectrographs, which allows the team to take spectra of many stars in a galaxy simultaneously (in a single exposure). These stars can then be studied individually later, when the data are analyzed to determine atmospheric temperatures and surface gravities.\n\nThe talk at the AAS meeting will describe their analysis method. It will also discuss the determination of the chemical composition of the individual stars in distant galaxies and how the chemical composition changes from the center of the galaxies to their outskirts.\n\nBlue supergiant stars are the largest and brightest stars in the universe at visual wavelengths, with an intrinsic brightness between 10,000 and 1000,000 times that of the sun. They appear blue in color because the temperature of their atmospheres is 150 percent to 500 percent times than that of the sun. Because of their blue color and their enormous brightness, they stand out among the hundred billion stars in a galaxy, and so are easy to find and identify. This makes them ideal for studying stellar populations in galaxies beyond the Local Group (the group of galaxies that contains our own Milky Way galaxy) to learn about distances, chemical composition, star formation in galaxies, and the absorption of starlight by gas and dust between stars. In the Milky Way, Deneb in the constellation Cygnus the Swan and Rigel in Orion are two well-known blue supergiants."}

If the coma were starlike, how would anyone have thought of a nucleus? The coma is spatially resolved or they would have been hard-pressed to know something is a comet. And \"nucleus\" was longstanding terminology for the starlike thing in the middle of the coma, even though it wasn't until (late 1983?) that the first bare nucleus (Halley inbound) was actually observed.

Actually they probably meant without stellar collisions despite billions of stars. This idea is illustrated in an award-winning and splendid old Canadian film titled \"Universe.\" The idea fails to consider the collisions of vast gas clouds within the galaxies, and the resultant intense star making activity.

{"text":"Friday, February 08, 2013 The Spins of Black Holes in Galactic Nuclei Supermasssive black holes, having masses of millions or even billions of\nsuns, are found at the nuclei of galaxies. In dramatic cases like quasars, these black holes are responsible for spectacular phenomena like the ejection of narrow jets of particles at nearly the speed of light. These outflows, discovered at radio wavelengths, are thought to\nbe driven by matter accreting onto a hot disk around the black hole. A black hole, although thought to be point-like in dimension, is surrounded by an imaginary surface, or \"edge,\" of finite size (its\n\"event horizon\") within which anything that ventures becomes lost forever to the rest of the universe. But black holes can be ringed by disks of matter, and when infalling material interacts with the disk,\nradiation and matter can be ejected.\n\nA black hole is so simple that it can be completely described by only three parameters: its mass, its spin, and its electric charge, but determining these values is not simple. The charge is usually considered to be negligibly small and neglected in modeling. The mass can be found when the black hole has orbiting material or companions from the\nperiodic orbital motions. The spin is derived from modeling the shape of emission lines, for example from iron, a very abundant species. The atoms rotate in the disk around the black hole, some close to the minimum possible orbit before being captured; the rotation of the disk\nmeasured by these atoms in turn reflects the rotation of the black hole itself.\n\nCfA astronomer E. Nardini and four colleagues used the Japanese Suzaku\nX-ray satellite to complete a unique, systematic study of twenty-five galaxies with active nuclei whose black holes are vigorously accreting material and heating their surroundings. The scientists chose a sample of galaxies seen face-on with little or no dust along the line-of-sight to the nucleus that could diminish the radiation and thereby complicate the analysis. The astronomers modeled both the X-ray emission from the continuum and from hot atoms in these galaxies, and report two significant conclusions. First, most of the supermassive black holes are indeed rapidly rotating. As material accretes onto a black hole it can either increase the rotation (if it is an ordered and gradual process) or decrease the rotation (if the infall is more random), and therefore this conclusion implies that the feeding of nuclear black holes was a steady and ordered process. Secondly, in a related point, they conclude that the strength of the radio emission of a galactic nucleus is not directly related to the black hole spin."}

{"text":"This post is the fourth in a series that accompanies the publication of my book 'Gravity's Engines: How Bubble-Blowing Black Holes Rule Galaxies, Stars, and Life in the Cosmos' (Scientific American\/FSG).\n\nTen years ago the universe was in trouble.\n\nOr rather, our puny human theories about the nature of all the stars and galaxies in the universe were in trouble. At this time we had managed to discover a number of remarkable things about our cosmic surroundings. We had detected minute non-uniformities in the remains of the primordial radiation field known as the cosmic microwave background, and we had ever more convincing evidence that normal matter \u2013 the stuff we are made of \u2013 amounts to barely a fifth of the total raw mass of the universe. The rest is dark matter, a shadowy stuff that seldom interacts particle-to-particle but is massive enough that its gravity dictates much of the motion of stars in galaxies and the colossal structures of galaxy clusters and superclusters.\n\nA virtual cosmos. The predicted distribution of stars and galaxies across tens of millions of light years (Credit: Millenium Simulation)\n\nArmed with these observations, and with our models of how these features would translate into the seeding and gravitational growth of structure in the universe, we could build virtual realities in which galaxies and stars would arise and populate an imaginary cosmos. These simulations could then be compared to our great cosmological maps and our statistical counts of all the bright and dark places around us. It was a way to confirm our ideas, compare virtual universes to the real one. And this was the problem, because most of these models did not look quite like the real thing.\n\nThe fact was that the simulations overproduced stars and they overproduced big bright galaxies. They didn't produce a cosmos that looked like ours. Debate raged over the possible cause. It was possible that the computer algorithms used to simulate the production of stars in the virtual galaxies were deeply flawed. It was also possible that we were missing a critical component, a source of additional energy that would dampen down the process in the real universe, stunting galaxies and regulating stellar births from virtual nebula. But what could it be? It might be the energy of the stars themselves \u2013 massive suns burning through their nuclear fuel quickly and exploding as supernova could impose a speed-limit on the formation of subsequent generations. It might also be something else that was lurking in the dark alleys and back rooms of the cosmos.\n\nSupermassive black holes had long been suspected of being a disruptive element. As I wrote in the last piece in this series, when they consume matter they can be incredibly noisy, casting energy back out into the surrounding universe. Inside clusters of galaxies we see them blowing bubbles and generating waves in intergalactic gas, phenomena that slow down the condensation of that gas into cool nebula and new stars. In other places we see the wash of radiation and particles flooding galaxies, a sporadic but potent force. It looked like a promising solution, but was still incomplete.\n\nI was personally convinced of the role that these giant holes play in 'pruning' galaxies and stars when my colleagues and I stumbled across a great clue in the deep cosmic past. For black holes to provide the missing link, they needed to have helped stunt the growth of the very largest galaxies. And that meant that they needed to have been involved from the very outset, something that was unconfirmed. Luckily, we had discovered just such a situation in a place some 12 billion light years away, in the early morning of galactic evolution.\n\nThe birth of a galaxy. An overlay of the X-ray light (blue) and ultraviolet light (red) coming from a system 12 billion years ago (with thanks to Wil van Breugel and Ian Smail)\n\nIt has a dreadfully boring name of 4C 41.17. A source of intense radio waves so far away that its light is stretched, redshifted, by a factor of 3.8 due to the expansion of the universe. Using the giant Keck telescope in Hawaii, a seven hour exposure allowed us to make an image of what was originally the ultraviolet light flooding from this system \u2013 revealing a tumultuous scene of gas ebbing and flowing. Deep infrared images also showed a colossal mass of star dust, 600 million times the mass of our Sun in carbon-rich grains, a fingerprint of an orgy of stellar birth and death. And then we used NASA's orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory for 40 hours to gather the barest whisper of X-ray light, a total of only 150 twelve billion year-old photons. But this was all we needed, because they revealed the whole story.\n\nDeep inside this teenage galaxy was a supermassive black hole. As it consumed matter it was spewing forth electrons at close to the speed of light. As these particles sped away they were meeting the cosmic background radiation, primordial photons. But 12 billion years ago the universe was more compact, the background radiation was warmer than it is today, and so when these encounters happened the exchange of energy was far more efficient than it is today. Black hole accelerated electrons boosted primordial photons into X-rays, and the X-rays were penetrating through the murk of this youthful galaxy, modifying its production of new stars.\n\nIt was an exciting discovery. A vivid demonstration that we did indeed need black holes, that they were not mere bystanders in the game of cosmic evolution but central players, today, yesterday, and all the yesterdays before that.\n\nThe number of stars in the universe, and the very nature of the galaxies, owes an enormous debt to the behavior of these most extreme and fantastical of astrophysical phenomena. Ten years ago they helped solve part of a mystery, who knows what we'll learn about them next.\n\nThe whole story of our modern view of black holes is told in Gravity's Engines, available today!11 Comments\n\nCaleb \u2013 Nicely put! Is it correct to say then that supermassive black holes were removing material and energy from galaxies that would have otherwise resulted in the production of additional stars?\n\nAlso, perhaps you can explain how it was determined \"\u2026 that normal matter \u2013 the stuff we are made of \u2013 amounts to barely a fifth of the total raw mass of the universe\" and \"The rest is dark matter\u2026\" Was this proportion arrived at the amount of additional mass required to generally make galactic models produce their observed non-Keplerian rotation curves, or was is the amount necessary for cosmological simulations to produce some observed characteristic? Thanks in advance\u2026\n\nAuthor is attributing the missing mass of stars and galaxies when compared to simulations to the presence of super massive black holes at the center of galaxies. He is also stating that for the black holes to stunt the growth of galaxies, super massive black holes should be associated with the galaxies right from outset.\n\nIn support of above, he has presented a study of an intense radio source nicknamed 4c 41.17 located some 12 billion light years away from earth and having a mass of about 600 million solar masses. An object of such a supermass equivalent to 600 million solar masses should be either a super massive black hole or a highly dense condensed stellar object. This happened some 12 billion years ago.\n\nAge of universe is normally taken at 13.72 billion years. In view of this, a pertinent question which arises is how within a span of about 1.72 billion years ( 13.72- 12), a super massive black hole having mass as high as 600 million solar masses could have been formed?\nA black hole is normally considered the end stage of a massive stellar object when it exhausts all its fuel by burning.. Within this span of 1.72 billion years, all the intermediate stages in the formation of a super massive black hole having 600 million solar masses viz coalescing of a very massive nebula of gas, formation of star, burning of fuel, formation of black hole have to be completed. I request author and readers to join their heads to discuss and examine if the above long sequence in the formation of a supermassive BH having mass of 600 solar masses is realistic within a period of 1.72 billion years?\n\nSecondly, author is stating that electrons accelerated to very high speeds, due to presence of SMBH, boosted the primordial CMB photons to X-rays. These X-rays modified \u2014 stunted the growth of new star formation. This straightforward means around a supermassive BH, a large nos. of CMB photons in radio frequency were converted to X-ray frequencies and this conversion took place some 12 billion years ago. If this is true, it implies around the vicinity of such supermassive BH, intensity of CMB photons ( in radio range) should be either NIL or much lesser compared to other regions away from SMBH. I do not know if this aspect has been examined or not? As far as I know COBE and WIMP studies have indicated uniform pattern in the intensity of CMB photons in all the parts of sky.\n\nYou should at least check such easily available sources as Wikipedia before questioning others?\n\nThe are several theories as to how SMBHs form. See \n\"Currently, there appears to be a gap in the observed mass distribution of black holes. There are stellar-mass black holes, generated from collapsing stars, which range up to perhaps 33 solar masses. The minimal supermassive black hole is in the range of a hundred thousand solar masses. Between these regimes there appears to be a dearth of intermediate-mass black holes. Such a gap would suggest qualitatively different formation processes.\"\n\nAlso keep in mind that the mass-energy density of the early universe was necessarily greater than in more recent times. Exceedingly dense conditions might have affected the processes of accretion to either directly produce supermassive black holes or produce hypermassive stars that then produced supermassive black holes via hypernovae.\n\nI too have to wonder how electrons ejected from SMBHs ingesting galactic matter through the relativistic jets of active galactic nuclei could have directly increased the energy of primordial photons (as I understand, thought to have been originally emitted as infrared spectra, now redshifted to microwaves) to produce x-rays. See \n\nSince AGNs produce multi-waveband emissions (thought to depend on the observer's viewing angle of accelerated particles being ejected), I don't understand how the x-ray emissions of AGN could have anything to do with any direct interactions with CMD photons. I suspect the x-rays have everything to do with interactions between the ejected particles accelerated in relativistic jets from SMBHs and hydrogen gas in the dense early intergalactic medium\u2026\n\nYou seem uncertain of what had a mass of 600 million solar masses. You first seem to believe it is the entire galaxy 4C 41.17 (see your 2nd paragraph). You then believe the SMBH in 4C 41.17 has a mass of 600 million solar masses (see your 2nd, 3rd and 4th paragraphs).\n\nProf Scharf wrote, \"deep infrared images also showed a colossal mass of star dust, 600 million times the mass of our Sun in carbon-rich grains.\" IT'S DUST. The SBMH disrupts (i.e. slows down) the dust from condensing into new stars. That's the whole point.\n\nThen your 5th paragraph seems to show further misunderstandings about the \"uniformity\" of the CMB. The original photons were UV. The accelerated electrons from the SMBH boosted the UV photons into X-ray photons.\n\nPlease look at the image of the galaxy and read its caption. It shows exactly what you seem to believe doesn't exist (see your last sentence about \"uniform pattern in intensity of CMB photons\"). The image shows that around the SMBH (assumed to be in the center) is made up of x-rays where the periphery is UV.\n\nA methodical doubt from a lay in everything: the dark matter is all dark, as Pink Floyd said about the dark side of the moon, or some dark matter is not so dark? Dark matter is really dark, or just it's not illuminated? If it's illuminated: does it reflect some light, or it's so cold that even if it absorbed some energy it wouldn't reach any sate allowing us to detect it? How dense is this dark matter in the space between stars and galaxies? Has the dark matter any connection to the concept of ether that was annihilated by Michelson and Morley?. Nice weekend!\n\nYes, I had noted that Prof Scharf has mentioned that IR image had indicated a supermass of 600 million solar masses as star dust. But in the next para he has also indicated of a SMBH deep inside the galaxy probably at the center.\n\"Deep inside this teenage galaxy was a supermassive black hole. As it consumed matter it was spewing forth electrons at close to the speed of light.\"\n\nThe article does not indicates mass of SMBH but indicates it to be supermassive. It also indicates that electrons accelerated closer to speed of light boosted primordial CMB photons to X-energies\nSo my original question remains as such : How within a period of 1.72 billion years, a SMBH after completing a long chain of steps, was formed?\n\nHowever, no mention has been made of the origin of UV radiations. Probably, UV radiations might also have originated from boosting of primordial CMB photons by boosting from accelerated electrons but at lower speeds.\n\nPrimordial CMB photons had appeared some 380000 years after BB when temp. was about 3000 K. At that temp. CMB photons were in the IR energies which in the current universe have gone down to radio range at temp of about 2.725 K. As per the article, 12 billion years ago, primordial CMB photons around SMBH were boosted to X-ray energies and probably also UV radiations. It implies 12 billion years ago intensity of primordial photons which, before boosting to higher energies, were in IR or higher radio ranges, would have been drastically reduced. This effect should be visible in present universe also when we detect CMB photons in radio range.\n\nAbove implies that if the hypothesis of author is true, intensity of CMB photons ( in the radio frequencies) received from space around a SMBH should be drastically lower that intensity of CMB photons received from those parts of sky which are away from SMBH. I had indicated if this aspect has been examined or not? But I learn that COBE and WIMP studies have indicated a uniform pattern in the intensity of CMB photons in all parts of the sky.\n\nIt's all in writing for anyone to read. What you wrote is not consistent with what Prof Scharf wrote. You did not mention dust.\n\nThe population of very massive stars in the early universe was significant enough for SMBHs to form in 1.7 billion years. Red supergiants and hypergiants only have lifespans of a few million to 100 million years (the larger the star, the shorter its lifespan). The BH created by these stars then merge to form SMBHs (the early universe was much more dense).\n\nRegarding the CMB radiation, I believe you have misunderstood what is meant by \"uniform pattern.\" Uniform pattern is in reference to macro-scale not micro-scale. It just means that 'everything' looks the same in all directions. One part of the sky in not more dense (or intense) than other parts of the sky. It does't mean the absence of variation.\n\nThis is ludicrous to watch. There is obviously something basic that is wrong with the Standard Model. But every time it hits a wall, instead of reassessing what led them into the wall, physicists just dream up some new theory in hopes of getting their square peg to fit better in the round hole. Making up more and more stuff to cover up the unworkability of earlier theories is a doomed proposition, since the flaw is somewhere in the initial conditions.\nLike with String Theory, how many dimensions does it take to overcome our initial mistake? Zero, because it cannot be done.\n\nCaleb \u2013 you might be interested in a recent hypothesis of spiral arm formation that attributes their production by planar outflows from galactic SMBHs.

{"text":"Pulsars\n\nPulsars are very small, dense stars known as neutron stars, as small as only 20 km in diameter. We can detect regular periodic bursts of electromagnetic radiation that these stars emit as they spin. Some of them spin very fast - up to 1000 revolutions per second!\n\nThe very first pulsar was accidentally discovered in 1967 by Jocelyn Bell and Antony Hewish. Bell and Hewish were studying known radio sources with a large radio telescope at Cambridge University, when they detected periodic bursts of radio noise, apparently originating from one of these sources. At first the regularity of the pulses led scientists to speculate that they might be signals from extraterrestrial life, but as more similar sources were discovered, an explanation of their behavior became more clear.\n\n(c) 1996 STSCI\n\nGalaxies sprinkle the sky in this image obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope. The area of sky in this image could be covered by a dime held 75 feet away.\n\nThe discovery of this pulsar and three others from Cambridge was soon followed by more discoveries at observatories around the world. All of the new objects behaved the same way, emitting short pulses of noise at a specific period that remained constant for each pulsar. The first pulsar, later named PSR 1919+21 because of its location on the sky, emitted a pulse every 1.33 seconds and the others had signature periods in the neighborhood of one to a few seconds. More recently, pulsars have been discovered which emit as many as 1000 pulses per second.\n\nSince 1967 over one thousand pulsars have been discovered and catalogued, and it is now estimated that our own galaxy, the Milky Way, contains perhaps as many as one million pulsars. So why do we continue to look for new pulsars? What could possibly be so interesting about them that one thousand of them is not enough? Why do we even use radio telescopes to observe some the known pulsars as often as twice a month?"}

The objects could be wildly massive stars or voracious black holes. They are too far away to be seen individually, but Spitzer has captured new, convincing evidence of what appears to be the collective pattern of their infrared light.\n\nThese two panels show the same slice of sky in the constellation Bo\u00f6tes, dubbed the \"Extended Groth Strip.\" The area covered is about 1 by 0.12 degrees.\n\nImage credit: NASA\/JPL-Caltech\/GSFC\n\nThe observations help confirm the first objects were numerous in quantity and furiously burned cosmic fuel.\n\n\"These objects would have been tremendously bright,\" said Alexander \"Sasha\" Kashlinsky of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., lead author of a new paper appearing in The Astrophysical Journal.\"\n\nSpitzer first caught hints of this remote pattern of light, known as the cosmic infrared background, in 2005, and again with more precision in 2007. Now, Spitzer is in the extended phase of its mission, during which it performs more in-depth studies on specific patches of the sky. Kashlinsky and his colleagues used Spitzer to look at two patches of sky for more than 400 hours each.\n\nThe team then carefully subtracted all of the known stars and galaxies in the images. Rather than being left with a black, empty patch of sky, they found faint patterns of light with several telltale characteristics of the cosmic infrared background. The lumps in the pattern observed are consistent with the way the very distant objects are thought to be clustered together.\n\nKashlinsky likens the observations to looking for Fourth of July fireworks in New York City from Los Angeles. First, you would have to remove all the foreground lights between the two cities, as well as the blazing lights of New York City itself. You ultimately would be left with a fuzzy map of how the fireworks are distributed, but they would still be too distant to make out individually.\n\n\"We can gather clues from the light of the universe's first fireworks,\" said Kashlinsky. \"This is teaching us that the sources, or the \"sparks,\" are intensely burning their nuclear fuel.\"\n\nThe universe formed roughly 13.7 billion years ago in a fiery, explosive Big Bang. With time, it cooled and, by around 500 million years later, the first stars, galaxies and black holes began to take shape. Astronomers say some of that \"first light\" may have traveled billions of years to reach the Spitzer Space Telescope. The light would have originated at visible or even ultraviolet wavelengths and then, because of the expansion of the universe, stretched out to the longer, infrared wavelengths observed by Spitzer.\n\nThe new study improves on previous observations by measuring this cosmic infrared background out to scales equivalent to two full moons -- significantly larger than what was detected before. Imagine trying to find a pattern in the noise in an old-fashioned television set by looking at just a small piece of the screen. It would be hard to know for certain if a suspected pattern was real. By observing a larger section of the screen, you would be able to resolve both small- and large-scale patterns, further confirming your initial suspicion.\n\nLikewise, astronomers using Spitzer have increased the amount of the sky examined to obtain more definitive evidence of the cosmic infrared background. The researchers plan to explore more patches of sky in the future to gather more clues hidden in the light of this ancient era.\n\n\"This is one of the reason's we are building the James Webb Space Telescope,\" said Glenn Wahlgren, Spitzer program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Spitzer is giving us tantalizing clues, but James Webb will tell us what really lies at the era where stars first ignited.\"\n\nOther authors are Richard Arendt of Goddard and the University of Maryland in Baltimore; Matt Ashby and Giovanni Fazio of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.; and John Mather and Harvey Moseley of Goddard.

{"text":"This image shows the central region of the Milky Way as seen by Chandra. The bright, point-like source at the center was produced by a huge X-ray flare that occurred in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy, associated with the compact radio source Sagittarius A*. During the observation, the X-ray source at the galactic center brightened dramatically in a few minutes and rapidly declined to the pre-flare level after about three hours. Image courtesy \/ NASA and F. Baganoff\n\nFor the first time, astronomers have detected material being consumed by the supermassive black hole in our own back yard. A violent, rapid X-ray flare, captured by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, has been observed from the direction of the supermassive black hole that resides at the center of our Milky Way galaxy.\n\nA team of scientists led by Fredrick K. Baganoff, a research scientist at MIT's Center for Space Research (CSR), detected a sudden X-ray flare while observing Sagittarius A*, a source of radio emission believed to be associated with the black hole at the center of our galaxy.\n\n\"This is extremely exciting because it's the first time we've seen our own neighborhood supermassive black hole devour a chunk of material,\" Baganoff said. \"It's as if the material there sent us a postcard before it fell in.\"\n\nIn a few minutes, the source brightened dramatically, eventually reaching a level 45 times brighter than before the flare. After about three hours, the X-ray intensity rapidly declined to the pre-flare level. \"The rapid rise and fall of the X-rays from this outburst are compelling evidence that the X-ray emission is coming from matter falling into a supermassive black hole, confirming that it is powered by the same accretion process as quasars and other active galactic nuclei,\" said Baganoff.\n\nHe added that the data also provide the best look yet at the area just outside this event horizon, the surface of \"no return\" for matter or light falling into a black hole.\n\nStudies of the central region of the Milky Way in the infrared and radio wavebands indicate the presence of a large, dark object, presumably a supermassive black hole with the mass of about 3 million of our suns. The faintness of Sagittarius A* at all wavelengths, especially in X-rays, has puzzled scientists who expected that the matter should shine more brightly on its way in, and this has left some room for doubt.\n\nThe latest precise Chandra observations of the crowded galactic center region have dispelled that doubt. Given the extremely accurate position, it is highly unlikely that the flare is due to an unrelated contaminating source such as an X-ray binary system.\n\n\"The rapidity of the variations in X-ray intensity indicate that we are observing material that is as close to the black hole as the Earth is to the sun,\" said Gordon Garmire of Pennsylvania State University at University Park, principal investigator of the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS), which was used in these observations.\n\n\"It's truly remarkable that we could identify and track this flare in such a crowded region of space,\" said Mark Bautz, a principal research scientist in the CSR. \"This discovery would not have been possible without the resolution and sensitivity of Chandra and the ACIS instrument.\"\n\nAlso on the team is CSR senior research scientist George Ricker.

{"text":"More In This Article\n\nAbout 20 years ago one of the authors of this article took his father's binoculars and tiptoed out of the house at night. The budding astronomer decided that he would look for playmates on other planets going around stars in the sky. To his chagrin, the binoculars made no difference whatsoever. The stars appeared as twinkling points of light to his naked eye, and they were pointlike through binoculars as well. Although the largest stars could engulf our entire solar system within their luminous diameters, every star (aside from the sun) is simply too distant to be resolved with binoculars.\n\nTwo decades later the same kid can see not just a point of light but a circular disk--at least for some of the brightest stars. This stellar resolution takes advantage of a technique that was suggested more than 130 years ago: interferometry. Instead of looking through binoculars or even a conventional telescope, he must use a computer display connected to a device called an optical interferometer. For more than half a century, interferometry at radio wavelengths has succeeded brilliantly, mapping the structures of distant galaxies and quasars by their radio emissions. Only in the past 15 years, however, has technology allowed interferometry at infrared and visual wavelengths to take off--and the results have been well worth the wait.

{"text":"Black Holes Aren't So Black\n\nOct 03, 2005\n\nCommon wisdom holds that we can never see a black hole because nothing can escape it - not even light. Fortunately, black holes aren't completely black. As gas is pulled into a black hole by its strong gravitational force, the gas heats up and radiates. That radiation can be used to illuminate the black hole and paint its profile.\n\nWithin a few years, astronomers believe they will be able to peer close to the horizon of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Already, they have spotted light from \"hot spots\" just outside the black hole. While current technology is not quite ready for the final plunge, Harvard theorists Avery Broderick and Avi Loeb (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics) already have modeled what observers will see when they look into the maw of this monster.\n\n\"It will be really remarkable when observers can see all the way to the edge of the Milky Way's central black hole - a hole 10 million miles in diameter that's more than 25,000 light-years away,\" said Broderick.\n\nAll it will take is a cross-continental array of submillimeter telescopes to effectively create a single telescope as large as the Earth. This process, known as interferometry, has already been used to study longer wavelength radio emissions from outer space. By studying shorter wavelength submillimeter emissions, astronomers could get a high-resolution view of the region just outside the black hole.\n\n\"The Holy Grail of black hole astronomy is within our grasp,\" said Broderick. \"We could see the shadow that the black hole casts on surrounding material, and determine the size and spin of the black hole itself.\"\n\nInfrared observations using existing and near-future interferometric instruments also offer the possibility of imaging the core of our Galaxy in incredible detail, with resolutions better than one milli-arcsecond.\n\n\"Submillimeter and infrared observations are complementary,\" said Smithsonian astronomer Lincoln Greenhill of the Center. \"We need to use both to tackle the problem of getting high-resolution observations. It's the only way to get a complete picture of the Galactic center.\"\n\nThe black hole at the center of the Milky Way is the best target for interferometric observations because it spans the largest area in the sky of any known black hole. Nevertheless, its angular size of tens of micro-arcseconds poses a major challenge to observers, requiring resolution 10,000 times better than the Hubble Space Telescope provides in visible light.\n\n\"When astronomers achieve it, that first image of the black hole's shadow and inner accretion disk will enter textbooks, and will test our current notions on gravity in the regime where spacetime is strongly curved,\" said Loeb.\n\n\"Ultimately, we want to test Einstein's general theory of relativity in the strong field limit - within a strong gravitational field like that of a black hole,\" said Broderick.\n\nIn preparation for that observational leap, Broderick and Loeb created a computer program to simulate the view. Emissions from the Galaxy's central black hole are known to fluctuate, probably due to clumps of material being swallowed. The researchers modeled those clumps of hot gas and predicted the up-close appearance. They also summed the total light from the \"hot spots\" to simulate low-resolution observations possible with current technology.\n\nNew observational results are starting to come out and already are proving consistent with Broderick and Loeb's prediction.\n\n\"Observations to date only span a limited time interval,\" said Loeb. \"With routine monitoring, astronomers will be able to collect many examples of flares and start deriving the characteristics of the black hole itself.\"\n\nA paper on the hot-spot modeling has been accepted for publication by the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and is available online at arxiv.org\/abs\/astro-ph\/0506433\n\nA second paper modeling the accretion disk has been submitted to The Astrophysical Journal Letters and is available online at arxiv.org\/abs\/astro-ph\/0508386\n\nA third paper combining the accretion disk with hot spots has been submitted to Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and is available online at arxiv.org\/abs\/astro-ph\/0509237 team led by the University of Warwick has pinpointed a new type of exceptionally powerful and long-lived cosmic explosion, prompting a theory that they arise in the violent death throesScientists have used Chandra to make a detailed study of an enormous cloud of hot gas enveloping two large, colliding galaxies.

{"text":"Science News\n\nRare Observation of Cosmic Explosion\n\nMar. 8, 2011 \u2014 A University of Leicester researcher has led an international team of scientists to announce the discovery of a new cosmic explosion: a gamma-ray burst and its associated supernova.\n\nShare This:\n\nDr. Rhaana Starling, of the Department of Physics and Astronomy, presents her research findings in a paper published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful blasts in the Universe, and are thought to be created in the deaths of the most massive stars. These brief flashes of gamma radiation are picked up by dedicated satellites which then send out an alert to the astronomers who study them. This dual discovery of a gamma-ray burst and supernova is remarkable in its high energy properties: the X-ray radiation reveals the explosion breaking out of the star. This event provides a much needed confirmation of a phenomenon glimpsed only once previously, supporting the theory that GRBs are indeed linked with the destruction of massive stars.\n\nRhaana said: \"This nearby GRB and supernova, seen together in a relatively nearby galaxy, is a rare find and allows us to study the origins of these enormous explosions in great detail.

{"text":"organic molecule in space\n\nWednesday, March 26, 2008\n\nAmino acetonitrile (NH2CH2CN). (Credit: Sven Thorwirth, MPIfR)\n\nThe \"Large Molecule Heimat\" is a very dense, hot gas clump within the star forming region Sagittarius B2. In this source of only 0,3 light-year diameter, which is heated by a deeply embedded newly formed star, most of the interstellar molecules known to date have been found, including the most complex ones such as ethyl alcohol, formaldehyde, formic acid, acetic acid, glycol aldehyde (a basic sugar), and ethylene glycol.\n\nStarting from 1965, more than 140 molecular species have been detected in space, in interstellar clouds as well as in circumstellar envelopes. A large fraction of these molecules is organic or carbon-based. A lot of attention is given to the quest for so-called \"bio\"-molecules, especially interstellar amino acids. Amino acids, the building blocks of proteins and therefore key ingredients for the origin of life, have been found in meteorites on Earth, but not yet in interstellar space.\n\nThe simplest amino acid, glycine (NH2CH2COOH), has long been searched for in the interstellar medium but has so far not been unambiguously detected. Since the search for glycine has turned out to be extremely difficult, a chemically related molecule was searched for, amino acetonitrile (NH2CH2CN), probably a direct precursor of glycine.\n\nThe scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Radioastronomy in Bonn selected the \"Large Molecule Heimat\", as the source has been named by experts, and investigated a dense forest of 3700 spectral lines from complex molecules with the IRAM 30-metre telescope in Spain. Atoms and molecules emit light at very specific frequencies, which appear as characteristic lines in the radiation spectrum. By analyzing these spectral lines, astronomers can determine the chemical composition of cosmic clouds. The more complex a molecule is, the more possibilities it has to radiate its internal energy. This is the reason why complex molecules emit many spectral lines, which are very weak and therefore difficult to identify in the \"line jungle\".\n\n\"Still, we were finally able to assign 51 very weak lines to the molecule amino acetonitrile\" says Arnaud Belloche, scientist at the Max Planck institute and first author of the research paper. This result was confirmed at 10 times higher spatial resolution with two radio telescope arrays, the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer in France and the Australia Telescope Compact Array. These observations showed that all the candidate lines were emitted from the same position in the \"Large Molecule Heimat\", \"a strong proof of the reliability of our identification\".\n\n\"Finding amino acetonitrile has greatly extended our insight into the chemistry of dense, hot star-forming regions. I am sure we will be able to identify in the future many new, even more complex organic molecules in the interstellar gas. We already have several candidates!\" says Karl Menten, director at the Max Planck Institute for Radioastronomy and head of the \"Millimeter and Submillimeter Astronomy\" research group.\n\n###\n\nIRAM, the \"Institute for Radio Astronomy at Millimeter wavelengths\", is a joint German-French-Spanish radio astronomy venture which runs the 30m radio telescope on Pico Veleta in the Sierra Nevada mountains in southern Spain and also the Plateau de Bure interferometer in the French alps near Grenoble. Both facilities were utilized for the first detection of amino acetonitrile described here.\n\nATCA, the \"Australia Telescope Compact Array\", is an array of six 22-m antennas located about 25 km west of the town of Narrabri, about 500 km north-west of Sydney, Australia.

{"text":"Star Formation & Destruction\n\nWelcome to the NUI Galway Star Formation & Destruction research home page.\n\nWe use observational, theoretical and numerical techniques to observe and model the star formation process. We also study star destruction processes through phenomena such as planetary nebulae and supernova remnants.\n\nJoining the group\n\nIf you are interested in carrying out a PhD or as a postdoc in this area then please contact Dr. Matt Redman in the first instance.\n\nWe would be delighted to support postdoctoral applications under the FP7 Marie Curie and IRCSET programmes.\n\nThe Formation of Sun-Like Stars\n\nB72\/B68 Nebula Complex - Image Credit: Gary Stevens\n\nHow does star formation begin? The picture above shows a good place to start looking. These are nearby isolated clouds of molecular hydrogen. Tiny solid dust particles block the background starlight so that the clouds are only seen in silhouette against a distant star field. To look inside the cloud, we must use telescopes that operate at millimetre wavelengths, such as the James Clark Maxwell Telescope or the forthcoming Atacama Large Millimeter Array.\n\nAt these wavelengths the cloud glows from thermal emission from the dust particles and also when molecules like carbon monoxide emit radiation at fixed frequencies as they rotate. This helps keeps the cloud cold in a way that is a bit like a microwave oven in reverse (microwaves cause water molecules to spin rapidly and thus heat the food). Molecular clouds are also very dense compared to other gas clouds in the interstellar medium. We would like to understand how a cloud like Barnard 68 collapses under gravity to form a star.\n\nObserving lines from molecules\n\nB68 Dark Cloud - Image Credit: Alves et al.\n\nHere is an image of Barnard 68 as seen in an emission line of carbon monoxide. We can also display this emission from a single point in the form of a line profile where the brightness of the emission is plotted against wavelength.\n\nBecause the clouds are so cold the width of the molecular emission lines would be very narrow if the gas is at rest. However, a cloud may be collapsing, rotating or expanding and the telescope beam captures different elements of the cloud along our line of sight. Because of the doppler effect, the line becomes broader and changes shape in a complicated way. Decoding the information in the line profiles is required to piece together how a star forming cloud is behaving.\n\nWe tackle this by carrying out numerical experiments on a computer using one of the best codes available for solving the problem of the transfer of radiation through a dense cloud such as this. The code is three dimensional which means we are not restricted to models with some overall symmetry. We recently looked at Barnard 68 with the JCMT and then modelled the results with the code and it turned out that the best way to explain the results is if the cloud is undergoing pulsating motions in the outer layers of the cloud - it is wobbling like a giant jelly! More information can be obtained from our recent publication available here.\n\nModel line profiles next to data - credit Redman et al.\n\nObserving Glowing Dust\n\nAlthough star forming clouds are bitterly cold at temperatures as low as 10 degrees above absolute zero (Kelvin), this is still warmer than the famous cosmic microwave background that pervades the universe at 2.73 Kelvin. So the dust grains inside the clouds emit thermal radiation that allows us to map their internal distribution inside the cloud. As long as they are well mixed in with the gas, then these dust grains should trace the gas density distribution too.\n\nScuba map of inside of L1689B - credit Shirley et al 2000\n\nAstrochemistry and molecular astrophysics\n\nHydrogen cyanide (HCN) is an easy species to observe in molecular clouds. It is quite abundant and due to its physical properties it turns out to be a useful tracer of some of the densest regions of star formation. It was a surprise to early researchers in the 1980s to find that the line spectrum of HCN observed towards typical star forming regions is radically different to that expected from the best models at the time.\n\nWe are researching a new method to model HCN's strange spectrum in order to determine what physical conditions trigger these effects. This will allow other researchers to know whether the HCN that they are observing is likely to be well-behaved or not and how to then go on to extract key physical parameters such as temperature and density from their data.\n\nRadiative Transfer\n\nWe use a molecular line transfer code, MOLecular LIne Explorer (MOLLIE), developed originally by Eric R. Keto. MOLLIE has been written to solve the difficult problem of line radiation transport in cold dense molecular clouds. Typically, one has a mixed set of observational data from one or more molecular line transitions and from various positions across the cloud. One of many strengths of MOLLIE code is that it can model such a 'messy' observational system by directly loading the data into the code. Alternatively, it can be used for stand alone modelling work.

{"text":"Related\n\nKalirai: The main goal of my research is to understand the details of how stars like our sun, including those that are a little more and a little less massive, change over time. For billions of years, these stars will remain at the same brightness and temperature. This is great for humans on Earth since it gives us a stable climate. After the hydrogen in the sun is exhausted, the sun will become a stellar cinder and simply cool over time. We call this state, the end state of 98% of all stars, white dwarfs.\n\nAll of the action in stellar evolution occurs between these two phases, when, over a relatively short time scale, stars swell up into \"giants\" and spill their outer materials into space. The detailed understanding of this process, of how stars dramatically change, is fundamentally important to many research areas in astronomy. After all, the light that we see from distant galaxies is really just millions of individual stars at the tip of their luminous evolution.\n\nCNN: If the sun will experience this dramatic change, what is the fate of our planet Earth?\n\nKalirai: The Earth is orbiting the sun at a distance of about 90 million miles. When the sun runs out of hydrogen in its core, it will begin burning hydrogen in a shell around the core and become very luminous and bloated. The outer layers of the sun will actually reach the Earth, and so the oceans will evaporate and our planet will be fried. Sorry! Fortunately for us, this won't happen for several billions of years.\n\nBased on my research on \"stellar mass loss,\" the sun itself will lose about 45% of its mass through this process. The remaining mass, the core of the sun, will be the white dwarf. Interestingly, the size of that core will only be a little larger than the Earth, so the remnant star will be very dense.\n\nCNN: What telescopes do you use to study the stars?\n\nKalirai: I enjoy using the Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii.

{"text":"GAS CLOUD FOUND AT UNIVERSE'S EDGE\n\nA vast cloud of gas molecules has been detected near the fringe of the observable universe, giving astronomers a revealing glimpse into the earliest stars in the firmament and the creation of galaxies.\n\nAstronThe cloud is estimated to be 12 billion light-years away, 10 times farther than any other molecular gas cloud seen. Making Cosmic History\n\nThe two discoverers, Dr. Robert L. Brown and Dr. Paul Vanden Bout, both of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, Va., said the huge volume of gas being detected at such a great distance was strong evidence that they had observed a galaxy still in the formation process. The cloud is being seen as it existed about 3 billion years after the presumed birth of the universe in the Big Bang, and no galaxy had ever before been caught in the act of forming so relatively early in cosmic history.\n\nThe observations, they also said, demonstrate that galaxy formation is preceded by the gravitational accumulation of an enormous reservoir of molecular gas that occurred surprisingly soon after the Big Bang.\n\nIn an announcement of their discovery, Dr. Brown and Dr. Vanden Bout said Friday that the findings were \"in keeping with models of galaxy formation, never before confirmed, that galaxies form by the gravitational accumulation of pre-existing clouds of gas.\"\n\nDr. Greg Bothun, an astrophysicist at the University of Oregon and specialist on galaxy studies, agreed that the cloud represented a nascent galaxy. \"This confirms what we expected,\" he said. \"But it is nice to finally see it.\" Finding Molecule's Signature\n\nThe astronomers made the discovery in July, using a radio telescope at Kitt Peak, Ariz., to detect the presence of carbon monoxide, one of the most stable molecules, in a cloud of interstellar dust. The dust cloud had been discovered a few months earlier in analysis of data from the Infrared Astronomy Satellite showing faint emissions of heat at far-infrared wavelengths. The object was in the constellation Ursa Major in the northern night sky.\n\nThe signature for the carbon monoxide molecule was detected in the extremely short radio wavelengths. It was coming from the same region as the dust cloud, known as IRAS 10214+4724.\n\nDr. Brown said the quantity of the molecular gas was astonishing. \"I can't think of another object in the universe that has anything like that mass of molecular gas,\" he said.\n\nDr. Richard B. Larson, an astronomer at Yale University, said: \"This combination of molecular gas and strong infrared signals is a sure sign for very intense star formation. It's perhaps the best evidence for a galaxy in the process of star formation.\"\n\nFrom observations of quasars, the extremely bright and distant objects assumed to be associated with early galaxies, astrophysicists had determined that stellar and galactic formation must have occurred much sooner after the Big Bang than had previously been thought. \"But it's been hard to find clear evidence,\" Dr. Larson said. Galaxy's Life Cycle\n\nSince both the elements carbon and oxygen are produced in stars, the carbon monoxide observations showed that, though this galaxy is in its formative stage, there has already been at least one generation of stars to have completed its life cycle. The Big Bang itself distributed only the elements hydrogen and helium. All heavier elements are then formed by nuclear processes within the stars and are scattered when those stars explode at the end of their lives.\n\nAs Dr. Brown reconstructed the cosmic events, a generation of stars must have been born in the huge cloud of dust and gas and then died in cataclysmic explosions, ejecting the carbon and oxygen needed for the formation of the carbon monoxide in the cloud. \"It was the Big Bang followed by a generation of stars followed by supernova explosions, then the remnants collapsing into a cold molecular cloud,\" he said.\n\nDr. Brown said the next step for astronomers would be to search for other molecules in the cloud, looking for more clues to how far the galactic chemistry has evolved, and to survey the sky for similar objects elsewhere, trying to determine how common this phenomenon is.\n\nScientists said the discovery provided even more evidence that soon after the Big Bang -- sooner than can be accounted for in current theory -- gases began clumping together instead of spreading out smoothly over the universe. This led to the surprisingly early formation of stars and galaxies."}

Others are presumed to exist but are discovered only slowly\u00d1the most recent one, a dwarf galaxy named Antlia, in 1997\u00d1because of the difficulty in identifying dwarf galaxies that lie close to the plane of our Galaxy, with its heavy interstellar absorption of radiation from such objects.

The range in absolute magnitude is from \u00e79 to \u00e721 (a range in absolute luminosity of 63,000). Most of the luminosity and mass of the Local Group are in M 31 and the Milky Way. The total mass is about 700 billion solar masses. One low-luminosity system, Leo II, is an extreme dwarf elliptical system with a mass of only a million solar masses, comparable in size to globular clusters. Even more extreme dwarf systems probably exist. Detection of these very faint systems continues by means of computer analyses of photographic plates.The Local Group is important because individual stars can be studied in detail within each member and because the most common type of galaxy, the dwarf elliptical, is best observed there."}
{"text":"Planck\n\nby dave on March 21st, 2013\n\nPlanck and the CMB\n\nIn May of 2009, the European Space Agency launched the Planck Satellite into orbit. On paper, Planck sounds very similar to the WMAP satellite launched 8 years earlier, or the COBE Satellite launched in 1989: measure and map the perturbations in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation.\n\nThe CMB radiation is a very nearly uniform remnant from the early universe, roughly 380,000 years after the big bang when the universe was approximately 1000 times smaller, and thus 1000 times hotter than it is now. These days, the CMB is only 2.73K and barely noticeable, unless you get very lucky, or happen to be looking for it.\n\nThe CMB is also very nearly uniform in every direction, with the temperature only varying by about 1 part in 100,000 from place to place. Those differences, however, mean a lot. The blue spots in the map above correspond to directions slightly cooler than average, while the red spots are slightly hotter. Those hot and cool patches ultimately give rise to the mass perturbations in the universe that we see today, including all of the large scale structure (galaxies, clusters of galaxies, etc.) that we see around us.\n\nThe Results\n\nThe Planck satellite has a number of advantages over its predecessors. For one thing, it has 9 different frequency channels, giving it increased sensitivity, and allowing the Planck team to effectively remove various types of foreground sources. Planck also measures structure to a much smaller scale. To give you an idea, you can take all of the hot and cold spots and make a spectrum of how much structure there is on various scales:\n\nIf you've never seen one of these plots before, large scale (corresponding to the whole sky) is to the left while small scale (corresponding to something like 4 minutes of arc) is to the right. The red curve is a purely theoretical model, while the blue dots (with error bars) show the average of the data. This is astounding precision science!\n\nEarlier this morning, ESA made a public announcement about the data and results from 15 months of observations. Essentially, they adjusted the various cosmological parameters until the red curve above matched the blue dots as closely as possible. In addition, they adjusted to include information from the WMAP satellite and other cosmological measurements. The thirty (!) technical papers will be officially released on the arxiv tomorrow, but there were a few big surprises.\n\nNotably, they found a little more dark matter and a little less dark energy than previously supposed.\n\nCredit: Planck and ESA\n\nIn addition, they found a somewhat lower Hubble Constant than previously supposed. Instead of the best-fit concluded from WMAP, Planck found a slightly slower expansion, only . The age of the universe, when all of these numbers are plugged in, is still about 13.8 Billion Years.\n\nIf you are an expert and want the money table, here it is (click to zoom in):\n\nShould you freak out about these differences?\n\nNo.\n\nWhile it's always interesting when the best-fit cosmological parameters get tweaked, it's important to remember that these are estimates. There are error bars involved, and in this case, the differences between these results and the WMAP 9 year results are something on the order of 2 or so. Interesting, and likely to bounce around a bit, bit nothing earth-shattering.\n\nIn their overview paper, the Planck team did announce a few things that I thought were kind of noteworthy (with a little editorializing on my part):\n\n\"An exploration of parameter space beyond the basic set leads to: (a) firmly establishing the effective number of relativistic\nspecies (neutrinos) at 3;\"\n\nWe expected this, but if there is another species of neutrino, it's fairly massive.\n\n\"(b) constraining the flatness of space-time to a level of 0.1%;\"\n\nGreat constraint! And unsurprising given the standard model of inflation.\n\n\"we find no evidence at the current level of analysis for tensor modes, nor for a dynamical form of dark energy, nor for time variations of the fine structure constant\"\n\nThat is inflation seems to be fairly generic, dark energy seems even more likely to be a cosmological constant, and despite some claims to the contrary, physical parameters seem to be fixed.\n\n\"we do find evidence for deviations from isotropy at low l's.In particular, we find a coherent deficit of power with respect to our best-fit CDM model at l's between 20 and 30.\"\n\nThis is quite interesting. The large scale structure \u2014 small l \u2014 doesn't quite fit. This sort of problem showed up in WMAP as well. In announcements, they're not making a huge deal about this, however, and personally, I don't think it presents much of a problem to the newly tweaked standard cosmological model.\n\n\"the first detection at high significance () of the cross-correlation between CMB lensing and the cosmic infrared background, which allows us to constrain the star formation rate at high redshifts.\"\n\nThis, and some of their other results, are putting very tight constraints on the epochs of the first stars.\n\nThis is a very big deal. The Integrated Sachs-Wolfe Effect basically measures the difference between the blue shifting of microwave background photons as they fall into forming clusters and the redshifting as they climb out. They measure, in effect, the overall increase in structure over a finite amount of time. Since the growth of structure is directly predicted by cosmology it is a very robust way of putting an additional constraint on the models.\n\nExpect lots of news and discussion over the next few days. While the Planck results don't overturn the picture of our universe, they are some pretty exciting and astoundingly precise results!"}
{"text":"Hubble Image of NGC 3324\n\nThe landmark 10th anniversary of the Hubble Space Telescope's Hubble Heritage Project is being celebrated with a 'landscape' image from the cosmos. Cutting across a nearby star-forming region are the \"hills and valleys\" of gas and dust displayed in intricate detail. Set amid a backdrop of soft, glowing blue light are wispy tendrils of gas as well as dark trunks of dust that are light-years in height.\n\nThe Hubble Heritage Project, which began in October 1998, has released nearly 130 images mined from the Hubble data archive as well as a number of observations taken specifically for the project. By releasing a new, previously unseen Hubble image every month, the team's intent was to showcase some of the most attractive images ever taken by the Hubble telescope, and share them with a wide audience. The Heritage team continues to create aesthetic images that present the universe from an artistic perspective.\n\nThis month's three-dimensional-looking Hubble image shows the edge of the giant gaseous cavity within the star-forming region called NGC 3324. The glowing nebula has been carved out by intense ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds from several hot, young stars. A cluster of extremely massive stars, located well outside this image in the center of the nebula, is responsible for the ionization of the nebula and excavation of the cavity.\n\nThe image also reveals dramatic dark towers of cool gas and dust that rise above the glowing wall of gas. The dense gas at the top resists the blistering ultraviolet radiation from the central stars, and creates a tower that points in the direction of the energy flow. The high-energy radiation blazing out from the hot, young stars in NGC 3324 is sculpting the wall of the nebula by slowly eroding it away.\n\nLocated in the Southern Hemisphere, NGC 3324 is at the northwest corner of the Carina Nebula (NGC 3372), home of the Keyhole Nebula and the active, outbursting star Eta Carinae. The entire Carina Nebula complex is located at a distance of roughly 7,200 light-years, and lies in the constellation Carina.\n\nThis image is a composite of data taken with two of Hubble's science instruments. Data taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) in 2006 isolated light emitted by hydrogen. More recent data, taken in 2008 with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2), isolated light emitted by sulfur and oxygen gas. To create a color composite, the data from the sulfur filter are represented by red, from the oxygen filter by blue, and from the hydrogen filter by green.\n\nThe Heritage project has released images using several of Hubble's optical cameras: the Wide Field Planetary Camera (WF\/PC), which was installed when the telescope was first deployed in 1990; WFPC2, which replaced WFPC in 1993 and is still in service today; and ACS, which was added in 2002. After the Hubble Servicing Mission in early 2009, the Hubble Heritage team hopes to continue using ACS as well as the newest of the optical cameras, Wide Field Camera 3."}

Also known by the catalog number NGC 7293, it is a typical example of a class of objects called planetary nebulae. Discovered in the 18th century, these cosmic works of art were erroneously named for their resemblance to gas-giant planets.\n\nPlanetary nebulae are actually the remains of stars that once looked a lot like our sun. These stars spend most of their lives turning hydrogen into helium in massive runaway nuclear fusion reactions in their cores. In fact, this process of fusion provides all the light and heat that we get from our sun. Our sun will blossom into a planetary nebula when it dies in about five billion years.\n\nWhen the hydrogen fuel for the fusion reaction runs out, the star turns to helium for a fuel source, burning it into an even heavier mix of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. Eventually, the helium will also be exhausted, and the star dies, puffing off its outer gaseous layers and leaving behind the tiny, hot, dense core, called a white dwarf. The white dwarf is about the size of Earth, but has a mass very close to that of the original star; in fact, a teaspoon of a white dwarf would weigh as much as a few elephants!\n\nThe intense ultraviolet radiation from the white dwarf heats up the expelled layers of gas, which shine brightly in the infrared. GALEX has picked out the ultraviolet light pouring out of this system, shown throughout the nebula in blue, while Spitzer has snagged the detailed infrared signature of the dust and gas in red, yellow and green. Where red Spitzer and blue GALEX data combine in the middle, the nebula appears pink. A portion of the extended field beyond the nebula, which was not observed by Spitzer, is from NASA's all-sky Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The white dwarf star itself is a tiny white pinprick right at the center of the nebula.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- If this were an inkblot test, you might see a bow tie or a butterfly depending on your personality.

{"text":"Astronomers simulate real-time telescope as big as the world to study peculiar active galaxy\n\nMar 02, 2011\n\nUsing a perfectly orchestrated world-wide network of radio telescopes, astronomers have produced a high-resolution map of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) belonging to an unknown class of gamma-ray sources. The unusual source and the groundbreaking technique used to produce the image are detailed in a letter published today in Astronomy & Astrophysics.\n\nThe paper, \"Global e-VLBI observations of the gamma-ray narrow line Seyfert 1 PMN J0948+0022\", presents very high resolution radio\nobservations of the active nucleus of a peculiar Seyfert galaxy. In 2009, observations made with the Fermi satellite of PMN J0948+0022\nrevealed the emission of high energy gamma rays, presumably from the active nucleus of this galaxy. No other galaxy of this kind had ever been revealed at such high energy, and it could be the first member of a new class of gamma-ray extragalactic sources. Gamma-ray emission is typically associated with relativistic jets of plasma that also emit radio waves. Therefore, the best way to image such structure is in the radio spectrum using VLBI, Very Long Baseline Interferometry. \"We immediately realized this was an extremely interesting object, so we decided to look at it using the best resolution we could attain. And we knew it was important to do it as soon as possible, since this was a variable source,\" says Marcello Giroletti, astronomer at INAF-IRA in Bologna, Italy, who led the observations.\n\nVLBI observations are performed by simultaneously pointing at a source with telescopes distributed across several countries, and the more distant their locations, the better the achieved angular resolution. With traditional VLBI, each station records data on hard disks which are shipped to a central supercomputer called a correlator, which processes the data. Recently, it has become possible to directly connect the telescopes to the correlator using optical fibres and to process the data in real-time, in the so-called electronic VLBI (e-VLBI) technique, providing astronomers with data in a matter of hours rather than weeks. Although e-VLBI is done routinely at the European scale, it had only been done at a global scale for testing and demonstration purposes. Scientific observations using a world-scale, real-time connected array had never been done before.\n\nGiroletti and his team conducted observations in three sessions from May to July 2009 using radio telescopes in Europe, East Asia, and\nAustralia, connecting observatories as far apart as 12,458 km. With such a long baseline, the central region of the galaxy was mapped at an astonishing resolution of a few tens of microarcseconds - about the same as identifying a football on the moon!\n\nAll aspects of the technical experiment were successful, with each telescope streaming its data to the correlator at the Joint Institute\nfor VLBI in Europe (JIVE) in the Netherlands. This type of observation is testing new frontiers, since it permits real-time network performance monitoring and the possibility of delivering prompt results, which is essential for coordination with other observatories at other wavelengths. Several of them, including space satellites Fermi and Swift, joined the same observing campaign. More radio telescopes are expected to become connected through real-time high-speed networks, such as the upcoming 64m INAF Sardinia Radio Telescope, and technology developments are being made through the NEXPReS project to remove the distinction between traditional VLBI and e-VLBI techniques.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nOn May 22, Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico joined other telescopes in North America, South America, Europe and Africa in simultaneously observing the same targets, simulating a telescope more than 6,800 miles (almost 11,000 ...\n\nFor the first time, a CSIRO radio telescope has been linked to others in China and Europe in real-time, demonstrating the power of high-speed global networks and effectively creating a telescope almost as ...\n\nThe 100m Radio Telescope Effelsberg enters operations of the e-EVN network, enhancing its sensitivity to detect the radio sky providing the sharpest images in nearby real time.

{"text":"Molecules\n\nCourse: AST 871, Fall 2009 School: National Taiwan University Rating:\n\nWord Count: 12337\n\nDocument Preview). The Copernicus satellite detected Far-UV absorption bands of H2 (the Lyman & Werner electronic transition bands) and HD in the early 1970s, and Lyman FUSE (launched in 1999) has detected diffuse H2 along nearly every line of sight it has looked (where it often gets in the way of lines from the extragalactic sources of interest to the observations!). Infrared observations beginning in the 1970s detected H2 in emission from forbidden rotational-vibrational transitions in the Near-IR, with advances in IR array detectors in the late 1990s greatly expanding studies of these transitions. It was in the 1980s, with the development of new millimeter receiver technology, that the study of interstellar molecules blossomed. Many molecular species were identified, and the field has grown sufficiently in depth that we can only give it the most basic treatment here. This section will focus on the basic physics of molecular line formation in the interstellar medium, and on the properties of giant molecular clouds. These notes assume a familiarity with basic molecular structure (electronic, vibrational, and rotational quantum states) as was covered in the Astronomy 823 course (Theoretical Spectroscopy). Persons using these notes outside of OSU can refer to standard texts (like Herzberg) for the necessary background information. While the dominant molecular species in the ISM is H2, because it is a homonuclear linear molecule with no permanent dipole moment all of the low-lying energy levels are quadrupole transitions with small transition probabilities (A-values) and relatively high excitation energies. The high excitation energies mean that these transitions are only excited at high temperatures or in strong UV radiation fields (i.e., fluorescence). Thus the most abundant molecule in the ISM, carrying most of the mass and playing a key role in excitation, thermal balance, and gas-phase chemistry, is virtually invisible to direct observation. As a consequence, most of what we know about interstellar molecules comes from observations of socalled tracer species, primarily CO which is observed in its J=10 rotational transition at =2.6 mm. This and other molecular species are observed as emission lines from pure rotational transitions at centimeter to millimeter wavelengths. Like we saw in the case with the HI 21-cm line, we must account for stimulated emission as well as collisional and radiative effects when deriving the line properties. Since the formation of molecular species like CO occurs under conditions favorable for H2 formation, we will try to estimate the amount of H2 from the observed amount of CO with the assistance of a few simplifying assumptions. A final aspect of the physics of molecular clouds is chemistry, both gas-phase and on the surfaces of dust grains. This is a rich topic that is sadly beyond the scope of this course.\nV-1\nInterstellar Molecules\nSpectrum of Orion Molecular Cloud 1 (OMC1) in the 1.3mm band [Blake et al. 1987, ApJ, 315, 621] showing many of the 29 molecular species detected in this region.\nV-1 Interstellar CO & Other Tracer Molecules\nRadiative Transfer (yet again!)\nIn our discussion of the HI 21cm line our treatment of radiative transfer included the effects of stimulated emission. We were assisted in this analysis by the fact that the 21cm wavelength of the transition is in the long wavelength Rayleigh-Jeans limit of the background radiation field. For the rotational transitions of interstellar molecules like CO1 that occur at shorter wavelengths, this simplifying assumption is no longer true the analysis become more involved. In general, the background radiation field has a blackbody spectrum:\n2h 3 1 I = B (TR ) = 2 h \/ kTR 1 c e\nwhere TR is the brightness temperature of the background radiation field, which at millimeter wavelengths (e.g., for the CO J=10 transition at 2.6mm) is dominated by the cosmic microwave background radiation with TR2.725K. We know from COBE and WMAP observations that the cosmic microwave background is the most perfect blackbody yet observed.\nI will follow the usual convention of denoting the principal isotopic species of atoms in a molecule without giving the atomic weights explicitly. For example, CO means 12C16O. The isotopic species will be given explicitly when comparing different isotopic forms (e.g., when discussing the 12CO\/13CO ratio in the standard CO analysis). V-2\n1\nInterstellar Molecules\nAt millimeter wavelengths, the observed brightness temperature of a line Tb is often expressed in terms of an effective antenna temperature:\n* TA = TA \/\nwhere is the receiver efficiency. A molecular line source is usually observed by chopping the telescopes beam between on- and off-source positions and measuring the difference in antenna temperatures. In general, the difference in brightness temperatures is\n* TA = (1 e )\nh 1 1 e h \/ kTexc 1 e h \/ kTR 1 k\nThe excitation temperature Texc for a given transition is defined as: nu gu h ul \/ kTexc =e nl gl For pure rotational transitions the excitation temperature is often called the rotation temperature, whereas for vibrational transitions it is called the vibration temperature. This nomenclature is analogous to the spin temperature defined for the HI 21cm hyperfine transition. The absorption optical depth is:\n= ds = (nl Blu nu Bul ) I ds\nOn the right-hand side the first expression of the integrand is the pure absorption term, and the second is the stimulated emission term. Integrating the optical depth over the line profile and eliminating the Bs as we did previously in our treatment of atomic gas line transfer gives\nh ul c2 ( Nl Blu Nu Bul ) = 2 Aul Nu eh \/ kTexc 1 8 ul c line where Nu is the column density of the molecules in the given upper excited state, and Aul is the transition probability for the line. There are three regimes of excitation temperature:\nd =\n(\n)\n* Texc = TR : TA = 0; no line is visible * Texc > TR : TA > 0; line appears in emission * Texc < TR : TA < 0; line appears in absorption\nThe excitation temperature will depend on the relative importance of radiative processes (which drive Texc towards TR) and collisional processes (which drive Texc towards the kinetic temperature of the gas). Collisions between the molecular species in question (CO etc.) and HI and\/or H2 are the most important. Considering only a single collider for simplicity, the excitation temperature is: 1 Aul + Tkin nqul 1 = Texc Aul 1 + nq ul where: T* = h ul \/ k and nqul = collisional de-excitation rate TR 1 T* TR TR T*\nV-3\nInterstellar Molecules\nWritten this way, the excitation temperature is a harmonic mean between the radiation and kinetic temperatures weighted by the relative collisional and radiative de-excitation terms. The ratio of the radiative and collisional rates is just the ratio of the density to the critical density for the transition: A ncrit = ul qul as we have seen previously for UV, optical, and near-infrared forbidden lines. In the low-density limit (n < ncrit), the excitation temperature is driven towards the radiation temperature and no line will be visible. In the high-density limit (n>>ncrit), the excitation temperature is driven towards the kinetic temperature, and we see an emission line since Tkin > TR for most cases.\nCritical Density and Line Visibility\nAt low densities, below the critical density, the excitation temperature will be only slightly above the radiation temperature and the emission line will be practically invisible. This is why you often read in the molecular line literature that a particular line is only visible at or above its critical density. At high densities, well above the critical density, the excitation temperature is at (or very near) the kinetic temperature of the gas, we often say that the line is thermalized. Because different molecular lines have different critical densities, line visibility can serve as an approximate density diagnostic. This rule of thumb is not without qualifications. Previously we noted that the weighting factor in the harmonic mean was the ratio of the density to the critical density. However, note that in the equation for 1\/Texc, this factor is multiplied by an additional factor of (TR\/T). If stimulated emission is important, T<<TR, and the density must be much larger than ncrit to produce visible emission lines. For example, the graph below shows the excitation temperature as a function of density for two molecular lines: the CS J=32 147 GHz line and the NH3 (J,K)=(1,1) 23 GHz line. This CS line has a critical density of 1.5106 cm3, and reaches an excitation temperature of 0.9Tkin at n=2106 cm3. However, the NH3 line has a critical density of 2103 cm3, but the excitation temperature does not approach the kinetic temperature until n>105 cm3, nearly 3 orders of magnitude larger. The reason is the greater importance of stimulated emission at low frequencies compared to at high frequencies. In general, if T=h\/k<<Tkin, the density must be much larger than the critical density in order for the line to be visible. As such, the density must be very large compared to the critical density to thermalize lines at centimeter wavelengths (like the NH3 transition noted above), while at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths, the lines of species like CO and CS are essentially thermalized at or near their critical densities. By the time you get to Infrared and Visible wavelengths stimulated emission becomes negligible and all collisionally excited lines thermalize at ncrit.\nTexc vs. density for NH3 and CS transitions from Evans (1989)\nV-4\nInterstellar Molecules\nTotal Column Densities\nOnce the total optical depth and kinetic temperature have been measured, this only gives an estimate the column density for molecules in that particular rotational state. To convert this into a total column density, we can exploit the fact that in order for the line is visible at all it must be nearly thermalized. In the LTE approximation, the fractional population of a given rotational state, J, is given as:\ng J e EJ \/ kT Q(T ) where Q(T) is the partition function, defined as the sum over rotational states. fJ =\nQ(T ) = gi e Ei \/ kT\ni\nFor rotational states in simple linear molecules like CO or CS, the statistical weights and energies of the Jth rotational state is: g J = (2 J + 1) EJ = J ( J + 1)hB (v) Here B(v) is a function of the moment of inertia associated with vibrational quantum number v of the molecule (rotational transitions come in ladders within a given vibrational state) B (v) = h 8 I (v)\n2\nwhere I(v) is the moment of inertia of the molecule when it is in vibrational quantum state v. The summation is relatively straightforward to perform as it can be truncated at a high J level because transition probabilities increase with increasing J, and transitions out of these higher states occur fast enough that they will be heavily depopulated and contribute negligibly to the partition function. At low density, the sum for Q(T) can be approximated as an integral:\nQ(T ) (2 J + 1)e EJ \/ kT dJ As the system approaches LTE, the partition function is approximately Q (T ) kT hB (v) For example, for the CO J=10 transition, the LTE partition function is: T Q(T ) 2.76 K Strictly speaking, LTE is not always a valid assumption, and explicit non-LTE calculations are performed to solve the equations of statistical equilibrium to evaluate the partition functions. When you see a conversion between the observed CO J=10 flux to a total CO column density being computed in the LTE approximation, you will know that theyve followed the simple treatment described above.\nRadiative Trapping\nThe preceding analysis has assumed that only photons from the background radiation field (TR) are used to compute the stimulated emission term, ignoring contributions from line photons. This assumption is only strictly true in an optically thin cloud. For strong lines in abundant molecular species, like the CO J=10 line, the cloud will be optically thick in these lines, and we will have to include stimulated emission from these emission-line photons in the radiative transfer treatment.\nV-5\nInterstellar Molecules\nIn an optically thick molecular cloud, line photons scatter around and are effectively \"trapped\". If the cloud is thick enough, the local density of line photons can greatly exceed the density of photons from the cosmic microwave background. These extra photons result in greater stimulated emission, driving the excitation temperature above the kinetic temperature of the gas. Further, the velocity field becomes important as we often observe that the widths of emission lines are larger than the expected thermal Doppler widths, either due to turbulent motions within the clouds or large-scale motions (e.g., velocity gradients or outflows). There are a number of ways to calculate the effects of radiative trapping, the most common is the escape probability treatment of Scoville & Solomon [1974, ApJ, 187, L67]. The details are beyond the scope of these notes, but the basic idea is that radiative trapping causes line photons to scatter many times about the cloud, enhancing the subsequent emergent line flux due to stimulated emission. Each emission-line photon emitted by normal downward radiative transitions can effectively multiply itself by stimulated emission before escaping the cloud. The result is that you can get a larger excitation temperature at a lower density than in an optically thin cloud, thus lowering the effective density at which the line appears to thermalize and become visible. Since CO J=10 line is always extremely optically thick in molecular clouds, some kind of radiative trapping treatment must be performed. For most Giant Molecular Clouds, the observed optical depths in the J=10 line are >10, lowering the effective density at which TexcTkin from 3000 cm3 to as low as 300 cm3.\nDensity & Temperature Diagnostics\nDensity Diagnostics\nThere are a variety of ways to estimate the density of a molecular cloud from observations of molecular lines, all of which come with various assumptions and caveats. Goldsmith gives a relatively complete list of the most common diagnostics in his review in Interstellar Processes along with citations to the key papers. The most basic way to estimate density is from the observed column density by assuming a path length through the cloud: n N tot L1 Ntot is the total column density along the line of sight, and L is the path length. A second way that is commonly encountered in the literature is to set lower limits on the density by noting which molecular lines of different critical densities are visible in a cloud. Some of the common emission lines (among many others) that are used in this way are: Transition\n12\nCO J=10\nFrequency 115 GHz 23.7 GHz 49 GHz 4.3 GHz\nncrit(10K) ~1000 cm3 1800 cm3 4.6104 cm3 1.7105 cm3\nNH3 (1,1) CS J=10 HCO+ J=10\nIf many lines from a given molecular species (e.g., H2CO) can be observed, a better method is to measure the ratios of lines that are not yet thermalized (n<ncrit). These line ratios will be density sensitive and may be used to estimate densities in roughly the same way that we used the [SII] and\nV-6\nInterstellar Molecules\n[OII] doublet ratios at visible wavelengths in HII regions. Such ratios tend to have limited ranges of applicability, for example: Lines CO J=10 and J=23 CS J=76 and J=43 Applicable Range 10 < n(H2) < 104 cm3\n2.5\n105.5 < n(H2) < 107.5 cm3\nThe main limitation of using molecular line ratios as a density diagnostic is that detailed quantum mechanical calculations are required to work out the density dependence, and this has been done for only a few species with the sufficient precision. A final way of estimating densities that is sometimes used to assume that the cloud is in virial equilibrium, with turbulent motions holding the cloud up against self gravity. Interpreting the observed line width as the virial velocity, you estimate the virial mass and divide by the volume of the cloud to estimate a density. Crude, but it can give a robust mean density for the cloud.\nTemperature Diagnostics\nThe most important thermometers in molecular clouds are the rotational transitions of 12CO. The low-J levels are very optically thick, and if the lines are thermalized, measuring the line strength gives the excitation temperature, and hence the kinetic temperature of the H2. In most molecular clouds without additional heating sources (i.e., away from regions of massive-star formation), the observed kinetic temperatures are in the range of 1020K. In these regions, the thermal balance is between heating by cosmic rays and collisions with warm (T=3040K) dust grains, and cooling by molecular line emission, with CO as one of the primary coolants. Near the edges of molecular clouds, heating by photoelectrons ejected by Interstellar Radiation Field photons becomes important. In clouds associated with massive-star formation (e.g., in Orion or M17), the cloud temperatures range from 4070K, and localized regions with heating sources can be as warm as a few 100K. For a few molecular line species, we can estimate the kinetic temperature directly, along with an estimate of the density, using line ratios of optically thin transitions. Emission lines of NH3, for example, are often used this way, in conjunction with detailed models. Again, the principal limitation of line ratio methods is the necessity of having using quantum mechanical models to predict the run of line ratios with density and temperature. Such data are known with sufficient precision for only a few molecular species.\nAnomalous Excitation\nBriefly, but not to diminish its importance, the complex quantum structure of molecules makes many of them susceptible to a variety of non-thermal excitation sources like radiative and collisional pumping. This can lead to anomalous under- or over-population of excited states if the combination of selection rules and transition probabilities works out just right. If a molecule can be pumped so that the population of an excited state greatly exceeds the population of the ground state (population inversion), the excitation temperature can greatly exceed the background radiation temperature, and the additional population of the excited state enhances the effect of stimulated emission. Under the right circumstances, this can lead to the production of an astrophysical maser or laser (in laboratory spectroscopy, you get a maser if the wavelength is longer than 1mm, and a laser if shorter than 1mm). The most common astrophysical masers are OH, H2O, and NH3 masers powered by either radiative or collisional pumping. These masers are usually\nV-7\nInterstellar Molecules\nassociated with regions of star formation, and in dusty outflows around AGB stars. This is an entirely separate field of endeavor beyond the scope of these notes, but the interested reader should consult Moshe Elitzurs review article in Interstellar Processes, or recent Annual Reviews articles on astrophysical masers. If the anomalous excitation leads to significant underpopulation of an upper level relative to the lower level of a molecular transition, the resulting excitation temperature can become lower than the background temperature, causing the line to appear in absorption as against the cosmic background. An example of this is the anomalous absorption seen in formaldehyde (H2CO), in which the upper level of the transition in question is depopulated by photon pumping into even higher levels. Collisional refrigeration mechanisms have also been proposed.\nThe Standard CO Analysis\nAs we saw before, the observed antenna temperature is (on-off) is: h * TA = (1 e ) [ f (Texc ) f (TR ) ] k where 1 f (T ) = h \/ kT e 1 Since the observed intensity depends on the excitation temperature, Texc, and the optical depth, , observations of a single line will not allow you to derive both [i.e., you have two unknowns but only one observable].\nBecause the energy of a rotational transition E(J) is inversely proportional to the moment of inertia of the molecule I(v), changes in the isotopic species of one (or both) atoms will change the line frequency sufficiently to distinguish the two isotopic forms. For the CO molecule, the isotopic ratio is 13 12 C\/ C1\/90, so that one expects the relative optical depth in the 13CO lines to be smaller than in the 12 CO lines. This expectation is at the heart of the standard CO analysis: in most cases the 12CO line is optically thick, while its isotopic partner 13CO is optically thin. Observations show that the typical relative brightnesses of the J=10 line is I(13CO)\/I(12CO)~0.050.4, in agreement with this expectation. A further assumption is that 13CO and 12CO both arise in the same regions, and so share the same excitation temperature. If there are significant chemical fractionation effects, this assumption could be invalid (e.g., if local chemistry affects the creation\/destruction of 13CO differently than that of 12CO). In the limit of large optical depth for the 12CO line, the excitation temperature is\nh k h k ln 1 + * 12 TA ( CO) + TR Inserting the numbers for the J=10 line (h\/k=5.53K): Texc =\nTexc = 5.53 K 5.53 K ln 1 + * 12 TA ( CO) + TR\n12\nHere\n* TA = observed effective line intensity of\nCO\nTR = background radiation field temperature (2.725K)\nV-8\nInterstellar Molecules\nFor 13CO, we assume that it is optically thin, and substitute in the Texc derived from the 12CO observations into the equation for the intensity of 13CO and solve for the optical depth in 13CO, (13CO). Because we expect that Texc>TR, the optical depth of the 13CO line is\nT * ( 13 CO) ( CO) ln 1 A 12 * TA ( CO) Otherwise, we would have to solve the equations using the full form for the effective antenna temperature, which would need to be done numerically.\n13\n1\nThe optical depth in 13CO is then converted into a column density as follows: dv 1 e 5.53\/Texc The integral is taken over the line profile expressed as a function of line-of-sight velocity v. This column density is often written as N(13CO), as one assumes that if the line is visible it must therefore be thermalized, and so TexcTkin and N is thus an LTE column density. N ( CO) = 2.85 10 cm\n13 14 2\n( 13 CO) [1 + Texc ]\nN(12CO) is then derived by assuming an isotopic ratio for 13CO\/12CO, usually the locally determined cosmic ratio of ~1\/90.\nV-9\nInterstellar Molecules\nV-2 Molecular Hydrogen (H2)\nMolecular Hydrogen (H2) is the most abundant molecular species in the ISM, and plays a crucial role in cooling and molecular chemistry. Despite its importance, it is also the most difficult species to observe directly. The reason is that H2 is a simple, homonuclear molecule. Because it consists of two atoms of identical mass, the center of mass and the center of charge coincide, resulting in no permanent dipole moment. With no dipole moment, only quadrupole rotational transitions can occur. This means that only the J=0 and J=2 rotational transitions occur, while the J=1 (dipole) rotational transitions are strictly forbidden. This means that unlike other molecules we have studied, H2 emits no lines long-wavelength rotational lines. The small mass and small size of the H2 molecule gives it a low moment of inertia. This means that the first pure rotational transition, J=20, occurs at 28m, a part of the spectrum unobservable from the ground due to water-vapor absorption in the atmosphere. Further, h\/k =514K for this transition, very large relative to typical temperatures in giant molecular clouds (1020K). The next pure rotational transition is J=42 at 12m, which has h\/k 1200 K. The generally high energies of the first excited states of H2 means that we expect negligible H2 emission unless we are looking at unusually warm (500-1000K) H2 gas in proximity to hot stars or in regions of active star formation within or at the fringes of giant molecular clouds. Contrast this situation with the CO J=10 line at =2.6mm where h\/k=5.53K and the molecule, which is easily excited by H2 or HI collisions at temperatures of T=1020K more typical of the cores of giant molecular clouds. In general, H2 is only directly observable as 1. Absorption at Far-UV wavelengths in the diffuse ISM along sight lines toward nearby stars in the Lyman and Werner band electronic transitions. These lines arise in both cold and warm H2. This is our only direct probe of the cold H2 gas that makes up most of the ISM. 2. Emission by Infrared rotational-vibrational transitions in the electronic ground state of H2 at wavelengths between 1 and 28m in relatively warm regions. The molecular gas must be warm (500-2000K), excited either by shocks, outflows, or UV fluorescence from nearby stars. We will examine each of these below.\nUV Lyman & Werner Bands\nH2 consists of 2 hydrogen atoms linked by a covalent bond (i.e., sharing electron pairs between the atoms). The lowest energy states of H2 are shown in the figure below from Field, Somerville, & Dressler [1966, ARAA, 4, 207]. Subject to the usual selection rules for permitted electronic transitions (=0,1; S=0) and symmetry constraints on H2, there are two sets of allowed transitions out of the H2 ground state:\nLyman Bands: E>11.2eV, <1108 (first band head)\n+ X 1 + B 1 u g\nWerner Bands: E>12.3eV, <1008 (first band head)\nX 1 + C 1 u g\nExcitation into higher electronic states of H2 requires photons with wavelengths shortward of 800. Since these photons are more likely to ionize HI (<912), these higher electronic transitions are generally suppressed. A complete list of transition probabilities and oscillator strengths for these\nV-10\nInterstellar Molecules\nbands is given by Morton & Dinerstein 1976 [ApJ, 204, 1]. In all, the Lyman and Werner bands arising from the J=07 rotational levels in the ground vibrational state comprise nearly 400 absorption lines between 912 and 1120. An analogous set of HD (Deuterated Molecular Hydrogen) bands, shifted in wavelength, are also observed in this part of the spectrum. These, together with the HI and DI Lyman-series absorption lines, are potentially powerful diagnostics of atomic and molecular Hydrogen in the diffuse interstellar medium, a potential which until recently has gone unrealized.\nElectronic states of H2, from Field, Somerville & Dressler (1966)\nThe electronic absorption bands of H2 occur in the Far-UV part of the spectrum inaccessible with either IUE or HST. Interstellar Lyman and Werner bands were first observed with the Copernicus satellite in 1974 (cf. Spitzer & Jenkins 1975, ARAA, 13, 133). Copernicus had very low sensitivity and could only detect these bands along relatively diffuse (e.g., AV<1) lines of sight (e.g., towards Puppis), although it did provide exceptional data. Later short-duration missions (IMAPS and ORFEUS) in the 1990s used small telescopes and their observations of the H2 bands were limited to bright stars with relatively low line-of-sight extinction, and only a few targets due to their short mission times. Sounding rockets were used to study specific targets for very brief times. This all changed with the launch of the FUSE satellite in June 1999. FUSE is ~105 times more sensitive than Copernicus in the Far-UV band, and has produced must of the best data on the H2 Lyman and Werner band absorption to date. This sensitivity has also allowed extension of these observations to so-called translucent line of sight, those with AV>1 mag (e.g., Snow et al. 2000, ApJ, 538, L65, Rachford et al. 2001, ApJ, 555, 839 & 2002, ApJ, 577, 221). This particular study was one of the key projects for the FUSE mission.\nV-11\nInterstellar Molecules\nFUSE spectra of H2 Lyman\/Werner absorption bands along a translucent line of sight [From Rachford et al. 2002]\nThese absorption lines are the only way at present to directly detect the cold H2 gas that makes up most of the ISM. The limitations of these bands as ISM diagnostics are the same as for the UV atomic absorption lines, namely that information is confined to particular lines of sight back lit by strong UV sources (e.g., OB stars or AGNs) with sufficiently low extinction that the UV light from the background source can be detected. However, because these absorption lines of H2 are so strong, the H2 Lyman\/Werner bands have been seen along every line of sight where FUSE has observed, in fact they are often a foreground nuisance when observing extragalactic lines of sight, and in choosing targets one must take care not to pick sight lines where the strongest H2 lines are expected to be saturated, as the redshifted lines of interest in, for example, an AGN have been known to fall into these bands. The FUSE translucent cloud study produced direct measurements of the H2 column densities from the J=0 and J=1 transitions along lines of sight to more than 40 early-type stars with AV>1. Combined with earlier Copernicus data for diffuse lines of sight, the following general conclusions can be made: 1. The kinetic temperature of the H2 gas range between ~50100K, with a mean value around 70K. This temperature is uncorrelated with the amount extinction along a line of sight, but hotter H2 gas can be found among diffuse lines of sight (i.e., there is greater scatter in Tkin, extending to higher temperatures), with cooler temperatures prevailing in regions where the H2 column density becomes large enough for self shielding to become important. 2. The molecular fraction f H 2 = 2 N H 2 \/(2 N H 2 + N HI ) is low (<104) for sight lines with\nE(BV)<0.08, then it increases abruptly to >0.01 because of the onset of self-shielding, and rises to as high as 0.8 with considerable scatter in translucent sight lines. Nowhere, however, does the molecular fraction get as large as 90% as expected by earlier theoretical models. 3. While there is no detailed correlation between the molecular fraction and color excess or RV, the available data show that f H 2 is well correlated with the density-sensitive fractional CN abundance, the width of the 2175 bump, and the slope of the far-UV extinction, and a\nV-12\nInterstellar Molecules\ngeneral trend for f H 2 to be anticorrelated with the kinetic temperature (hotter H2 gas has a smaller molecular fraction). The relations with temperature and density are unsurprising: colder, denser clouds are expected to have a higher molecular fraction. The H2 electronic bands can, in principle, be seen in emission from the radiative cascade that would follow absorption of photons in the Lyman- and Werner bands. This would be most observable near regions with strong UV fluorescent excitation of H2 (see below). In particular, there have been observations of emission-lines from high-lying Werner bands in the 1150-1950 region accessible with IUE by Witt et al. 1989 [ApJ, 336, L21] towards a cold molecular cloud (the reflection nebula IC63), and by Schwartz et al. towards warm H2 in Herbig-Haro objects (shocks associated with jetlike outflows from young stellar objects).\nNear-Infrared Vibrational Rotational Emission Lines\nWithin the electronic ground state of H2, all of the vibrational and rotational transitions are forbidden by the dipole selection rules. This means that the P- (J=1) and R- (J=+1) branches of H2 do not occur, but transitions in the O- (J=2), Q- (J=0), and S- (J=+2) branches can occur and are observed in the near- and mid-infrared. The first vibrational-rotational transition in the H2 ground state is the v=00S(0) transition, which is the J=20 transition at =28.2m. All other vibrational-rotational transitions in the ground state have increasing energy (and shorter ). Pure rotational lines (vu=vl) span the 3.4 to 28m region, while v=1 vibrational-rotational transitions have typical energies of ~0.5eV and are found in the 14m region clustering around 2m. Typical transition probabilities are ~107 108 sec1, so these lines are strongly forbidden.\nISO spectrum of Orion H2 Peak 1 from 2-40m showing a wealth of H2 vibrational and rotational emission lines [Rosenthal et al. 2000, A&A, 356, 705]\nThe notation used for these lines is: vu vl O(J l ); for J= 2 vu vl Q(J l ); for J=0 vu vl S(J l ); for J= + 2\nV-13\nInterstellar Molecules\nFor example, the 10S(1) emission line at =2.1218m in the Near-IR arises from a transition between the (v,J)=(1,3) upper level and the (v,J)=(0,1) lower level in the electronic ground state of H2. H2 has two spin isomers: Para-Hydrogen with the proton spins anti-parallel, corresponding to the even-numbered J states, and Ortho-Hydrogen with the proton spins parallel, corresponding to oddnumbered J states. The ortho-to-para ratio is 3.0 for thermalized level populations (75% ortho-H2 and 25% para-H2). Because only J=0,2 radiative transitions can occur, radiative transitions between the various rotational-vibrational levels in the ground state will preserve the ortho- or parastate of the molecules, and so one speaks of separate ortho and para energy ladders within the ground electronic state. Deviations from the predicted ortho-to-para ratio of 3 are primarily caused radiative de-excitation from the excited Lyman- or Werner-bands into ortho or para ladders in the ground state, and thus observations of different ortho-to-para ratios is taken as a sign of fluorescent excitation by UV photons. Because the rotational-vibrational states have typical transition energies of 0.5eV, they require excitation temperatures of ~1000 K. Since the kinetic temperature of typical cold molecular clouds is at most a few 10s of Kelvins, this means that you will only see these lines in regions that are unusually energetic. There are three basic mechanisms for exciting the NIR rotational-vibrational emission lines of H2 in nebulae: 1. Collisional Excitation: This primarily affects the low-J levels of H2. Hydrodynamic shocks with velocities of >6 km\/sec are the principal cause of strong collisional excitation, but if the velocity is >25 km\/sec, the shock will destroy (dissociate) H2. 2. UV Fluorescence: Radiative excitation of the Lyman and Werner bands by UV photons is followed by radiative de-excitation into excited states of the ground level which pumps the populations of the excited states. 3. Formation Excitation: Excitation of low-lying states as a by-product of molecular formation on grains due to the redistribution of binding energy between heating of the grain surface, kinetic energy of the ejected molecule, and internal excitation of the newly-formed H2. We shall consider each of these in turn.\nCollisional Excitation\nH2 molecules are subject to collisions in a variety of astrophysical environments, particularly in regions with hydrodynamic shocks such as jets from young stellar objects, stellar winds impinging upon interstellar clouds, or shocks in supernova remnants. Because the first (v=1) vibrational excited state of H2 lies ~0.5eV above the ground state (corresponding to E\/k6000K), temperatures above ~1000K are required to collisionally excite the low-lying vibrational levels of H2. Because the dissociation rate of H2 increases very rapidly with temperature, molecular gas hotter than 4000-5000K will either rapidly dissociate into HI or cool dramatically (H2 dissociation is a very efficient cooling mechanism). As such, most collisional excitation of H2 will occur for molecular gas in a very narrow range of a few thousand Kelvins. Models of shocks show that the excitation of the low-J states responsible for the observed rotationalvibration levels occurs if the shock speed is faster than ~6 km\/sec, with an excitation efficiency that scales roughly like n0v3, where n0 is the pre-shock density and v is the shock speed. At shock speeds >25 km\/sec, the shock heating results in dissociated into atomic Hydrogen, but one may still get excitation due to re-formation behind the shock as the post-shock gas and dust grains cool off.\nV-14\nInterstellar Molecules\nBecause of the narrow range of excitation temperatures between the lower threshold and the upper dissociation\/cooling threshold, collisionally excited H2 is characterized by strong lines of low vibrational levels (v<4), with rapidly decreasing level populations with increasing energy levels. In the high-density limit where collisional excitation and de-excitation will dominate, the relative H2 vibrational-rotational level populations nv,J are characterized by a thermalized Boltzmann population:\nE exp v, J gJ kT where gJ is the statistical weight of the level, Ev,J is the energy of the upper level, and T is the kinetic temperature of the gas. For odd-numbered J-levels (ortho-H2), the statistical weight is:\nnv , J\ng J = 3(2 J + 1) while for the even-numbered J-levels (para-H2), the statistical weight is gJ = 2J +1 The standard analysis for the rotational-vibrational states of H2 is to create an Excitation Diagram that plots the emission line data as ln(nv,J\/gJ) as a function of (Ev,J\/k). The line strengths are usually expressed relative to a strong H2 line like the v=10S(1) 2.1218m line. If the level populations are thermalized, they will all lie along a straight-line locus in this diagram with a slope inversely proportional to the excitation temperature of the gas. An example excitation diagram for a collisionally excited region in the starburst galaxy NGC6240 is shown below.\nExcitation diagram for near-IR H2 lines in NGC6240 (unpublished OSIRIS data)\nIf a range of temperatures occurs along the line of sight (e.g., your sight line integrates through the cooling region behind a shock), the diagram will show a smoothly curving locus of points, with lower energy levels lying along a steeply sloped (lower T) curve, with more highly-excited levels lying along a flatter-sloped curve because these levels are only excited at higher temperatures. An example of this is shown below for the bright near-IR H2 peak in the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC Peak 1) from Everett, DePoy & Pogge 1995 [AJ, 110, 1295]. The curves are fits assuming a power-law cooling function responsible for the range of temperatures observed. As advertised, the low-lying levels have a steeper slope (lower excitation temperature) than the high-lying levels (shallower slope, hence higher excitation temperature).\nV-15\nInterstellar Molecules\nExcitation Diagram for near-IR H2 emission lines in Orion H2 Peak 1 [Everett et al. 1995]\nAt lower densities, radiative de-excitation from excited rotational-vibrational states becomes important for determining the relative H2 level populations. Because each energy level has a different critical density, you to need specify both the density and temperature to estimate the equilibrium H2 populations. Such level populations will not be thermalized per se, and the temperature derived from the slope of the data in the excitation diagram is more correctly an excitation temperature rather than a reasonable approximation of the kinetic temperature. Which colliding species dominates (atoms or other molecules) determines the densities at which the observed relative level populations will deviate from the predicted high-density thermalized (nearLTE) populations. This is because each different collider has a different critical density associated with it. In purely molecular regions where H2-H2 collisions dominate, the critical densities are relatively high: 1056 cm3. In partially atomic gas, H0-H2 collisions begin to dominate when the atomic fraction is H0\/H2>0.01 because the critical densities for H0-H2 collisions are about 2 order of magnitude lower than for H2-H2 collisions. In this case, the level populations will fall below the LTE predictions at densities of ~103 cm3. In either case, where a sufficient number of Near-IR H2 lines have been observed to make these subtle deviations evident, detailed level calculations are required to fully understand them (see Martin, Schwarz & Mandy 1996 ApJ, 461, 256, and Everett 1997, ApJ, 478, 246).\nFluorescent Excitation\nIn the interstellar medium, H2 in the electronic ground state can be excited into the first or second electronic excited states by absorption of a UV photon in the Lyman or Werner bands, respectively. Excitation is followed by radiative de-excitation back into the electronic ground state. On average, ~12% of the excited H2 molecules will de-excite into the dissociation bands (v>13) of the ground state, destroying the molecule (see below). The remaining, however, de-excite into bound levels of the ground electronic state which at low densities will cascade downwards into the v=0 level by radiative de-excitation through the forbidden rotational-vibrational transitions described before. At very high densities (>105 cm3, the critical densities of the rotational-vibrational states), the populations of these excited states can be redistributed by collisions before de-excitation into the v=0 level. Similarly at high UV flux densities multiple fluorescent excitations can redistribute the excited ground-level populations.\nV-16\nInterstellar Molecules\nIn addition to fluorescence by absorption of Far-UV continuum photons, the 12R(6) and 12P(5) transitions in the H2 Lyman band are in near-resonance with the HI Lyman- line at Doppler shifts of +15 and +100 km\/sec respectively. Strong shocks can produce significant Lyman- emission, which in turn can fluorescently pump H2. This has been implicated as a possible source of warm H2 emission at the working surfaces of jets emerging from Young Stellar Objects (e.g., Wolfire & Knigl 1991 ApJ, 383, 205). Because the rotational state of the molecule changes very little during excitation and de-excitation (only J=0,2 transitions can occur), the rotational level populations will reflect the rotational state of the original gas being illuminated by UV radiation, whereas collisions can result in rotational mixing. In general, the spectral signatures of low-density fluorescent excitation of H2 are threefold: 1. Significant population of high-lying (v>4) vibrational levels that are rarely populated by collisions as they have sufficiently small Boltzmann factors that make these higher vibrational states relatively inaccessible. 2. Excitation temperatures for rotational states within a given vibrational level (rotation temperatures) are lower than the excitation temperatures among vibrational levels at a given rotational state (vibrational temperatures). In collisionally excited systems, rotational and vibrational temperatures are the same. The effect of this is to split the simple locus in the excitation diagram into separate curves by vibrational level. 3. The populations of even-numbered rotational states (para-H2) are enhanced relative to oddnumbered states (ortho-H2), in the sense that the observed ortho-to-para ratio will be smaller than the value of 3 expected for a thermalized population. An example of an excitation diagram for fluorescently-excited H2 gas in the reflection nebula NGC 7023 from Martini et al. 1997 [ApJ, 484, 296] is shown below.\nExcitation diagram of fluorescent H2 lines in NGC 7023 (adapted from Martini et al. 1997)\nThe effects of fluorescent excitation are most dramatic among the high vibrational levels (v=5, 6, and 7) that occur primarily in the 11.8m region (J and H-bands) and are unlikely to be significantly populated by collisions. The spectral signature of fluorescently excited H2 emission has been observed in reflection nebulae (Hayashi et al. 1985 MNRAS 215, 31P, Sellgren 1986 ApJ, 305, 399; Martini, Sellgren & Hora 1997, ApJ, 484, 296; Martini, Sellgren, & DePoy 1997, ApJ, 484, 296), and planetary nebulae (Dinerstein et al. 1988 ApJ 327, L27).\nV-17\nInterstellar Molecules\nThe signatures of fluorescent excitation, however, can be effectively erased at high densities when collisions start to become important. If the density is high enough (>1045 cm3), collisions can thermalize the level populations, resulting in excitation diagrams that more closely resemble shockheated H2, even when UV fluorescence is important. The effect of collisions is to quickly de-populate the high vibrational levels whose lines are usually an unambiguous signature of fluorescent excitation. The converse, however, does not occur: there is no convincing combination of effects that will cause a collisionally excited region to emit like a fluorescently excitation region. In any case, the detailed predictions of fluorescent excitation models depend sensitively on the density, temperature, UV radiation field intensity & spectrum, H2 formation\/reformation processes etc. Classic fluorescent models are those of Black & van Dishoeck (1987 ApJ, 322, 412) and Draine & Bertoldi (1996, ApJ, 468, 269). These are the ones that are most often compared with observations.\nFormation Excitation\nH2 molecules form most efficiently on the surfaces of dust grains. Upon formation, the 4.5eV binding energy must be distributed into kinetic energy (after breaking the bond with the grain surface), heating of the dust grain at the formation site, and internal energy in the form of excitation of rotationalvibrational states within the electronic ground state. The exact distribution of energy depends on the details of formation that are fundamentally unknown, and so formation excitation is difficult to assess observationally. An example is higher-than-expected excitation temperatures in H2 Lyman-Werner bands observed in absorption towards stars (e.g., Spitzer & Zweibel 1974, ApJ, 191, L127). Some models have tried to include formation excitation in an ad-hoc way. For example the models of Black & van Dishoeck (1987) considered three different distribution functions in which (1) 1.5eV was distributed among the rotational-vibrational levels following the Boltzmann distribution, (2) all H2 molecules from in the v=14, J=0,1 levels, and (3) all H2 molecules form in the v=6 level with low-J states. These are then used as inputs in computing the emergent spectrum (see Black & van Dishoeck 1987 and Le Bourlot et al. 1995 ApJ, 449, 178 for examples).\nFormation of H2\nThere are two primary ways that H2 can be formed in the gas-phase. The first is Direct Radiative Attachment in which two H atoms collide to form H2 followed by radiation of the excess 4.5eV binding energy as photons:\nH 0 + H 0 H2 +\nAfter the H0-H0 collision the binding energy is converted into internal energy (excitation of rotationalvibrational levels of the ground state) in newly-formed H2 molecule. Because these transitions are highly forbidden, with small Einstein A coefficients, radiation of the binding energy very inefficient, and the molecule is much more likely to dissociate before it relaxes. The rate coefficient for radiative attachment is <1023 cm3 s1, so this mechanism is much too slow and inefficient to form H2 in sufficient quantities to be important in the ISM. Three-body processes, in which three H0 atoms collide and the third H0 atom carries off the excess binding energy, are similarly unlikely at ISM densities, though they have been proposed as a way to form H2 in protoplanetary disks. The second gas-phase mechanism is Associative Detachment, which was first proposed by McDowell [1961, The Observatory, 81, 240] and given its classic treatment by Dalgarno & McCray [1973, ApJ, 181, 95]. H 0 + e H + h\nH + H 0 H 2 + e\nV-18\nInterstellar Molecules\nThe first reaction, Radiative Association, is slow, having a temperature-dependent rate coefficient of ~1018 T cm3 s1. The second reaction, Associative Detachment, is much faster with a nearly temperature-independent rate coefficient of ~1.3109 cm3 s1, though this step will have to compete with photodissociation of H which has a rate of ~2.4107 s1 for diffuse clouds exposed to the ISRF. The combined volumetric H2 formation rate for this mechanism is approximately\ndnH 2 dt\nxe T n n cm 3 s 1 7.5 1023 4 H H 0 100K 1.4 10\nOverall, this mechanism is also very inefficient at forming H2 in the ISM, especially at low temperatures (though it is about an order of magnitude faster than direct radiative attachment). While too slow to explain the observed abundances of H2 in the present-day ISM, it may be important in the early universe when no metals, and hence no dust grains, were present, but the gas was hotter (larger T) and there were copious electrons present from partial ionization of H0 (larger xe) The currently favored H2 formation mechanism is Grain-Surface Catalysis, first described by McCrae & McNally [1960, MNRAS, 121, 238] and given its classic treatment by Gould & Salpeter [1963, ApJ, 138, 393]. An H atom colliding with a dust grain will have a certain probability of sticking to the surface, provided that it is not moving too fast (e.g., as in a hot HI gas) and that the grains themselves are not too hot, which makes the surfaces energetically less sticky. Once the H atom has been adsorbed by the grain surface, it will migrate around until it reaches a site on the grain surface where it is more tightly bound by either chemisorption (i.e., bound by valence forces with surface materials) or physisorption (i.e., bound by intermolecular van der Waals forces). Such sites act as sinks for H atoms. It is while trapped in this site that the atom is likely to encounter another H atom, and the two can react to form H2, distributing the 4.5eV of binding energy into (1) heating of the dust grain, (2) breaking the activation barrier at the formation site and ejecting the newly-formed H2 molecule from the surface (desorption), and (3) internal vibrational energy (excited ground states) that is later radiated away by the molecule as rotational-vibrational emission lines. The volumetric rate of dust-catalyzed H2 formation is given by:\ndnH 2 = Rd nH nH 0 dt where nH is the total density of hydrogen of all forms (nH=nH0+2nH2), nH0 is the density of neutral atomic hydrogen, and R is a rate coefficient with units of cm3 s1 that depends on the temperature of the atoms and grains and the fraction of atoms that can adhere to the grain:\n1 8kT Rd = m 2 H\n1\/2\nda n\n1 dngr 2 a (a) H da\nHere (a) is the probability of sticking to a grain of size a. In general, it appears that all H atoms will stick to grains if their speeds are <2km\/sec, provided that the grain temperatures are between ~20100K. If the grains are too hot, the adsorbed atoms will evaporate off the grain surface before they can find another H atom and form H2. From observations of the fraction of H2 towards nearby stars using Far-UV measurements of the Lyman-Werner bands, the H2 formation rate coefficient is estimated to be Rd131017 cm3 s1, implying a mean sticking fraction of 0.06 for typical interstellar conditions and the observed dust\/gas ratio. Draine & Bertoldi [1996, ApJ, 468, 269] quote Rd=61018T1\/2 cm3 s1. Thus while very small grains have most the total grain surface area, they are expected to be less effective as H2\nV-19\nInterstellar Molecules\nformation sites, and most molecular formation thus occurs on larger grains. In some sense this is not surprising, as the smaller the grain becomes, the longer the timescale between H-atom collisions. The H-atom impact timescale\na tHI 810 s 0.01m\n4\n2\nnH 30 cm3\n1\nT 100K\n1\/ 2\nFor typical interstellar conditions, tHI is of order the photon absorption time. As we saw in the previous section on Dust, the absorption of a single photon by a small grain can cause rapid stochastic heating of the grain. Thus in the time it takes 2 H atoms to collide with and stick to a small grain it is very likely that a photon will be absorbed with enough energy to kick off the one or both of the hydrogen atoms, effectively suppressing H2 formation on tiny grains. Such photons have a less dramatic effect on the temperatures of large grains, and so photosuppression of H2 formation will be less effective. The corresponding timescale for H2 formation on grains, tH2 is:\nt H 2 109 nH1 years\nFor typical interstellar cold interstellar clouds where densities are of order 104 cm3 it is possible to convert most of the HI into H2 in as little as 105 years. Interstellar shocks may speed up this process by making the gas warmer and denser, provided the shocks are not so strong as to destroy the grains or the newly formed molecules. Some other important papers on H2 formation on grains are Hollenbach & Salpeter 1971 [ApJ, 163, 155] and Hollenbach & McKee 1979 [ApJS, 41, 555], and discussion in Draine & Bertoldi 1996 [ApJ, 468, 269].\nDestruction of H2 Molecules\nH2 molecules can be destroyed collisions and by UV photons (photodissociation). Collisional dissociation occurs at temperatures >4000 K, when collisions with HI can excite H2 into the unbound v>13 vibrational states. Photodissociation of H2 occurs when UV photons (either from a nearby star of the ISRF) are absorbed with sufficient energy to unbind the molecule. There are two possible processes for photodissociation:\nDirect Photodissociation from the electronic ground state: An H2 molecule in the X1g+ ground state should dissociate if it absorbs a photon with an energy >14.7eV (<850). The problem with this mechanism is that there are two processes competing for these photons. The first is HI ionization (threshold of 13.6eV, =912), which has a higher cross-section, so such photons are more likely to photoionize HI than dissociate H2. Second, the threshold for photoionization of H2 to H2+ out of the ground state is h>15.5eV (<804), which also has a larger cross-section than photodissociation. Thus while direct photodissociation can occur, it is very inefficient. UV Fluorescent Photodissociation This is a two-step process in which absorption of Lyman- or Werner-band UV photons is followed by radiative de-excitation into ground state vibrational continuum bands which have vibration quantum numbers v>13. These high vibrational levels are unbound and the molecule dissociates, converting binding energy into the kinetic energy of the now free H0 atoms. On average ~12% of all radiative decays following absorption in the Lyman- and Werner-bands\nV-20\nInterstellar Molecules\nresults in fluorescent dissociation of H2. This is the dominant mechanism for H2 photodissociation in the ISM. Classic papers describing these H2 destruction are Dalgarno & Roberge [1979, ApJ, 233, L25 for collisional dissociation] and Black & Dalgarno [1976, ApJ, 203, 132 for photodissociation]. The rate of photodissociation via Lyman\/Werner band fluorescence is\ndiss = 4 J k d\nwhere 4J is the strength of the radiation field (e.g., the ISRF in the diffuse ISM), k is the fraction of Lyman\/Werner band excitations that are followed by de-excitation into the vibrational continuum band and lead to dissociation of H2 (k0.12 for the ISRF), and is the cross-section for LymanWerner fluorescence\n= i i\ni\nwhere the sum is over all Lyman\/Werner bands with h <13.6eV (i.e., absorptions arising from photons less energetic than the HI ionization potential). The rate of H2 destruction via this process is dnH 2 dt\n= diss nH 2\nIn the diffuse ISM, equilibrium between grain formation and fluorescent photodissociation occurs when Rd nH nH 0 diss nH 2 For typical values of the rate coefficients in the diffuse ISM, diss5.51011 s1, and so the fraction of H2 relative to Hydrogen of all forms in the diffuse ISM is roughly nH 2 nH\n1.1 107 T 1\/2 nH\nIn the diffuse ISM, the time to achieve equilibrium should be of order 1\/diss, which is ~600 years for typical conditions. We thus expect that in the diffuse ISM, the fractional abundance of H2 that we observe along virtually all sightlines is in equilibrium.\nSelf-Shielding\nAt H2 column densities >1014 cm2 the Lyman\/Werner UV absorption line bands start to become optically thick, and H2 becomes self-shielding in the sense that all of the photons that could lead to UV fluorescent photodissociation are absorbed by H2 in the outer layers of the cloud, effectively shielding the H2 within it. The rate of H2 photodissociation thus depends on the abundance and state of excitation of the H2 as you go into the cloud. Self-shielding occurs in diffuse clouds exposed to the ISRF or in dense clouds in proximity to sources of UV photons (e.g., reflection nebulae around earlytype stars or HII regions and PNe). Dust can also absorb UV photons, further limiting the process, but as we will see it dominates only when the local UV radiation field is unusually intense relative to the density of the cloud. Self-shielding makes H2 a very robust molecule, allowing it to exist even in the UV radiation field of the diffuse ISM.\nV-21\nInterstellar Molecules\nThe H2 photodissociation rate in the presence of dust opacity and H2 self-shielding is\ndiss = 0e\ngr\nf shield ( N H 2 )\nwhere 0 is the dissociation rate at the cloud surface, gr is the dust grain optical depth, and fshield is the self-shielding factor, which Draine & Bertoldi [1996, ApJ, 468, 269] estimated as\n1 = N H 3\/4 2 N0 for N H 2 < 1014 cm 2 for 1014 N H 2 < 1021 cm 2\nf shield\nBelow the threshold column density of N0=1014 cm2 there is no self-shielding, whereas above it selfshielding scales as the H2 column density to the 3\/4 power. The strong dependence on column density means we expect there to be a very sharp-edged transition between atomic and molecular gas regions as we go into a molecular cloud, much in the same way that we saw an abrupt transition between ionized and neutral gas in HII regions. This can be seen as follows. In steady state, H2 destruction is balanced by H2 formation\ndiss nH = Rd nH nH\n2\n0\nAssuming low dust opacity and recalling that nH=nH0+2nH2, the steady-state density of H2 is\nnH 2\n3\/4 0 N0 = nH + 2 3\/4 Rd nH N H 2 1\nSince column density (N) and total density (n) are related by dN=n ds, we can rewrite this to solve for the approximate H2 column density: N H2 and the H2 abundance, XH2 X H2 = dN H 2 dN H R n N = 4 d H H 4 0 N 0\n4 3\nR n N = d H H N0 4 0 N 0\n4\n4\nThe result is that there is a very sharp transition between neutral atomic hydrogen (H0) and molecular hydrogen (H2) going into a region of steady-state photodissociation because of the effect of selfshielding. The mid-point of the transition will occur when the gas is half atomic and half molecular which occurs when XH2=1\/4. This transition point occurs at a column density of N diss\nG 3.7 10 0 nH\n22\n4 \/3\ncm 2\nwhere G0 is the mean intensity of the ISRF and taking Rd=31017 cm3 s1, the upper end of the range quoted above. Dust opacity starts to become important when A11001 hence NH21020 cm2. This means that the onset of H2 self-shielding will determine the location of the H2\/H0 transition for (G0\/n)<0.02 cm3, which is generally true of molecular clouds illuminated by the ISRF. Near OB starforming regions or reflection nebulae in proximity to UV-bright stars, however, (G0\/n)~1 cm3, and dust opacity, not self-shielding, determines the location of the molecular\/atomic transition which works out to be a depth where AV=2 going into the molecular cloud.\nV-22\nInterstellar Molecules\nV-3 Observed Properties of Molecular Clouds\nIn this section we will briefly review some of the properties of giant molecular clouds as derived primarily from observations of tracer molecules like CO. This is a research area that has become increasingly active as new and better millimeter techniques; especially millimeter interferometry and sub-millimeter imaging (e.g., SCUBA) have come into use. A thorough review of the current literature would be beyond the scope of this course, but this should give you an idea of some of the more common results quoted in recent and previous papers.\nCloud Structure\nLocal density estimates using line ratios often give larger densities than global mean densities found by averaging the observed molecular column densities along the line of sight. The interpretation of this is that the clouds are very clumpy, with the dense cores having typical sizes of <1 pc or smaller, and densities >106 cm3. The overall cloud itself extends for 320 pc on average, with a mean density of 1034 cm3. Some molecular clouds (most?) have a number of discernable cores. These are often detected as sources of molecular lines with high critical densities (e.g., CS), while the general cloud is mapped using lines of lower critical density (chiefly CO). Within the galaxies, molecular clouds are most often seen organized into complexes with sizes from 20 to 100pc, and overall H2 masses of 1046 Msun. The distinction between clouds and complexes in terms of sizes and masses is somewhat artificial. A more precise statement is that we see a wide range of structures, from single small clouds to large complexes of clouds, with many complexes arrayed along the spiral arms of the Galaxy.\nCloud Masses\nOne way to estimate the mass of a molecular cloud is to integrate the column density across the face of the cloud by mapping it with millimeter interferometry. A common alternative that is used is to assume that the cloud is only supported against its own gravity by internal thermal pressure. In this case the characteristic length scale within the cloud is the Jeans Length:\nkT RJ 2 Gn\n1\n2\nAssuming that the clouds are spherical, the mass will be the Jeans Mass: 4 3 RJ C 18M sunT 1.5 n 0.5 3 where T is the kinetic temperature in K, and n is the density in cm3. If the cloud is supported against gravity by random turbulent velocities with a characteristic velocity dispersion of v, you can define a Virial Mass for the cloud R M vir v 2 G Where R is the radius of the cloud, and v is the velocity dispersion of an optically thin emission line (e.g., the 13CO J=10 line). The assumption here is that the observed velocity dispersion is just the amount needed to virialize the cloud. Computation of a virial mass requires that you can resolve the cloud (measure R). A more sophisticated analysis assumes that the cloud has a radial density profile, rathe 871, Autumn 2008, Problem Set 3Due Thursday, October 30Problem 1 A radiation-bounded nebula is one in which all of the ionizing photons are absorbed within the ionized volume, and the ionization equilibrium is found by balancing the total\n\nNotes on the NotesThese lecture notes have been distilled from hand-written notes compiled while teaching Astronomy 871, Physics of the Interstellar Medium, during 4 quarters between 1993 and 1999, and recently revived for teaching it again during S\n\nI Introduction to the Interstellar MediumThe Interstellar Medium is anything not in starsDonald Osterbrock [1984 Jan 13 authors UCSC course notes].

{"text":"Combined with newborn stars.\n: a spiral galaxy around 30 thousand light-years across located only about 21 million light-years beyond the stars of the Milky Way. Along with prominent dust lanes and a bright central core, this colorful composite image highlights youthful blue star clusters and reddish stellar nurseries that trace the galaxy's spiral arms. The high resolution galaxy portrait is a mosaic of data from Hubble's sharp ACS camera combined with groundbased color image data. M106 (aka NGC 4258) is a nearby example of the Seyfert class of active galaxies, seen across the spectrum from radio to X-rays. Energetic active galaxies are powered by matter falling into a massive central black hole.\n\nStars, like bees, swarm around the center of bright globular cluster M15. This ball of over 100,000 stars is a relic from the early years of our Galaxy, and continues to orbit the Milky Way's center. M15, one of about 150 globular clusters remaining, is noted for being easily visible with only binoculars, having at its center one of the densest concentrations of stars known, and containing a high abundance of variable stars and pulsars. This sharp image, taken by the Earth-orbiting Hubble Space Telescope, spans about 120 light years. It shows the dramatic increase in density of stars toward the cluster's center. M15 lies about 35,000 light years away toward the constellation of the Winged Horse (Pegasus). Recent evidence indicates that a massive black hole might reside as the center of M15.\n\nSome spiral galaxies are seen almost sideways. NGC 3190, one such galaxy, is the largest member of the Hickson 44 Group, one of the nearer groups of galaxies to our own Local Group of galaxies. Pictured above, finely textured dust lanes surround the brightly glowing center of this picturesque spiral. Gravitational tidal interactions with other members of its group have likely caused the spiral arms of NGC 3190 to appear asymmetric around the center, while the galactic disk also appears warped. NGC 3190 spans about 75,000 light years across and is visible with a small telescope toward the constellation of the Lion (Leo).\n\nIn 1787, astronomer William Herschel discovered the Eskimo Nebula. From the ground, NGC 2392 resembles a person's head surrounded by a parka hood. In 2000, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged the Eskimo Nebula. From space, the nebula displays gas clouds so complex they are not fully understood. The Eskimo Nebula is clearly a planetary nebula, and the gas seen above composed the outer layers of a Sun-like star only 10,000 years ago. The inner filaments visible above are being ejected by strong wind of particles from the central star. The outer disk contains unusual light-year long orange filaments. The Eskimo Nebula spans about 1\/3 of a light year and lies in our Milky Way Galaxy, about 3,000 light years distant, toward the constellation of the Twins (Gemini).\n\nSnow-capped stratovolcano Mt. Damavand climbs to 5,670 meters (18,598 feet) near the left edge in this panoramic view of the world at night. In the sky to the left of Damavand's peak are the stars of the Big Dipper in Ursa Major. Pan to the right and your gaze will sweep across the arch of our Milky Way Galaxy above the Alborz Mountain Range bordering the Caspian Sea. Near the center of the panorama, recorded in the predawn hours of April 4th, bright stars Deneb and Altair lie close to the curve of the Milky Way, above the glow of the Haraz valley. Farther right, brilliant Jupiter dominates the sky near the stars, nebulae, and dark dust clouds toward the bulging galactic center. Finally, the horizon glow at the right edge, below bright yellowish giant star Antares, is from the city of Damavand, named for the legendary mountain peak.\n\nGrand spiral galaxies often seem to get all the glory. Their newly formed, bright, blue star clusters along beautiful, symmetric spiral arms are guaranteed to attract attention. But small irregular galaxies form stars too, like NGC 4449, located about 12 million light-years away. The well-studied galaxy is similar in size, and often compared to our Milky Way's satellite galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This lovely color image shows NGC 4449's general bar shape, also characteristic of the LMC, with scattered young blue star clusters. Near the bottom is the pinkish glow of atomic hydrogen gas, the telltale tracer of massive star forming regions. NGC 4449 is a member of a group of galaxies found in the constellation Canes Venatici. In fact, interactions with nearby galaxies are thought to have influenced star formation in NGC 4449.\n\nWhy is Saturn partly blue? The above picture of Saturn approximates what a human would see if hovering close to the giant ringed world. The above picture was taken in mid-March by the robot Cassini spacecraft now orbiting Saturn. Here Saturn's majestic rings appear directly only as a thin vertical line. The rings show their complex structure in the dark shadows they create on the image left. Saturn's fountain moon Enceladus, only about 500 kilometers across, is seen as the bump in the plane of the rings. The northern hemisphere of Saturn can appear partly blue for the same reason that Earth's skies can appear blue -- molecules in the cloudless portions of both planet's atmospheres are better at scattering blue light than red. When looking deep into Saturn's clouds, however, the natural gold hue of Saturn's clouds becomes dominant. It is not known why southern Saturn does not show the same blue hue -- one hypothesis holds that clouds are higher there. It is also not known why Saturn's clouds are colored gold.\n\nIfComet Bradfield is easy to see on the left, but can you find Comet LINEAR on the right? Last week, just before sunrise from the northern hemisphere, two bright comets were visible in the same part of the sky at the same time. The above long-exposure image was taken on the morning of April 25 from Joshua Tree National Park in California, USA. Comet C\/2004 F4 (Bradfield) is giving an unexpectedly good show as it recedes from the Sun and Earth and fades from view. Its tail is estimated by some to be about 10 degrees long. Having just rounded the Sun itself, Comet C\/2002 T7 (LINEAR) is now moving toward the Earth. Although intrinsically fading, T7 will appear to brighten until about mid-May and so continue to be visible to the unaided eye before sunrise to southern hemisphere observers into June. Q4, the third coincidental naked eye comet, will become visible in mid-May to northern hemisphere observers.\n\nThe star cluster at lower right, cataloged as Hodge 301, is a denizen of the Tarantula Nebula. An evocative nebula in the southern sky, the sprawling cosmic Tarantula is an energetic star forming region some 168,000 light-years distant in our neighboring galaxy the Large Magellanic Cloud. The stars within Hodge 301 formed together tens of millions of years ago and as the massive ones quickly exhaust their nuclear fuel they explode. In fact, the giant stars of Hodge 301 are rapidly approaching this violent final phase of stellar evolution - known as a supernova. These supernova blasts send material and shock waves back into the nebular gas to create the Tarantula's glowing filaments also visible in this Hubble Space Telescope Heritage image. But these spectacular stellar death explosions signal star birth as well, as the blast waves condense gas and dust to ultimately form the next generation of stars inside the Tarantula Nebula.\n\nCones, pillars, and majestic flowing shapes abound in stellar nurseries where natal clouds of gas and dust are buffeted by energetic winds from newborn stars. A well-known example, the Cone Nebula within the bright galactic star-forming region NGC 2264, was captured in this close-up view from the Hubble Space Telescope's newest camera. While the Cone Nebula, about 2,500 light-years away in Monoceros, is around 7 light-years long, the region pictured here surrounding the cone's blunted head is a mere 2.5 light-years across. In our neck of the galaxy that distance is just over half way from the Sun to its nearest stellar neighbor, Alpha Centauri. The massive star NGC 2264 IRS, seen by Hubble's infrared camera in 1997, is the likely source of the wind sculpting the Cone Nebula and lies off the top of the image. The Cone Nebula's reddish veil is produced by glowing hydrogen gas.\n\nYou may think it's impossible to see through the Sun, but maps of the Sun's far side are now made routinely by instruments on board the sun-staring SOHO spacecraft. This is one such map from April 12. At right, is a map projection of calculated magnetic field strengths on the Earth-facing solar hemisphere with yellow and red indicating high magnetic fields characteristic of solar active regions. At left is a similar map of the solar hemisphere opposite planet Earth, which shows the large active region AR9393 as the 27-day solar rotation carried it across the far side. The largest sunspot group in a decade, AR9393 was easily seen as it tracked across the Sun's Earth-facing hemisphere in late March. When AR9393 swung around to the Sun's far side, SOHO's Michelson Doppler Interferometer (MDI) instrument continued to map its position by measuring changes in motions caused by solar sound waves - transmitted through the Sun and influenced by the active region's strong magnetic fields. Known as helioseismology, analyzing solar sound waves is like using seismological records of earthquakes to probe the interior of the Earth. On the Sun, sound waves are produced by turbulent convection cells seen on the surface as dynamic solar granules.\n\nDrifting through the stratosphere above Antarctica in late 1998, the balloon-borne BOOMERANG telescope peered into the cosmos at millimeter wavelengths. The blotchy structures it detected are seen above in the sharpest yet picture of the universe at an early age, perhaps a mere 300,000 years old. The false-color image shows subtle fluctuations in the temperature of the hot plasma which filled the universe before expansion cooled the material, producing the familiar stars and galaxies. Dramatically, the size of the fluctuations in the BOOMERANG image has convinced many cosmologists that the universe contains just exactly enough matter and energy to be flat -- a powerful prediction of the popular theory of Inflation which describes the earliest moments of the Big Bang. A flat universe will expand forever and two light rays which start out parallel will never spread or intersect. But all is not solved (!) as the BOOMERANG results don't show clearly details confirming the suspected amounts of dark matter and the cosmological constant.\n\nOne of the largest coherent structures on the sky is known simply as Loop I and can best be seen in radio and X-ray maps. Spanning over 100 degrees, part of Loop I appears so prominent in northern sky maps that it is known as the North Polar Spur (NPS). Loop I, shown above in X-ray light, is a thin bubble of gas about 700 light-years across with a center located only about 400 light-years away. Surprisingly, the cause of this immense structure is still debated, but is possibly related to expanding gas from a million-year old supernova. Loop I gas is impacting the nearby Aquila Rift molecular cloud, and may create relatively dense fragments of the local interstellar medium. Were our Sun to pass through one of these fragments in the next few million years, it might affect Earth's climate.\n\nHumans once walked on the Moon.

Many are images of a single, unusual, beaded, blue, ring-like galaxy which just happens to line-up behind a giant cluster of galaxies. Cluster galaxies here appear yellow and -- together with the cluster's dark matter -- act as a gravitational lens. A gravitational lens can create several images of background galaxies, analogous to the many points of light one would see while looking through a wine glass at a distant street light. The distinctive shape of this background galaxy -- which is probably just forming -- has allowed astronomers to deduce that it has separate images at 4, 8, 9 and 10 o'clock, from the center of the cluster. Possibly even the blue smudge just left of center is yet another image! This spectacular photo from HST was taken in October 1994. The first cluster lens was found unexpectedly by Roger Lynds (NOAO) and Vahe Petrosian (Stanford) in 1986 while testing a new type of imaging device. Lensed arcs around this cluster, CL0024+1654, were first discovered from the ground by David Koo (UCO Lick) in 1988.\n\nThis breathtaking patch of sky would be above you were you to stand at the south pole of the Earth. Just above and to the right of the photograph's center are the four stars that mark the boundaries of the famous Southern Cross. At the top of this constellation, also known as \"The Crux,\" is the orange star Gamma Crucis. The band of stars, dust, and gas crossing the middle of the photograph is part our Milky Way Galaxy. In the very center of the photograph is the dark Coal Sack Nebula, and the bright nebula on the far right is the Eta Carina Nebula. The southern cross is so famous a constellation that it is depicted on the Australian National Flag."}

It contains 10 times as many objects \u2013 such as galaxies, stars and nebulae \u2013 as the Palomar survey and scientists hope it will be used for decades to come by astronomers hunting for everything from dark matter to planets orbiting other stars.\n\n\"There are half a billion objects detected in this image,\" said David Weinberg, an astronomer at Ohio State University who worked on the SDSS image. \"About a quarter of a billion stars and a quarter of a billion galaxies.\"\n\nEach pixel contains data in five different colours of light. \"That's green, yellow, red, redder than red and bluer than blue.

This allowed the scientists to measure the distance to the objects, which was then used to infer a 3D map of their distribution.\n\n\"The goal is to understand why the expansion of the universe is speeding up \u2013 that is the biggest puzzle in cosmology today, because all of our experience is that ... things fall towards each other,\" said Weinberg. \"But, at the scale of the universe, gravity seems to be pushing things apart.

About 3.75 billion years from now, Andromeda's disk fills the field of view and its gravity begins to create tidal distortions in the Milky Way. The view is inspired by dynamical computer modeling of the future collision between the two galaxies. The two galaxies collide about 4 billion years from now and merge to form a single galaxy about 6 billion years from now. Credit: NASA\/ESA\/Z. Levay and R. van der Marel (STScI)\/A. Mellinger\n\nNASA astronomers announced Thursday, May 31, that they can now predict with certainty the next major cosmic event to affect our galaxy, the Sun, and the solar system: the titanic collision of our Milky Way Galaxy with the neighboring Andromeda Galaxy (M31).\n\nThe Milky Way is destined to get a major makeover during the encounter, which is predicted to happen 4 billion years from now. It is likely that the Sun will be flung into a new region of our galaxy, but Earth and the solar system are in no danger of being destroyed.\n\n\"Our findings are statistically consistent with a head-on collision between the Andromeda Galaxy and our Milky Way Galaxy,\" said Roeland van der Marel from the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland. The solution came through painstaking NASA Hubble Space Telescope measurements of the motion of Andromeda from STScI.\n\nThe scenario is like a baseball batter watching an oncoming fastball. Although Andromeda is approaching us more than 2 thousand times faster, it will take 4 billion years before the strike.\n\nComputer simulations derived from Hubble's data show that it will take an additional 2 billion years after the encounter for the interacting galaxies to completely merge under the tug of gravity and reshape into a single elliptical galaxy similar to the kind commonly seen in the local universe. Although the galaxies will plow into each other, stars inside each galaxy are so far apart that they will not collide with other stars during the encounter; however Galaxy (M33),, mph (400,000 km\/h). That is fast enough to travel from here to the Moon from STScI.\n\n\"In the 'worst-case-scenario'And, Ray, you must understand that, compared to their relative SIZES, galaxies are huge and close together. The Andromeda Galaxy is 2.538 MLY away, only 25 Milky Way diameters, or so. If the Sun were a golf ball, 42.67 mm in diameter, then the nearest star would be 31,146,7070 solar diameters away.

This FACT is often overlooked in long-distance positional calculations, due to the COMPOUNDING effects of this level of time passage. Imagine, during that 4 BILLION years, a motion of 100 million light-years (LY) occurred. OK. Another 100 MILLION years passes, and the object travels 620,000 LY. OK. Another 620,000 YEARS pass, and we're at the object. A significant flux from unity, BTW.\n\nAlso, EVERYONE, please discount every single thing Bill Simpson fro Louisiana says. EVERYTHING!

Even with computer simulations that would show the apparent safety of Earth when the collision happens, I don't think there is any real guarantee that anyone, or any simulation could make that Earth won't somehow be affected. But let's face it - no one born a hundred million years from tomorrow will be concerned with it. I think it's nice that they made the discovery, but why do they bother telling us about something that will not occur for four billion years? And will human kind (in any form) still be here? To what you said about fossil fuels running out, along with population and sustainability issues, I have doubts we will see the 22nd century. That's just MY cynicism talking.\n\nAlso, I have a problem with the idea that there will be absolutely no cases of stellar collisions. I understand that the distances between individual stars is immense, but to say that there will not be any instances at all of two stellar bodies running into each other seems a bit of a stretch. Maybe collisions among stars will be the exception rather than the rule, but I think that some stars are bound to collide. When the members of either galaxy begin to mingle (and it's even stated in the article that the stars will get jostled and moved into other random orbits), wouldn't gravitation cause some bodies to get too close to one another, leading to a possible collision?\n\nSubmitted: 6\/5\/2012 1:00:32 AM (CST)\n\nBRIAN UGARTEfrom NEVADA\nsaid:\n\nThe only thing I can really write is that the sky at that point of time would be very interesting.

Lets assume our descendants manage to survive millions of years into the future, which is probably the exception with any animal species. ( I'll ignore the very real possibility of the collapse of industrial civilization once the fossil fuels that power it run out during the next century, and assume that wind and solar will power everything.) In about 100 million years, the Sun will start to run low on hydrogen and begin to work on heavier elements. That will greatly increase its' energy output. It will also begin to get a LOT bigger. The oceans on Earth will be boiled away and the surface heated to hundreds of degrees. Should the surface of the expanding Sun get close enough to the Earth, it might boil it into vapor. Human ancestors, who won't look like us, would have had to flee this planet long before Andromeda gets anywhere near here. I like these articles about millions of years in the future. Do these folks realize the bad things that could happen in a million years, much less a billion. Yellowstone blows up next week and humans might be extinct in a year. A big comet comes out from behind the Sun and nails Earth, and you won't see 2014. Sorry to be so cynical, but I had a bad experience at the vehicle inspection certificate place. Little did they know that I had just erased the error code on the dashboard with my scanner, so they put a sticker on a defective vehicle. I beat the system again, so it was worth the rude treatment.

The entire sky is plotted in galactocentric coordinates of longitude and latitude. The Magellanic Stream is the pronounced tail of material that stretches 150 degrees Credit: Plot by G. Besla, Milky Way background image by Axel Mellinger (used with permission)\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- The Magellanic Stream is an arc of hydrogen gas spanning more than 100 degrees of the sky as it trails behind the Milky Way's neighbor galaxies, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Our home galaxy, the Milky Way, has long been thought to be the dominant gravitational force in forming the Stream by pulling gas from the Clouds. A new computer simulation by Gurtina Besla (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics) and her colleagues now shows, however, that the Magellanic Stream resulted from a past close encounter between these dwarf galaxies rather than effects of the Milky Way.\n\n\"The traditional models required the Magellanic Clouds to complete an orbit about the Milky Way in less than 2 billion years in order for the Stream to form,\" says Besla. Other work by Besla and her colleagues, and measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope by colleague Nitya Kallivaylil, rule out such an orbit, however, suggesting the Magellanic Clouds are new arrivals and not long-time satellites of the Milky Way.\n\nThis creates a problem: How can the Stream have formed without a complete orbit about the Milky Way?\n\nTo address this, Besla and her team set up a simulation assuming the Clouds were a stable binary system on their first passage about the Milky Way in order to show how the Stream could form without relying on a close encounter with the Milky Way.\n\nThe team postulated that the Magellanic Stream and Bridge are similar to bridge and tail structures seen in other interacting galaxies and, importantly, formed before the Clouds were captured by the Milky Way.\n\n\"While the Clouds didn't actually collide,\" says Besla, \"they came close enough that the Large Cloud pulled large amounts of hydrogen gas away from the Small Cloud. This tidal interaction gave rise to the Bridge we see between the Clouds, as well as the Stream.\"\n\n\"We believe our model illustrates that dwarf-dwarf galaxy tidal interactions are a powerful mechanism to change the shape of dwarf galaxies without the need for repeated interactions with a massive host galaxy like the Milky Way.\"\n\nWhile the Milky Way may not have drawn the Stream material out of the Clouds, the Milky Way's gravity now shapes the orbit of the Clouds and thereby controls the appearance of the tail.\n\n\"We can tell this from the line-of-sight velocities and spatial location of the tail observed in the Stream today,\" says team member Lars Hernquist of the Center.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nA giant stream of gas flowing from neighbor galaxies around our own Milky Way is much longer and older than previously thought, astronomers have discovered.

{"text":"Exploding Star\n\nWant to stay on top of all the space news? Follow @universetoday on Twitter\n\nAn exploding star, also known as a supernova, is one of the most majestic events in the entire universe. At the climax of this event, it can outshine even an entire galaxy.\n\nIn some cases, this cataclysmic event (including its fading) can last up to many years.\n\nThere are two main types of supernovae: Type I and Type II. These two are then subdivided into subclasses like Type Ia, Ib, and Ic (for Type I) or Type IIP and Type IIL (for Type II).\n\nA Type I supernova can happen to some binary star systems (star systems made up of two stars). On the other hand, a Type II can happen to a very massive star, typically much more massive than the Sun.\n\nSome exploding stars, like the type Ib, Ic and II supernovae, are accompanied by a burst of high energy neutrinos. These neutrinos travel through space and may be detected here on Earth. It is for this reason that observatories like the Super-Kamiokande and the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory were constructed.\n\nWhen exactly a supernova can occur is hard to predict. Because of this, scientists can only start studying them when they have already occurred. This is where neutrinos play an important role. Detection of neutrinos in the observatories above may indicate the presence of an exploding star somewhere in the Universe.\n\nBecause an exploding star can really stand out in the sky (due to its extreme brightness), early astronomers were able to observe them. The earliest recorded observation of an exploding star was made by Chinese astronomers in 185 AD.\n\nWhen a supernova occurs near the Earth, its gamma rays can deplete the ozone layer and subsequently permit solar and cosmic radiation to pass through. Some scientists believe its effects are so deadly that it may have caused the end Ordovician extinction wherein 60% of the living organisms found in the ocean perished.\n\nIt has been suggested that when an exploding star is located within 100 light years away, it can pose great risks to our planet. A number of stars in our own galaxy, the Milky Way, are believed to be approaching supernovae status.\n\nRho Cassiopeiae, Eta Carinae, RS Ophiuchi, U Scorpii, HD 179821, VY Canis Majoris, Betelgeuse, Antares, and Spica, are among those that may turn into supernovae in the near future. No need to be alarmed right now though.

{"text":"How nature shapes the birth of stars (RAS PR 12\/40)\n\nUsing state of the art computer simulations, a team of astronomers from the University of Bonn in Germany have found the first evidence that the way in which stars form depends on their birth environment. The team, based at the University of Bonn in Germany, publish their results in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nStars are thought to form in interstellar space from dark clouds of gas and dust. Their properties are expected to depend on the conditions of their dusty birth environment, in the same way that the temperature and constitution of clouds on Earth determines whether we experience drizzly weather, rain with large or small droplets, or a hail shower. In contrast, until now stars have appeared to unexpectedly form in the same manner everywhere. \"Sites of star formation are the bad weather regions in a galaxy and the forming stars are, in a very rough analogy, like the raindrops condensing out of this material\", comments team member Prof. Dr. Pavel Kroupa.\n\nThe group of scientists now have evidence that the mass distribution of stars does indeed depend on the environment in which they form. \"Surprisingly, this evidence does not come to us from young regions of ongoing star formation, but from a very old class of objects, so called globular star clusters\", says Dr. Michael Marks, lead author of the new paper. \"The number of observed stars less massive than our Sun in globular clusters is at odds with their structure.\"\n\nGlobular clusters are massive congregations of thousands stars surrounding our Galaxy, the Milky Way. Star formation in these clusters ceased billions of years ago. \"Nevertheless, using our simulations we found that the connection between star formation and birth environment can be understood when invoking a process that occurs very early in the life of any cluster, called residual-gas expulsion\", continues Marks.\n\nOnce a star completes its formation it starts to shine and eventually the radiation coming from the cluster of freshly-hatched stars quickly drives out the gas from which they formed. The region of star birth is then destroyed, leaving behind stars of different masses. \"This process leads to expansion of the whole aggregate of stars with the accompanying stripping of some of the stars from the cluster by the gravitational attraction of the young Milky Way. The faster the gas is blown out the stronger is the expansion and the more stars are removed\", Kroupa explains. He adds, \"The imprint of this process is still visible in the present-day mass distribution\". This means that careful observations of present-day stellar populations in globular clusters allow their initial star content to be reconstructed.\n\nThe astronomers find globular clusters must have formed with many more massive stars than are counted in individual star forming regions today. \"Otherwise the star birth region a globular cluster formed from is not destroyed quickly enough and the subsequent expansion is too weak to remove enough stars from the cluster\", says Marks. \"If this had happened the distribution of masses of stars we see today would be quite different\". The deduced differences in the number of massive stars having formed in globular clusters depending on the cloud conditions is indeed in agreement with theoretical expectation.\n\nAccording to their results, differences in the initial star content appear only when conditions in the star birth regions are very extreme compared to those we see today. \"We do not observe these extreme environments in the present day, but these may have well been frequent when globular clusters were born around 12 billion years ago\", Marks states. Their work predicts that stars form in the same way, with the same range of masses, in different sites in the present day Milky Way.\n\nKroupa summarises their results. \"With this work, we might have uncovered the long expected systematic differences in the star formation process\". The Bonn astronomers now plan to use further simulations to study the effect of these differences on the long-term evolution of globular star clusters.\n\nCaption: A Hubble Space Telescope image of the massive star cluster R 136 in the Large Magellanic Cloud.

This is the nearest large galaxy to us, and a very bright one at that. I can't say for certain the most distant object that you can see with an amateur telescope because the size of such telescopes can vary a lot, and because it depends on the detector that you have attached to it (like your eye, film, or an electronic CCD).

It's like the shutter speed of a camera: slow shutter speed = long exposure time. The exposure time for your eye is fixed at a fraction of a second, not very long. With film or a CCD, you can expose for minutes or even hours, and detect distant galaxies.\n\nThe most distant object known and observed with a large optical telescope is the quasar PK 1247 +3406, at a distance of 5000 megaparsecs, the time when galaxies first began to form.

{"text":"In two separate reports, astronomers reveal ancient globular clusters to be breeding much younger blue-straggler members, and a relatively young open cluster hosting an aging stellar population, calling into question theories of stellar evolution.\n\nGlobular clusters, densely populated hubs of stars, lying in the outskirts of our Milky Way Galaxy are around the same age as the Milky Way itself, about 10 billion years. It is strongly believed that all of the cluster's inhabitants formed at the same time, with individual stars evolving at their own pace, but with no new additions to the group.\n\nA close binary pair of stars merge to form a blue-straggler star, stirring up both stars' fuel to make it burn hotter and bluer, as this artist's impression depicts. Image: NASA, ESA, W. Clark (Indiana University and UCLA), and K. Sahu (STScI).\n\nThen, \"blue stragglers\" were discovered. Hotter, brighter and more massive than typical globular cluster stars, their apparent youth called into question how they got there. Collisions and interactions seemed the logical solution. \" explains Alison Sills of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, who is presenting the research at the Canadian Astronomical Society Conference this week. \"Somewhat like a traffic system with no stop lights, there are a lot of close encounters and collisions.\"\n\nBut new Hubble Space Telescope observations of a dozen clusters revealed that not only are blue stragglers present in all of the clusters studied, but there are two distinct generations of star formation, separated by between 30 and 100 million years, with the second generation apparently forming from the material shed by the first generation of stars.\n\n\"There are data for about a dozen clusters with both blue stragglers and good information about the multiple populations,\" Sills tells Astronomy Now. \"About 25 clusters have been surveyed of the ~150 globular clusters in our Galaxy by different groups, and all of them show one or more of these hints [of multiple populations].\"\n\nSills speculates that the stars of the first generation put gas back into the cluster when they are in their late phase of evolution, that is, at the end of their lives and are about to become a white dwarf \u2013 a phase on the Hertzprung-Russell diagram of stellar evolution referred to as the Asymptotic Giant Branch. \"These stars have really strong winds, and if the material from the wind can collect in the centre of the cluster, the second generation can form from this 'stuff',\" she says. \"However, blue stragglers are thought to be a completely separate problem and aren't part of this picture.\" Sills says that even though the blue stragglers and the second generation of stars share similar characteristics, there is a long way to go before finding the missing link between these two unexpected members of globular clusters.\n\nForty-two blue straggler candidates (circled) were found in the Milky Way's bulge during the SWEEPS survey, of which astronomers believe 18-37 are true blue stars much younger than ordinary bulge stars. Image: NASA, ESA, W. Clarkson (Indiana University and UCLA), and K. Sahu (STScI).\n\nMeanwhile, the seemingly open cluster NGC 6791 in Lyra has some of the traits of an older globular cluster. \"This cluster is about twice the age of the Sun and is unusually metal rich (at least twice the Sun's metallicity),\" says Imants Platais of the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. \"A couple of decades ago, it was also found that NGC 6791 contains a handful of very hot but somewhat dim stars, called hot subdwarfs. The presence of such stars in an open cluster is rare, though not unique.\"\n\nPlatais and colleague's new census of some 60 thousand of the cluster's stars revealed that NGC 6791 contains several luminous stars belonging to the so-called classical horizontal branch. These are stars which are normally found only in globular clusters which are much older than NGC 6791. Unlike a typical globular cluster, however, NGC 6791 contains simultaneously both red and very blue horizontal branch stars, adding to the strange observation that it is both metal rich and old.\n\nThe team say that NGC 6791 is the first known star cluster juxtaposing the properties of open and globular clusters and, as such, represents a new class of star clusters, which could have originated in the central bulge region of the Milky Way.\n\nThe research was presented at the 218th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Boston, where the first announcement of blue stragglers within the central hub of the Milky Way was also made. A team lead by Will Clarkson of Indiana University, used data from the 2006 Hubble Space Telescope survey called the Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search (SWEEPS) to study stars in the central bulge of our Galaxy, a survey intended to find hot Jupiter-class planets that orbit very close to their stars, but which uncovered 42 oddball blue stars with brightness and temperatures typical for stars much younger than ordinary bulge stars.\n\n\"Although the Milky Way bulge is by far the closest galaxy bulge, several key aspects of its formation and subsequent evolution remain poorly understood,\" says Clarkson. \"Many details of its star-formation history remain controversial.\"\n\nThe observations clearly indicate that if there is a young star population in the bulge, it is very small, and that the central bulge stopped producing stars billions of years ago, and is now home to aging Sun-like"}

{"text":"T he most ambitious attempt yet to trace the history of the universe has seen \"first light.\" The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III), took its first astronomical data on the night of Sept. 14-15 at the Sloan Foundation telescope in New Mexico.\n\nThe goal of the six-year project is to measure the spectra of 1.4 million galaxies and 160,000 quasars, extremely distant objects that shine more brightly than entire galaxies. The previous sky survey (SDSS-II) determined the two-dimensional position of these objects in the sky. The new project will measure their distance, allowing astronomers to produce a three-dimensional map with unprecedented detail that extends out about one-fifth of the full depth of the visible universe and traces the evolution of the universe back some 6.5 billion years.\n\n\"This will give us a three-dimensional map of a large volume of the universe, which is exactly what we need to learn more about dark energy,\" says assistant professor Andreas Berlind. He and his colleagues in Vanderbilt's physics and astronomy department \u2014 assistant professor Kelly Holley-Bockelmann, associate professor Keivan Stassun and professor David Weintraub \u2014 are participating in the survey along with 350 scientists from 41 other institutions.\n\nDark energy is a type of \"negative gravity\" that seems to play a role in accelerating the expansion of the universe. Scientists think it makes up about 70 percent of the energy\/matter of the universe, but its basic nature is a mystery. \"One of the most sensitive measures of dark energy that we have found is the large-scale distribution of galaxies,\" Berlind says.\n\nBOSS uses the same telescope as the original Sloan Digital Sky Survey, but the instrument has been equipped with new, specially built spectrographs. The new devices can measure the spectra of 1,000 objects at a time and are considerably more sensitive than the original ones, so they can record the spectra of extremely dim objects. \"The new spectrographs are much more efficient in infrared light,\" explains Natalie Roe of Lawrence Berkeley National Labooratory, the instrument scientist for BOSS. \"The light emitted by distant galaxies arrives at Earth as infrared light, so these improved spectrographs are able to look much farther back in time.\"\n\nThe Vanderbilt team brings a unique resource to the project: A set of more than 400 simulated universes. These are computer models of the universe that start at the Big Bang and then virtually evolve to the present following known physical laws. \"Other groups have produced individual simulations that are more detailed than ours, but we've gone for greater numbers in order to get a better idea of the amount of variation that is possible,\" says Berlind.\n\nThese virtual universes are being used to test the BOSS data analysis methods and will be necessary to interpret BOSS's measurements of dark energy. Berlind and his colleagues are generating simulated observational data from a number of their virtual universes; this data is run through the BOSS analysis pipeline and the results are compared with the original. \"This allows us to catch any systematic errors that might throw the results off,\" he says.\n\nABOUT SDSS-III AND BOSS\n\nBOSS is the largest of four surveys in SDSS-III, which includes 350 scientists from 42 institutions. The BOSS design and implementation has been led from the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The optical systems were designed and built at Johns Hopkins University, with new CCD cameras designed and built at Princeton University and the University of California at Santa Cruz\/Lick Observatory. The University of Washington contributed new optical fiber systems, and Ohio State University designed and built an upgraded BOSS data-acquisition system.

{"text":"Astronomers discover a trio of quasars\n\nJan 08, 2007\n\nUsing ESO's Very Large Telescope and the W.M. Keck Observatory, astronomers at the Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne in Switzerland and the California Institute of Technology, USA, have discovered the first known triplet of quasars. This close trio of supermassive black holes lies about 10.5 billion light-years away towards the Virgo (The Virgin) constellation.\n\n\"Quasars are extremely rare objects,\" says George Djorgovski, from Caltech and leader of the team that made the discovery. \"To find two of them so close together is very unlikely if they were randomly distributed in space. To find three is un-precedented.\"\n\nThe findings are being reported at the winter 2007 meeting of the American Astronomical Soci-ety in Seattle, USA. Quasars are extraordinary luminous objects in the distant universe, thought to be powered by supermassive black holes at the heart of galaxies. A single quasar could be a thousand times brighter than an entire galaxy of a hundred billion stars, and yet this remarkable amount of energy originates from a volume smaller than our solar system. About a hundred thousand quasars have been found to date, and among them several tens of close pairs, but this is the first known case of a close triple quasar system.\n\nQuasars (QUAsi StellAR Sources) were first discovered in 1963 by the Dutch-American as-tronomer Maarten Schmidt at the Palomar Obser-vatory (California, USA) and the name refers to their 'star-like' appearance on the images ob-tained at that time. Distinguishing them from stars is thus no easy task and discovering a close trio of such objects is even less obvious.\n\nThe feat could only be accomplished by combining images from two of the largest ground-based telescopes, ESO's 8.2-m Very Large Tele-scope at Cerro Paranal, in Chile, and the W. M. Keck Observatory's 10-m telescope atop Mauna Kea, Hawaii, as well as using very sophisticated and efficient image sharpening method.\n\nThe distant quasar LBQS 1429-008 was first discovered in 1989 by an international team of astronomers led by Paul Hewett of the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge, England. Hewett and his collaborators found a fainter companion to their quasar, and proposed that it was a case of gravitational lensing. According to Einstein's gen-eral theory of relativity, if a large mass (such as a big galaxy or a cluster of galaxies) is placed along the line of sight to a distant quasar, the light rays are bent, and an observer on Earth will see two or more close images of the quasar \u2013 a cosmic mi-rage. The first such gravitational lens was discov-ered in 1979, and hundreds of cases are now known.\n\nHowever, several groups over the past several years cast doubts that this system is a gravitational lens, and proposed instead that it is a close physical pair of quasars.\n\nWhat the Caltech-Swiss team has found is that there is a third, even fainter quasar associated with the previously known two. The three quasars have the same redshift, hence, are at the same distance from us.\n\nThe astronomers performed an extensive theo-retical modeling, trying to explain the observed geometry of the three images as a consequence of gravitational lensing. \"We just could not repro-duce the data,\" says Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Courbin of Lausanne. \"It is essentially impossible to account for what we see using reasonable gravitational lensing models.\" Moreover, there is no trace of a possible lens-ing galaxy, which would be needed if the system were a gravitational lens. The team has also docu-mented small, but significant differences in the properties of the three quasars. These are much easier to understand if the three quasars are physically distinct objects, rather than gravita-tional lensing mirages. Combining all these pieces of evidence effectively eliminated lensing as a possible explanation.\n\n\"We were left with an even more exciting pos-sibility that this is an actual triple quasar,\" says Georges Meylan, also from Lausanne. The three quasars are separated by only about 100,000 to 150,000 light-years, which is about the size of our own Milky Way.\n\nGravitational lensing can be used to probe the distribution of dark and visible mass in the uni-verse, but quasar pairs -and now a triplet- provide astronomers with a different kind of insight.\n\n\"Quasars are believed to be powered by gas falling into supermassive black holes,\" says Djor-govski. \"This process happens very effectively when galaxies collide or merge, and we are ob-serving this system at the time in the cosmic his-tory when such galaxy interactions were at a peak.\"\n\nIf galaxy interactions were responsible for the quasar activity, having two quasars close together would be much more likely than if they were ran-domly distributed in space. This may explain the unusual abundance of binary quasars, which have been reported by several groups. \"In this case, we are lucky to catch a rare situation where qua-sars are ignited in three interacting galaxies,\" says Ashish Mahabal, one of the Caltech scientists in-volved in the study. Discoveries of more such systems in the future may help astronomers understand better the fun-damental relationship between the formation and evolution of galaxies, and the supermassive black holes in their cores, now believed to be common in most large galaxies, our own Milky Way in-cluded.\n\nThis work is also described in a paper submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters. The team is com-posed of S. George Djorgovski, Ashish Mahabal, and Eilat Glikman of Caltech (USA), Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Courbin, Georges Meylan and Dominique Sluse of the Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (Switzerland), and David Thompson of the University of Arizona's Large Binocular Telescope Observatory (USA).BOSS, the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, is mapping a huge volume of space to measure the role of dark energy in the evolution of the universe.

{"text":"Saturday, May 16, 2009\n\nDoes the universe actually look like that?\n\nOkay, I'll admit it, the last post had a lot of math. For those who are less inclined to slog through equations, let's talk about all those astronomical pretty pictures we see.\n\nKarl asks:\n\nI always hear that photos of cosmological objects (like that photo of the Ring Nebula in your previous post) have been enhanced in some way. What would those things look like if we just saw them exactly as the telescope or camera picked them up? And when the photos are enhanced, are they always enhanced the same way, or does the formula vary?\n\nFinally, does the enhancing serve some scientific purpose, or is it done basically to make the pictures prettier? (I suppose that's a scientific purpose too, in the long view, since pretty pictures make it easier to get funding. Don't worry, I won't tell!)\n\nSo, it's totally true, the final images given out for press releases have usually been heavily processed from the original raw images. Just like the pictures you took at a party where you throw them into photoshop and remove your friends' red-eye, there are a set of \"standard\" processing steps for astronomical images.\n\nThat said, there's usually not outright deception the way advertisers airbrush images - no astronomer is going to try and make their planet look skinnier or add lolcat tags. To understand this a little better, let's talk about how modern astronomical images are actually taken.\n\nFirst off, almost all optical images are taken with a Charged Coupled Device (CCD) mounted to the back of a telescope. This is the same kind of chip that's in the back of your ordinary digital camera, albeit more sensitive and more expensive. Essentially, it's just a thin piece of silicon divided into a narrowly-spaced grid of cells. Each cell in the grid can hold electrons which might get excited when a photon hits them. At the end of an exposure, each cell reports how many energetic electrons it contains. Our image just translates each cell into a pixel, and the brightness of that pixel is just how many electrons it contains.\n\nNow, notice there's absolutely no color information here. The CCD just reports the number of excited electrons, and doesn't know anything about whether it was a red photon or a blue photon which excited it...so this just produces a black & white photo. This means we have to use filters if we want to get any color information. If we put, say, a red filter on our CCD before taking the image, then we know only red photons can get through.\n\nSo, first we take an exposure with a red filter, then another with a green filter, and then another with a blue filter. We combine them all at the end to produce our fancy color image.\n\nOkay, you're probably already asking, \"then how does my digital camera takes color photos all at once without any color filters?\" The answer is that it uses filters all the time - here's a schematic of the filter mosaic used in most digital camera CCDs. By filtering alternating pixels with different colors, in only one exposure the camera can get an image in each filter...albeit at lower resolution than the entire grid. The fancy camera software then interpolates these separate staggered color images to produce a single color image.\n\nSo with all this said, let's take a look at an actual single raw image of a galaxy:\n\nYou'll want to click on the image above to look at the original with all its glorious artifacts. Let's also take a look at close-up with some artifacts highlighted:\n\nSo, there's several issues we have to contend with to make this into a \"pretty picture\".\n\nIn red, I've highlighted a particularly annoying cosmic ray trail (though they're all over the image). Unlike digital camera photos which only open the shutter for a fraction of a second, astronomical images - particularly of faint objects - can be upwards of an hour long. During this time, high-energy particles known as cosmic rays - which are always whizzing around - have a much greater chance of interacting with your CCD and exciting electrons completely independent of any photons coming through the telescope. The annoying ones come in at an oblique angle to the CCD, leaving a trail of excited electrons across the chip. The even more annoying ones do this directly over the CCD cells you're using to capture an image of your object. Thankfully, there are some pretty good cosmic ray removal packages out there which use sophisticated image detection algorithms to remove this...so that's a processing step right there.\n\nIn blue, I've highlighted pixel bleed. We're going for a long exposure of a pretty faint galaxy here, so any bright stars in the field will become oversaturated. In essence, the CCD cell containing the image of the bright star begins to overflow with energetic electrons, pouring them out into adjacent cells.\n\nIn green, I've highlighted a row of bad pixels. With millions of cells across the entire chip, statistically many are eventually going to fail. For earth-based observatories, it's untenable to keep throwing out CCDs which cost many thousands of dollars whenever some pixels go out...so you work around it. For spacecraft, meanwhile, there's really nothing you can do about bad pixels even if you had the money to replace it.\n\nThere's a couple other artifacts noticeable in the original image, as well. Notice the steady gradient of dark-to-light in the background. Unfortunately, not all the pixels have the same sensitivity. Send 100 photons to one cell, and you might get 50 excited electrons...send them to another cell, and you might only get 40.\n\nYou have to account for this by taking \"flat fields\". Essentially, you take images (ideally just before or just after taking your astronomical images) of a uniformly lit surface with each color filter. The idea is that the surface should be sending out a constant number of photons to each cell, so the only signal you'll see will be the change in sensitivity across the CCD. You then divide the astronomical image by the flat field on a pixel-by-pixel basis to remove this sensitivity effect. Finding a truly flat field, though, can be a chore in itself...often times the best flat field you'll get is an image of the twilight sky before the stars come out.\n\nAnother artifact you may notice in the original is the weird wavy pattern, particularly noticeable on the left. Ideally you want your CCD chip to be as thin a piece of silicon as possible - this makes it more sensitive. However, particularly for longer wavelengths of light, photons reflecting off the back surface of the CCD can interfere with photons hitting the front surface and produce thin film interference - very similar to the wavy colored patterns you'll see in soap bubbles or with oil on water. Hopefully this too will be removed by flat-fielding.\n\nFinally, as for the purpose of enhancing images, all of the above steps are necessary to get good science. Otherwise, you're just measuring your signal buried in a whole lot of noise. If you're going to take an image this far, though, you might as well go one step further to make a press release photo.\n\nThis serves several purposes, but not least of which is to share your own fascination of an astronomical object with the general public. Imagine if the Hubble Space Telescope *never* made press release photos available and only was used for hard science in the journals...public support wouldn't be nearly what it is today. Besides, it's the taxpayer's dollar which goes to fund it - the least we can do is give them some pretty pictures in return.\n\nSo, if you want to make a pretty picture, there's one more step you'll have to take - and this is a big one - because the above image was taken through an infrared filter. By definition, the human eye can't see this wavelength of light, so if we were to represent it in \"true-color\", the entire image should be black.\n\nCreatively mapping various single filtered images to RGB space as well as some tweaking of colors needs to happen to for this to be visible - and aesthetically pleasing - for human vision. This color manipulation doesn't have the same tried-and-true formula as the above sequence of processing steps, and is often just manipulated until one gets something that just \"looks good\".\n\n37 comments:\n\nI agree with Lluvia, I'm learning so much from you. What kinda urks me a bit is that based on this information, I really can't trust the \"picture\" I get from my camera. Is it an industry thing to give us what we want to see instead of what's really there?\n\nThank you, Planetary Astronomer Mike! What a terrifically detailed answer -- once again, I learn even more than I expected to.\n\nA couple of questions:\n\nDoes per-pixel sensitivity change over time? In other words, is there some reason not to take the baseline flat field on Earth, using some kind of specially-built uniform lamp, before launching the CCD into space? Or would the data gathered by that artifically perfect flat field just become obsolete as pixel sensitivities change over time anyway?\n\nAnd as for color-mapping down into RGB space: it's interesting that you used the word \"creatively\" :-). Is there some reason just uniformly upshifting (or downshifting, in the case of ultraviolet) wouldn't do the trick? I'd somehow feel that's more \"accurate\", since it's just a straight multiplication or division, but maybe that's naive...\n\nBy \"can't trust the picture\" you mean that your camera interpolates separate color images from a lower-resolution grid of filters?\n\nI don't think it's the industry getting us down so much as an issue that if you did take a picture first with red, then green, then blue filters, in that time your subject would probably have moved in the frame.\n\nThis isn't too much of a problem for astronomy since stuff doesn't move that quickly...except for transient events. High-res images of Jupiter can have color blurring since the planet rotates so quickly (only 10 hours).\n\nThe other option for digital cameras is the new Foveon CCD:\n\n\n\nIt's technically 3 CCDs stacked on one another. The top CCD only detects blue light and allows green and red light to pass through. The next CCD detects green light and allows red light through. The bottom one detects red light. So, you can get full resolution images in each color with a single exposure and no need for interpolation algorithms.\n\nHowever, you can expect to pay an arm and quite possibly a leg for this technology.\n\nIt really depends on the specific CCD, but in general, pixel sensitivity changes a lot over both time and temperature. When observing from Earth-based observatories, you almost always want to take flat fields each night, and ideally throughout the course of the night as the temperature changes (if you're really want to calibrate your images well(.\n\nThat said, the recently-removed WFPC2 instrument on Hubble is surprisingly stable. Still, getting occasional flat-fields is still necessary...they do this by actually pointing the Hubble back at Earth. Because the Hubble is moving around the planet so quickly, the images are smeared out, producing a pretty uniform field.\n\nAs for color upshifting\/downshifting, that's generally what's done. However, a lot of observations might be done in, say, 6 different filters including both UV and IR...mapping that to only 3 visible color channels may require some creativity.\n\nIt gets even more complicated when some of those filters are extremely narrow for the sake of detecting some property other than just color. For example, the narrow near-IR filter at the 889 nanometer absorption line of methane ultimately probes vertical height in the giant planets. Having only one color dedicated to vertical height seems a little wonky, so scientists will often favor a mapping which is decidedly \"false color\", e.g. this image of Jupiter:\n\nUniverse that's my passion my favorite topic, I'm totally surprised with those images, when I get into those topics I feel like in a viagra online travel around the space and galaxies, I feel flying and get inspiration.\n\nQuestion 2: When (if ever) do you guys plan on bringing back the switch characters button?

{"text":"Was Kepler's supernova unusually powerful?\n\nSep 11, 2012\n\nThis composite image of Kepler's supernova remnant shows different colors ranging from lower to higher energies: red, yellow, green, blue and purple. An optical image from the Digitized Sky Survey (pale yellow and blue) shows stars in the field. The Kepler supernova was a Type Ia event, the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf. New analysis suggests that the supernova explosion was not only more powerful, but might have also occurred at a greater distance, than previously thought. Credit: X-ray: NASA\/CXC\/SAO\/D.Patnaude, Optical: DSS\n\n(Phys.org)\u2014In 1604, a new star appeared in the night sky that was much brighter than Jupiter and dimmed over several weeks. This event was witnessed by sky watchers including the famous astronomer Johannes Kepler. Centuries later, the debris from this exploded star is known as the Kepler supernova remnant.\n\nAstronomers have long studied the Kepler supernova remnant and tried to determine exactly what happened when the star exploded to create it. New analysis of a long observation from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory is providing more clues. This analysis suggests that the supernova explosion was not only more powerful, but might have also occurred at a greater distance, than previously thought.\n\nThis image shows the Chandra data derived from more than 8 days worth of observing time. The X-rays are shown in five colors from lower to higher energies: red, yellow, green, blue, and purple. These various X-ray slices were then combined with an optical image from the Digitized Sky Survey, showing stars in the field.\n\nThis video is not supported by your browser at this time.\n\nTour of Kepler's Supernova\n\nPrevious analysis of this Chandra image has determined that the stellar explosion that created Kepler was what astronomers call a \"Type Ia\" supernova. This class of supernovas occurs when a white dwarf gains mass, either by pulling gas off a companion star or merging with another white dwarf, until it becomes unstable and is destroyed by a thermonuclear explosion.\n\nUnlike other well-known Type Ia supernovas and their remnants, Kepler's debris field is being strongly shaped by what it is running into. More specifically, most Type Ia supernova remnants are very symmetrical, but the Kepler remnant is asymmetrical with a bright arc of X-ray emission in its northern region. This indicates the expanding ball of debris from the supernova explosion is plowing into the gas and dust around the now-dead star.\n\nThe bright X-ray arc can be explained in two ways. In one model, the pre-supernova star and its companion were moving through the interstellar gas and losing mass at a significant rate via a wind, creating a bow shock wave similar to that of a boat moving through water. Another possibility is that the X-ray arc is caused by debris from the supernova expanding into an interstellar cloud of gradually increasing density.\n\nThe wind and bow shock model described above requires that the Kepler supernova remnant is located at a distance of more than 23,000 light years. In the latter alternative, the gas into which the remnant is expanding has higher density than average, and the distance of the remnant from the earth is between about 16,000 and 20,000 light years. Both alternatives give greater distances than the commonly used value of 13,000 light years.\n\nIn either model, the X-ray spectrum - that is, the amount of X-rays produced at different energies \u2013 reveals the presence of a large amount of iron, and indicates an explosion more energetic than the average Type Ia supernova. Additionally, to explain the observed X-ray spectrum in this model, a small cavity must have been cleared out around the star before it exploded. Such a cavity, which would have a diameter less than a tenth that of the remnant's current size, might have been produced by a fast, dense outflow from the surface of the white dwarf before it exploded, as predicted by some models of Type Ia supernovas.\n\nEvidence for an unusually powerful Type Ia supernova has previously been observed in another remnant with Chandra and an optical telescope. These results were independently verified by subsequent observations of light from the original supernova explosion that bounced off gas clouds, a phenomenon called light echoes. This other remnant is located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small galaxy about 160,000 light years from Earth, making it much farther away than Kepler and therefore more difficult to study.\n\nRelated StoriesAstronomers have made the best ever determination of the power of a supernova explosion that was visible from Earth long ago.

Previously, however, astronomers could not find stars containing less than 1\/10 000th of the amount of metal found in the Sun, a value much higher than is expected for stars in the early Milky Way. Now, Norbert Christlieb and his colleagues at the University of Hamburg have found a distant star that contains only about 1\/200 000th of the Sun's metal content (N. Christlieb et al 2002 Nature419 904).\n\nThe chemical composition of the earliest stars reflects the composition of the gas from which they were made. Since stars themselves generate all of the elements in the Universe except hydrogen, helium and a small amount of lithium, the oldest stars should contain very little of the heavier elements (known collectively as metals). Some of these stars should still be observable but have eluded astronomers for decades.\n\nThe star investigated by Christlieb and co-workers, called HE0107-5240, is part of the Milky Way's halo. It was identified as a possible metal-deficient star by a spectroscopic survey of the southern sky carried out by a collaboration between the University of Hamburg and the European Southern Observatory (ESO). This survey is more sensitive and some ten times larger than earlier surveys.\n\nChristlieb's group carried out more refined spectroscopic measurements of the star at the 2.3m Siding Spring Observatory in Australia and on one of the 8m telescopes at ESO's Very Large Telescope in Chile. These results showed that the star is indeed metal deficient. It contains only 1\/200 000th of the amount of metal in the Sun and even its strongest metallic spectral lines are extremely faint.\n\nThe team is currently using the Siding Spring Observatory to investigate other metal-deficient candidate stars from the Hamburg\/ESO survey. Such stars should provide important information about star formation and may also lead to an improved estimate of the age of the Universe.\n\n\"Finding more metal-poor stars should help us understand the epoch of the first star formation, since these stars are our best direct 'witnesses' of this epoch,\" says Christlieb."}
{"text":"Abstract The escape rate of cosmic ray (CR) particles from radio\ngalaxy cocoons is a problem of high astrophysical relevance: e.g. if\nCR electrons are stored for long times in the dilute relativistic\nmedium filling the radio cocoons (radio plasma in the following)\nthey are protected against Coulomb losses and thus are able to produce\na significant non-thermal Comptonisation signature on the CMB. On the\nother hand, CR protons and positrons which leak out of radio plasma\ncan interact with the ambient medium, leading to characteristic gamma\nray radiation by pion decay and pair annihilation. In order better\nunderstand such problems a model for the escape of CR particles from\nradio galaxy cocoons is presented here. It is assumed that the radio\ncocoon is poorly magnetically connected to the environment. An extreme\ncase of this kind is an insulating boundary layer of magnetic fields,\nwhich can efficiently suppress particle escape. More likely, magnetic\nfield lines are less organised and allow the transport of CR particles\nfrom the source interior to the surface region. For such a scenario\ntwo transport regimes are analysed: diffusion of particles along\ninter-phase magnetic flux tubes (leaving the cocoon) and cross field\ntransport of particles in flux tubes touching the cocoon surface. The\ncross field diffusion is likely the dominate escape path, unless a\nsignificant fraction of the surface is magnetically connected to the\nenvironment. Major cluster merger should strongly enhance the\nparticle escape by two complementary mechanisms. i) The merger shock\nwaves shred radio cocoons into filamentary structures, allowing the\nCRs to easily reach the radio plasma boundary due to the changed\nmorphology. ii) Also efficient particle losses can be expected for\nradio cocoons not compressed in shock waves. There, for a short period\nafter the sudden injection of large scale turbulence, the (anomalous)\ncross field diffusion can be enhanced by several orders of\nmagnitude.

{"text":"Pulsars III\n\nMost stars, like the Sun, are made of different layers of hot gas. As the stars rotate, the layers spin at different rates. That tangles up a star's magnetic field, creating big magnetic storms on its surface. And when the field gets too tangled, it triggers powerful explosions.\n\nBut in a neutron star, the tangled magnetic fields can crack the star's solid crust, triggering outbursts that are far more powerful than those from any Sun-like star.\n\nNeutron stars are the crushed remnants of exploded stars. They're as massive as the Sun, but only a few miles in diameter. They're squeezed so tightly that they have a solid crust, with a \"liquid\" layer of pure neutrons below.\n\nSome neutron stars spin rapidly -- once every few seconds, or even faster. They \"beam\" energy into space from their magnetic poles. If Earth lies along the path of one of these beams, we see the star \"pulse\" on and off, like a lighthouse beacon sweeping across the cosmic landscape.\n\nOver time, these pulsars spin a little slower. But some of them can suddenly speed up again.\n\nThat's probably caused by the different spin rates of the solid crust and the liquid layer below. This generates extremely powerful magnetic fields. When the fields get tangled, they produce \"starquakes\" in the crust -- violent cracks that are accompanied by enormous bursts of energy. The crust then catches up to the liquid layers below it -- starting the cycle all over again"}

{"text":"How to Build a Star\n\nTo understand how something works you must first take it apart to see what makes\nit tick. We will try to do just that -- starting with the power pack. What is\nthe source of a star's enormous power?\n\nThe Short Answer\n\nStars produce power by changing mass into energy. That's right ... the solid,\nliquid and gasseous stuff that makes up everything you see around you is changed\ninto energy (heat and light) inside of a star. It doesn't take much mass to\nmake an enormous amount of energy.\n\nLook at the jelly bean in the picture for a minute. Stare at it with awe and\nrespect. If all the mass in this jelly bean were converted all at once into\nenergy, it would be equivalent to 25,000 tons of TNT.\n\nCut this jelly bean in half and you would have the mass converted into the amount of energy in the first atomic bomb. Enough energy was released to completely destroy a small island"}

Then, all of the sudden, a blast of cosmic winds from the galaxy next door comes along, and toasts you, your planet, and all the other planets in your part of the galaxy. Sound far-fetched? It's not. In fact, it's happening right now. (Technically it happened 1.4 billion years ago, but we're just now seeing it.)\n\nMSNBC Science reports on how a jet of cosmic radiation including x-rays and gamma rays are hurling out of a massive black hole in one galaxy, and impacting stars and (assumed) solar systems in another galaxy right next to it. If this happened near Earth, this blast of cosmic radiation would strip away our ozone layer, and be lethal to life as we know it.\n\nSo the next time you catch yourself thinking about getting a cold because someone sneezed while in line with you at the store, take a moment and think about something 20,000 light years away the causing the extinction of all life on Earth in something akin to a giant cosmic cough.\n\nThis entry was posted\non Tuesday, December 18th, 2007 at 6:52 pm and is filed under Space and Science"}

{"text":"Scientists believe they are on the verge of solving the 70-year-old mystery of dark matter.\n\nThe structure of the observable universe\nsuggests there is a lot of matter that we simply cannot see, and astronomers, cosmologists and particle physicists have\nbeen looking for answers to what it could be.\n\nBut now the ESA Planck satellite has picked up radiation beams from the centre of the Milky Way, and scientists believe they have discovered proof that dark mater exists - otherwise the alternative would re-write physics as we know it.\n\nPavel Naselsky, professor of cosmology at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen, said: 'The radiation cannot be explained by the\nstructural mechanisms in the galaxy and it cannot be radiation from\nsupernova explosions.\n\n'We believe that this could be proof of dark\nmatter. Otherwise, we have discovered absolutely new (and unknown for\nphysics) mechanism of acceleration of particles in the Galactic centre.'\n\nRadiation map of the skies: A false colour image of the whole sky as seen by Planck, the space observatory\n\nWHAT THE IMAGE ABOVE TELLS US\n\nIn this image, the dust of the Milky Way is shown in blue, with a red band across the centre showing hot regions.\n\nThe mottled yellow area above and below represents relic radiation, otherwise known as the Cosmic Microwave Background, created in the fireball of the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago, which is the oldest light in the Universe.\n\nSuch an image allows scientists to study both the origins of the Universe and the birth of stars in our galaxy.\n\nResearchers were studying data from the Planck satellite, launched in 2009.\n\nThe satellite does not just remain still in space, but changes direction every hour as well as rotates once a minute on its own axis.\n\nThese movements mean that it scans the entire surrounding Universe in the course of six months, using extremely sensitive instruments that can map microwave radiation in the entire sky with great precision.\n\nThe latest data from the Planck mission reveals unusual radiation from our own galaxy, which open a new direction in understanding the most fundamental properties of the space, time and matter in the Universe.\n\nMore...\n\nNaselsky said: 'We have observed a very unique emission of radio radiation from the centre of our galaxy, the Milky Way.\n\n'By using different methods to separate the signal for very broad range of wavelengths, we have been able to determine the spectrum of the radiation.\n\n'The radiation originates from synchrotron emission - electrons and positrons circulating at high energies around the lines of the Magnetic Field in the centre of the galaxy, and there are quite strong indications that it could come from dark matter.'\n\nPlanck produced its first all-sky image in 2010, and scientists are currently working to analyse and parse the various and complex elements\n\nNaselsky said\n\nBut they have very unique properties and do not interact with 'normal' matter particles. Dark matter particles are also usually very scattered and do not interact with each other.\n\n'But we know from theoretical predictions that the concentration of dark matter particles around the centre of galaxies is very high and we have a strong argument they can collide there and in the collision electrons and positrons are formed.\n\n'These.'\n\nThe results have been published in ArXive.org. and submitted to the scientific journal, Astronomy and Astrophysics.\n\nComments (35)\n\nProof? of the Dr Violette cosmic-super-wave?\na cyclical ELE, say around 100,000 year intervals that swamps our solar system with distrubances which can affect the OOrt cloud &\/or the Sun whu=ic seems to be going on right now with mega flares & CMEs as the whole solar system heats up ;p\n\nScott. Good comment. I am a creationist and belive the Genesis account, not by blind faith, but by looking at the sciencetific evedence for it. Gods word never changes but science does and we have to respect that. Dawerian evoloutionist have still yet to show how non-organic material evloved to organic matter. All they have on there side is the millions of years and randon chance, and they know it. So we as bible belivering creations\/christians don't have to fear form these people. They have the same evedince as we do, it is how it is interpreted.\n\nThe problem is that this dark matter is concetrated in the center of our milky way as this article tells. Originally the dark matter as a theoretical assumption was introduced to explain the excess high velocity movement of the starts at the edge of our (and other) galaxies. But the distribution of this dark matter should be more evenly distributed throughout the galaxy for the proper modelling of galaxy rotation. The dark matter in general does not explain the filament structure of the spiral galaxies. I think that there are other forces in play than only the gravitational one for the explanation of the dynamics of the galaxies. Just an example: it can be electromagnetic force. There is no such a requirement that any celestical body should have zero electrical charge at the end. (There is electrical discharge going on between the planet Jupiter and its nearest satelite, Io.) There can be other forces to explain the dynamics of the galaxy but my imagination is too weak.\n\nWill,uk The hardest problem to solve seems to be grown ups who still believe fairy tales.People like you>>>>> Man is currently trying to become the \"Creator\". Who's to say that someone or something more intelligent, has beaten us to it. But, with closed minds like yours, then there's no chance of that ever happening.\n\nAndy HB 05\/09\/12 17:59>>> If environmental issues float your boat then, yeah, why not. Would the ability to produce clean, inexpensive energy be such a bad thing? Must be better than what's on offer at the moment. The producing, taxpaying consumer, directly and indirectly pays for scientific research, that's a fact. Science seems to fall into two categories, 1. Genuine scientific research which has a purpose and useful end goal , 2. Science only for the purpose of raising money through funding and grants just to keep a few lemmings in a job. Nuff Said.\n\n@ Simon. I realised that which is why I wrote \"if the sun disappeared it would take 8 mins for ** any ** effect to be noticeable on earth ....- including it getting dark or our **trajectory through space to change** (emphasis added).\n\nwhat people do,nt understand is all we have to do is ask god if he can send a divine message as to how he made all this\n- tonythetap, gloucester, 5\/9\/2012 11:28\nGood luck with that one!

{"text":"How Many Stars are there in the Universe?\n\nThis is one of those subjects on which people will disagree. Why? Simply because we can't actually count the exact number of stars in the universe. In fact, it is impossible to count the stars that make up our particular solar system. There is general agreement among astronomers that there are billions of stars in the universe, however.\n\nHuman beings began to wonder about this subject many centuries ago. Early astronomers first looked using their eyes then eventually got some help from basic telescopes. With their own calculations and with help from mathematicians the first scientists tried to come up with estimates. In past centuries it may have been easier to actually see more stars because there was less man-made light on the Earth to interfere. On very clear nights in rural areas today it is still possible to see more stars. Modern telescopes have brought many more stars into view.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that stars are grouped together in what we call galaxies. This makes it easier to see lots of stars. If they were widely scattered over the universe it would seem as if there were fewer stars. But with stars gathered in galaxies we can see millions upon millions of stars quite easily. The most recent estimates by astronomers (educated guesses) put the number of stars in our galaxy alone at 100 billion. (The galaxy that contains our sun and planets is called the Milky Way.) With billions of stars in each galaxy there are billions of billions of stars in the universe!\n\nOne of the most accurate methods for counting the stars in the universe is called mapping. Astronomers view a definite section of the sky and count the stars in that part, then multiply the number actually counted by the number of similar-size areas in the sky to get close to a total number. This is only a representative number, however. From this, astronomers try to estimate the number of galaxies in the universe and multiply that number by the star count in the Milky Way.\n\nIn recent years, the ability to put scientific instruments into space for a closer look has resulted in more accurate star counts. Not only that but satellites and cameras launched into space provide other information about stars. Scientists are even able to study the light levels of different stars and add stars to the count. Some of these stars were not visible before, even with the best telescopes.\n\nWhy is it important to know how many stars there are in the universe? It's not particularly crucial to the existence of life on Earth (at least not directly). But human beings have always been curious about what the universe is made of. We have always been intrigued about our place in the vast expanse of space. Counting the stars is one part of the overall knowledge human beings seek. For the Universe, the galaxies are our small representative volumes, and there are something like 1011 to 1012 stars in our galaxy, and there are perhaps something like 1011 or 1012 galaxies. So we can say that galaxies, on average have between 100 billion and 1 trillion numbers of stars."}

An inner ring of younger stars (light blue) also orbits the black hole. The stellar disks may drag swirling gas close enough to the black hole to be consumed. Credit: A. Field, NASA, ESA.\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- At the center of most galaxies lie supermassive black holes that can grow to become more than a billion times larger than our Sun. However, astrophysicists don't fully understand the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes - specifically, how swirling gas from the galaxy loses its large angular momentum to allow it to be consumed by the black hole.\n\nIn a new study, astrophysicists Philip Hopkins and Eliot Quataert from the University of California, Berkeley, have proposed an explanation for how gas loses its angular momentum and successfully crosses the last 30 light years to the black hole. Their idea stems from previous observations that the supermassive black hole in the center of the Andromeda galaxy is orbited by an old lopsided stellar disk. Hopkins and Quataert suggest that when gas flows toward a black hole, it initially forms this stellar disk due to gravitational instabilities.\n\nEventually, the stellar disk grows in size to stretch over a distance of dozens of light years from the center of the galaxy. Once it becomes large enough, its eccentric shape pulls unevenly on the incoming gas. This torque causes different gas streams to collide, reducing the gas' momentum and allowing it to flow close enough to the black hole (less than one light year) to allow the black hole's gravity to dominate and swallow the gas. The researchers' simulations showed that this process could enable black holes to consume several solar masses of gas each year, which could have helped Andromeda's black hole to gain much of its mass.\n\nSince Andromeda is not a unique galaxy, other supermassive black holes may also have orbiting stellar disks that transport the angular momentum of gas to the black hole's vicinity, helping to \"feed\" the black hole. In addition, the eccentric stellar disk's self-gravitational forces might reveal insight into active galactic nuclei and the cosmic X-ray background.\n\nMore information: Philip Hopkins and Eliot Quataert. \"The Nuclear Stellar Disk in Andromeda: A Fossil from the Era of Black Hole Growth.\" Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

The Euclid mission, to which they have been appointed, is an initiative to build a space-based telescope to better study how dark matter and dark energy manifest themselves.\n\nHo and Mandelbaum are assistant professors of physics and members of CMU's Bruce and Astrid McWilliams Center for Cosmology. They are among 40 researchers newly selected to join the elite U.S. team that will participate in both building and launching the space-based telescope.\n\nEuclid is part of the European Space Agency (ESA). NASA is working in conjunction with the ESA, and will support the researchers from 2013 to 2028 as they prepare for and carry out collaborative scientific research using the data gathered by Euclid, which is planned for launch in 2020.\n\nThough they make up 95 percent of the matter and energy in the universe, dark matter and dark energy cannot be seen; their presence can only be detected by their effects on things we can see and measure, like stars and galaxies. Euclid would not only be a telescope, but would also be outfitted with imaging and spectroscopic instruments to study the \"expansion history\" of the universe in various ways. This is where the expertise of Ho and Mandelbaum come into play.\n\nMandelbaum studies the slight distortions in the images of galaxies through telescopes, which are caused by the gravitational pull of dark matter, called weak gravitational lensing. This type of measurement allows researchers to derive how much dark matter lies between galaxies and how it is distributed throughout space specializes in redshift space distortions \u2014 changes in light wavelength as the object emitting light moves away from the observer \u2014 and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), which are essentially echoes of sound waves.

{"text":"How do we determine the life cycles of stars and tag some as \"young\" and some as \"old?\"\n\nOnly the fusion of hydrogen into helium can\nprovide enough energy to power most stars. In our models we find that choosing how much helium (and the trace amount of heavier elements)\nalmost completely determines a star's temperature and luminosity. The models that fit Red Giant's characteristics suggest that they are mostly\nhelium inside and so they must be old; the hydrogen in their cores has already been turned into helium. The models that fit White Dwarfs low\nluminosity and temperatures best suggest that no energy generation is taking place and that their cores are made of elements heavier than helium.\n\nWHITE DWARFS\n\nSo, in the end, we can make an educated guess\nabout the age of a star by the core composition of the model that fits best--and the time it would take the hydrogen to turn into the helium. This\ntakes billions of years for main sequences stars like the Sun. To turn helium into carbon and heavier elements takes much less time (only a few\nhundred million to a billion years), and it is these models that fit the observed characteristics of Red Giant stars best. So we conclude that Red\nGiants are old stars, which don't have much lifetime left.\n\nFor hydrogen-burning stars on the main sequence, such as the Sun, there is another\nway to narrow down an age. Just as the Sun has an 11 year sunspot cycle, stars also have activity cycles; they have many \"star-spots\" sometimes,\nand a few at other times. These cycles are detectable by looking for the spectral features that active surface regions emit, such as the emission lines\nof the common element calcium. Models suggest that the activity of a star, and the brightness of these spectral features, declines as a star ages.\nHence, one way of determining a main sequence star's age is to measure how bright these activity-sensitive spectral features are.\n\nHow about\nthe age of a White Dwarf star? These stars aren't making their own energy anymore, and only shine because they are still hot from their hydrogen\nand helium burning phases. They are so small and so hot that it takes billions of years for them to cool to the temperature of interstellar space,\nwhich is just a few degrees above absolute zero.\n\nThink of a cup of coffee. When first poured, it is very hot, but as time goes on the temperature\nfalls. If you know how fast a cup of coffee cools, you can measure its present temperature and determine how long it has been since it was poured.\nThe color of a White Dwarf is easy to measure, and it directly tells us its temperature. The redder it is, the cooler it is--therefore the older it is.\n\nCuriously, we find no White Dwarfs cooler than about 4,000 Kelvins. It takes a White Dwarf about 10 billion years to cool to this temperature.\nSo we conclude that even the first generation of stars in our galaxy, whose remnants are now White Dwarfs, have not had a chance to cool below\n4,000 Kelvins. By that reckoning, the galaxy, and hence the whole universe, must be at least 10 billion years"}

The Bolshoi simulation traces how the largest galaxies and galaxy structures in the universe were formed billions of years ago. Collaboration with astrophysicists at New Mexico State University Las Cruces, New Mexico and the University of California High-Performance Astrocomputing Center (UC-HIPACC), Santa Cruz, California ran the Bolshoi code on Pleiades for 18 days, which consumed millions of hours of computer time, and generated enormous amounts of data.\n\n\"NASA installs systems like Pleiades, that are able to run single jobs that span tens of thousands of processors, to facilitate scientific discovery,\" said William Thigpen, systems and engineering branch chief in the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) Division at NASA's Ames Research Center. \"The Bolshoi simulation is an excellent example of work done in support of NASA's science goal to understand how stars, galaxies and planets are formed, in order to get a picture of how the universe has changed over billions of years,\" Thigpen added.\n\nPleiades' new graphics processing units came from NVIDIA, Corp. and this greatly sped up parts of the Bolshoi calculations.\n\n\"Being able to tap into the power and speed of Pleiades has improved the Bolshoi simulation in every respect,\" said Joel Primack, director of the University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center (UC-HIPACC) and co-investigator on two studies reporting on the simulation results, slated for publication in the Astrophysical Journal in October. \"In addition, ultra-high-resolution images and animations created by NAS visualization experts have provided the basis for imaging and interpreting our latest simulation results,\" Primack said"}

{"text":"Gamma Ray Bursts, The Most devastating Blasts in the Cosmos\n\nWith the power only to the Big Bang itself, shining with the luminosity of a billion, trillion Suns, an event with such intensity it could wipe out life on Earth of one were to off in our galactic neighbourhood. The gamma ray burst is the biggest outpouring of energy in the known universe caused when the most gigantic stars in the universe end their lives in a hypernova. The gamma ray burst is the birth cry of a massive black hole emerging into existence.\n\nWhen one of these stars eventually starts running out of fuel in its core, it stars shedding material from it's outer layers. When all the fuel in the core runs out, the star cannot support itself so all matter is pulled inwards creating runaway gravity and a spinning black hole is formed in the core. This spinning black hole has so much energy that two narrow jets of material shoot out from above and below the monstrous gravity in the core. These jets then burst out through the star's surface travelling at 99.995% of light speed.\n\nThis highly concentrated narrow beam escapes from the self destructing star and slams into the surrounding gas clouds and interstellar medium, causing it to glow extremely brightly. This is the afterglow of the gamma ray burst that can be seen with telescopes and last for days or even weeks after. The actual burst itself only lasts for milliseconds or seconds, yet in this short space of time more energy is released than our Sun will emit in 10 billion years.\n\nWhen the jets are pointing towards Earth we can pick them up, The Hete-2 Satellite is designed especially for this and can detect and localize bursts, studying them instantly for gamma rays and x-rays. Gamma ray bursts are actually very common and one goes off most days in the universe, but they are all at vast distances away usually billions of light years. Although they happen most days in the universe this makes them actaully very rare because considering the billions of galaxies out there, one a day in the cosmos isn't very much. So the likely hood of a gamma ray burst going off in an average galaxy like the Milky Way is about 1 every 100,000 to 1,000,000 years, and if one were to go off in the Milky Way tomorrow then the jet would have to be pointed towards Earth to pose a danger. But if one was in the neighbourhood and one of the jets was pointed at Earth it would wreak havoc with the atmosphere and natural systems of our planet causing a mass extinction.\n\nThere are some very dangerous and destructive phenomena out there in the cosmos and these beasts are top of the list. Like thermonuclear flash bulbs they have the power to wipe out life on nearby planets, sterilising their local galactic environment, and stopping emerging civilisation in their tracks. In our Galaxy there are no obvious contenders for a gamma ray blast in the Sun's vicinity so we are pretty safe.\n\nAs with a lot of discoveries gamma ray bursts in space were found by accident. In the 1960\u2032s the world was a bit jittery over what countries had the nuclear bomb, and what they were intending to do with their new toys. Satellites started to get put into orbit to keep an eye on other countries making sure they weren't carrying out secret tests. These were the Vela Satellites launched in 1967 and were designed to detect the gamma rays emitted during a nuclear explosion. Horror ensued when strong gamma ray sources started to be detected going off at random points. But horror soon turned to bewilderment when it was realised that the sources of the outbursts were not from the Russians on Earth, but coming from deep space and at random points in the sky.\n\nIt was at this point that the mystery was handed over to the astronomers to puzzle over. But at this point nobody knew what these strange and powerful events were. All types of explanations were put forward, neutron stars colliding, black holes merging. Finally in 1997 the first visible after glow and x-rays were measured, including the gamma ray burst's redshift to work out distance. It was at this point that these events were at vast distances away, and associated with the deaths of the most gigantic stars in the universe."}
{"text":"Four billion years from now, the Milky Way galaxy as we know it will cease to exist.\n\nOur Milky Way is bound for a head-on collision with the similar-sized Andromeda galaxy, researchers announced on Thursday. Over time, the huge galactic smashup will create an entirely new hybrid galaxy, one likely bearing an elliptical shape rather than the Milky Way's trademark spiral-armed diskWe do know of other galaxies in the local universe around us that are in the process of colliding and merging,\" Roeland van der Marel, of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, told reporters. \"However, what makes the future merger of the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way so special is that it will happen to us.\"\n\nAstronomers have long known that the Milky Way and Andromeda, which is also known as M31, are barrelling toward one another at a speed of about 250,000 mph (400,000 kilometers per hour). They have also long suspected that the two galaxies may slam into each other billions of years down the road. [Milky Way Slams Into Andromeda (Artist Images)]\n\nHowever, such discussions of the future galactic crash have always remained somewhat speculative, because no one had managed to measure Andromeda's sideways motion \u2014 a key component of that galaxy's path through space.\n\nThat's no longer the case.\n\nVan der Marel and his colleagues used NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to observe select regions of Andromeda repeatedly over a seven-year period. They were able to measure the galaxy's sideways (or tangential) motion, and they found that Andromeda and the Milky Way are indeed bound for a direct hit.\n\nThat merger, van der Marel added, begins in 4 billion years and will be complete about 6 billion years from now.\n\nA future cosmic crash\nSuch a dramatic event has never occurred in the long history of our Milky Way, which likely began taking shape about 13.5 billion years ago.\n\n\"The Milky Way has had, probably, quite a lot of small, minor mergers,\" said Rosemary Wyse of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who was not affiliated with the new study. \"But this major merger will be unprecedented.\"\n\nThe merger poses no real danger of destroying Earth or our solar system, researchers said. The stretches of empty space separating the stars in the two galaxies will remain vast, making any collisions or serious perturbations unlikely.\n\nHowever, our solar system will likely get booted out to a different position in the new galaxy, which some astronomers have dubbed the \"Milkomeda galaxy.\" Simulations show that we'll probably occupy a spot much farther from the galactic core than we do today, researchers said.\n\nA new night sky\nThe collision will change our night sky dramatically. If any humans are still around 3.75 billion years from now, they'll see Andromeda fill their field of view as it sidles up next to our own Milky Way. For the next few billion years after that, stargazers will be spellbound by the merger, which will trigger intense bouts of star formation.\n\nFinally, by about 7 billion years from now, the bright core of the elliptical Milkomeda galaxy will dominate the night sky, researchers said. (The odds of viewing this sight, at least from Earth, are pretty slim, since the sun is predicted to bloat into a huge red giant 5 billion or 6 billion years from now.)\n\nIn its 22-year history, Hubble has revolutionized the way humanity views the cosmos. The new finding is another step in that process, researchers said.\n\n\"What's really exciting about the current measurements is, it's not about historical astronomy; it's not about looking back in time, understanding the expansion of the universe,\" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate and a former astronaut who flew on three space shuttle missions that repaired Hubble .\n\n\"It's looking forward in time, which is another very human story,\" Grunsfeld added. \"We like to know about our past \u2014 where did we come from?

{"text":"Tuesday, January 12, 2010\n\nBy using interferometry, an international team led by an astronomer of Paris Observatory (LESIA) obtained an unprecedented image of the surface of the red supergiant Betelgeuse, in the constellation of Orion. The image reveals the presence of two giant bright spots, whose size is equivalent to the distance Earth-Sun: they cover a large fraction of the surface. It is a first strong and direct indication of the presence of phenomena of convection, transport of heat by the moving matter, in a star other than the Sun. This result allows to better understand the structure and the evolution of supergiants.\n\nBetelgeuse is a red supergiant located in the constellation of Orion. This star is quite different from our Sun: 600 times larger in dimension, it radiates approximately 100 000 times more energy. But following the Sun, this type of object also reveals a surface with bright and dark spots, i.e. hotter and colder spots. These structures would be mainly due to the phenomenon of convection, i.e. the transport of heat by the matter currents. This phenomenon is observed every day in the boiling water. On the surface of the Sun, these spots are rather well-known and visible. However, it is not at all the case for other stars and in particular the supergiants. The size, the physical characteristics and the life time of these dynamical structures remain unknown.\n\nFigure 1: The surface of Betelgeuse in near infrared at 1.64 micron in wavelength, obtained with the interferometre IOTA (Arizona). The image has been re-constructed with two different algorithms, which yield the same details, of 9 mas (milli-arcsecond). The star diametre is about 40 mas.\n\nOther images of less quality, of Betelgeuse surface had already been obtained in the past. They were primarily models of the surface constrained from the interferometric data. Now, the researchers have a true image whose richness exceeds what is possible to imagine from a model. For the first time, one can say that two spots are present and determine the size of the largest. Perhaps this difference in dimension correspond to different physical phenomena.\n\nThe analysis of the brightness of the spots shows a variation of 500 degrees compared to the average temperature of the star (3 600 Kelvins). The largest of the two structures has a dimension equivalent to the quarter of the star diametre (or one and a half the distance Earth-Sun). This marks a clear difference with the Sun where the cells of convection are much finer and reach hardly 1\/20th of the solar radius (a few Earth radius). These characteristics are compatible with the idea of luminous spots produced by the convection. These results constitute a first strong and direct indication of the presence of convection on the surface of a star other than the Sun."}

It showcases galaxies of several types, from elegant grand design spirals to more patchy flocculent spirals. Some of the galaxies have roundish centers, while others have elongated central bars. The orientation of the galaxies varies as well, with some seeming to peer straight back at us in the face-on configuration while others point to the side, appearing edge-on.

For a larger version of this image please go here.\n\nby Staff Writers Pasadena CA (JPL) May 26, 2011\nAn assorted mix of colorful galaxies is being released by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer mission, or WISE. The nine galaxies are a taste of what's to come. The mission plans to release similar images for the 1,000 largest galaxies that appear in our sky, and possibly more.\n\n\"Galaxies come in all sorts of delicious flavors,\" said Tom Jarrett, a WISE team member at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center, California Institute of Technology, in Pasadena, who studies our Milky Way's neighboring galaxies. \"Our first sample shows what WISE is capable of. We can produce spectacular high-resolution images of the largest galaxies.\"\n\nThe new collage showcases galaxies of varying types - everything from \"grand design spirals,\" with their elegant cinnamon bun-like swirling arms, to so-called \"flocculent\" galaxies, which have a more patchy appearance.\n\nThey are close enough to us that WISE can see details of their structure, for example their sinuous arms and central bulges. Because WISE can study so many types of nearby galaxies, its observations will provide a better understanding of how these complex objects form and evolve.\n\nWISE, which launched into space in Dec. 2009, scanned the whole sky one-and-a-half times in infrared light. It captured images of asteroids in our own solar system, distant galaxies billions of light-years away, and everything in between.\n\nThe mission's first batch of data, which does not include all of the galaxies in the new collage, was released to the public in April of this year. The complete WISE catalog will follow a year later, in the spring of 2012.\n\n\"We can learn about a galaxy's stars - where are they forming and how fast?\" said Jarrett. \"There's so much diversity in galaxies to explore.\"\n\nThe new collection of nine galaxies shows off this diversity, with members of different sizes, colors and shapes. Infrared light from the galaxies, which we can't see with our eyes, has been translated into visible-light colors that we can see. Blue colors show older populations of stars, while yellow indicates dusty areas where stars are forming.\n\nSome of the galaxies are oriented toward us nearly face-on, such as Messier 83, and others are partly angled away from us, for example Messier 81. One galaxy, NGC 5907, is oriented completely edge-on, so that all we can see is its profile. The edge of its main galaxy disk appears pencil-thin, and its halo of surrounding stars is barely visible as a green glow above and below the disk.\n\nThe arms of the galaxies come in different shapes too. Messier 51 has arms that look like a spiral lollipop, while the arms of the flocculent galaxy NGC 2403 look choppy, perhaps more like layered frosting. Astronomers think that gravitational interactions with companion galaxies may lead to more well-defined spiral arms. One such companion can be seen near Messier 51 in blue. Some of the galaxies also have spokes, or spurs, that join the arms together, such as those in IC 342.\n\nExpanded VLA flexing new scientific muscle Tempe NM (SPX) May 25, 2011\nA new and uniquely powerful tool for cutting-edge science is emerging on the crisp, high desert of western New Mexico.

{"text":"Chandra Observatory Shows Milky Way Enveloped in Gas\n\n\"The mass of the Milky Way gas envelope is comparable to the combined mass of the rest of the galaxy and, if confirmed, could explain the \"missing baryon\" problem in physics.\"\n\nAstronomers at NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory have found evidence that the entire Milky Way Galaxy is surrounded by a sheath of hot gas extending for hundreds of thousands of light years in all directions. The mass of this envelope is comparable to the combined mass of the rest of the galaxy and, if confirmed, could explain the \"missing baryon\" problem in physics.\n\nBaryons are the sub-atomic particles, comprised of quarks, that make up about 99.9% of the mass of the universe. Notable examples of baryons are protons and neutrons, which in turn are the most common baryons. Electrons are not formed from quarks, and as such are made up of leptons instead of baryons. Observations of extremely distant galaxies and gas halos show that scientists cannot account for about half the baryons observed in those far-off objects in our own time period.\n\nA recent study by five astronomers used information from Chandra, the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton space observatory, and Japan's Suzaku satellite to measure the temperature and size of the halo of gas. By measuring the X-rays absorbed by sources located hundreds of millions of light years from the galaxy, they were able to determine that the temperature of the gas surrounding the galaxy clocks in somewhere between 1 and 2.5 million kelvins, several hundred times hotter than the surface of our sun. This is much hotter than earlier measurements of the gas surrounding the galaxy, and this evidence points toward the conclusion that the gas halo is much more massive than previously thought.\n\n\"According to these measurements, the mass of the gas could be greater than that of more than 10 billion suns, or could even reach a mass as large as 60 billion suns.\" farther into the surrounding local group of galaxies. Either way, its mass appears to be very large.\"\n\nAccording to these measurements, the mass of the gas could be greater than that of more than 10 billion suns, or could even reach a mass as large as 60 billion suns. This uncertainty depends on certain factors that are not yet measured, such as the amount of oxygen relative to hydrogen, the most common element in the gas cloud. The estimated density of this cloud is very low, however, which is why it had escaped detection until relatively recently.\n\nFor more on NASA's findings on the Milky Way, head over to their website.\n\nThomas Anderson\n\nThomas spends most of his day reading and complaining about people he sees on the Internet.

Zeta Ophiuchi is actually a very massive, hot, bright blue star plowing its way through a large cloud of interstellar dust and gas.\nAstronomers theorize that this stellar juggernaut was likely once part of a binary star system with an even more massive partner. It's believed that when the partner exploded as a supernova, blasting away most of its mass, Zeta Ophiuchi was suddenly freed from its partner's pull and shot away like a bullet moving 24 kilometers per second (54,000 miles per hour).\nZeta Ophiuchi is about 20 times more massive and 65,000 times more luminous than the sun. If it weren't surrounded by so much dust, it would be one of the brightest stars in the sky and appear blue to the eye. It's already about halfway through its very short 8-million-year lifespan. In comparison, the sun is roughly halfway through its 10-billion-year lifespan. While the sun will eventually become a quiet white dwarf, Zeta Ophiuchi, like its ex-partner, will ultimately die in a massive explosion called a supernova.\nThe most interesting features in this image are related to the interstellar gas and dust that surrounds Zeta Ophiuchi.

In part, this is because the dusty, star-forming spiral disk in M104 is seen nearly edge-on from our point of view. M104 also has a large, ball-shaped bulge component of older stars, seen here in blue.\nThe large, fuzzy grouping of stars at the center of the lower left panel is the galaxy Messier 60, or M60. This galaxy does not have a spiral disk, just a bulge, making it a massive elliptical galaxy. M60 is about 20 percent larger than the Milky Way galaxy, and lies in the Virgo cluster of galaxies. The brighter dense spot inside but off-center from the blue core of M60 is a separate spiral galaxy called NGC 4647.\nRecent evidence suggests there is a black hole at the center of M60 with a mass of about 4.5 billion times that of the sun, making it one of the largest black holes known.\nThe galaxy in the lower right panel is Messier 51, or NGC 5194, also frequently referred to as the Whirlpool galaxy. The Whirlpool is a \"grand design\" spiral galaxy. It is interacting with its smaller companion -- NGC 5195, a dwarf galaxy, which can be seen as a bright spot near the tip of the spiral arm extending up and to the right of the larger galaxy. The Whirpool's very bright spiral arms show areas of compressed dust and gas.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nExplosion of Infrared Light\n\nA circular rainbow appears like a halo around an exploded star in this new view of the IC 443 nebula from NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE.\nWhen massive stars die, they explode in tremendous blasts, called supernova, which send out shock waves. The shock waves sweep up and heat surrounding gas and dust, creating supernova remnants like the one pictured here. The supernova in IC 443 happened somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 years ago.\nIn this WISE image, infrared light has been color-coded to reveal what our eyes cannot see. The colors differ primarily because materials surrounding the supernova remnant vary in density. When the shock waves hit these materials, different gases were triggered to release a mix of infrared wavelengths.\nIC 443 can be found near the star Eta Geminorum, which lies near Castor, one of the twins in the constellation Gemini.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nLagoon Nebula\n\nThis colorful picture is a mosaic of the Lagoon nebula taken by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE. Normally, you would expect a lagoon to be filled with water, but this nebula is composed of clouds of gas and dust in which new stars are forming.\nAlso known as Messier 8, or simply M8, the Lagoon nebula is seen here as a large circular cloud in the center of the image, surrounded by innumerable stars.\nLagoon nebula can be found in constellation Sagittarius. Distance measurements to this nebula vary widely, from 4,000 to 6,500 light-years away from Earth. At the center of the Lagoon nebula is the star Herschel 36.\nM8 is a favorite target for amateur astronomers because it can be easily seen with binoculars or a small telescope. Astronomers have identified several different parts of the Lagoon nebula, including M8E, a young stellar object, and the star clusters NGC 6523 and NGC 6530.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nNeighbor Galaxy\n\nThis image shows of one of our closest neighboring galaxies, Messier 33. Also named the Triangulum galaxy (after the constellation it's found in), M33 is one of largest members in our small neighborhood of galaxies -- the Local Group.\nThe Local Group consists of about 30 galaxies that are gravitationally bound and travel together through the universe. M33 is the third largest member of the Local Group, dwarfed only by the Andromeda galaxy (M31) and our very own home galaxy, the Milky Way.\nM33 is extremely close as far as galaxies go, residing only 3 million light-years away. Star-forming regions are easy to spot in infrared (green and red areas in this image).\nThe bright yellow-orange 'blobs' scattered throughout M33 are areas where stars are forming at an especially intense rate. The largest one in the spiral arm to the upper left has its own name, NGC 604.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nChasing Chickens in Lambda Centauri Nebula\n\nThis infrared image from WISE shows the Lambda Centauri nebula, a star-forming cloud in our Milky Way galaxy, also known as the Running Chicken nebula. The nebula, cataloged as IC 2944, is about 5,800 light-years from Earth and is home to a new cluster of stars born from the cloud nearly 8 million years ago.\nThe hottest members of the cluster produce enough ultraviolet radiation and strong winds to convert the cloud into ions and excavate it. The ionized gas glows in visible light, but in infrared light we see the dust in the cloud warmed by the very same radiation. The red, glowing dust is the coolest material visible in this image and is composed of metallic dust grains.\nThe greenish components in the image are warmer dust grains composed of smog-like materials. The large green ring-like structure near the middle of the image is some 77 light-years across and was formed when materials that created the stars in the clusters were blown back by the combined winds of the stars.\nThe nebula gets its common name because in some visible light images it resembles a running chicken. It is also called the Lambda Centauri nebula because it appears to surround the bright star Lambda Centauri. Lambda Centauri is one of the brightest stars in the constellation Centaurus.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nCosmic Cocoon\n\nThe aptly named Cocoon nebula is featured in this image from NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE. This cloud of dust and gas, cataloged as IC 5416 and located in the constellation Cygnus, is wrapped in a dark cloud of dust called Barnard 168. Within this cocoon of dust and gas, new stars are forming and beginning to emerge into the wild.\nIn the heart of the nebula, which looks surprisingly like a Valentine's heart in WISE's view, massive new stars are emerging. The intense radiation from these stars heats up the cloud. The highest-energy light from the stars rips electrons from hydrogen atoms, which then recombine with the atoms and emit visible light.\nThe dusty cocoon extends over 45 light-years across, which is more than three times larger than the inner, glowing portion of the nebula.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nThe Dark Heart of the King\n\nWISE captured this image of a hidden star-forming cloud of dust and gas located in the constellation of Cepheus. Cepheus, father of Andromeda, was a mythological king in the ancient Greek world. This image of dark nebulae lies near the heart of the king, as imagined by ancient Greek astronomers.\nThe dust in these nebulae blocks visible light passing through, and the cloud and its contents are mostly hidden when viewed in visible light.\nThe central portion is known as IRAS 22298+6505. IRAS stands for Infrared Astronomical Satellite, a predecessor to WISE and an international satellite that mapped the sky in infrared light in the 1980s. Other portions of this cloud are called TGU H686 P2 and LDN 1213. As with IRAS, the first letters of these objects refer to astronomical catalogs.\nWhat looked like distinct nebulae in those surveys are revealed as a much larger cloud complex by WISE. This complex spans about 120 light-years across and is located about 2,500 light-years away at the edge of a spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy, called the Orion spur.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nA Spiral Galaxy is Visited by a Trojan War Hero\n\nIt's a bird! It's a plane! Nope, it's an asteroid tracking its way across the sky with a beautiful spiral galaxy in the background. In the center of this new mosaic image captured by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is the galaxy Messier 74, with its spiral arms seen face-on.\nThe bright reddish object moving across the lower right part of the image is the much closer asteroid 3540 Protesilaos, seen at different points in its orbit around the sun.\nAlso known as NGC 628, the Messier 74 galaxy is between 24.5 and 36 million light-years away, and has a diameter of about 100,000 light-years. It is suspected to have a black hole at its center, with a mass equal to 10,000 suns.\nBy convention, Trojan asteroids are named after the heroes from the Trojan War. In this case, asteroid 3540 is named after the hero Protesilaos.\nAccording to Greek mythology, Protesilaos was the first Greek to set foot on Trojan land during the war. Unfortunately for him, there was a prophecy that the first soldier in the war to step onto land from a battle ship would die. The prophecy quickly came true and Protesilaos was killed."}

Previously, the largest known was found at the center of the galaxy M87, measuring 6.6 billion solar masses, also measured using the Gemini North telescope.\n\nAll large galaxies are thought to have a supermassive black hole at the center, including our own, the Milky Way. That black hole, Sagittarius A Star, is thought to be at least 2.6 million solar masses and up to 4 million solar masses.\n\nAnd many more questions have been sparked by the finding of the new black holes, chief among them: How did they get so large? Either due to sucking up stellar gas, which they are no longer doing, or from the merging of two galaxies into one larger galaxyAlso, are these two black holes rare giants or just the first of a whole crowd of previously unknown supermassive black holes?\n\nThose answers are still floating out there in space.\n\nThe team's research was funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and UC Berkeley's Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science."}

Just how many very large galaxies do the authors believe collide in 100,000 years?\n\nWho's Doing The Math?\n\nWed Mar 05 01:44:37 GMT 2008 by Charles\n\nIsn't the number of galaxies in the visible universe of the order of 10^10? If so, for there to be 10^5 of these things visible, would that mean one a collision per year? Or would it? Anyway, someone with a more mathematical background can surely work it out quite easily!\n\nWho's Doing The Math?\n\nThu Mar 06 22:46:42 GMT 2008 by Cyrus\n\nI think it's time you pulled your heads out of your math-holes.\n\nFirst of all, there are 10^10 galaxies in the visible universe, not 10^10 super-massive black holes, as only those galaxies at least as big as the Milky Way are supposed to contain them (assuming they exist at all). Second, the interaction of galaxies do not follow gas laws. Perhaps you haven't been paying attention, but it now known that the universe's galactic superclusters are accelerating away from from each other, whilst the galactic superclusters themselves are, generally speaking, static. Estimating that there is 1 collision annually is ludicrous. If, in the future life of the universe, a single collision of super-massive black holes occured, it would be nothing short of a miracle. Third, maybe you didn't notice, but each super-massive black hole is surrounded by an enormous galaxy of around 10^10 stars. Does anyone really believe that you will see this infrared afterglow through the infrared light given off by all these stars? We can't even see the center of our own galaxy! Finally, if such a collision were to give off more energy than produced by all the visible stars in the observable universe in an instant, as postulated, do you really think any intelligent beings would be left in the universe to view the afterglow?\n\nWho's Doing The Math?\n\nWow, Cyrus, your rudeness is matched only by your impressive ignorance (but isn't that so often the case?).\n\nAs a matter of fact,\n\nYES, all those galaxies are expected to host black holes.\n\nYES, those galaxies and their central black holes collide all the time, especially those in clusters, which are anything but static.\n\nYES, we can easily see the black holes, which in many galaxies are far brighter than all the stars combined (our sun gives off 10^33 ergs\/sec, but a quasar shines at 10^46 ergs\/sec or more!)\n\nand NO, the energy from such a collision would not kill us all because it is in the form of gravitational waves, which couple only very weakly to matter--that's why they are so hard to see in the first place!\n\nWho's Doing The Math?\n\nNO, super massive black holes do NOT collide all the time. When spiral galaxies interact to form the globular type (which does not happen annually), there are very few actual collisions of bodies, and certainly there is NO evidence of their centers colliding.\n\nNO, we can't \"see\" black holes and NO they are not bright - we only can only surmise their existence by the energy given off by their accretion disks.\n\nNO, just because a quasar outshines our sun, does not imply that the infrared afterglow will outshine the half trillion stars surrounding it.\n\nAnd how can you be so sure that a gravitational wave carrying energy equivalent to all the visible enrgy in the universe won't kill us?"}

{"text":"Science News\n\nRare Quasar Discovered That Produces More X-Rays Than Thought Possible\n\nApr. 8, 2008 \u2014 XMM-Newton has been surprised by a rare type of galaxy, from which it has detected a higher number of X-rays than thought possible. The observation gives new insight into the powerful processes shaping galaxies during their formation and evolution.\n\nShare This:\n\nScientists working with XMM-Newton were looking into the furthest reaches of the universe, at celestial objects called quasars. These are vast cosmic engines that pump energy into their surroundings. It is thought an enormous black hole drives each quasar.\n\nAs matter falls into the black hole, it collects in a swirling reservoir called the accretion disc, which heats up. Computer simulations suggest that powerful radiation and magnetic fields present in the region eject some of gas from the gravitational clutches of the black hole, throwing it back into space.\n\nThis outflow has a profound effect on its surrounding galaxy. It can create turbulence in the gas throughout the galaxy, hampering star formation. Thus, understanding quasars is an important step to understanding the early history of galaxies.\n\nHowever, the structure surrounding a quasar is difficult to see because they are so distant. The light and X-rays from them takes thousands of millions of years to reach us.\n\nAbout 10-20% of quasars are of a special type called BAL quasars. The BAL stands for 'broad absorption line' and seems to indicate that a thick cocoon of gas surrounds the quasar.\n\nMost researchers believe that gas flows away from a BAL quasar along the equatorial direction of the accretion disc. These quasars show little X-ray emission, indicating that there is enough gas to absorb most of the X-rays given out from the region near the black hole.\n\nBut some BAL quasars appear to be spewing material out along their polar axes, at right angles to the accretion discs.\n\nJunXian Wang, Center for Astrophysics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, and his colleagues including Tinggui Wang and Hongyan Zhou, used XMM-Newton to target four such polar BAL quasars, identified by them previously. They were investigating whether the X-rays were being absorbed strongly.\n\nXMM-Newton observed the quasars at specific times during 2006 and 2007. Two of them emitted more X-rays than the researchers anticipated, indicating that there is no veil of absorbing gas surrounding these particular quasars. \"Our results can help refine the computer simulations of how these quasars work,\" says Wang.\n\nIt may mean that BAL quasars are more complicated than originally thought. \"Perhaps there can be both equatorial outflows and polar outflows simultaneously from these objects,\" says Wang. Maybe, the outflows are even produced by similar means.\n\nComputer simulations suggest that the polar outflows, like the gas ejected from the accretion disc, are also material falling in, turned away by fierce radiation before it comes near the black hole.\n\nWang and colleagues are now following this work up. They hope to monitor more BAL quasars over a longer period of time. \"We need more data so that we can look into the details of the X-ray emission,\" says Wang.\n\nIt seems that the more astronomers look into the distant universe, the more complex it becomes.\n\nThe findings appear in 'XMM observations of BAL Quasars with polar outflows' by J. Wang, P. Jiang, H. Zhou, T. Wang, X. Dong, and H. Wang, published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters on `20 March 2008.\n\nArtist's impression of a rare type of quasar, called a broad absorption line (BAL) quasar.

We can then study the formation of the Antennae's most impressive fireworks and look into the cores of the giant molecular clouds where the star clusters are born.\"\n\nThe giant telescope is situated at the border of Chile and Bolivia and is placed at 10,000 feet high. The giant telescope which is connected to a supercomputer will measure the light at millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelength due to which it will able to examine the cosmos better than any other telescope.\n\nThe North American Alma Project Manager from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Mark McKinnon said, \"Alma's test views of the Antennae show us star forming regions on a level of detail that no other telescope on Earth or in space has attained.

{"text":"Making the invisible visible\n\n universe, from the Milky Way up to extremely distant galaxies. LUCIFER 1 has been built by a consortium of German institutes and will be followed by an identical twin instrument that will be delivered to the telescope in early 2011.\n\nLUCIFER's innovative design allows astronomers to observe in unprecedented detail, for example, star forming regions which are commonly hidden by dust clouds. The instrument provides unrivaled flexibility, with features such as a unique robotic arm that can replace spectroscopic masks within the instrument's extreme sub-zero environment.\n\nLUCIFER and its twin are mounted at the focus points of the LBT's two giant 8.4-metre (27.6 foot) diameter telescope mirrors. Each instrument is cooled to a chilly -213 degrees Celsius in order to observe in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range. Near-infrared observations are essential for understanding the formation of stars and planets in our galaxy as well as revealing the secrets of the most distant and very young galaxies.\n\nLUCIFER is a remarkable new multi-purpose instrument with great flexibility combining a large field of view with a high resolution. It provides three exchangeable cameras for imaging and spectroscopy in different resolutions according to observational requirements. Besides its outstanding imaging capability which presently makes use of 18 high-quality filters, LUCIFER allows the simultaneous spectroscopy of about two dozen objects in the infrared through laser-cut slit-masks. For highest flexibility the masks can be changed even at the cryogenic temperatures, through the innovative development of a unique robotic mask grabber which places the individual masks with absolute precision into the focal plane.\n\n\"Together with the large light gathering power of the LBT, astronomers are now able to collect the spectral fingerprints of the faintest and most distant objects in the universe.\" says Richard Green, the Director of the LBT. \"After completion of the LBT adaptive secondary mirror system to correct for atmospheric perturbation, LUCIFER will show its full capability by delivering images with a quality that are otherwise only obtained from space-based observatories.\"\n\nA cut-out of a multi-object spectrum obtained with LUCIFER shows the tell-tale signs of gas heated by young stars at unimaginably distances of billions of light-years. Such a spectrum is the decomposition of light into its different wavelengths (colors). At certain wavelengths, emission lines can be found depending on the chemical composition and physical conditions of an object. For distant galaxies, the most interesting lines are found in the near-infrared, where observations were less efficient until now. With LUCIFER and the LBT, large samples of galaxies can now be studied using its multi-object capability.\n\n(Photo Credit: Jaron Kurk)\n\n\"Already the very first LUCIFER observations of star forming regions are giving us an indication of the enormous potential of the new instrument,\" said Thomas Henning, the chair of the German LBT-Partners.\n\nThe instruments have been built by a consortium of five German institutes led by the Center for Astronomy of Heidelberg University (Landessternwarte Heidelberg, LSW) together with the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg (MPIA), the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching (MPE), the Astronomical Institute of the Ruhr-University in Bochum (AIRUB) as well as the University of Applied Sciences in Mannheim (Hochschule Mannheim).\n\nWalter Seifert (LSW), Nancy Ageorges (MPE) and Marcus J\u00fctte (AIRUB), responsible for the successful commissioning, spent more than half a year in several runs at the LBT site to make the telescope\/instrument combination work efficiently. Holger Mandel, the Principal Investigator of LUCIFER said: \"From the very beginning, there was uniform excitement about the promise of this instrument for cutting-edge science. Now, the amazing results speak for themselves.\"\n\nThe faint irregular dwarf galaxy NGC 1569 is located 6.2 million light-years from Earth. This galaxy contains several large stellar clusters with episodic star formation at a rate of more than 100 times faster than we observe in our own galaxy. In visible light, the core of the galaxy shows only three large stellar clusters, each containing more than one million stars.

{"text":"Related links\n\nRestricted links\n\nMilky Way in line for aggressive three-way merger\n\nAn international team of astrophysicists has mapped the borderlands between two of our neighbouring galaxies to reveal an ongoing galactic jostle that will eventually result in the formation of one super-galaxy incorporating the Milky Way. The findings provide the first qualitative evidence outside of the Milky Way that galaxies evolve through the merging of smaller galaxies.\n\nAlan McConnachie\nof the NRC Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, Canada, and his colleagues in the US, Europe and Australia set out to shed new light on the dynamics of galaxy evolution. They focused on two of our closest galactic neighbours to establish the extent and nature of any interaction that may be taking place. To do this, they combined computer simulations with new images captured by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) located near the summit of Mauna Kea in Hawaii.\n\nFirst, the researchers surveyed Andromeda, which is the closest large galaxy to the Milky Way and contains a similar number of stars \u2013 around 100 billion. While the central disc of Andromeda is one of the most photographed objects in the sky, the outer sections are still relatively unobserved. McConnachie and his team have now vastly extended the survey and show that Andromeda has stars stretching over an area more than 100 times larger than the central disc. \"The fact that we are looking so far out from the centre of the galaxy, and yet still detecting stars in this galaxy at these positions, really demonstrates just how large this galaxy is,\" says McConnachie.\n\nRipping off a limb\n\nNext, the researchers turned their attention to one of Andromeda's smaller satellites, Triangulum \u2013 a densely-packed galaxy of about one-tenth the size of its spiral neighbour. What they observed was an extended, stream-like structure protruding from Triangulum in the direction of Andromeda. They conclude that this structure is very similar to what they would expect to see around a smaller galaxy that is interacting with a massive galaxy that is \"ripping\" stars from it.\n\nHaving made these observations, the researchers then looked to see if the laws of physics would permit such a violent interaction of this kind, given that we know these galaxies are moving in a certain way in relation to each other. Using computer simulations, they estimate that this stellar assault must have occurred roughly 2 billion years ago when Triangulum passed within 100,000 light years of Andromeda.\n\nAccording to McConnachie, the encounter was aggressive but it was still a long way from being a head-on collision. The astrophysicist warns, however, that Triangulum may not come off so lightly when the two galaxies interact again, which is likely to occur within the next 2 billion years. \"It's unlikely Triangulum will be able to escape this time, and it's very likely that the two galaxies will completely merge together soon afterwards.\"\n\nThe fate of the Milky Way\n\nBy the time Triangulum is approaching Andromeda again, the Milky Way and Andromeda will have moved much closer together. McConnachie predicts that all three galaxies will probably collide together at the same time resulting in a merger and the formation of a new, larger galaxy. This process is a common occurrence in the \"hierarchical\" model of galaxy evolution.\n\nNickolay Gnedin, a member of the Theoretical Astrophysics Group at Fermilab in the US, believes that this new research is important because it extends our picture of galaxy evolution beyond our own galaxy. \"The Milky Way is a wonderful galaxy and we learned a great deal about galaxies in general from it alone, but one can never be sure that the Milky Way is not special or unusual in some particular way, so a confirmation from a different galaxy is very important.\"\n\nGnedin also believes that Andromeda and Triangulum will merge within a few billion years but he has a slightly different take on the fate of the Milky Way. \"The merger between Triangulum and Androme will not gobble up the Milky Way, but the Milky Way and Andromeda will collide and merge together in about 3 billion years.\"\n\nAbout the author\n\n1 comment\n\ngalaxy collision\n\nquote \"the Milky Way and Andromeda will collide and merge together in about 3 billion years.\" I wonder why everybody talks about a collision of M31 and our galaxy. With knowing only the negative radial velocity, anything is possible, from a flyby to an elliptic orbit or a head on collision. To my knowledge nobody has meaasure the impact distance (perigalaxon?). Apart from that the article is an interesting example of galaxy dynamics."}

{"text":"Cosmology\n\nThe Composition of the Universe\n\nThe chemical composition of the Universe and the physical nature of its constituent matter are topics that have occupied scientists for centuries. From its privileged position above the Earth's atmosphere Hubble has been able to contribute significantly to this area of research.\n\nAll over the Universe stars work as giant reprocessing plants taking light chemical elements and transforming them into heavier ones. The original, so-called primordial, composition of the Universe is studied in such fine detail because it is one of the keys to our understanding of processes in the very early Universe.\n\nHelium in the early Universe\n\nShortly after the First Servicing Mission successfully corrected the spherical aberration in Hubble's mirror a team led by European astronomer Peter Jakobsen investigated the nature of the gaseous matter that fills the vast volume of intergalactic space. By observing ultraviolet light from a distant quasar, which would otherwise have been absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, they found the long-sought signature of helium in the early Universe. This was an important piece of supporting evidence for the Big Bang theory. It also confirmed scientists' expectation that, in the very early Universe, matter not yet locked up in stars and galaxies was nearly completely ionised (the atoms were stripped of their electrons). This was an important step forward for cosmology.\n\nQuasar lighthouses\n\nThis investigation of helium in the early Universe is one of many ways that Hubble has used distant quasars as lighthouses. As light from the quasars passes through the intervening intergalactic matter, the light signal is changed in such a way as to reveal the composition of the gas. The results have filled in important pieces of the puzzle of the total composition of the Universe now and in the past.\n\nDark Matter\n\nToday astronomers believe that close to 95% of the mass of the Universe consists of dark matter, a substance quite different from the normal matter that makes up atoms and the familiar world around us. Hubble has played an important part in work intended to establish the amount of dark matter in the Universe and to determine its composition. The riddle of the ghostly dark matter is still far from solved, but Hubble's incredibly sharp observations of, for instance, gravitational lenses (see pages 32-33) have provided stepping stones for future work in this area.\n\nPeter Jakobsen ESA astronomer, NGST Study Scientist\n\n\"I believe that we now have a good understanding of the amount and composition of 'normal' matter of the Universe. By looking further and further back in time we are now beginning to piece together the history of this matter since it emerged from the Big Bang and eventually collapsed to form the stars and galaxies that we see in the present day Universe.

{"text":"A new study using data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory points to the origin of a famous supernova. This supernova, discovered in 1604 by Johannes Kepler, belongs to an important class of objects that are used to measure the rate of expansion of the universe.\n\nAstronomers have used a very long Chandra observation of the remnant of Kepler's supernova to deduce that the supernova was triggered by an interaction between a white dwarf and a red giant star. This is significant because another study has already shown that a so-called Type Ia supernova caused the Kepler supernova remnant.\n\nThe thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf star produces such supernovas. Because they explode with nearly uniform brightness, astronomers have used them as cosmic distance markers to track the accelerated expansion of the universe.\n\n\"While we can't speak to all Type Ia supernovas, our evidence points to Kepler being caused by a white dwarf pulling material from a companion star, and not the merger of two white dwarfs,\" said the first author of the new Chandra study, Mary Burkey of North Carolina State University (NCSU). \"To continue improving distance measurements with these supernovas, it is crucial to understand how they are triggered.\"\n\nThe Kepler supernova remnant is one of only a few Type Ia supernovas known to have exploded in the Milky Way galaxy. Its proximity and its identifiable explosion date make it an excellent object to study.\n\n\"Johannes Kepler made such good naked-eye observations in 1604 that we can identify the supernova as Type Ia,\" said co-author Stephen Reynolds, also of NCSU. \"He would be thrilled that we can use today's terrific instruments to reveal the hidden secrets of his supernova.\"\n\nThe new Chandra images reveal a disk-shaped structure near the center of the remnant. The researchers interpret this X-ray emission to be caused by the collision between supernova debris and disk-shaped material that the giant star expelled before the explosion. Another possibility is that the structure is just debris from the explosion.\n\nThe evidence that this disk-shaped structure was left behind by the giant star is two-fold: first, a substantial amount of magnesium - an element not produced in great amounts in Type Ia supernovas - was found in the Kepler remnant. This suggests the magnesium came from the giant companion star.\n\nSecondly, the disk structure seen by Chandra in X-rays bears a remarkable resemblance in both shape and location to one observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope. These infrared-emitting disks are thought to be dusty bands expelled by stars in a wind, rather than material ejected in a supernova.\n\nThe researchers found\n\"One remaining challenge is to find the damaged and fast-moving leftovers of the giant star that was pummeled by the explosion at close quarters,\" said co-author Kazimierz Borkowski, also of NCSU.\n\nMuch of the evidence in the last several years has favored the white dwarf merger scenario for Type Ia supernovas within the Milky Way as well as those found in other galaxies. This result strengthens the case that Type Ia supernovas may have more than one triggering mechanism.\n\nThese results could imply that many Type Ia supernovas have a similar origin, but the authors warn that they are unsure whether Kepler was a typical explosion. For example, a recent analysis based on Chandra data and computer simulations, led by Daniel Patnaude from Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, has suggested that Kepler was an unusually powerful explosion.\n\n\"We could settle the issue of how normal - or abnormal - the Kepler supernova was if we could discover some light from the supernova explosion that just happened to bounce off some interstellar dust to take a few hundred extra years to get here: a light echo,\" said Reynolds. Such light echoes have been found for two other galactic supernovas in the last millennium.\n\nHerschel Discovers Some of the Youngest Stars Ever Seen Washington DC (SPX) Mar 21, 2013\nAstronomers have found some of the youngest stars ever seen thanks to the Herschel space observatory, a European Space Agency mission with important NASA contributions.\nObservations from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) telescope in Chile, a collaboration involving the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Germany, the Onsala Space Observ"}

The glowing region is a relatively small object, just a few light-years across, in contrast to the one hundred light-years and more spanned by its famous neighbor, the Lagoon Nebula ( Messier 8 , eso0936). Although it is usually overlooked in favor of its distinguished companion, NGC 6559 has the leading role in this new picture. The gas in the clouds of NGC 6559, mainly hydrogen, is the raw material for star formation. When a region inside this nebula gathers enough matter, it starts to collapse under its own gravity. The center of the cloud grows ever denser and hotter, until thermonuclear fusion begins and a star is born.\n\nA team of astronomers has used the new ALMA ( Atacama Large Millimeter\/submillimeter Array ) telescope to pinpoint the locations of over 100 of the most fertile star-forming galaxies in the early Universe . ALMA is so powerful that, in just a few hours, it captured as many observations of these galaxies as have been made by all similar telescopes worldwide over a span of more than a decade. The most fertile bursts of star birth in the early Universe took place in distant galaxies containing lots of cosmic dust. These galaxies are of key importance to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution over the history of the Universe, but the dust obscures them and makes them difficult to identify with visible-light telescopes. To pick them out, astronomers must use telescopes that observe light at longer wavelengths, around one millimetre, such as ALMA. \"Astronomers have waited for data like this for over a decade.\n\nA laboratory experiment at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena, Calif., simulating the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan suggests complex organic chemistry that could eventually lead to the building blocks of life extends lower in the atmosphere than previously thought. The results now point out another region on the moon that could brew up prebiotic materials. \"Scientists previously thought that as we got closer to the surface of Titan, the moon's atmospheric chemistry was basically inert and dull,\" said Murthy Gudipati, the paper's lead author at JPL. \"Our experiment shows that's not true.\n\nMany biologists still view RNA as a messenger to shutlle inforamtion from DNA to the cell's protein manufacturing centers, ribosomes. Like DNA, RNA is a string of four different kinds of nucleotide building blocks, except that RNA has a single chain rather than DNA's iconic double helix that uses a different sugar in its molecular architecture, and substitutes uracil instead of thymine. However, unlike DNA, RNA is capable of carrying both genetic information and getting metabolic work done making it the \" \" molecule capabable of both reproducing itself and carrying the code to guide the needed copying. Some bacterial cells can swim, morph into new forms and even become dangerously virulent - all without initial involvement of DNA.\n\nThe team created experiments with powerful laboratory \"guns\" and computer models that replicated the conditions that existed inside comets that hit Earth's atmosphere at almost 25,000 miles per hour and crashed down upon the surface. The research is part of a broader scientific effort to understand how amino acids and other ingredients for the first living things appeared on a planet that billions of years ago was barren and desolate. Amino acids make up proteins, which are the workhorses of all forms of life, ranging from microbes to people. \"Our research shows that the building blocks of life could, indeed, have remained intact despite the tremendous shock wave and other violent conditions in a comet impact,\" Blank said.\n\n\"We are trying to understand the chemical origins of life. One of the interesting questions is where carbohydrates come from because they are the building blocks of DNA and RNA . What we have achieved is the first step on that pathway to show how simple sugars \u2013threose and erythrose\u2014originated. We generated these sugars from a very simple set of materials that most scientists believe were around at the time that life began.\" All biological molecules have an ability to exist as left-handed forms or right-handed forms.\n\ndiscovered the first known mechanism by which cells control the survival of messenger (mRNA) -- arguably biology's most important molecule. The findings pertain to mRNAs that help regulate and could therefore have implications for reversing cancer's out-of-control cell division. The study was carried out in yeast cells using advanced microscope technology developed previously by Dr. Singer that has allowed scientists, for the first time, to observe single molecules in single cells in real time.\n\nOrganic chemists at the University of York have made a significant advance towards establishing the origin of the carbohydrates (sugars) that form the building blocks of life. Researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University have discovered the first known mechanism by which cells control the survival of messenger RNA (mRNA) -- arguably biology's most important molecule.\n\nHow did life on Earth begin? An giant step toward solving this puzzle was taken in the 1980's with the Nobel Prize\u2013winning discovery by Tom Cech and Sidney Altman that RNA, the sister molecule of DNA, can catalyze certain chemical reactions inside cells, a job previously thought to be the exclusive domain of proteins. Until their discovery, RNA was thought to have just one function: storing the genetic information cells need to build proteins.\n\nRNA plays a critical role in directing the creation of proteins, but there is more to the life of an RNA molecule than simply carrying DNA's message.\n\nIt's paradoxical that as our leading microbiologists look to create the building blocks of life in Earth-bound labs, our Universe is alive with the building blocks for DNA and RNA. The giant gas nebula in outer space are rife with sugars that form ribose --the backbone of RNA."}
{"text":"Track name:\n\nArtist:\n\nAlbum:\n\nAstronomers survey the scale of the Universe by first measuring the distances to close-by objects and then using them as standard candlesThe improvement in the measurement of the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud also gives better distances for many Cepheid variable stars. These bright pulsating stars are used as standard candles to measure distances out to more remote galaxies and to determine the expansion rate of the Universe \u2014 the Hubble Constant. This in turn is the basis for surveying the Universe out to the most distant galaxies that can be seen with current telescopes. So the more accurate distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud immediately reduces the inaccuracy in current measurements of cosmological distances.\n\nThe astronomers worked out the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud by observing rare close pairs of stars, known as eclipsing binaries. As these stars orbit each other they pass in front of each other. When this happens, as seen from Earth, the total brightness drops, both when one star passes in front of the other and, by a different amount, when it passes behind.\n\nBy tracking these changes in brightness very carefully, and also measuring the stars' orbital speeds, it is possible to work out how big the stars are, their masses and other information about their orbits. When this is combined with careful measurements of the total brightness and colours of the stars remarkably accurate distances can be found.\n\nMurakami's new backlist design uses the circle as a central motif and the palette is limited to red, black and off-white. This creates a strong and consistent identity for the set.\n\nMurakami's work has a sense that something has been lost or hidden, what is real and what is not. To match this playfulness for the covers, we commissioned Noma Bar, a talented Israeli-born and London-based illustrator. His powerful graphic illustrations cleverly utilise negative space concealing secondary images and illusions. Noma's illustrations were screenprinted by hand to give them a personal and softer edge."}
{"text":"underestimated the luminous matter in the galaxy?\n\nTradBut it occurs to me that the calculation of how much luminous matter there is in the galaxy is based on a measurement of how much light the galaxy puts out, multiplied by a factor based on certain assumptions about what percentage of stars fall into the super-bright category and what percentage of stars fall into the super-dim category. A hot star like Sirius A, for example, will contribute 23 times as much light as the sun but only 2.3 times as much mass as the sun. A red dwarf star like Proxima Centauri, on the other hand, will contribute only 1\/10,000 as much visible light as the sun, but will weigh in at a sizeable 1\/10 the sun's mass. Therefore, an accurate estimate of how much luminous matter there is in the galaxy depends severely on an accurate survey of how many red dwarfs there are. An enormous number of red dwarfs would only make a tiny contribution to the total luminosity of the galaxy.\n\nWell ... according to this article, which came out earlier this year, it seems we may indeed have underestimated the percentage of stars in the galaxy that are red dwarfs. Look at this passage:\n\nThe most surprising result of RECONS so far is the realization of the extent to which red dwarfs are the real rulers of the universe, both in numbers and total mass. Within 10 parsecs of the Sun there are no hot, bright O and B stars, just 4 white A stars and 6 yellow-white F stars, 21 G stars similar to our Sun, 45 orange K dwarfs \u2014 and a whopping 236 cool, orange-red M dwarfs like Proxima Centauri (which still ranks as the Sun's closest neighbor). There are also 20 white dwarfs. That means that for every other star in the universe, there are no less than 2.5 red M dwarfs.\n\nHow does this new, upwardly-revised estimate of the number of red dwarfs affect our calculations as to what percentage of the galaxy's mass is made up of luminous matter? Does it mean that the old 10% figure should be revised upward to 15%? 20%? 30%?! And since this also means that the percentage of dark matter in the galaxy must now be revised downward, how far does this go toward solving the Dark Matter riddle?\n\nWell, the amount of exotic dark matter vs. regular matter (luminous and dark) in the universe was found independent of galactic observations, so how much DM we see (well, don't see) in the galaxy may not help us a whole lot in figuring out what it is.\n\nWhat this could do is give us a better idea on the amount of luminous matter in the universe. It should be noted that that amount is ~10%, which is very likely related to your galactic figure above.\n\nNow, as to how this figure should be changed (and we really need a bigger survey, IMO, that would get a good sample of O\/B stars in addition to M-dwarfs to get a good feel for numbers of stars), I don't know what the previous M-dwarf ratio was, so I don't know how it changed. That would tell us how much the percentage of luminous matter should increase.\n\nThis isn't news at all. Astronomers have long known that about 80 percent of all stars in the Galaxy are red dwarfs. See, for example, the stellar pyramid on page 79 of Ken Croswell's book Planet Quest, which gives the following statistics:\n\nActually, stars DO make up most of the normal (baryonic) matter of the Milky Way. Interstellar gas and dust account for only about 5 to 10 billion solar masses of material in the Galaxy.\n\nAre you sure? Can you provide a citation? It's not that I don't believe you, it's just that you have contradicted what I had come to belive and I would like confirmation before I shift my paradigm!\n\n\"The space between the stars looks empty, which is what it mostly is. A cubic centimeter of terrestrial air packs 25 million million million molecules, but the same volume of interstellar space in the Galactic disk typically holds just a single atom--by laboratory standards, a perfect vacuum. However, the Galaxy is so big that if you added up all this tenuous material, its total mass would equal 5 to 10 billion stars like the Sun--approximately 5 to 10 percent of the mass of the Galactic disk.\"\n--Magnificent Universe by Ken Croswell, page 54.\n\nTracer: TradThe luminous matter seems pretty well accounted for, but a related question is whether or not we have underestimated the baryonic dark matter in galaxies.\n\nI assume that you're referring to tthe galaxy from the way your question is stated. We know two things: galactic rotation curves (velocity vs. radius) are flat through the disk into the halo and we do not see enough mass in luminous matter (i.e. stars). We know that dark matter exits in some form, since *we* are dark matter. (No telescope somewhere else will pick up the radiation we and the earth are emitting.) However, we also do not see evidence around here for enough normal (or baryonic, like drguss said) dark matter to make up the missing mass that must be there to make the galaxies rotate at the observed velocities. This leads us to believe that there must be something else out there making up the dark mass.\n\nAs a final note, going beyond galaxies, WMAP observations of the cosmic microwave background have told us how much baryonic matter, (exotic) dark matter, and dark energy are in the universe. These observation corroborate the dark matter theory originially based on the galactic evidence.\n\nI'm wondering about something. Has evidence of dark matter really been found or is it just used to account for the missing mass?\n\nMany spiral galaxies have flat rotation curves . If the visible mass was all there was you would expect a fall-off of velocity with distance from the core. That is what is not observed so there is evidence for some unseen matter that is \"dark\". that have yet to be detected but may exist based upon particle physics. The \"Cold Dark Matter\" models you often hear about are referring to the non-baryonic forms of dark matter.\n\nTobin Dax noted that WMAP and Big Bang parameters in general seem to restrict most dark matter to the non-baryonic forms. But is important to stress that this conclusion is based upon a combination of observations and Big Bang requirements. The universe is not obligated to conform to those requirements. Some researchers have pointed to observations that suggest the dark matter may actually be entirely baryonic in nature - which conflicts with the currently preferred version of the Big Bang (concordance model --> dark energy = 73%, non-baryonic dark matter =23%, baryonic matter = 4%). So the actual census of baryonic dark matter is an important test for the concordance model.\n\nOne interesting recent result is that many elliptical galaxies have a dearth of dark matter. Other problems include observations that indicate a coupling between dark matter halos and luminous matter unexpected in CDM models.\n\nThat's why it is important to keep in mind that what the observations indicate about dark matter are more important than what any one theory says the dark matter must be. that have yet to be detected but may exist based upon particle physics. The \"Cold Dark Matter\" models you often hear about are referring to the non-baryonic forms of dark matter.\n\nGaaah! I thought I'd finally gotten the different varieties of dark matter sorted out, but I had the impression that the cold dark matter was baryonic, while hot dark matter was non-baryonic, perhaps neutrinos or something like that. And where does exotic dark matter fit into this, or is it just a synonym for one of the above, or a more specific variety?\nAs for dark energy, that's what might eventually rend the universe apart, right? Does it seem to be exerting a gravitational attraction meanwhile? If so, does that seem to be part of what's keeping galaxies together?\n\n...As for dark energy, that's what might eventually rend the universe apart, right? Does it seem to be exerting a gravitational attraction meanwhile? If so, does that seem to be part of what's keeping galaxies together?\n\nThe expansion rate may be the sum of two forces. As the universe expands, the gravitational force becomes less effective allowing the dark energy force to dominate. Acceleration would be the result.\n\nIf this is true, would the \"Hubble Constant\" become refined to an equation and not a \"constant\"?\n\nThere are several independent classes of observation attesting to the existence of dark matter; this paper gives an overview, from both observational and theoretical perspective.\n\nIn brief:\n- rotation curves of galaxies (as already noted by several posters)\n- gravitational lensing, both strong and weak (here is an excellent recent, HST + X-ray + ground-based study of the distribution of dark matter in an Abell cluster)\n- motion of galaxies in the Local Group\n- X-ray emission from some clusters (-> high-temperature gas; if in equilbrium, needs far more mass than that implied by light from galaxies in the cluster)\n- large-scale streaming (e.g. towards the Great Attractor)"}

{"text":"The Death of Stars I: Solar-Mass Stars\n\nOur Sun will eventually exhaust its core hydrogen and evolve off the main sequence\ninto a red giant. After the helium flash initiates helium-burning it will move\nonto the horizontal branch then expand to become an AGB star. This page now\nexplores the fate of stars of 8 solar masses or less. These stars are destined\nto eject planetary nebulae and end up as white dwarfs.\n\nPlanetary Nebulae\n\nIn an AGB star, if the helium fuel in the He-burning shell runs low, the outward\nradiation pressure drops off. As this was previously holding out the shell of\nhydrogen gas this shell now contracts, heats up and ignites, converting hydrogen\nto helium. This helium \"ash\" in turn falls onto the helium shell,\nheating it up till it is hot enough to re-ignite in a helium-shell flash, producing\na thermal pulse. Increased radiation pressure now causes the hydrogen shell\nto expand and cool, shutting down H-shell burning.\n\nThe interval between successive thermal pulses decreases as the AGB star ages.\nFor solar-mass stars such pulses dramatically increase the luminosity for several\ndecades. Over time the outer layers of the AGB star are almost totally ejected\nand may initially appear as a circumstellar shell. The ejected cloud contains\ndust grains of silicates and graphite in addition to hydrogen and elements produced\nvia nucleosynthesis reactions within the parent star. The cloud has typical\nexpansion velocities of tens of kilometres per second.Our Sun will shed about\n40% of its mass during this phase. More massive stars lose a greater percentage\nof their initial mass.\n\nWith the ejection of the outer layers of the star, its hot, dense core is left\nexposed. It is initially so hot that the intense ultraviolet radiation it emits\nionises the expanding, ejected shell. This results in the cloud glowing, similar\nto an emission nebula. Such objects are called planetary nebulae after\ntheir initial description by Herschel in the 18th century. Through small telescopes\nthey appear as faint discs, like a dim planet though they are not related. Planetary\nnebulae typically contain 0.1 - 0.2 solar masses at densities equivalent to\na vacuum on Earth. Spectacular images by modern telescopes including the HST\nreveal a wide range of shapes that pose interesting problems for theorists to\nexplain.\n\nA gallery of planetary nebulae taken by the HST.\n\nThe bipolar nature of many planetary nebulae may be due to the parent star\nbeing in a binary system. Strong magnetic fields of remnant cores may also influence\nthe shape of the nebulae. Colour of the nebulae reveals information about their\ncomposition. The characteristic blue-green colour is from the doubly-ionised\noxygen emissions, OIII. Oxygen, carbon and some s-process elements\nejected by AGBs and found in planetary nebulae may eventually seed the ISM for\nthe next generation of star formation. Some of the carbon and oxygen in our\nbodies may have come from such nebulae, the rest probably came from supernovae\nexplosions.\n\nPlanetary nebulae do not exist for long. An expanding shell of dust and gas\nmay only be visible for a few 20,000 years or so before dispersing into the\nISM. There are, however, over 1,500 known in our galaxy and others are visible\nin nearby galaxies. They are useful as one method for determining distances\nto these galaxies.\n\nAlthough a planetary nebula is only short-lived, the exposed core remains.\nWe shall now see what happens to it.\n\nWhite Dwarfs\n\nThe exposed, remnant core that ionised the planetary nebula material is basically\nan extremely hot, dense sphere of carbon and oxygen. Any hydrogen not ejected\nquickly fuses via shell-burning. When initially exposed, the central star, with\na temperature greater than 30,000 K may have a luminosity 100,000 \u00d7 that\nof our Sun but it quickly fades by up to 90% within a century. The stellar remnant\nbecomes a white dwarf or wd with a surface temperature of\nabout 104 K.\n\nWhite dwarfs have unusual properties. Firstly, they are very small but the\nmore massive white dwarfs are actually smaller than less massive ones. With\ntheir fuel used up no fusion takes place so there is no outward radiation pressure\nto withstand gravitational collapse. More massive stellar cores experience stronger\ngravitational force so actually compress more. A 0.5 solar-mass white dwarf\nhas a radius 1.9 \u00d7 that of Earth, a 1.0 solar-mass one is only 1.5 earth\nradii whilst a 1.3 solar-mass white dwarf 1.4 earth radii. A white dwarf is\ncomposed of carbon and oxygen ions mixed in with a sea of degenerate electrons.\nIt is the degeneracy pressure provided by the electrons that prevents further\ncollapse.\n\nA white dwarf, with a mass roughly that of the Sun packed into a volume not\nmuch greater than the Earth must have an extremely high density. At 109\nkg m-3 its density is one million times greater than that of water.\nAlthough its surface temperature is about 10,000 K, the core temperature may\nbe as high as 107 K. The heat trapped within a white dwarf will gradually\nbe radiated away by it but with its small radius, a white dwarf has only a small\nsurface area. Heat therefore cannot escape quickly. In fact it will take tens\nto hundreds of billions of years for a white dwarf to radiate away its heat\nand cool down to a black, inert clump of carbon and degenerate electrons. As\nthe Universe is not yet old enough for this to have happened, all the white\ndwarfs that have ever formed in single-star systems are still white dwarfs.\n\nInterestingly, not only are the more massive dwarfs smaller than less massive\nones, they are also less luminous for the reason explained above. Typical luminosities\nare less than 10-3 that of our Sun. More massive white dwarfs, having\nsmaller surface areas but more trapped heat, take longer to cool down than lower-mass\nones. As white dwarfs are so faint they are also hard to detect. We are only\nable to observe relatively close ones. Nonetheless white dwarfs are thought\nto comprise about 10% of the stars in our galaxy. Nearby examples are Sirius\nB and Procyon B, both of which are found in binary systems.\n\nWhite dwarfs in the globular cluster M4. The white dwarfs\n(circled) are about 12 billion years old, the oldest yet observed and at 30th\nmagnitude, also the faintest. For more details read the press\nrelease.\n\nThe Chandrasekhar Limit\n\nWhat is the upper-mass limit for a white dwarf? We may imagine that\nif we increase the mass of a degenerate core it simply becomes smaller. Whilst\nthis is true there is a limit. If the mass of the stellar remnant exceeds 1.4\nsolar masses then the electron degenerate pressure is insufficient to withstand\nthe force of gravity. The core will thus continue to collapse and form either\na neutron star or a black hole. Both of these are discussed in more detail on\nthe next page. The value of 1.4\nsolar masses is called the Chandrasekhar limit after the Indian astrophysicist,\nSubrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (1910-1995). He won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics\nfor this discovery and now has NASA's X-ray observatory, Chandra,\nnamed in his honour. His theoretical calculations have so far held the observational\ntest - no white dwarfs have been found with a mass greater than 1.4 solar masses.\n\nOne point to remember about this Chandrasekhar limit is that it refers to the\nmass of the material in the remnant core after all other mass loss. Stars loose\na lot of their mass as they evolve off the main sequence and become an AGB.\nThe upper mass-limit for a main sequence star that will go on to form a white\ndwarf rather than a neutron star is not precisely known but is thought to be\nabout 8 solar masses. A 2 solar-mass star will probably end up as a 0.7 solar-mass\nwhite dwarf. At present the lower-mass limit for any white dwarf is about 0.6\nsolar masses. These dwarfs form from main sequence stars slightly less than\n1 solar-mass. Main sequence stars much less than this have not yet had time\nto evolve off the main sequence and form white dwarfs as the Universe is not\nyet old enough."}
{"text":"Black holes provide us with knowledge of the Earth\n\nOct 11, 2012 by Malin Avenius\n\nBlack holes in distant galaxies can provide us with vital knowledge about our planet. Chalmers is currently building two new telescopes which, despite the fact they are directed out into space, will measure and map the Earth.\n\n\"It could be described as surveying on a global scale,\" says R\u00fcdiger Haas, as he explains how the telescope could be used. Normally, he researches and teaches in space geodesy although at the moment a great deal of time is being spent on planning the construction project, which is due to commence in summer 2014.\n\nBefore this, land issues need to be investigated, building permit applications need to be submitted and the telescopes and peripheral equipment need to be procured. Once the two new radio telescopes are in use in four years' time, R\u00fcdiger Haas predicts that Onsala will be one of the most modern observatories in Europe for space geodesy research, a science in which the Earth is studied with the aid of distant heavenly bodies.\n\n\"The aim is to study geodynamic processes, which generally means the way the planet is changing. This involves variations in the Earth's rotation and the angle of the Earth's axis, increases in land height, changes in sea level or how an earthquake affects the shape and rotation of the Earth.\"\n\nBlack holes as reference points\n\nFor the type of measurement required, fixed reference points outside the planet are needed and this is where galaxies with the black holes come into the picture. Quasars, as they are called, emit electromagnetic energy, which is picked up by the researchers' radio telescope and can be used as reference points from which calculations can be made.\n\n\"Really it is not the distance we are measuring but time,\" says R\u00fcdiger Haas. He explains that they measure the time difference between when the wave front from a quasar reaches a telescope in Onsala, for example, and when it reaches a telescope in Chile.\n\n\"As the method requires that telescopes at different locations around the world are linked, space geodesy has become a research area where virtually everyone knows everyone,\" says R\u00fcdiger Haas.\n\n\"There are only around 50 observatories throughout the world where these types of measurements are made and those of us who work with this have become something of a family.\"\n\nGreater precision required\n\nThe management technique, known as VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) was developed in the USA. Onsala Space Observatory was the first in Europe to become affiliated and made the first transatlantic observation possible in 1968. The investment in two new telescopes at Onsala is part of a joint plan to gradually update the geodetic VLBI network around the world.\n\n\"We have reached the limit and the technology that began to be developed in the 1960s and 1970s will not bring us any farther. We are therefore building a new type of telescope, which, among other things, means that measurements will be ten times as accurate.\"\n\nAt the water's edge and with a view across open sea on the western side of the Onsala Peninsula, there is one of the observatory's old space telescopes with his 25-metre wide dish directed at the sky. To prevent it from being blown over in high winds, the surface comprises a fine mesh grille. The extremely bright autumn sunlight is sieved through the holes and falls softly on R\u00fcdiger Haas as he points up towards the curved dish and explains how the new telescopes will be different.\n\n\"The most tangible differences are that the new telescopes will be half as big and that they will move considerably more and much more quickly. They will focus on a new radio source every 30 seconds and will thus provide us with a great deal of data in a very short period of time. They are also placed just 75 m from each other and work as a pair, what is known as a twin telescope, which makes it easier to cope with various disruptions in the atmosphere.\"\n\nMeasuring processes take time\n\nR\u00fcdiger Haas is not prepared to promise any revolutionary research results from this new generation of radio telescope this side of 2020. The work will mostly involve gathering data over a long period and studying processes and changes. An example of this research is how global warming will affect the sea level.\n\n\"At present, we unable in reality to decide what effect individual sources will have on the sea level. We don't know, for example, what impact the rise in water level resulting from the melting of the Greenland inland ice will have in relation to global warming and smaller glaciers. This requires a better frame of reference, which is one of the many things that we will have the opportunity to contribute using the new telescope.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(Phys.org) -- Astronomers have found evidence of hundreds of black holes in a galaxy 250 million light years away.

If dark matter is 97% of the Milky Way Galaxy and if it can interact with normal matter through gravity, then why is not the Earth 97% dark matter? After all, our solar system is less than 5 billion years old and the universe is about 16 billion (?) so that would have allowed a lot of time for mixing to occur before the solar system formed. But obviously the solar system is not mainly dark matter or that would have shown up in orbital calculations, mass estimates etc. So why this separation when dark and \"light\" matter should attract each other? Any physicists out there want to enlighten me?\n\nDid Professor Freeman's work build on at least in part Olinto de Pretto's 1903 publication about the energy (interchangeable with matter) in the aether which filled interstellar \"space\"?\nDe Pretto: \"L'energia dell'universo \u00e8 rappresentata dalla forza viva dell'etere in movimento espressa dalla formula m v2.\nIl termine v, cio\u00e8 la velocit\u00e0 delle vibrazioni semplici dell'etere, anche supponendo che sia soltanto pari a quella della luce, mentre dovrebbe ritenersi maggiore, corrisponderebbe a trecento milioni di metri per secondo, e si comprende quindi che il prodotto m v2 possa riuscire sensibile anche se la massa m delle particelle eteree, si voglia ritenere estremamente piccola.\"\nHere de Pretto ran the idea that this energy equalled mass x the square of the speed of light. (Perhaps someone with a good background in Italian can provide a translation better than the one I can get from machine translation).\nProf Freeman seemed to rely on the ABC this morning on Newton in relation to gravity. Newton told us what gravity does and how it behaves but not really what it was. Some current thinking appears to see gravity (at least on earth) as some form of current of energy flowing downwards into the earth.\nWhen Prof Freeman talked of spinning galaxies, does this bring up the issue of the energy in angular momentum, and how angular momentum arose from the big bang?"}
{"text":"March 30, 2012\n\nThese highly developed galaxies, whose star-forming youth is in fact long gone, just shouldn't be there, but are.\"\n\nDr. Karl Glazebrook (Johns Hopkins University).\n\nSome of the faintest spectra in the universe raise a glaring question: Why do Galaxies in the early universe appear old? Until recently, astronomers have been nearly blind when looking back in time to survey an era when most stars in the Universe were expected to have formed. This critical cosmological blind-spot was removed in 2011 by a team using the Frederick C. Gillett Gemini North Telescope located on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, showing that many galaxies in the young Universe are not behaving as they would have expected some 8-11 billion years ago.\n\nThe surprise: these galaxies appear to be more fully formed and mature than expected at this early stage in the evolution of the Universe.\n\n\"Theory tells us that this epoch should be dominated by little galaxies crashing together,\" said Dr. Roberto Abraham (University of Toronto) who was a Co-Principal Investigator of the team that conducted the observations at Gemini. \"We are seeing that a large fraction of the stars in the Universe are already in place when the Universe was quite young, which should not be the case. This glimpse back in time shows pretty clearly that we need to re-think what happened during this early epoch in galactic evolution. The theoreticians will definitely have something to gnaw on!\"\n\nThese observations are from a multinational investigation, called the Gemini Deep Deep Survey (GDDS), which used a special technique to capture the faintest galactic light ever dissected into the rainbow of colors called a spectrum. In all, spectra from over 300 galaxies were collected, most of which are within what is called the \"Redshift Desert,\" a relatively unexplored period of the Universe seen by telescopes looking back to an era when the universe was only 3-6 billion years old.\n\nThese spectra represent the most complete sample ever obtained of galaxies in the Redshift Desert. By obtaining large amounts of data from four widely separated fields, this survey provides the statistical basis for drawing conclusions that have been suspected by past observations done by the Hubble Space Telescope, Keck Observatory, Subaru Telescope and the Very Large Telescope over the past decade.\n\nStudying the faint galaxies at this epoch when the Universe was only 20-40% of its current age presents a daunting challenge to astronomers, even when using the light-gathering capacity of a very large telescope like Gemini North with its 8-meter mirror. All previous galaxy surveys in this realm have focused on galaxies where intense star formation is occurring, which makes it easier to obtain spectra but produces a biased sample.\n\nThe GDDS was able to select a more representative sample including those galaxies which hold the most stars\u2013normal, dimmer, and more massive galaxies\u2013that demand special techniques to coax a spectrum from their dim light.\n\n\"The Gemini data is the most comprehensive survey ever done covering the bulk of the galaxies that represent conditions in the early Universe. These are the massive galaxies that are actually more difficult to study because of their lack of energetic light from star formation. These highly developed galaxies, whose star-forming youth is in fact long gone, just shouldn't be there, but are,\" said Co-Principal Investigator Dr. Karl Glazebrook of Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\"It is unclear if we need to tweak the existing models or develop a new one in order to understand this finding,\" said the survey's third Co-Principal Investigator, Dr. Patrick McCarthy with the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution. \"It is quite obvious from the Gemini spectra that these are indeed very mature galaxies, and we are not seeing the effects of obscuring dust. Obviously there are some major aspects about the early lives of galaxies that we just don't understand. It is even possible that black holes might have been much more ubiquitous than we thought in the early Universe and played a larger role in seeding early galaxy formation.\"\n\nWhat is arguably the dominant galactic evolution theory postulates that the population of galaxies at this early stage should have been dominated by evolutionary building blocks. Aptly called the Hierarchical Model, it predicts that normal to large galaxies, like those studied in this work, would not yet exist and would instead be forming from local beehives of activity where big galaxies grew. The GDDS reveals that this might not be the case.\n\nCaltech astronomer, Dr. Richard Ellis commented, \"The Gemini Deep Deep Survey represents a very significant achievement, both technically and scientifically. The survey has provided a new and valuable census of galaxies during a key period in cosmic history, one that has been difficult to study until now, particularly for the quiescent component of the galaxy population.\"\n\nMaking observations in the Redshift Desert has frustrated modern astronomers for the last decade. While astronomers have known that plenty of galaxies must exist in the Redshift Desert, it is only a \"desert\" because we couldn't get good spectra from many of them. The problem lies in the fact that key spectroscopic features used to study these galaxies have been redshifted\u2013due to the expansion of the Universe\u2013into a part of the optical spectrum that corresponds to a faint, natural, obscuring glow in the Earth's nighttime atmosphere.\n\nTo overcome this problem, a sophisticated technique called \"Nod and Shuffle\" was used on the Gemini telescope.\n\n\"The Nod and Shuffle technique enables us to skim off the faint natural glow of the night sky to reveal the tenuous spectra of galaxies beneath it. These galaxies are over 300 times fainter than this sky glow,\" explains Dr. Kathy Roth, an astronomer at Gemini who was also part of the team and obtained much of the data. \"It has proven to be an extremely effective way to radically reduce the \"noise\" or contamination levels that are found in the signal from an electronic light detector.\"\n\nPrevious studies in the Redshift Desert have concentrated on galaxies that were not necessarily representative of mainstream systems. For this study, galaxies were carefully selected based upon data from the Las Campanas Infrared Survey in order to assure that strong ultraviolet emitting starburst galaxies were not oversampled.\n\n\"This study is unique in that we were able to study the red end of the spectrum, and this tells us about the ages of old stars,\" says Dr. Abraham. \"We undertook incredibly long observations with Gemini\u2013about ten times as long as typical exposures. This let us look at much fainter galaxies than is usually the case, and let us focus on the bulk of the stars, instead of just the flashy young ones. This makes it a lot easier for us to work out how the galaxies are evolving. We are no longer guessing at it by studying young objects and assuming the old objects were not contributing much to the story of galaxy evolution. It turns out that there are lots of old galaxies out there, but they're really hard to find.\"\n\nThe Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph used on the Frederick C. Gillett Gemini Telescope on Mauna Kea to make the GDDS observations is one of two identical instruments, which are used on both Gemini telescopes. GMOS is primarily designed for spectroscopic studies where several hundred simultaneous spectra are required, such as when observing star and galaxy clusters. GMOS also has the ability to focus astronomical images on its array of over 28 million pixels.\n\nThe Gemini Observatory is an international collaboration that has built two identical 8-meter telescopes. The Gemini South telescope is located on Cerro Pach\u00f3n in central Chile (Gemini South), and hence provide full coverage of both hemispheres of the sky. Both telescopes incorporate new technologies that allow large, relatively thin mirrors under active control to collect and focus both optical and infrared radiation from space.\n\nTo launch the video click on the Start Arrow. Our thanks for your support! It allows us to bring you the news daily about the discoveries, people and events changing our planet and our knowledge of the Universe.\n\nWell i think we are hindered by our current level of telescope technology. Yes we can see very far, even close to the beginning but is what we are seeing things that are real? We are in fact not seeing things as they are in this time, but as they were billions of years ago when the light first began it's journey towards us. So i think until we can side step that time oriented view point. We will not truly see the universe as it is, but as it was.\n\nWell, shucks. The grown-ups are baffled. The fact is that no one wants to look at these galaxies because it will suggest that the universe is older than 13 billion years--assuming it takes galaxies anywhere from 7-10 billion years to form. (Our galaxy's age keeps getting updated. Last I read it was about 11 billion years old. Its globular clusters are at least 12-14 billion years old.) So much for the Big Bang or Inflation.\n\nBill Nye has posted something similar to a posting I made last year about the age of the universe,I postulated that maybe light fades to almost nothing after traveling 13 plus billion light years, dust clouds gravity fields bending it or reflecting it leave it virtually non existant to earth based observers. I have always thought that 13.7 billion years is not really that long a time on a universal scale. I think eventually we may find that our universe is rotating since most things in space rotate as do things on earth, storms whirlpools. Nature likes rotation.\n\nWhy? Because redshift galaxies are on the borderline of disappearing from the visible universe (that is our view) they are SO far away, that NONE of their light reaches us, which could mean that a) the universe is older than we originally suspected b) All galaxies are being racing away towards (possibly) another huge super-cluster of galaxies that form another 'universe.'\n\nEssentially what constitutes our universe is really nothing more than a large grouping of galaxies - billions in numbers.\n\nBut I wouldn't be surprised if other such grouping exists far beyond our view.\n\nAs we know light is energy. And a theory of light being bent,and refracted would be the most reasonable hypothesis. 13 billion years indeed is a long period. I just don't think its even close to the time scales we are looking for. A more reasonable number I would assume would be in hundreds of billions of years old.\n\nObserving the universe from earth is like standing in a dark room with a flashlight. All we know is what we see. We can assume that all we see is everything - until we get a brighter flashlight and then see more. Then we can assume that all we see is everything - until we get a an even brighter flashlight and then see more. It is pretty presumptuous to assume that we are the center of everything, that we are alone in the room, and that we know the size and age of the room based on what we can see without regard to everything we cannot see.\n\nNow start spinning while running around in circles while the room itself is spinning.\n\nIf red shift is the affect of motion on spectrographic readings then what does all the combine motions of our planet do to effect this red shift? What would the red shift look like if we factored out all these composite motions? - earth spinning, earth revolving around sun, sun revolving around our galaxy, our galaxy moving through space, ect.\n\nObviously the universe is much older than we know. Perhaps the universe is infinitely old and is just continually being created and destroyed recreated and redestroyed. No wait energy cannot be created or destroyed only converted from one form to another. So maybe this vast universe is a gigantic recycling machine that constantly recycles energy from cosmic energy down to matter and then back to cosmic energy in an endless cycle. Never beginning and never really ending.\n\nwe don`t want to see those galaxies exactly like we don`t want to spread the word about the tens of billions planets in Milky Way, because it`s no word about them in the bible. All this bigbang theory sucks bigtime, but noone has enough courage to contardict an old man on a wheelchair. Any direction you look our universe is identical, with identical age galaxies. But we continue with this stupid theory that we`re exactly on the middle way from the \"center\" of the universe to the \"border\"... Conveniently we can`t see the \"center\" nor the \"border\" of the universe... We are born from a small dot that came from nowhere and we`re going to nowhere...BS. And while infinite space is denied, infinite time isn`t.\n\nRed shift is an illusion. It is created by the movement of expanding ether which eminates from black holes at the centre of each galaxy, where ether is created by destroying matter. The ether is then used by suns to generate matter and light. Etheric presure creates gravity, electricity and magnetism. Magnetism is the result of etheric movement being diverted by magnetic materials. This creates high and low presure zones at opposite poles which we call attraction and repulsion. The light from the sun travels via waves and doesn't travel as a photon. Photons don't exist. Galaxies are in a constant cycle of birth and death which exists individually in a circular motion from the outer rim spiraling into the centre.\n\n@Steve - If redshift is an illusion caused by the ether then why is it observed on earth in a variety of situations which have nothing to do with black holes? Stars produce light by nuclear fusion and their emitted spectra attest to this. Maxwell demonstrated that magnetism is the same as electricity and light, and Einstein showed that this is mediated by photons. If photons don't exist then explain the photoelectric effect using the ether instead.\n\n@Rick47933 - The amount of redshift produced by the motion of the earth and sun are negligible in comparison. They are also easily accounted for. You seem to be labouring under the assumption that the relatively docile motion of either body is far more problematic than it really is.\n\nEveryone seems to be in need of some research, as the majority of the posters here are making untenable assumptions on the basis of what appears to be a near-nonexistent knowledge of physics or cosmology. Try reading through some open-access journals, like Arxiv, before spamming up the comments with your preferred hypothesis. For example, Coward et al (2012) show how some of these galaxies can be explained and also go into detail regarding the presumptions of which many of you are guilty."}

{"text":"HUBBLE TELESCOPE REVEALS SWARM\nOF GLITTERING STARS IN NEARBY GALAXY\n\nPhil\nPlait, Sally Heap and Eliot Malumuth\n\nDeep in the heart of the Large Magellanic Cloud\n(LMC; a small companion galaxy to our own Milky\nWay) is a tremendous cloud of gas called the Tarantula\nNebula. For about the past five million years, the\nTarantula has been busily turning itself into stars.\nVery busily-- just in its center, the nebula has\nconverted enough gas to form the mass equivalent\nof 15,000 Suns, and far more are being formed over\nthe nebula as a whole. Because this is one of the\nlargest and closest star forming regions known,\nit has long been subject to intense scrutiny by\nastronomers.\n\nIn February 1996, Drs.\nSally Heap and Eliot\nMalumuth at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center\npointed Hubble's Faint Object Spectrograph at the\ncore of the cluster to investigate the properties\nof the very massive hot stars forming there. In\nparallel, they also switched on Hubble's Wide Field\nPlanetary Camera 2 (WFPC2). The two instruments\nworked at the same time: while the spectrograph\ntook data of the center of the nebula, WFPC2 took\nnumerous deep, multi-color images of the outskirts.\nBy taking observations far from the crowded center\nof the nebula, fainter stars were more easily detected\nsince they were not overwhelmed by the much brighter\nstars near the core. In this way, we can find out\nmore about how stars like our Sun are formed.\nDr. Philip Plait (also from GSFC) analyzed the\nWFPC2 data.\n\nThe top image (in the panel of 3 images) is of\nthe entire nebulosity complex and was taken by\nGary Bernstein and Megan Novicki of the University\nof Michigan using a ground based telescope in Hawaii\n(we thank them for graciously allowing the image\nto be used here). The giant gas cloud spans the\nroughly 1500 light year field of this image. The\nbright center of the nebula can be seen in the center\nleft of the image. The star which eventually blew\nup to become Supernova\n1987A was born in this cloud, near the lower\nright hand side of the image.\n\nThis image is not as deep as the Hubble image\n(it had a much shorter exposure time) but it covers\na much larger area of the sky. The white outline\nin the big picture represents the field of the next\nimage, which is a zoom in on the ``suburbs'' of\nthe Tarantula.\n\nThis smaller area of the nebula spans about 300\nlight years, and you can start to see some of the\nindividual fainter stars and details of the gas.\nThe outline of the Hubble image is shown in this\nimage.\n\nThe field-of-view of the\nWide Field and Planetary Camera 2 is overlaid\non the ground-based image in the middle image\nand the \"Starfield in\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud\" Hubble Heritage\nimage is detailed in the bottom.\n\nFor the third image, three Hubble WFPC2 images\nhave been combined to make a natural color picture\nof the region. (Editor's note: details about color\nassignments to black and white data can be found\nat\ntechnical information page and about specific\nassignments for this image in its fast\nfacts table.)This picture represents the deepest\nmulti-color images ever taken in the LMC; over 10,000\nstars can be seen in the image, including stars\nas faint as 26th magnitude. The brightest stars\nin the image are 10,000 times fainter than can be\nseen with the unaided eye, and the faintest are\n100 million times dimmer! At this distance, the\nSun itself would be about 23rd magnitude, and would\nbe lost in the wash of thousands of stars. In the\nimage are also sheets of nebular gas which are shaped\nby their interaction with the light and winds from\nnearby stars. Also visible are dark patches of interstellar\ndust which block our view of the stars behind them.\nIn the Hubble image, stars as close together as\n0.2 light years can be distinguished from each other.\nThat's 20 times closer than the Sun to its nearest\nstellar neighbor, Proxima\nCentauri!\n\nNote the different colors of the stars. The brightest\nstars are giants, much larger than the Sun, which\nare hundreds or thousands of times brighter than\nthe Sun. They are bluish white or red- the red giants\nare nearing the end of their short lives, and may\nend as supernovae, or exploding stars. Fainter stars\ncome in all colors, most obviously blue or yellow,\nand some fainter reddish stars can also be seen.\nThese stars are less massive and cooler than the\nSun, shining with a ruddy glow.\n\nBy studying such deep images, we hope to learn\nmore about what triggers star formation and why\nit produces the kinds of stars it does. Understanding\nstars is fundamental to understanding how our own\nSun behaves, how it affects us on Earth and possibly\neven how other stars can form their own planets\nand solar systems."}

Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is a similar barred spiral, and the study of galaxies such as NGC 1073 helps astronomers learn more about our celestial home.\n\nMost spiral galaxies in the Universe have a bar structure in their centre, and Hubble's image of NGC 1073 offers a particularly clear view of one of these. Galaxies' star-filled bars are thought to emerge as gravitational density waves funnel gas toward the galactic centre, supplying the material to create new stars. The transport of gas can also feed the supermassive black holes that lurk in the centres of almost every galaxy. This storyline would also account for the observation that in the early Universe, only around a fifth of spiral galaxies contained bars, while more than two thirds do in the more modern cosmos.\n\nThe NASA\/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has taken a picture of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1073, which is found in the constellation of Cetus (The Sea Monster).

In the upper left part of the image, a rough ring-like structure of recent star formation hides a bright source of X-rays. Called IXO 5, this X-ray source is likely to be a binary system featuring a black hole and a star orbiting each other.\n\nComparing X-ray observations from the Chandra spacecraft with this Hubble image, astronomers have narrowed the position of IXO 5 down to one of two faint stars visible here. However, X-ray observations with current instruments are not precise enough to conclusively determine which of the two it is.\n\nHubble's image does not only tell us about a galaxy in our own cosmic neighbourhood, however. We can also discern glimpses of objects much further away, whose light tells us about earlier eras in cosmic history.\n\nRight across Hubble's field of view, more distant galaxies are peering through NGC 1073, with several reddish examples appearing clearly in the top left part of the frame.\n\nThis video zooms from an image of constellation of Cetus (the Sea Monster) into a closeup of the galaxy NGC 1073, imaged by the NASA\/ESA Hubble Space Telescope.

In fact they are not stars at all. They are quasars, incredibly bright sources of light caused by matter heating up and falling into supermassive black holes in galaxies literally billions of light-years from us.

Its lifetime,\nlimited by exhaustion of the liquid helium which cooled telescope and detectors,\noutlasted the 18-month nominal mission and reached 28 months\n(finally warming up in May 1998).\nThe telescope on ISO was the same size as that of IRAS, at 60 cm diameter.\nThe major differences between the missions were that IRAS was\noptimized to survey the sky in a few broad passbands, while ISO\nwas designed to study known targets in great detail. It carried\ntwo cameras and two spectrometers, operating from 2-240 microns.\n\nWe used ISO data to examine the properties of dust in galaxies,\nusing overlapping glaaxies to simultaneously see the dust in\nemission in the infrared and in absorption in optical and near-IR light.\nComparison of the two let us test for any small clumps of dust that\nwouldn't be effective optical absorbers, or any widespread very\ncold dust that would absorb visible light but contribute minimally\nto the far-IR. As it happened, additional data with the\nJCMT at longer wavelengths were important in reaching our goal.\nHere are some 12-micron images of galaxy pairs from the ISOCAM\narray. Our longer-wavelength observations all look like unresolvd\ndots, so they're much less visually interesting. And the upshot?\nAs nearly as we can tell we see the same amounts of dust in emission\nand absorption, so that we may finally be able to see all that's\nthere, and thus really know its role in a galaxy's development and\nappearance. For each picture, we show an optical image (from HST or CTIO)\nfor reference along with the 12-micron ISO image.

{"text":"Science News\n\nSearching for the First Stars\n\nFeb. 28, 2012 \u2014 Recently, astronomers found two immense clouds of pristine gas, nearly 12 billion light years away -- clouds that astronomers suspect are the stuff from which the first stars were born. The Kavli Foundation spoke with three prominent researchers about this and other exciting findings that are moving scientists closer to understanding how the first stars and galaxies formed. This includes the realization that in early times, there were many more small, feeble galaxies than large luminous galaxies.\n\nShare This:\n\n\"If you were to take a space ship and go back to that point in cosmic time, you'd find that the sky is really ablaze with them -- so many of them that their combined output is very significant,\" said Richard Ellis, Steele Professor of Astronomy at the California Institute of Technology. \"These early objects are in fact very, very small -- about a tenth the diameter of the Milky Way. And yet, they are forming stars more prodigiously than the galaxy we live in today.\"\n\nDiscoveries such as these come as scientists focus on studying the gaseous \"fingerprints\" the early galaxies left on their surroundings -- what's called the intergalactic medium (IGM). \"We know from these observations that after about one billion years all of this gas is ionized, and it's the galaxies that we think did this,\" said George Becker, Fellow, the Kavli Institute for Cosmology at the University of Cambridge. \"The question that we are trying to answer is how and when it happened, and what these earliest galaxies were like.\"\n\nSaid Avi Loeb, Chair of the Department of Astronomy and Director of the Institute for Theory and Computation, Harvard University, \"If we can map the distribution of galaxies and the hydrogen gas between them, in the IGM, we can see the relationship between the places where the galaxies are and the regions that were ionized\u2026 [This] gives us indirect evidence for the earliest galaxies. This new technique will enable us to directly study the galaxies that ionized that hydrogen gas.\"\n\nAnd what do researchers ultimately hope to uncover?\n\n\"[We] would like to understand how the galaxies that we see around us, including the Milky Way, came into existence,\" said Loeb. \"It's going back in time to our origins, in a sense.

{"text":"It's well known that the Milky Way is a spiral galaxy, a swirl of stars in an extended, many-armed disk. But the structure of the galaxy is far from two-dimensional. Above and below those familiar spiral arms is a lesser-known feature, a spherical swarm of stars that makes up a halo around the disk.\n\n? In recent years a group of astronomers has suggested an answer to some of those big questions by drawing on a large telescopic survey of the sky.\n\nThe halo, they have concluded, is composed of at least two distinct populations of stars, with different chemical makeups and different orbits. One group of stars, dubbed the inner halo, generally orbits closer to the galactic center, and its members tend to contain more heavy elements such as iron than do stars farther out. (Halo stars as a whole are depleted in these heavy elements, relative to stars in the galactic disk.) Stars.\n\n\"We don't think it's just one halo,\" says Timothy Beers, an astronomer at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory and Michigan State University, who was lead author on a recent study in The Astrophysical Journal. Beers, Daniela Carollo of Macquarie University in Australia and their colleagues based their analysis on data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a long-running telescopic campaign based at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico. \"We advocate the position that we are looking at a minimum of a dual halo,\" he says.\n\nAs the Milky Way built up by accretion of smaller galaxies, the inner and outer halo would represent two different epochs of galactic assembly. \"We actually think that the formation scenario was something you could describe as a multiphase assembly,\" Beers says. The inner halo would represent the remnants of relatively massive dwarf galaxies, which coalesced early on. Lighter-weight galaxies would have attached themselves later on in a very gradual agglomeration to form the outer halo.\n\nThe inner and outer halo are not cleanly divided, but the differences in how the two populations move could aid astronomers in finding extremely primitive stars, which contain primarily hydrogen and helium. Those were the raw materials for the first generation of stars, early in the history of the universe; subsequent generations contained heavier elements that were fused in stellar cores and supernovae and then released into interstellar space. \"Knowing that you have this dichotomy helps direct us to finding these interesting low-metallicity stars,\" Beers says. Outer-halo stars could be identified for detailed study by their distinctive motions on the sky. \"Those are the ones that tell the story of how the universe built its elements,\" Beers says.\n\nBut not everyone agrees that the facts support the dual-halo interpretation. \"I have a very relaxed opinion about single halos, dual halos, multiple halos,\" says astrophysicist Ralph Sch\u00f6nrich, a NASA Hubble Fellow at The Ohio State University. \"I don't mind any idea of a dual halo. It's just that I don't see any evidence for it.\"\n\n18 Comments\n\nTorroidial Curve. the possitioning of the halos are an occurance the magnetic polarities distribution. Thus we have space fabrik. so time yes is distributed as we see it more slowly. yet the occurance is at a normal rate. also if one would look the curves also match the male an female aspects of life.\u263a\u263b\n\nWhat this debate completely overlooks is that the distant Milky Way halo objects DO each effectively independently orbit the galaxy's distant, central principal mass (the galactic disk and core), just as described by Kepler's 'laws' of planetary motion.\n\nNo 'dark matter' is necessary to explain their rotational velocities, as they diminish as a function of their radii from the galactic center of mass just as Kepler described.\n\nThis result contradicts the flat rotation curves discovered for objects within spiral galaxies' disks that seemed to require the presence of enormous dark matter halos containing 6-10 times the mass of the galaxies' visible matter!\n\nIf the rotational characteristics of spiral galaxy disks seems to require enormous dark matter halos while the rotational characteristics of ordinary halo objects seem to preclude the existence of dark matter, there must be an error in at least one of the respective analysis!\n\nActually, Newton proved in his 'Principia' that Kepler's equations included an error component for non-zero mass orbitals. Kepler's empirically derived equations provided reasonably useful approximations, peculiarly well suited to the Solar system, whose mass is dominated by the Sun (containing 99.86% of total system mass).\n\nThe mass of spiral galaxies is largely distributed throughout their spiral disks. As a result, the motions of individual stars within the disks (especially at the disk periphery) are determined far more by their gravitational interactions with neighboring masses than any collective center of mass.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that the rotational characteristics of spiral galaxies can be described using Newtonian dynamics and universal law of gravitation, without dark matter or modified gravity. Please see: Feng & Gallo, (2011), \"Modeling the Newtonian dynamics for rotation curve analysis of thin-disk galaxies\", \n\nWhile the self-gravitating disks of spiral galaxies do not behave as planetary orbital systems, more distant objects at the galactic periphery do independently orbit the Milky Way 'just like planets in the Solar system'. This observation conflicts with the presence of an enormous dark matter halo containing most of the galaxy's mass. Please also see: Bratek et al, (2011), \"Keplerian Ensemble Approximation. The issue of motions of Galactic halo compact objects\", \n\nPlease see a brief commentary with additional references: \n\nYou're so off-base it's pathetic. Newton is so over, anyway. Why bother quoting a has-been? It's obvious that these halos are being pushed out by excess heat generated by millions of planetary intelligences burning up their fossil fuels. Tool-using intelligence is a galactic infection which needs to be stopped.\n\nRight-wing Republican extremists must exist on many planets other than our own, and it's their use of tools which is causing the apparent warming of millions of planets - which in turn are the reason for galactic halo formation.\n\nTo you, InquiryingIdiot, SaltnotPepper and Lunges I am sorry National Lampoon is no longer there for your wit. But I suggest this dog is in your hands, if you don't take two minutes and go to the real authority of all knonsense and pay homage to this page  Remember The dogs life is in your hands.\n\nCould we please stick to scientific comments and speculation? Political (and religious) commentary, except when some scientist asks innocently why GW deniers exist, is really out of place in these forums. The vast majority of you, when opening your mouth through your finger tips, only expose your ignorance and superstitution.\n\nThe only reason my comment is not scientific is that I don't have enough facts to have an opinion; although the halo looks to me like something and would occur naturally in a spinning structure which contains a sufficient amount of star dust and other loose pieces.\n\nFirst of all to Nagnostic, you saved the dog. Thank you. Grumpyoleman, thank you. I had been responding to several articles in a very serious tone using what science I do know and while I am not a PHD or anything but a self taught curious being that loves particle, quantum and some of where string theory is trying to go, I was shot down for missing what was being posted as gags by the voices above my comments.\n\nI have been trying to get people to pay attention to some real science here on earth that would free us of our energy needs if funded but what I usually see is the crap\/humor that preceeded my comments.\n\nIf you want to tickle your brain with some real science check out the following articles referenced in these links.  It is something discovered in 1993 and deals with a Cyanobacterium that poops H2 and O2 prolifically. If you put the two together you get H2O and energy. It feeds on Chlorophyll (easily attainable) and has about a 3,000 to one return rate. It is sustainable which had been an early issue and will probably get reburied again until we are totally out of oil.\n\nAnother interesting discover was several years ago when a student\/scientist at MIT discovered she could custom tip viruses to create anything that you can imagine,such as a computer the size and depth of a piece of paper maybe. DARPA is currently experimenting with flexible batteries for the service but that is the least of the possibilities and again this story got even harder to relocate. But you can start with  and  .\n\nAdditionally two Nobel Prizes were awarded for work in Graphine which besides being an easy building block for nanotubes also has some interesting quantum effects that include tunneling 100% of the time. I have been preaching Carbon use instead of abuse for years to empty ears yet the science keeps proving me right. Recently diamonds (which by the way are now able to be grown from a seed in a heavy carbon gas environment) were shown to have entanglement features (HUGE)  . Not to mention carbon composites etc.. but we continue to burn the stuff at our own danger.\n\nIf you want to read my take on Carbon here is my piece I wrote several years ago.  .\n\nTo answer one last thing. Regarding our universe my take is that the whole universe may be alive and I am in good company with this (Freeman Dyson and to some degree Lee Smolin) and based on the large maps I have seen it appears to look like the inside of a cell with the galaxies acting something like atoms but much slower (only because of our perspective (we are tiny)). I loved Benoit Manderbolt and his view of Fractals and after studying the folly of infinity came up with a picture of a multiverse that I think is fractal shaped and Escher space bound. But that is my humble opinion.\n\nPeterT Whatever the T stands for. I am an old man with little time left and kind of enjoy some of the rift raft. But since you entered the conversation what more than a lecture that is the LAMEST LECTURE ever given what do you have to add to the story. Or are you in lack of said life also. As I breathe on my leash of O2 I will await your input, surely it will astound the idiots you so classify as ALL. And maybe the dog is in trouble again.\n\nIf you have nothing positive to say, did not your mother tell you to keep your fingers off the keyboard. So in support of all of us IDIOTS put up or shut up. I look forward to your response and your deep knowledge of the universe. I would hope that it is something I can take to the grave or at least gravy.\n\nTo the rest of you fellow IDIOTS keep having fun life is short. Sometimes even in your fun there is wisdom, which is better than shouting from a soap box while adding nothing to the conversation.\n\nClues to the formation of galaxies and of stars would be easier to perceive with the knowledge of some fundamentals, as given in:  In our universe of fractals, galaxies and stars form by fragmentation and nuclear fissure(increasing entropy) and NOT by agglomeration and nuclear fusion (decreasing entropy); and entropy is conserved in our universe. Get the whole picture with:  and \n\n\"?\"\n\nIn what will become the standard model for cosmology. all such questions will also become readily answerable, simply and classical mechanically. For instance (in our fractal universe), the answers as to how the galactic halo is structured and how it got there are similar to those for the the solar halo, or heliosphere: The final decay of neutrons (from the central fission reactor) dominate the outermost fringes as also a buffer in intergalactic\/interstellar space. There will thus be an enormous outward wind from the halo (see:  ), the backpressure from which will keep even high-speed halo stars\/orbital matter penned in (without the need for recourse to any mystical 'dark matter' for the corral). \"Stars\" In the highly rarefied regions of the outer halo, fission is enhanced, making stars to appear older (and depleted in heavy elements)than any of their siblings closer to the high-pressure central regions. All ejections from the galactic core are in retrograde orbit (to conserve angular momentum of the entire galaxy; eventually, the outermost ejecta (evolved now into stars) tend to lose kinetic energy and fall back, retracing their trajectories in the spiral arm, and back into the galactic hub, where the very old and the very new stars would seem to coexist). Good exercise to answer all such questions (and many more) yourselves with the correct model now in hand. Good luck, and Cheers!\n\nEugene, you have some interesting ideals and I am happy to read your papers and go through your material. But we are still learning and I am not ready to throw nuclear fusion out the window. It may disrupt how the Thermal Nuclear Reactions occur. Granted they are initiated by a fissionable source but it is the bonding of Hydrogen into Helium and the release of energy that makes the boom bigger. Also to the best of all the science I have read the sun is taking Hydrogen and creating Helium which eventually turns to Oxygen or Carbon and when it gets to Iron the process breaks down and then size matters.\n\nBut I will be happy to read your papers. You are recognized as someone who has submitted and you remind me of Hoyle with the steady state theory. More after I read your stuff. Thanks for the contribution, but you should make sure to credit that it is your point not an outside source making the claims.\n\nI try explain issues with the research that originally established the perceived requirement for dark matter to explain observed rotation curves of spiral galaxies in their own context.\n\nMore 'modern' readers might prefer a discussion of these same issues in the context of general relativity. Please see: J. D. Carrick and F. I. Cooperstock, (2010), \"General relativistic dynamics applied to the rotation curves of galaxies\", \n\nDavid, thanks for your kind response and for the advice, too. Glad also to take note of your interest in my work. I reckon you nave already visited my 'Cosmos' and 'Galaxy' web pages give above (links therein open best with Internet Explorer). Re the fusion of H nuclei to produce He, and then go onto C and O, Sir Fred Hoyle's down-to-earth argument in this vibrational world is well worth for anyone to consider deeply, in this short clip: \n\nFinally, my paper to Nature Physics (submitted, though unsuccessfully; no surprise at all!)may help you further toward that real world which should be empirical physics, the bedrock of science:  Best regards, and Cheers!\n\nI am a Freeman Dyson fan which default makes me a Feynman fan which indirectly makes me a Lee Smolin fan. I have especially enjoyed Dyson and Smolin books I have read and love the concepts put forth on quantum loop gravity. I also loved Benoit Manderbolt's work on Fractals and I think in the end he will be the most underestimated of the group.\n\nOne part of entropy I have issue with is the self organization of life and evolution. It tends to use chaos and attractors to create order which is what made me a lover of fractals. Hoyle was a very smart man but when Hubble discovered the expansion of the universe and the COBE pictures came back it was hard to say that big bang was not a good solution.\n\nI am intrigue by the implications of dark energy and perhaps that may become Hoyle's last laugh on steady state. I think we may be inside an event horizon and the illusion of dark energy is really the effect of where we are viewing. But that is just conjecture based on the description of the future evolution of the universe from the effects of dark"}

{"text":"Most quasars live on snacks, not large meals\n\nAstronomers are uncovering an underlying population of fainter quasars in the distant universe that thrive in normal-looking spiral galaxies and are triggered by black holes consuming a batch of gas or the occasional small satellite galaxy.\n\nThe galaxies pictured here have so much dust surrounding them that the brilliant light from their quasars cannot be seen in these images from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. Quasars are the brilliant beacons of light that are powered by black holes feasting on captured material, and in the process, heating some of the matter to millions of degrees. Credit: NASA\/ESA\/Yale\n\nBlack holes in the early universe needed a few snacks rather than one giant meal to fuel their quasars and help them grow, according to observations from NASA's Spitzer and Hubble space telescopes.\n\nQuasars are the brilliant beacons of light powered by black holes feasting on captured material, and in the process, heating some of the matter to millions of degrees. The brightest quasars reside in galaxies distorted by collisions with other galaxies. These encounters send lots of gas and dust into the gravitational whirlpool of hungry black holes.\n\nNow, however, astronomers are uncovering an underlying population of fainter quasars that thrive in normal-looking spiral galaxies. They are triggered by black holes snacking on such tasty treats as a batch of gas or the occasional small satellite galaxy.\n\nA census of 30 quasar host galaxies conducted with two of NASA's premier observatories, Hubble and Spitzer, has found that 26 of the host galaxies bear no telltale signs of collisions with neighbors, such as distorted shapes. Only one galaxy in the sample shows evidence of an interaction with another galaxy. The galaxies existed roughly 8\u201312 billion years ago, during a peak epoch of black-hole growth.\n\nThe study, led by Kevin Schawinski of Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, bolsters evidence that the growth of most massive black holes in the early universe was fueled by small long-term events rather than dramatic short-term major mergers.\n\n\"Quasars that are products of galaxy collisions are very bright,\" Schawinski said. \"The objects we looked at in this study are the more typical quasars \u2014 they're a lot less luminous. The brilliant quasars born of galaxy mergers get all the attention because they are so bright and their host galaxies are so messed up. But the typical bread-and-butter quasars are actually where most of the black-hole growth is happening. They are the norm, and they don't need the drama of a collision to shine.\"\n\nFor his study, Schawinski analyzed galaxies observed by the Spitzer and Hubble telescopes in the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey. He chose 30 dust-enshrouded galaxies that appeared extremely bright in infrared images taken by Spitzer, a sign that their resident black holes are feasting on surrounding material. The dust is blocking the quasar's light at visible wavelengths, but infrared light pierces the dust, allowing Schawinski to study the galaxies' detailed structure. The masses of those galaxies are comparable to that of our Milky Way.\n\nSchawinski then studied the galaxies in near-infrared images taken by Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3. Hubble's sharp images allowed careful analysis of galaxy shapes, which would be significantly distorted if major galaxy mergers had taken place and were disrupting the structure. Instead, in all but one instance, the galaxies show no such disruption.\n\nWhatever process is stoking the quasars, it's below the detection capability of even Hubble. \"I think it's a combination of processes, such as random stirring of gas, supernovae blasts, swallowing of small bodies, and streams of gas and stars feeding material into the nucleus,\" Schawinski said.\n\nA black hole doesn't need much gas to satisfy its hunger and turn on a quasar. \"There's more than enough gas within a few light-years from the center of our Milky Way to turn it into a quasar,\" Schawinski said. \"It just doesn't happen. But it could happen if one of those small clouds of gas ran into the black hole. Random motions and stirrings inside the galaxy would channel gas into the black hole. Ten billion years ago, those random motions were more common and there was more gas to go around. Small galaxies also were more abundant and were swallowed up by larger galaxies.\"\n\nThe galaxies in Schawinski's study are prime targets for NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, a large infrared observatory scheduled to launch later this decade. \"To get to the heart of what kinds of events are powering the quasars in these galaxies, we need the Webb telescope. Hubble and Spitzer have been the trailblazers for finding them.\"\n\nWithin a billion light-years of earth, a hundred galaxy super clusters reside:\n\n\n\nThat space density (a hundred per cubic giga light-year) is similar to the observed space density of Quasars. Inexpertly, Quasars reflect major mergers, occurring in crowded clusters of galaxies. As this article states:\n\n\"The brightest quasars reside in galaxies distorted by collisions with other galaxies. These encounters send lots of gas and dust into the gravitational whirlpool of hungry black holes.\"\n\nPerhaps the infrared excess seen in these Spiral galaxies derives from shrouded star-formation, rather than (unseen) faint Quasars ? Outside of crowded clusters, Spiral galaxies are the most numerous kind of large galaxy. But, only a few in a million galaxies ever generates a Quasar: astronomers observe ~30 Quasars per square degree of sky, implying ~1 million Quasars all-sky; but, extrapolating from the Hubble \"Deep Field\" series of extended exposures, there are hundreds of billions of large galaxies all-sky. Inexpertly, i understand that Quasars derive from super elliptical cD galaxies, residing in the centers of busy super clusters of galaxies, having assembled there from major mergers, some of which generated powerful Quasars.\n\nSubmitted: 11\/21\/2012 1:12:45"}
{"text":"Galaxies have one job to do: Turn gas into stars. Dwarf galaxies\nare really bad at their jobs. Take Ursa Minor, for example.\nIt contains about half a million stars. However, in the past it\nprobably contained much more mass in gas than its present mass in\nstars. That's because it lost a great deal of gas over its\nlifetime.\n\nGalaxies lose gas in a variety of ways. The most common ways for\ndwarf galaxies to lose gas is \"stellar feedback\" and \"tidal\nstripping.\" Stellar feedback is the loss of gas from the galaxy\ndue to energy input from the stars. For example, when some stars\nend their lives, they blow up as supernovae. One supernova puts\nout as much energy in one second as the the Sun does in several billion\nyears! That much energy can expel a lot of gas from the\ngalaxy.\n\nTidal stripping is a mechanism of gas loss unique to\ndwarf galaxies, which are satellites of larger galaxies. When the\ndwarf galaxy gets close enough to its large host, the much stronger\ngravity of the larger galaxy can rip gas out of the smaller\ngalaxy. In the case of Ursa Minor and the other galaxies\nrepresented in the plot to the left, that large host galaxy is our\nGalaxy, the Milky Way.\n\nMassive stars are nuclear reactors, fusing hydrogen and helium into heavier\nelements like iron. To illustrate how much material is lost from\ngalaxies, let's again consider Ursa Minor. Over its lifetime,\nUrsa Minor synthesized a couple thousand times the Sun's mass in\niron. That number is represent by the hollow circled labeled\n\"UMi.\" My measurements show that Ursa Minor presently contains\nless than a thousand solar masses of iron. That's the filled\nblack circle. That means the puny galaxy lost 99.8% of the iron\nthat its stars produced. That's like getting a 0.2% on your\nperformance review.\n\nMore massive galaxies lost a slightly smaller percentage of their\niron. Fornax, which is about 35 times the mass of Ursa Minor,\nlost 96% of the iron that its stars produced. And it's not just\niron. The metals lost from the galaxy also include magnesium,\nsilicon, and calcium. Even a galaxy like NGC 1569, which is even\nmore massive than Fornax, lost nearly all of the metals that its stars\nproduced. That means that only the largest galaxies in the\nUniverse, like our Milky Way, do a good job of turning their gas into\nstars.\n\nSay\nhello to the newest member of the Local Group of galaxies, VV124.\nThe Local Group is a collection of mostly dwarf galaxies, but it also\nincludes big ones like the Milky Way and Andromeda. Until a few\nyears ago, a big catalog mistakenly listed VV124 as being about 10\ntimes more distant than it actually is. When the mistake was\nnoticed, the true distance confirmed VV124 as a member of the Local\nGroup.\n\nMy faculty contact at Caltech, Judy Cohen, and the Italian astronomer\nMichele Bellazzini, had the idea to look at VV124 with the Keck II\ntelescope. Judy and I observed this galaxy in January 2011 with\nthe amazing spectrograph called DEIMOS. We spent an entire night\nstaring at this galaxy, and our reward was beautiful stellar\nspectra. These spectra contain information about the individual\nstars that make up VV124. The information we're interested in\nincludes the velocities of the stars and their compositions.\n\nThe top panel of the figure to the left shows the distribution of iron\namong the stars of VV124. A pretty basic model of galactic\nchemical evolution describes this distribution pretty well. The\nblue line (overlapping exactly with the red line) is that simple\nmodel. Adding complexity to the model\ngives a slightly better description of the iron\ndistribution. The red and green lines represent more complex\nmodels, and the green line fits the data a little better than the blue\nline.\nTherefore, VV124 is a simple galaxy that started with pure\nhydrogen gas, and it turned some of that gas into stars. It may\nhave acquired a small amount of gas while it was forming stars.\n\nThe velocity distribution of the stars presents additional evidence\nthat VV124 is a simple galaxy. The velocities are distributed\naccording to a \"Gaussian,\" a bell curve. What's more is that the\nstars on one side of the galaxy don't show any different average\nvelocity than the stars on the other side of the galaxy. That\nmeans that the galaxy does not rotate. The stars move around\nrandomly without any ordered motion. That's typical of dwarf\ngalaxies.\n\nThe strange thing is that the gas\nin the galaxy does have velocity structure. Why the gas is ordered but the stars are not\nremains a mystery.\n\nLithium is a fairly simple element. It has just three protons,\none more than helium and two more than hydrogen. The Big Bang\nmanufactured\nnearly all of the lithium in the Universe. From there, the\nlithium content of the Universe has decreased because stars destroy lithium in the\ncourse of normal setllar evolution. In the plot to the left, the\ngray points show the amount of lithium in stars at different points in\ntheir lives. Stellar evolution moves stars to the right on this\ndiagram. At a certain point, when the star transitions from being\na dwarf star to a giant star, over 90% of the lithium is converted into\nhelium. Another episode of lithium destruction takes care of the\nrest of the lithium.\n\nAlmost all stars obey this simple picture. However, a few giant\nstars are renegades. A very small number of red giant\nstars--about 1%--have a lot lithium. Some of them have even\nmore lithium than they started with. That means that these stars\ndidn't just save their lithium from destruction. They created it.\n\nA master's student (Xiaoting Fu) and I found 14 red giants in dwarf galaxies that belong to this special\nclass of giants. I don't know how these stars get all that\nlithium, but I'm not alone. Some smart theorists have some good\nideas, but none of them is completely consistent with the data.\nRegardless, this new sample of 14 metal-poor, lithium-rich giants is\nlarger than all of the previous samples combined, and it will help\nthose theorists figure out what exactly is making all that lithium.\n\nThe\nmeasurement of alpha element abundances can reveal the history of star\nformation in a galaxy. I previously\nmeasured the alpha element distribution in the dwarf galaxy\nSculptor. Now I have devised a very basic model of chemical\nevolution to describe those measurements. The model is very\nsimple compared to some great models in the literature. However,\nI kept it simple intentionally so that it wouldn't take very long to\nrun on my computer. That way, I could quickly see the results of\nchanging the input parameters. That was important because I\nwanted to make a model that described my alpha element measurements as\nbest I could, so I had to try a lot of different input parameters.\n\nThe figure to the left illustrates the history of star formation and\ngas flow in Sculptor. This figure is one way to interpret the\nelemental distributions that I measured.\n\nThe top panel shows how Sculptor accumulated gas over the one billion\nyears that it formed stars. This information comes mostly from\nthe number of stars at different metallicites. That is, the\ninfall rate depends mostly on the [Fe\/H] distribution, not [\u03b1\/Fe].\n\nThe second panel shows the mass of Sculptor, separated into gas (blue)\nand stars (red). The peak gas mass is about ten times the final\nstellar mass. That means that Sculptor required a great deal of\ngas to catalyze the star formation of a relatively small mass of\nstars. The post above\ntalks about\ngalaxies having one job to do: Turn gas into stars. Sculptor was\nso bad at it that it had to go through tons and tons of gas to make\njust a few stars.\n\nThe third panel shows how fast Sculptor turned gas into stars.\nThis is another way to see that Sculptor was terrible at its job.\nAt its peak, its star formation rate was 0.026 solar masses per\nyear. For comparison, the star formation rate of the Milky Way is\nabout one solar mass per year.\n\nThe bottom two panels show the composition of the gas in Sculptor as a\nfunction of time. The steady decline of [Mg\/Fe] with time\nindicates that Type Ia supernovae dominated the chemical evolution of\nSculptor. Those supernovae are big iron bombs that add a bunch of\niron (Fe) but no magnesium (Mg). As a result,those supernovae\nrapidly decrease [Mg\/Fe].\n\nThis model isn't the only way to interpret the measured chemical\nabundances of Sculptor, but this model does roughly describe the\nobservations. In total, Sculptor formed stars for just one\nbillion years. That actually isn't that much. Consider that\nthe Earth has been around for over four billion years. The history\nof star formation in Sculptor is much shorter than Earth's geological\nhistory.\n\nThe\ndistribution of\ndifferent elements across the stars in a galaxy reveals the history of\nstar formation in the galaxy. The next\nsection explains the basic idea as it applies to one specific dwarf\ngalaxy. It is also enlightening to compare different dwarf\ngalaxies to each other. In particular, the trends in the\nelement abundance distributions may change with dwarf galaxy\nsize. In this case, \"size\" actually refers to the number of stars\nin the galaxy, which can equivalently be thought of as luminosity, or\nhow brightly the galaxy shines as a whole.\n\nThe legend in the plot on the left lists eight dwarf galaxies,\nsatellites\nof the Milky Way, in order from brightest (most stars) to faintest\n(fewest stars). As a point of reference, it also shows the trend\nin our own Milky Way galaxy, which is many times larger than the eight\ngalaxies I have included in my own study. It is clear that the\n[\u03b1\/Fe] ratio drops more steeply with increasing [Fe\/H] in the dwarf\ngalaxies than in the Milky Way. However, at low metallicity\n([Fe\/H] < -1.5) [\u03b1\/Fe] drops at about the same rate in the dwarf\ngalaxies, regardless of their final sizes.\n\nOne interpretation of the similarity in [\u03b1\/Fe] at low [Fe\/H] is\nthat the very first episodes of star formation in dwarf galaxies are\ninefficient. The galaxies' initially meager supplies of\ninterstellar gas, from which stars are formed, keep star formation at a\nlow level. As a result, the long-lived Type Ia supernovae have\nenough time to explode and depress the [\u03b1\/Fe] ratio as the galaxies\nevolve and become enriched in iron (moving right along the x-axis).\n\nThat all of these galaxies show similar [\u03b1\/Fe] at a given [Fe\/H] is\nunexpected. Larger dwarf galaxies, like Fornax (dark red), are expected to have\nmore intense star formation than smaller dwarf galaxies, like Ursa\nMinor (dark blue).\nAs a result, the larger galaxies should have been able to keep their\n[\u03b1\/Fe] high for a broader range of [Fe\/H]. In fact, the average\nstar formation efficiency over the entire\ngalaxy lifetimes is certainly larger for the larger galaxies.\nHowever, the decline in [\u03b1\/Fe] is manifest only for [Fe\/H] < -1.5,\ncorresponding to the earliest epochs. Therefore, this plot shows\nthat the early star formation\nhistories of all eight galaxies was similar. At later times,\ncorresponding to [Fe\/H] > -1.5, other methods of determining star\nformation histories show that the evolutionary paths of the galaxies\ndiverge.\n\nIn the process of\nstar formation, some stars explode as supernovae, releasing newly\ncreated elements into the interstellar gas. New stars form from\nthis gas, and the composition of those new stars incorporates the newly\ncreated elements. Some of the supernovae explode very quickly\nafter star formation begins. These are called Type II supernove,\nand they show a predictable pattern of elements. In particular,\nthe ratio of light \"alpha\" elements, like magnesium (Mg) and silicon\n(Si), to iron (Fe) in the ejecta is high. Other supernovae\nexplode only after a long time, perhaps as long as several billion\nyears. These are Type Ia supernovae, and the alpha-to-iron ratio\nin their ejecta is low. The difference in time to explosion means\nthat the timescale over which stars formed in the gaalxy is imprinted\nin the [\u03b1\/Fe] ratio of the surviving stars in these galaxies.\n\nThis plot shows the [\u03b1\/Fe] ratio for several hundred stars in the\nSculptor dwarf galaxy, a satellite of the Milky Way. The x-axis is the \"metallicity\" of the\nstar. You can think of metallicity as a proxy for the birth order\nof the star. Older stars have lower metallicity, or [Fe\/H],\nwhereas younger stars have higher [Fe\/H]. The y-axis, [\u03b1\/Fe], is also a time\nindicator, but it is not strictly age. Rather, it indicates the\nfrequency of star formation. Galaxies that form stars quickly\nramp up [Fe\/H] fast enough that Type Ia supernovae do not have time to\nexplode. As a result, [\u03b1\/Fe] remains high over the full range of\n[Fe\/H]. Galaxies that form stars at a leisurely pace over\nbillions of years have time for Type Ia supernovae to dilute the [\u03b1\/Fe]\nratio.\n\nIn the case of Sculptor, a steady decline in [\u03b1\/Fe] as a function of\n[Fe\/H] means that the galaxy took its time in forming stars, at least a\nbillion years. The star formation age of Sculptor is important\nbecause dwarf galaxies like Sculptor are thought form part of our own\nMilky Way galaxy. In theory, dwarf galaxies are disrupted by the\nMilky Way and form a diffuse halo of stars around it. However,\nthe [\u03b1\/Fe] patterns of Milky Way halo stars indicates that they formed\nvery quickly. Therefore, Sculptor is not representative of the\ngalaxies that may have built up the majority of the Milky Way\nhalo. However, galaxies like Sculptor may have a significant,\nongoing role in the continuing creation of the outer parts of the Milky\nWay halo.\n\nThis plot has been made possible by the techniques\nof my Ph.D. dissertation.\nSpecifically, I measured [Fe\/H] and\n[\u03b1\/Fe] from medium-resolution spectra obtained with the DEIMOS\ninstrument on the Keck II telescope. This plot has\nhelped to determine a more precise history of star formation in\nSculptor in a paper that I recently submitted to the Astrophysical\nJournal. The distribution of element abundances has helped us\nlearn how many stars formed in Sculptor at different\nhistorical epochs.\n\nA diffuse halo of stars and dark\nmatter surrounds the Milky Way. Most astronomers believe that\nsome of the oldest stars in the Universe\u2014nearly as old as the\nUniverse\nitself\u2014inhabit the stellar halo. Part of the reason to\nexpect these stars are so old is that they contain very little metals.\n(\"Metals\" means every element except hydrogen and helium.)\nMetals exist in the Universe because nuclear burning in stars\nprocessed hydrogen and helium into heavier elements. That\nmeans that the first generations of stars had no metals, or at least\nvery small amounts of metals.\n\nOne widely accepted theory of the formation of the\nMilky Way's\nstellar halo posits that small \"building blocks\" called dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies (dSphs) fell into each other by their mutual\ngravitational attraction. Those building blocks are no longer\ndistinct entities but instead a single enormous diffuse cloud of stars\nthat surrounds the Milky Way. However, some dSphs still exist\ntoday. In the hierarchical assembly model, these dSphs would\nbe the rare handful of latecomers to the Milky Way system which have\nnot yet suffered the gravitational interactions that pull the small\ngalaxies apart and melds them into the stellar halo.\n\nRecently, some astronomers claimed that the\nstars in the halo are different enough from the stars in the surviving\ndSphs to cast doubt on the hierarchical assembly model.\nSpecifically, a small fraction of stars in the halo are\nextremely metal-poor. Some have one ten\nthousandth the amount of metals that the Sun has.\nSome have even less. If dSphs built the stellar\nhalo, then even the surviving dSphs should also have some extremely\nmetal-poor stars. The claim is that, on the other hand, some\nsurviving dSphs\u2014specifically the large, luminous ones\u2014do not\ncontain stars that are quite so metal-poor.\n\nBy measuring the metal content of very tiny, very faint\nsurviving dSphs with a new\ntechnique, my group has discovered\nthat certain dSphs do in fact contain stars nearly as metal-poor as\nthose in\nthe stellar halo. The cumulative distribution of metallicity\n([Fe\/H]) shown above demonstrates that the extremely metal-poor tail of\nthe\nfaintest surviving dSphs has a shape similar to that of the Milky Way\nstellar halo after all. The discrepancy at [Fe\/H] >\n-2.3 is a result of excluding the more luminous surviving dSphs, whose\nstars are on average more metal-rich than the very faint dSphs\nrepresented by the black line.\n\nWhile the discovery of extremely metal-poor stars in some\nsurviving dSphs bolsters the hierarchical assembly model, it does not\nprove that all dSphs contain extremely metal-poor stars.\nTherefore, the claim that the luminous dSphs are devoid of\nvery metal-poor stars may be accurate. The discovery of very\nmetal-poor stars in the faint dSphs warrants a new look at the luminous\ndSphs with the same technique. Presently, it is unclear\nwhether the hierarchical assembly model depends on the\nexistence of extremely metal-poor stars in luminous dSphs. It\nis\npossible that the extremely metal-poor tail of the halo metallicity\ndistribution formed from tiny dSphs alone. Future work will\napply the same technique used to discover the extremely metal-poor\nstars in small, faint dSphs to the stars in large, luminous dSphs.\n\nDetailed tests of\ntheories of\nhierarchical structure formation require chemical abundances of many\nstars at large distances. In additional to overall metallicity, models\npredict the alpha enhancement of\ndifferent dynamical components of the Milky Way and M31. High\ndispersion spectroscopy can probe\nvery few stars in the Milky Way satellite galaxies and no stars in\nM31.\n\nMy dissertation employs a technique\nusing medium resolution spectroscopy and spectral synthesis to extract\nmetallicity and [\u03b1\/Fe] for\nlarge samples of individual stars at large distances. I have\nfound that R ~ 6000 spectra\nreproduce high\nresolution [Fe\/H] and [\u03b1\/Fe] measurements of Galactic globular cluster\nstars. At signal-to-noise ratios for which Milky Way satellites are\neasily accessible, the typical error on metallicity is 0.15 dex, and\nthe typical error on [\u03b1\/Fe] is 0.2 dex. Unlike empirical metallicity\nestimators, such as the equivalent width of the Ca II triplet, this\nsynthetic method does not depend on the metallicity range or alpha\nenhancement\nof calibrators.\n\nThis\nplot shows the mean metllaicities of nine Milky Way globular clusters.\nThe horizontal axis is the result from high dispersion\nspectroscopy, and the vertical axis is my result from DEIMOS spectra.\nThree clusters (NGC 2419, M79, and NGC 7492) have fewer than\nfive\nstars observed in high resolution spectroscopy. The\nmeasurements\nwith DEIMOS are based on 32, 16, and 21 stars, respectively.\nDespite the lower spectral resolution, the DEIMOS results may\nbe\nmore precise."}
{"text":"Star hunger\n\n0 Comments\n\nIssue Date: Feb 28, 1994\n\nA recent astronomical observation may prove to be the first sighting of a class of celestial bodies whose existence was postulated about two decades ago.\n\nA neutron star invades its gia A BRITISH astronomer may be the first to have witnessed a bizarre celestial phenomenon: the formation of strange heavenly bodies when a superdense neutron star -- one that has been crushed by its own gravity -- insinuates itself inside a red giant star and transforms it (Science, Vol 262, No 5134).\n\nPhilip Charles of Oxford University observed certain bright stars seem to be trapped in orbit around massive objects such as neutron stars and black holes. On analysing the light from these stars, Charles found the stars to be abnormally rich in lithium, which is a legacy of Thorne-Zytkow objects. But Charles realised that he may have glimpsed the celestial hybrid only when he compared his notes with those of Philipp Podsiadlowski, a theorist from Cambridge University.\n\nThe existence of Thorne-Zytkow objects was postulated as early as 1975 by Kip Thorne of the California Institute of Technology and Cambridge University's Anna Zytkow. According to their theory, these celestial objects are formed when a neutron star is in close orbit around a red giant star -- a massive and expanding star. The powerful gravity of the neutron star siphons matter from its younger giant companion and eventually, the neutron star drills into its fellow-star, sinks like a stone to its centre and starts destroying it.\n\nEven though these bodies look like ordinary stars, there is lot of strange and wonderful stuff going on inside, say astrophysicists. The neutron core keeps pulling matter inward, compressing and heating it to generate 10 times more heat than the star's original core did. As a result, the star's outer layers churn vigorously, forging heavy elements not seen in ordinary stars -- molybdenum, yttrium, and rubidium, for example.\n\nLast year, Podsiadlowski and Garrett Beale, a former student of Thorne, independently predicted large amounts of lithium also could be one of the elements produced -- just what Charles observed in the light from three stars.\n\nPodsiadlowski reckons that after forging huge amounts of lithium and other elements, the neutron star may have exhausted its fuel, started a runaway contraction and exploded, throwing the remains of the giant star into a disk. This material, says Podsiadlowski, may have coalesced into a new companion star, which he thinks is what Charles has spotted."}

At a relatively nearby distance to Earth of about 5,000 light years, Cygnus OB2 is the closest massive cluster. Deep observations with NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory of Cygnus OB2 have been used to detect the X-ray emission from the hot outer atmospheres, or coronas, of young stars in the cluster and to probe how these great star factories form and evolve. About 1,700 X-ray sources were detected, including about 1,450 thought to be stars in the cluster.

Evidence is also seen that the older population of stars has lost its most massive members because of supernova explosions.

Aguilar (CfA)\n\nA galaxy's core is a busy place, crowded with stars swarming around an enormous black hole. When galaxies collide, it gets even messier as the two black holes spiral toward each other, merging to make an even bigger gravitational monster.\n\nOnce it is created, the monster goes on a rampage. The merger kicks the black hole into surrounding stars. There it finds a hearty meal, shredding and swallowing stars at a rapid clip. According to new research by Nick Stone and Avi Loeb (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics), upcoming sky surveys might offer astronomers a way to catch a gorging black hole \"in the act.\"\n\nBefore the merger, as the two black holes whirl around each other, they stir the galactic center like the blade of a blender. Their strong gravity warps space, sending out ripples known as gravitational waves. When the black holes merge, they emit gravitational waves more strongly in one direction. That inequality kicks the black hole in the opposite direction like a rocket engine.\n\n\"That kick is very important. It can shove the black hole toward stars that otherwise would have been at a safe distance,\" said Stone.\n\n\"Essentially, the black hole can go from starving to enjoying an all-you-can-eat buffet,\" he added.\n\nWhen tidal forces rip a star apart, its remains will spiral around the black hole, smashing and rubbing together, heating up enough to shine in the ultraviolet or X-rays. The black hole will glow as brightly as an exploding star, or supernova, before gradually fading in a distinctive way.\n\nImportantly, a wandering, supermassive black hole is expected to swallow many more stars than a black hole in an undisrupted galactic center. A stationary black hole disrupts one star every 100,000 years. In the best-case scenario, a wandering black hole could disrupt a star every decade. This would give astronomers a much better opportunity of spotting these events, particularly with new survey facilities like Pan-STARRS and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.\n\nCatching the signal from a disrupted star is a good start. However, astronomers really want to combine that information with gravitational wave data from the black hole merger. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a future mission designed to detect and study gravitational waves, could provide that data.\n\nGravitational wave measurements yield very accurate distances (to better than one part in a hundred, or 1 percent). However, they don't provide precise sky coordinates. A star's tidal disruption will let astronomers pinpoint the galaxy containing the recently merged black-hole binary.\n\nBy correlating the galaxy's redshift (a change in its light that's caused by the expanding universe) with an accurate distance, astronomers can infer the equation of state of dark energy. In other words, they can learn more about the force that's accelerating cosmic expansion, and which dominates the cosmic mass\/energy budget today.\n\n\"Instead of 'standard candles' like supernovae, the black hole binary would be a 'standard siren.' Using it, we could create the most accurate cosmic 'ruler' possible,\" stated Loeb.\n\nFinding a merged black hole also would allow theorists to explore a new regime of Einstein's general theory of relativity.\n\n\"We could test general relativity in the regime of strong gravity with unprecedented precision,\" said Loeb. Astronomers using ESO's Very Large Telescope have detected, in another galaxy, a stellar-mass black hole much farther away than any other previously known. With a mass above fifteen times don't have the physics to assess this, but am curious if the current gamma ray event 110328A (not willing to call two weeks a single burst) is a result of a merged black hole system going through its neighbours...\n\nIt is rather interesting (but coincidental) that news of 110328A breaks around the time of this story. At this point, though, I think it's too early to tell precisely what's going on with this galaxy wrt the outburst.\n\nThere's still too little hard info available to make an informed guess. There has been some talk as to if this object is related to blazars (which includes BL Lac and Optically Violent Variable galaxies) which exhibit relatavistic jets beamed toward us.\n\nStan Woosley (UCSC)has opined that this could be a scaled-up version of what we see in standard GRBs. In this case the core of the massive star collapses to form a BH while the outer layers take days to fall in, producing the prolonged outburst: \n\nThis mechanism has been invoked before to explain a handful of unusual (long-duration)GRBs, so there might be some connection"}
{"text":"in my revision guide it says nearby galaxies all have similar patterns of lines in their emission and absorption spectra? why???\ni asked my teacher whether its coz those galaxies are in the same phase in fusion ( for e.g. the galaxies were made roughly the same time so they are still fusing hydrogen in the stars they contain) but my teacher says you cant assume this\njust coz galaxies are close to eachother doesnt mean they are nearly the same age and even if they are doesnt mean they are in the same stage of fusion - so wont have similar patterns of lines because it depends on the stars they contain in the galaxies which in turn depends on how much mass was initally available to form those stars - so this determines its stage in fusion i.e. whether its hydrogen\/helium fusion.\nso that brings me back to the original question why do galaxies nearby have similar patterns on lines in their absorption and emission spectra?\n\nsorry for the long question but my revision guide is seriously annoying it just states facts and doesnt explain why it is so, thanks for taking the time to read this!\n\nWell most stars spend most of their life in the Main Sequence like our Sun, just fusing Hydrogen into Helium.\nTherefore, on their atomic emission spectra they will have a similar pattern as it will show mainly H\/He.\n\nAlso, as they are nearby galaxies they probably came to existence at a similar time because of the Big Bang. Of course this is some galaxies and is only an assumption.\n\nYeah I know what you mean, but in the end they are there just to guide you in your revision. Look in the text book if you are unsure.\n\nHope this helps, and just contact me if you need any more help! (Except on electric fields...I don't get them!)"}
{"text":"NASA's scientists recently used the Swift Satellite in order to see a star explode and become a supernova. Although over the past 100 years astronomers have observed thousands of supernovas, every time it was seen, it was only after the explosion took place. Swift's high capabilities and some alert astronomers, as well as a bit of good luck, made it possible to observe the explosion in \"real-time\" for the first time.\n\nAlicia Soderberg and Edo Berger of Princeton University were the alert astronomers: on January 9 they were using NASA's Swift satellite's X-ray telescope to observe a distant spiral-shaped galaxy, known as NGC 2770. Thanks to the telescopes high sensitivity, at 9:33AM the scientists noticed a powerful burst of X-rays coming from the galaxy, which lasted for 5 minutes before fading away. The lucky part is that the telescope happened to be directed towards the right place at the time the star burst \u2013 even before Soderberg and Berger saw the after-effects of the X-rays. The scientists immediately realized the importance of their observation and quickly organized a plan to use telescopes in space and on Earth to follow-up Swift's discovery.\n\nOver the next few weeks, observations made by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory, along with Swift and other major telescopes, showed beyond a shadow of a doubt that the January 9 X-ray burst indicated the explosion of a giant star.The X-rays were due to a powerful blast wave bursting through the star's outer layers. The blast wave itself was triggered deep inside the star, when the \"nuclear engine\" at its center ran out of fuel and collapsed.\n\n\"For years we have dreamed of seeing a star just as it was exploding, but actually finding one is a once in a lifetime event,\" says Soderberg.\" This newly born supernova is going to be the Rosetta stone of supernova studies for years to come.\" Neil Gehrels, Swift lead scientist of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, adds: \"It was a gift of nature for Swift to be observing that patch of sky when the supernova exploded. But thanks to Swift's flexibility, we have been able to trace its evolution in detail every day since.\""}
{"text":"A panoramic loop in Cygnus\n\nScientists compiled older observations of this supernova remnant into one of the largest astronomical images ever made.\n\nBy\nNOAO, Tucson, Arizona \u2014\nPublished:\nDecember 27, 2012\n\nThe faint filaments of the giant supernova remnant known as the Cygnus Loop are visible in this image obtained with the wide-field view of the Mosaic camera on the WIYN 0.9-meter telescope. Because of its immense size, it contains several individually named objects, including NGC 6992 and IC 1340 on the left side as well as NGC 6960 and Pickering's Triangle on the right. \/\/ T. A. Rector (University of Alaska Anchorage)\/WIYN\/NOAO\/AURA\/NSF\n\nAs an end of the year finale, the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) and WIYN partners offer this new wide-field image of the Cygnus Loop. Three degrees on a side, this image covers an area of the sky about 45 times that of the Full Moon. But it does so without sacrificing high resolution. The image is more than 600 million pixels in size, making it one of the largest astronomical images ever made.\n\nThe Cygnus Loop is a large supernova remnant \u2014 the gaseous remains of a massive star that exploded long ago. It is located about 1,500 light-years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Cygnus the Swan. Astronomers estimate that the supernova explosion that produced the nebula occurred between 5,000 and 10,000 years ago. First noted in 1784 by William Herschel, it is so large that its many parts have been cataloged as separate objects, including NGC 6992, NGC 6995, and IC 1340 along the eastern (left) side of the image; NGC 6974 and NGC 6979 near the top-center; and the Veil Nebula (NGC 6960) and Pickering's Triangle along the western (right) edge. The bright star near the western edge of the image, known as 52 Cygnus, is not associated with the supernova.\n\nThe data were obtained with the NOAO Mosaic 1 camera, with observations in the Oxygen-III (blue), Sulphur-II (green), and Hydrogen-alpha (red) filters. When mounted on the WIYN 0.9-meter telescope, the Mosaic camera has a 1 square degree field of view. The Cygnus Loop was observed with nine separate telescope images in a 3 by 3 grid pattern.\n\nThe observations were originally obtained in 2003 by Richard Cool while he was a graduate student at the University of Arizona as part of a project to precisely measure the distance to the Cygnus Loop. Cool, now at the MMT Observatory in Arizona, said, \"Often, astronomical research reduces images to dry tables of numerical information that we analyze in order to more deeply understand our universe. Images like this are amazing because they can remind you of the big picture and beauty that surrounds us.\" In 2003, the computing power available was insufficient to process the data into a single, full-resolution color image. Nine years later, the data were re-reduced and processed by Travis Rector to create the image presented here.\n\nImages like this demonstrate that even relatively small telescopes are capable of producing cutting-edge research when equipped with modern cameras.\n\nIt would be interesting to read an article examining what might result in the event our solar system were to someday encounter a gas filament structure such as this. Would the heliopause simply push it aside, so that nothing would be noticeable within the heliopause envelope? What would be effect, if any, on the hypothetical Oort Cloud? It would seem logical to suspect that a collision with a molecular cloud would perturb orbits in the Oort Cloud and result in a higher bombardment rate in the inner solar system, or in other words, more comets.\n\nCoincidentally, the solar system is now passing through the galactic plane, where interstellar gas density should be higher. And we have a couple of new (as far as we know) visitors heading our way, Comet PANSTARRS to arrive in March, and the possibly spectacular Comet ISON to arrive at the end of the year.\n\nSubmitted: 1\/4\/2013 2:40:32 PM (CST)\n\nJENNIE JOHNSONfrom CALIFORNIA\nsaid:\n\nThe photograph of the Cygnus loop resembles an image of a large man in Outer Space.

{"text":"Like so many things in the cosmos, some stars practically die a-borning. These \"failed stars\" are known as \"brown dwarfs,\" and are simply not large enough to sustain a long-term hydrogenfusion reaction.\n\nBefore now, scientists believed the minimum mass required to sustain a long-term hydrogen reaction is equal to that of 75 times that of Jupiter. Although Jupiter's chemical makeup is almost identical to that of a star, it's mass is far too small to even begin a hydrogen reaction. As far as brown dwarfs are concerned, it has been difficult to confirm theories because brown dwarfs look a lot like red dwarfs - which are able to sustain the reaction required for full \"starhood.\"\n\nHarvey Richer of the University of British Columbia has used Hubble to observe the faintest red dwarf stars yet observed. These are located in a very old cluster identified as NGC 6397, about 8500 light years away. At 13.5 billion years, this cluster dates back to the beginning of the universe. According to another team member, Jay Anderson of Rice University in Texas, \"...the brown dwarfs have by now faded off into obscurity so there is a\nvery stark contrast between the stars that could burn hydrogen and the\nones that couldn't.\"\n\nTheories predict that the low-end mass for true stars should be determined by how many metals are present. Stellar objects with a metal content similar our own sun would need a minimum mass no less than 7.5% that of Sol. The NGC 6397 cluster has a metallic content that is less than 1% of the Sun's, so this dividing line is expected to be slightly greater - 8.3% that of Sol, or 83 times the mass of Jupiter.\n\nThe new Hubble observations are able to identify starts 10 to 20 times fainter than earlier ones. \"This kind of observation is probably the best kind of constraint one\ncan get,\" says Gibor Basri of UC Berkeley.

{"text":"A nova is a type of stellar explosion smaller than a supernova or hypernova. The phenomenon occurs in binary star systems, where a white dwarf star absorbs a critical amount of matter from its companion, compressing hydrogen onto its surface and eventually igniting a nuclear explosion. Only about 1\/10,000 solar masses of material is ejected, in comparison to 1.38 solar masses of material in a Type I supernova and a dozen or more solar masses in a Type II supernova. Although a Type I supernova also involves a white dwarf star, in that case a majority of the star's entire mass is fused. In the case of a nova, only a tiny percentage is.\n\nA white dwarf star is made up of degenerate matter, a super-dense phase of matter with the unusual property that its pressure is only weakly related to temperature. When a white dwarf's gravitational field sucks hydrogen gas from a nearby star, the gas fuses to the surface of the dwarf, joining the degenerate matter. A white dwarf packs a mass similar to the Sun in a volume similar to that of the Earth, compressing the incoming matter very tightly.\n\nA white dwarf is the \"ash\" of a much larger star that has fused together much of its hydrogen into heavier elements. Usually, white dwarfs are composed of carbon and oxygen. Fusing carbon and oxygen nuclei into heavier elements is a very energy-intensive process that only occurs in the cores of very massive stars. So, the white dwarf lacks the capability itself to engage in further fusion reactions. But, if enough hydrogen is packed onto its surface, it forms a shell which reaches the critical temperature and pressure for hydrogen fusion, around 20 million Kelvin. The hydrogen rapidly fuses, releasing energy in the same way as a fusion-based nuclear bomb (H-bomb). A nova results.\n\nBecause a nova does not destroy its host star, it may happen more than once in the same place. One nova, RS Ophiuchi, has flared six times since astronomers began watching it in 1890."}

But we can admire its galactic disc.\n\nDust over the galactic plane is visible as dark intricate filaments that block the visible light from the core of the galaxy. Recent studies suggest that this galaxy may have a bar structure. Galactic bars are thought to act as a mechanism that channels gas from the spiral arms to the centre, enhancing star formation.\n\nWith the combined power of NASA's Spitzer and Hubble space telescopes, astronomers have spotted what could be the most distant galaxy ever seen. Light from the primordial galaxy traveled approximately 13.2 billion light-years before reaching NASA's telescopes, shining forth from the so-called cosmic dark ages when the universe was just 3.6 percent of its present age.\n\nAstronomers relied on gravitational lensing to catch sight of the early, distant galaxy.

The crucial evidence from Chandra was a disk-shaped structure near the center of the remnant.

Another possibility was that the structure is just debris from the 19 Mar 2013 11:47:06 -0400chandra430 at  Another Look at a Historical Supernova\n<p><em>We are delighted to welcome Mary Burkey as a guest blogger today. Mary is first author of a paper, describing the trigger mechanism for the Kepler supernova, that is the subject of our latest press <a href=\"\/press\/13_releases\/press_031813.html\">release<\/a>. She grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina and is in her last semester at North Carolina State University. When she graduates in May, she will have Bachelors degrees in Physics, Chemistry, and Applied Mathematics. After commencement, Mary will attend one of the graduate schools she is currently exploring and plans to obtain a PhD in Physics. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>When people all over the world looked up into the night sky 409 years ago and saw a new star, they immediately began studying it. However, no one studied this new celestial object more closely than Johannes Kepler. Over several years, he synthesized his observations into a historical book, De Stella Nova, which later justified naming the star \"Kepler's supernova.\"<\/p>\n<p><!--break--><\/p>\n<p>In the course of the four centuries that have since passed, the remnant has been discovered, characterized as a Type Ia or thermonuclear event, and extensively observed by a now-modern armada of telescopes including the Chandra X-ray Observatory. However, since Kepler's explosion in 1604, there has not been another known thermonuclear event in the Milky Way galaxy to help us understand the actual explosion mechanism. Though astrophysicists have ideas and models of how the event must have happened that work well with many other, not-so-close events, we cannot say for sure if these models are correct. Thus, looking at Kepler's remnant and attempting to re-create the explosion from observation is a perfect way to test the models. However, as a seasoned astrophysicist once told me, the closer an object is and the longer one looks at it, the more it misbehaves.<\/p>\n<p>I stumbled upon Kepler's supernova remnant a couple of months before I began my undergraduate career at North Carolina State University. After taking a couple of physics classes at the University while I was still in high school, I decided to explore doing research. I had always been interested in the stars and my co-authors had a very stimulating project that they were willing to let me work on. The remnant of the famous Kepler's supernova had some unusual circumstellar material (that is, material that the doomed star or its companion sheds before it explodes) in it that the current thermonuclear models could not explain. To help solve this conundrum, Dr. Stephen Reynolds and Dr. Kazimierz Borkowski had a spectacular 9-day Chandra dataset that I could pick apart to quantify and characterize the material. Thus, I gave up my previous summer endeavors of roasting in the sun, twirling a whistle, and yelling at children for the very different work of an astrophysicist.<\/p>\n<p>Since that summer, the Kepler project has progressed and expanded quite a bit. My statistical analysis of the remnant became much more elaborate over time as well. At the end, the analysis algorithm successfully located the circumstellar material and allowed me to quantify it. It formed a very nice disk-shaped structure in the center and along the north rim, that, to my and my co-author's delight, was confirmed using a Spitzer Space Telescope infrared observation. Furthermore, the algorithm also located various other substructures in Kepler's supernova remnant, the most interesting of which was a large concentration of iron on the left side of the remnant near the center. We thought the feature might be a \"shadow\" of iron cast by the companion star that could have blocked a portion of the explosion.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, with a rough map of the remnant's structure beginning to establish itself, we decided to expand into the computational world to see if we could recreate what the observation had shown us. I did a few simple one-dimensional simulations using a program called VH-1 to test the idea using basic physics. When the results seemed successful, we passed the torch to Dr. John Blondin, our local expert on VH-1 and a co-author on our new paper. He turned the data we gave him into a beautiful 2D simulation, that when projected over 3 dimensions, seemed to form our circumstellar disk almost perfectly.<\/p>\n<div style=\"float:right; width: 150px; height=\"195\"; margin: 1em;><img src=\"\/blog\/files\/images\/mary_burkey.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Burkey\"><\/div>\n<p>Though our published results included the aforementioned computation, there is always more to do. The iron shadow could potentially reveal even more hints of the original thermonuclear explosion. The feature may even be worth its own simulation similar to that of the circumstellar disk. We could also look closer at several other substructures that the algorithm found within Kepler. With any luck, all of these hints and those provided by similar remnants will soon sum to a better understanding of how Type Ia supernovas explode. The Milky Way itself is long overdue for a supernova, particularly an Ia. One day, such an event will happen. When it does, our armada of telescopes and astronomical devices will begin observing the new star with as much fervor as Kepler himself did all those years ago. Hopefully then, we will officially know how these stars meet their demise. Who knows, maybe when such an event does happen, it will break the convention and behave just as astrophysicists anticipated it would.<\/p>\n<p>-Mary Burkey<\/p>\n &amp; Supernova RemnantsSun, 17 Mar 2013 21:09:26 -0400chandra429 at  Swift, Chandra Explore a Youthful 'Star Wreck'\n<p><a href=\"\/photo\/2013\/g306\/\"><img src=\"\/photo\/2013\/g306\/g306_525.jpg\" alt=\"G306.3-0.9\" width=\"525\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>While performing an extensive X-ray survey of our galaxy's central regions, NASA's Swift satellite has uncovered the previously unknown remains of a shattered star.

Without nuclear fusion to support the star, the core collapses to form a black hole while the outer layers of the star are thrown into space. In most supernova explosions that form a black hole, all the core material is pulled into the newly collapsed object. However, if the core of the star rotates rapidly (with one rotation every five millseconds!), then some of the heavy core metals can be expelled in jets at the poles of the star at velocities near the speed of light. And should these jets be pointed directly at Earth, the energy of the explosion is beamed into a tremendous flash of light known as gamma-ray bursts.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center; width: 525px;\"><a href=\"\/photo\/2013\/w49b\/\"><img src=\"\/photo\/2013\/w49b\/w49b_525.jpg\" alt=\"W49B\" width=\"525\"><\/a><br \/>W49B<\/div>\n<p>One thousand years later, the remnant of a gamma-ray burst would look different from a more run-of-the-mill supernova. For starters, a typical supernova is relatively spherical (i.e., the metals explode evenly in every direction, as in the supernova remnant E0102 shown in the image), whereas a gamma-ray burst should have jets full of heavy metals. By contrast, after a thousand years, the jets would have expanded and be seen as a \"bar\" with large amounts of iron (see image of W49B). Typical core-collapse supernovae do not produce nearly as much iron, so by measuring the amount of iron, chromium, and manganese compared to other elements in a supernova, we can assess whether W49B did arise from a gamma-ray burst.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center; width: 525px;\"><a href=\"\/photo\/2009\/e0102\/\"><img src=\"\/photo\/2009\/e0102\/e0102.jpg\" alt=\"E0102\" width=\"525\"><\/a><br \/>E0102<\/div>\n<p>With this goal, we observed W49B with the Chandra X-ray Observatory Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS). Chandra gives us the capability to map and compare the amount of the metals produced in the explosion. Because those metals are so hot (around 10 million degrees), they emit copious X-rays. The Chandra images reveal that W49B does have a \"bar\" of iron, and the data shows that the relative amount of silicon and sulfur is much less than what theory predicts for a typical core-collapse supernova. Thus, the shape and metals of W49B show the explosion has the jets we associate with gamma-ray bursts.<\/p>\n<p>Chandra also allows us to search for the compact object leftover from the supernova. For a very massive star that has a gamma-ray burst, we expect the explosion to produce a black hole. For a less massive star (between eight and twenty times the mass of the Sun, roughly), astronomers think that the explosion would form a neutron star. Neutron stars are tiny objects (with a radius of only 10 km!), but they are expected to be very bright in X-rays when they are a thousand years old because the neutron star surface is so hot. With the superb imaging of Chandra, we looked for a neutron star, and we couldn't find anything. In fact, the deep observation allowed us to say there's no neutron star in W49B that's even 1\/100 as bright as astronomers think it would be. This result supports the fact that W49B's supernova formed a black hole, which is consistent with the explosion having been a gamma-ray burst.<\/p>\n<p>So, did W49B result from a gamma-ray burst? Probably not, since the jets weren't pointed toward us. In other words, given that we see the \"bar\" of iron that was the jet, it means the explosion happened perpendicular to our view from Earth. However, the explosion of W49B's progenitor star does have all the telltale signs of a gamma-ray burst, and it probably would have looked like a GRB if the jets were oriented toward Earth. This result means that these exotic explosions can happen within our own Galaxy, and further study of W49B will give great insights into how these awesome events come about.<\/p>\n &amp; Supernova RemnantsTue, 12 Feb 2013 21:50:28 -0500chandra423 at  Kepler's Supernova Unusually Powerful?\n<p><a href=\"\/photo\/2012\/kepler\/\"><img src=\"\/photo\/2012\/kepler\/kepler_w11.jpg\" alt=\"Kepler&#039;s Supernova Remnant\" width=\"525\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>.<\/p>\n<p>.<\/p>\n<p> (light yellow and blue), showing stars in the field.<\/p>\n<p> 11 Sep 2012 12:09:52 -0400chandra396 at  Supernova Cocoon Breakthrough \n<p><a href=\" src=\" alt=\"SN 2010jl\" width=\"420\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Observ.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>A team of researchers used Chandra to observe this supernova in December 2010 and again in October 2011.

Using very long observations of Cassiopeia A (or Cas A), a team of scientists has mapped the distribution of elements in the supernova remnant in unprecedented detail. This information shows where the different layers of the pre-supernova star are located three hundred years after the explosion, and provides insight into the nature of the supernova.<\/p>\n<p>An artist's illustration on the left shows a simplified picture of the inner layers of the star that formed Cas A just before it exploded, with the predominant concentrations of different elements represented by different colors: iron in the core (blue), overlaid by sulfur and silicon (green), then magnesium, neon and oxygen (red). The image from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory on the right uses the same color scheme to show the distribution of iron, sulfur and magnesium in the supernova remnant. The data show that the distributions of sulfur and silicon are similar, as are the distributions of magnesium and neon. Oxygen, which according to theoretical models is the most abundant element in the remnant, is difficult to detect because the X-ray emission characteristic of oxygen ions is strongly absorbed by gas in along the line of sight to Cas A, and because almost all the oxygen ions have had all their electrons stripped away.<\/p>\n<p>A comparison of the illustration and the Chandra element map shows clearly that most of the iron, which according to theoretical models of the pre-supernova was originally on the inside of the star, is now located near the outer edges of the remnant. Surprisingly, there is no evidence from X-ray (Chandra) or infrared (Spitzer Space Telescope) observations for iron near the center of the remnant, where it was formed. Also, much of the silicon and sulfur, as well as the magnesium, is now found toward the outer edges of the still-expanding debris.

{"text":"Abstract:\n\nA simple scenario of cosmological reionization is presented. In hierarchical clustering models of structure formation, numerous nonlinear objects on small scales would collapse much earlier than a redshift z \u223c10. Our scenario assumes that such objects dissipate their kinetic energy efficiently into heat and eventually provide copious ionizing photons which reionize the universe almost instantaneously. We derive a simple estimate of the energy conversion efficiency required for the full reionization. Then we apply the formula to a specific hierarchical clustering model in which the power spectrum of density fluctuation obeys a single power-law P(k) \u221dkn approximately on scales of interest (at standard recombination epoch). After comparing the resulting production rate of ionizing photons with cooling rates of the relevant processes, we find that models with the spectral index n \u2265-1 can potentially reionize the universe at z \u226510. For flatter spectra, the universe remains effectively neutral. This index is somewhat larger than the conventional value around -2 on galactic scales in a cold dark matter universe, but is preferred phenomenologically in primordial isocurvature baryon models, for instance. Therefore it is possible to achieve a reionization of the universe naturally due to the energy release associated with the structure formation. We discuss briefly the implications of our scenario, in particular on the anisotropies and distortion of the cosmic microwave background, and on a characteristic mass of galaxies."}

{"text":"M33 X-7: The Most Massive Stellar-Mass Black Hole\n\nA\nblack hole\nis an object with a gravitational field so intense that\nnothing---not even light---can escape.\nIn the present-day universe,\nblack holes are formed by the collapse of very massive stars. It is\nbelieved that our Milky Way galaxy contains a few hundred million\nstellar-mass black holes. A small number of these black holes are in\nclose binary systems with a normal star. If the star is close enough,\ngas from its outer layers can bleed onto the black hole. As this gas\nfalls toward the black hole, it is heated by friction to a temperature\nof millions of degrees thereby producing a brilliant source of X-rays\nthat is brighter than 10,000 suns. These black-hole X-ray sources are\neasily observed throughout the Milky Way, and in nearby galaxies as\nwell, using orbiting X-ray observatories. During the past 30 years, I\nand other observers have determined the masses of 21 of these black\nholes by measuring the velocities of their companion stars.\n\nRecent X-ray observations using NASA's\nChandra X-ray Observatory\nhave\nrevealed a remarkable X-ray source that is periodically eclipsed every\n3.5 days by its companion star. The X-ray source is located in the\nspiral galaxy\nM33\nat a distance of 2.6 million light years in the\nconstellation of Triangulum. Eclipsing binaries are relatively rare\nbecause they require that the system be observed nearly edge-on, and\nthere are only a few such systems known that contain a strong X-ray\nsource. This eclipsing X-ray source, which was dubbed \"M33 X-7,\" is the\nonly one thought to contain a black hole (the others contain\nneutron stars).\n\nI am the leader of an international team that obtained optical\nobservations of M33 X-7 using the\n8.2 meter Gemini North telescope,\nwhich is located on the Island of Hawaii. In total, we obtained several\ndozen spectral and imaging observations during the fall of last year.\nThe Doppler velocities of the companion star, which are inferred from\nthe spectra, show that its orbital velocity in the line-of-sight exceeds\n110 km\/sec (for comparison, the Earth's orbital speed is 32 km\/sec). A\ndetailed analysis of all of the data yields mass estimates for the X-ray\nsource and companion star of 14 and 60 times the mass of the Sun,\nrespectively. Our determination of M33 X-7's large mass establishes that\nthe X-ray source is a black hole, since the mass of any other collapsed\nobject, such as a neutron or quark star, cannot exceed about 3 Sun\nmasses.\n\nThe confirmation of the presence of a black hole in M33 X-7 is exciting\nfor a number of reasons. This is the only known eclipsing binary that\ncontains a black hole, and the presence of eclipses opens up new\npossibilities for exploring the properties of black holes. Furthermore,\nthis is one of the most massive black-hole remnants of stellar collapse\nthat have been discovered to date. In addition, the companion star in\nM33 X-7 is the most massive companion star in an X-ray binary, making\nthis system central to the study of the evolution of X-ray binaries and\nof massive stars themselves. It is also notable that the determination\nof a precise mass for M33 X-7 at a distance that is 100 times that of\nMilky-Way black holes marks a breakthrough in observational capability.\nFinally, with the distance to the source and the mass of the black hole\nknown, and using the exquisite Chandra X-ray data, my collaborators and\nI are in the process of measuring the spin of this black hole. Since a\nblack hole is completely defined by just two numbers that specify its\nmass and spin (we know of nothing else this simple except for an\nelectron or a quark!), the measurement of M33 X-7's spin will provide us\nwith a complete description of this distant black hole.\nin extreme conditions."}

{"text":"Medium Black Hole May Be Hiding in Omega Centauri\n\nOmega Centauri is one of Milky Way's most massive globular star cluster, located about 17,000 light years away from Earth and containing several millions of stars. Evidence suggests that there may be a massive object in its core, with tremendous gravitational pull, possibly a medium-sized black hole with a mass estimated at about 40,000 solar masses.\n\nUsually, globular star clusters are held together only by the collective\n\ngravitational pull exerted by the millions of stars inside them. There are possibly more than 200 globular star clusters in all of our galaxy. Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics astronomer, Eva Noyola says that: \"This result shows that there is a continuous range of masses for black holes, from supermassive, to intermediate, to small, stellar types.\"\n\n\"This finding also is important because the theory of formation for supermassive black holes requires seed black holes that are exactly in the mass range of the one we found. Such seeds have not been identified so far. If these types of intermediate-mass black holes happen to be common in stars clusters, then they can provide numerous seeds for the formation of the supermassive black holes,\" she added.\n\nIntermediate black holes\n\nThere is little evidence that intermediate-sized black holes even exist, as none have ever been found. Additionally, their formation process is not very well understood; it is known that low mass black holes may take shape out of the massive stars in their final stages of life, and there is evidence that supermassive black holes are found in galactic nuclei, such as that of the Milky Way, however medium-sized black holes remain mostly elusive.\n\n\"Before this observation, we had only one example of an intermediate-mass black hole in the globular cluster G1, in the nearby Andromeda Galaxy,\" said astronomer Karl Gebhartd from the University of Texas, part of the team that made the discovery.\n\nMeasurements made with the Hubble Space Telescope and Gemini Observatory revealed that the stars in the near vicinity of the core of Omega Centauri move at speeds much higher than those expected, thus there must be some kind of unseen object that is interacting gravitationally with them.\n\nThe only object which could create such a massive gravitational disturbance must be a black hole, however there may be a couple of other causes which determine such a configuration.\n\nAlternatives to black hole\n\nAnother possible explanation for the speed excess would be the presence of a large collection of dead stars in the core, such as white dwarfs and neutron stars. Secondly, the star in the center of Omega Centauri may actually have a highly elliptical orbit, which could appear to us as they are moving really fast.\n\n\"For both alternative scenarios it is very hard to get stars to behave that way, either the burned-out stars really bunched up in the center or many stars with very elongated orbits. The normal evolution of a star cluster like Omega Centauri should not end up with stars behaving in those ways. But even if we assume that either scenario did happen somehow, both configurations are expected to be very short lived. A clump of burned-out stars, for example, are expected to move farther away from the center quickly. The stars with elongated orbits are expected to become circular very quickly,\" said Noyola.\n\nGalactic core\n\nThe Omega Centauri globular star cluster is extremely massive for its type of object. That's why it is believed that it is most likely the core of a former dwarf galaxy which may have collided with our galaxy at some point in time. Usually, there is a direct relation between the black hole in the galactic nuclei and the mass of the host galaxy, and with a mass 10 million times that of the Sun, Omega Centauri matches exactly the size of its black hole."}

The finger appears to move a little compared to the background of more-distant objects. Measuring how much it moves tells you the finger's distance -- and the same thing works with stars: Measuring a star's parallax reveals its distance from Earth.\n\nThe Berkeley astronomers used an array of radio telescopes from New Hampshire to Hawaii to pinpoint the parallax of a young star in the nebula.

{"text":"The newfound \"microquasar\" is a similar object, just smaller. Analyzing how this luminous monster is ripping apart a star could help shed light on the mysteries surrounding black holes, scientists said.\n\nMicroquasars\n\nIn 1994, astronomers discovered the first microquasars, which are black holes several times the mass of the sun. As they devour material from a companion star, the matter they pull off forms rapidly spinning disks around the microquasars that become hot enough to emit X-rays. These disks also spit out narrow jets of energetic particles that fly at nearly the speed of light and generate strong bursts of radio emissions. [Photos: Black Holes of the Universe]\n\nUntil now, the four known microquasars were all located within our Milky Way galaxy.\n\n\"Obscuration within our galaxy makes it difficult to study the disks of these microquasars,\" said study lead author Matthew Middleton, an astrophysicist at the Astronomical Institute Anton Pannekoek in Amsterdam.\n\nNow, an international team of scientists has discovered the first microquasar outside the Milky Way, 2.5 million light-years from Earth in the Andromeda Galaxy.\n\n\"Finding one in a neighboring galaxy means we probably can find many more, thus helping our efforts to better understand their physics,\" Middleton explained.\n\nThe microquasar, called XMMU J004243.6+412519, was discovered by the orbiting X-ray observatory XMM-Newton on Jan. 15. NASA's Swift and Chandra satellites then observed it regularly for more than eight weeks. New Mexico's Very Large Array and Very Long Baseline Array, and the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array in the United Kingdom, also studied the object at radio wavelengths.\n\nUltraluminous\n\nXMMU J004243.6+412519 is an ultraluminous X-ray source, which can outshine an entire galaxy in X-rays. At its brightest, the amount of X-rays that XMMU J004243.6+412519 radiated was about a million greater than all the light the sun puts out, Middleton told SPACE.com.\n\nAstronomers have spent years debating whether ultraluminous X-ray sources are microquasars or just more massive black holes eating more slowly. The researchers saw extremely bright radio-wave emissions from this ultraluminous X-ray source that helped solve the mystery of its identity.\n\nSpecifically, the investigators saw that radio emissions from XMMU J004243.6+412519 dropped by half in just 30 minutes.\n\n\"This tells us that the region producing radio waves is extremely small in size, no farther across than the distance between Jupiter and the sun,\" said study author James Miller-Jones at the Curtin University node of the International Center for Radio Astronomy Research in Perth, Australia. This is \"a dead giveaway\" that ultraluminous X-ray sources \"are just normal, everyday black holes,\" Miller-Jones said.\n\n\"Our observations tell us that this ultraluminous X-ray source \u2014 and by extension, many others \u2014 is just a run-of-the-mill black hole, only about 10 times the mass of the sun, that is swallowing material as fast as it can,\" Middleton said. The scientists estimate that its companion is a middle-sized, rather than a giant, star.\n\nThe microquasar brightened and faded over the course of six months as it gorged on its companion star.\n\n\"We watched a black hole go from nibbling daintily at an appetizer to binging on the main course, and then gradually slowing down over dessert,\" Middleton said.\n\nAt its peak, the researchers estimate the microquasar devoured matter at a rate of about 10 trillion tons \u2014 about 25 times the mass of all the people on Earth \u2014 per second. This rate is close to a theoretical maximum known as the Eddington limit.\n\nAlthough the Andromeda microquasar is about 100 times farther away from Earth than Milky Way microquasars are, the absence of dust and gas in that direction allows researchers an unhindered view of the Andromeda microquasar. This could give scientists key new insights on the mysteries of how black holes work, such as how they behave near the Eddington limit.\n\n\"Understanding how these things work is important, because we think quasars played a big role in redistributing matter and energy when the universe was very young,\" Middleton said.\n\n\"The next logical step is to search nearby galaxies for more of these sources,\" Middleton added.\n\nThe scientists detailed their findings online today (Dec. 12) in the journal Nature"}
{"text":"In this topic you will learn about the billions of stars of which the Sun is one.\n\nA star is a large, hot ball of gas, which is held together by gravity, and gives off its own light. Stars are actually at different distances from Earth.\n\nHow do scientists know a star's distance? If a star is close, they view it from different points in Earth's orbit. The star appears to shift its location compared with other stars farther away. This apparent shift of an object's location when viewed from two positions is called parallax. The closer a star is, the greater the shift. By measuring the shift, scientists can tell how far the star is.\n\nAstronomers use a unit called the light-year to describe distances in space. A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, or about 9 trillion kilometers. The easiest way to find a star is by looking for its constellation. A constellation is a number of stars that appear to form a pattern. Rigel is a star in the constellation Orion.\n\nSome stars are brighter than others. Sirius, in the constellation Canis Major, is the brightest star in the winter sky. It appears brighter than Rigel. However, Rigel is actually a brighter star than Sirius. The reason Sirius appears brighter is that it is closer to us than Rigel. The word magnitude is used to describe the brightness of a star. It can describe the actual brightness of a star, the absolute magnitude. It can also describe the apparent magnitude, the brightness of a star as you see it in the night sky. That depends on how much light it gives off and how far away it is.\n\nA star begins its life as a nebula, an enormous cloud of gas and dust in space. As time goes by, gravity causes the nebula to contract. As the cloud shrinks, it heats up. Eventually the center reaches a temperature of several million degrees. At these temperatures nuclear reactions occur. Four hydrogen atoms fuse and form one helium atom. Energy is released. During its life, a star may become unstable; it may develop into a supernova\u2014a star that explodes. A large, massive star that becomes a supernova may form a black hole. A black hole is an object whose gravity is so strong that light cannot escape it.\n\nThe Sun is the closest star to Earth. It contains 99.8 percent of all the mass in the solar system. The Sun is made of mostly hydrogen. The hydrogen atoms fuse together in the Sun forming helium atoms. This nuclear fusion produces the heat and light energy that Earth needs to sustain life."}
{"text":"All posts tagged 'Manatee nebula'\n\nEven in death, there can be great beauty. Consider supernova remnants, the results of massive stars dying in great explosions, creating some of the most spectacular cosmic objects around.\n\nEvery 50 years or so, a star in our galaxy with more than 10 times the mass of our sun will expire. When such stars die, they go supernova, one of the most violent events in our universe. These explosions shoot off tons of material from the central star at up to 10 percent the speed of light.\n\nThough the area surrounding stars seems empty, it is usually home to vast amounts of interstellar gas and dust. The supernova's outburst runs into this surrounding material, creating a shockwave and heating it to temperatures greater than 10,000 Celsius. Over thousands of years, the local structure of the gas and dust shapes the stellar outpouring into shells, filaments, and other diffuse forms. Astronomers call these objects supernova remnants.\n\nSupernova explosions and the remnants they leave behind have wide-ranging effects. They heat up the interstellar medium, creating complex chemistry out in space, and are responsible for accelerating protons and other atomic nuclei, which go zipping around the universe as cosmic rays. Perhaps most importantly, supernova explosions generate and liberate heavy elements, such as oxygen, carbon, and all metals, distributing them out into the wider cosmos. These elements eventually find their way into planetary systems, making life possible on at least one world that we know of.\n\nHere, we take a look at some of the most famous and beautiful supernova remnants, giving you a chance to contemplate life, death, and cycles of renewal in the universe.\n\nAbove:\n\nSupernova Superbubble\n\nThe supernova remnant N186 D appears as a bright pink spot at the top of this new image released by NASA on Jan. 28, spewing off tremendous amounts of X-rays. Located in the Large Magellanic Cloud about 160,000 light-years away, the remnant is blowing a huge bubble (the giant structure below the bright spot) as hot wind carves out a shock wave in the surrounding material.\n\nMeet the newly named Manatee nebula. Officially known as W50, this cloud of gas and dust is the remnant of a supernova explosion that happened 10,000 years ago in the constellation Aquila.\n\nThis image, released and renamed by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory on Jan. 19 to coincide with the Florida Manatee Festival, bears witness to the correspondence that heavenly phenomena sometimes have for more familiar things on Earth. Both the NRAO staff and members of the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge, home to many endangered West Indian manatees, hope to draw attention to the 40th anniversary of the Endangered Species Act with the release. The nebula joins the ranks of other nebulas named for animals, such as the Eagle nebula, Crab nebula, and Horsehead nebula.\n\nBut that's not all. According to a press release from both organizations, manatees have a lot in common with the Manatee nebula, including the fact that:\n\nThe cloud is the remnant of a star that is impossible to spot with a common telescope; you need a telescope that can detect the low-energy radio wave light radiated by the nebula's gases. Manatees can be hard to see in murky shallow waters. Spotters detect their presence by air bubbles and wakes.\n\nThe nebula bears arc-like scars carved into it by particles blasted from the jets of the exploded star's remnant, a black hole, at its center. The scars bring to mind the scars many manatees bear from boat propellers that have gotten too close.\n\nThe nebula took more than 10,000 years to assume its manatee-like shape. Manatees also have a long gestation and infancy period \u2013 well, at least compared to other earthly creatures. Gestation lasts 12 to 14 months and infancy, two to five years.\n\nRight.\n\nStill, that got us thinking: Just how much do all those other nebulas actually resemble their biological namesakes? In this gallery, we take a side-by-side comparison of animal-shaped nebula and their animal doppelgangers. Please let us know which ones are most (or least) deserving of their titles and whether you can think of a better alternative in the comments.\n\nAbove:\n\nManatee Nebula\n\nWe have to admit that the Manatee nebula is a pretty close twin to this happy-looking manatee."}
{"text":"(PhysOrg.com) -- The star TW Hydrae is located about 150 light-years from earth in the direction of the constellation of Hydrae, the Water Snake. This star is relatively young -- at about 10 million years old it has passed out of its infancy but is not yet mature.\n\nAstronomers are trying to understand the processes at work around stars at this stage in their lives, when planets might be developing from disks around them, and TW Hydrae is a valuable example for two reasons: it is relatively close by and therefore bright, and it is rotating with its pole pointed nearly directly towards earth, enabling scientists to view the star's surrounding disk of material nearly face on.\n\nLike other young stars of its size and age, TW Hydrae emits strong X-rays. The question is why, and how might they effect the star's proto-planetary disk? Several mechanisms have been proposed, including coronal magnetic field activity similar to that on the sun, accretion onto the stellar surface that might also contribute to winds and flares, and shocks from jets that develop. Each mechanism has associated with it hot gas with characteristic temperatures and densities.\n\nSAO astronomers Nancy Brickhouse, Steve Cranmer, Andrea Dupree, Juan Luna, and Scott Wolk used the High Energy Transmission Grating on the Chandra X-ray Observatory to obtain the most detailed X-ray spectra of this star ever seen.\n\nThey measure and model forty-two emission lines from gas present at extremely high temperatures, ranging from between about 2 million to 10 million degrees kelvin. Their results show that the star has both a hot solar-like corona and an accretion shock at relatively high densities and small volumes.\n\nInterestingly, the shocked gas heats a larger volume of the stellar atmosphere up to 2 million degrees, much hotter than the 10,000 degree hot spots previously known from optical and ultraviolet spectra. The new results are able to explain many of the earlier puzzles associated with X-ray emission, help to identify how winds can be produced in these stars, and suggest that the magnetic processes at work in this star are by no means unique but may be ubiquitous in other young stars of similar mass.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nIn a special feature published this week, Astronomy & Astrophysics presents the first round of results from a large project conducted with XMM-Newton, the \"XMM-Newton extended survey of the Taurus molecular cloud\" (XEST). ...This week, Astronomy & Astrophysics is publishing new observations with AMBER\/VLTI of the gas component in the vicinity of young stars.

Known as MOSFIRE (Multi-Object Spectrometer for Infra-Red Exploration), the device has been installed in the Keck I Telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, where it receives infrared light that the telescope collects. This allows MOSFIRE to sift through cosmic dust and see faraway objects whose light has been redshifted as a result of the universe's ongoing expansion.\n\nAccording to project leader Ian S.

{"text":"Watching a 'New Star' Make the Universe Dusty\n\nJul 24, 2008\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Using ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer, and its remarkable acuity, astronomers were able for the first time to witness the appearance of a shell of dusty gas around a star that had just erupted, and follow its evolution for more than 100 days. This provides the astronomers with a new way to estimate the distance of this object and obtain invaluable information on the operating mode of stellar vampires, dense stars that suck material from a companion.\n\nAlthough novae were first thought to be new stars appearing in the sky, hence their Latin name, they are now understood as signaling the brightening of a small, dense star. Novae occur in double star systems comprising a white dwarf - the end product of a solar-like star - and, generally, a low-mass normal star - a red dwarf. The two stars are so close together that the red dwarf cannot hold itself together and loses mass to its companion. Occasionally, the shell of matter that has fallen onto the ingesting star becomes unstable, leading to a thermonuclear explosion which makes the system brighter.\n\nNova Scorpii 2007a (or V1280 Scorpii), was discovered by Japanese amateur astronomers on 4 February 2007 towards the constellation Scorpius (\"the Scorpion\"). For a few days, it became brighter and brighter, reaching its maximum on 17 February, to become one of the brightest novae of the last 35 years. At that time, it was easily visible with the unaided eye.\n\nEleven days after reaching its maximum, astronomers witnessed the formation of dust around the object. Dust was present for more than 200 days, as the nova only slowly emerged from the smoke between October and November 2007. During these 200 days, the erupting source was screened out efficiently, becoming more than 10,000 times dimmer in the visual.\n\nAn unprecedented high spatial resolution monitoring of the dust formation event was carried out with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), extending over more than 5 months following the discovery. The astronomers first used the AMBER near-infrared instrument, then, as the nova continued to produce dust at a high rate, they moved to using the MIDI mid-infrared instrument, that is more sensitive to the radiation of the hot dust. Similarly, as the nova became fainter, the astronomers switched from the 1.8-m Auxiliary Telescopes to their larger brethren, the 8.2-m Unit Telescopes. With the interferometry mode, the resolution obtained is equivalent to using a telescope with a size between 35 and 71 metres (the distance between the 2 telescopes used).\n\nThe first observations, secured 23 days after the discovery, showed that the source was very compact, less than 1 thousandth of an arcsecond (1 milli-arcsecond or mas), which is a size comparable to viewing one grain of sand from about 100 kilometres away. A few days later, after the detection of the major dust formation event, the source measured 13 mas.\n\n\"It is most likely that the latter size corresponds to the diameter of the dust shell in expansion, while the size previously measured was an upper limit of the erupting source,\" explains lead author Olivier Chesneau. Over the following months the dusty shell expanded regularly, at a rate close to 2 million km\/h.\n\n\"This is the first time that the dust shell of a nova is spatially resolved and its evolution traced starting from the onset of its formation up to the point that it becomes too diluted to be seen\", says co-author Dipankar Banerjee, from India.\n\nThe measurement of the angular expansion rate, together with the knowledge of the expansion velocity, enables the astronomer to derive the distance of the object, in this case about 5500 light-years.\n\n\"This is a new and promising technique for providing distances of close novae. This was made possible because the state of the art facility of the VLTI, both in terms of infrastructure and management of the observations, allows one to schedule such observations,\" says co-author Markus Wittkowski from ESO.\n\nMoreover, the quality of the data provided by the VLTI was such that it was possible to estimate the daily production of dust and infer the total mass ejected. \"Overall, V1280 Sco probably ejected more than the equivalent of 33 times the mass of the Earth, a rather impressive feat if one considers that this mass was ejected from a star not larger in radius than the Earth,\" concludes Chesneau. Of this material, about a percent or less was in the form of dust.\n\n\"VLTI monitoring of the dust formation event of the Nova V1280 Sco\", by O. Chesneau et al. appears today in the research journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.\n\n(Phys.org) \u2014Astronomers have discovered light echoing off material surrounding a recent supernova explosion, SN 2009ig.

If there were an infinite number of stars and the universe was infinitely old, there would be a star everywhere you looked in the night sky and it would be very bright indeed.\n\nBut the universe isn't infinitely old. It was created approximately 14 billion years ago and since the speed of light is constant, we can only see objects that are less than 14 billion light years away. This means that we are living within a spherical 'observable universe' which is smaller that the total universe and that the light from stars further away from us than 14 billion light years will not have had enough time to reach the Earth.\n\nIn addition, the universe is expanding and all the galaxies, and their stars, are moving away from us. Thanks to this, the light from a moving star changes colour in a similar way that sound from a moving ambulance siren changes pitch. The light that we observe from distant receding stars is more red than it would be if they were stationary \u2013 the light is 'red shifted'. In many cases the red shift is large enough to move the light out of the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum."}

Astronomers refined the star's age to about 14.5 billion years (which is older than the universe), plus or minus 800 million years.\n\nIcon in Space\n\nAstronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope orbiting Earth to observe the Methuselah Star HD 140283 - the oldest known star in the sun's solar neighborhood.\n\nOldest Known Star HD 140283 & Neighbors\n\nThis artist's view shows the oldest known star HD 140283, which is about 190.1 light-years from Earth. Astronomers say the star looks like it is up to 14.5 billion years old, which would be older than the universe, if true. Because the aging star is relatively nearby, familiar stars and constellations as seen from Earth are in the sky, but in different locations, as seen in this annotated view.\n\nAt upper left is the constellation Orion, which looks distorted from our new perspective in space. Just to the upper left of the foreground star is the Pleiades cluster. To the lower left of the cluster, our Sun has dimmed to an apparent magnitude of +7, placing it below naked-eye visibility.\n\nOldest Known Star HD 140283: Backyard View\n\nThis is a backyard view of the sky surrounding the ancient star, cataloged as HD 140283, which lies 190.1 light-years from Earth. The star is the oldest known to astronomers to date. Image released March 7, 2013.\n\nParallax Star Distance Observation Explained\n\nDistances to stars comparatively near to our Sun can be measured using trigonometric parallax. This can only be done if the star is close enough to show an apparent shift in position relative to much farther background stars, as seen at upper right. This requires viewing the star on two occasions, when Earth is at opposite sides of the Sun (seen at lower left). The Hubble Space Telescope can then precisely measure the very small angular displacement of the star between observations. When the offset value is combined using geometry with the value for Earth's orbital diameter, a precise distance can be calculated."}
{"text":"Exploring at Other Wavelengths\n\nFor a long time, astronomy meant \"optical\" astronomy: the science of looking at a star and classifying it by its color and brightness. The development of sophisticated detection techniques that enabled astronomers to examine the whole range of the electromagnetic spectrum completely transformed that science.\n\nThese days, astronomers are increasingly involved in multiwavelength studies \u2013 making observations at energies ranging from the lowest possible (radio) to the highest ever detected (gamma rays).\n\nSpiral galaxy NGC 891\nImage Copyright: WIYN Consortium Inc\n\nIt is not always possible to study an object across the whole range of energies. The emissions of some objects are too faint to be detected, while some objects are obscured, and some just don't produce any radiation at a given energy. One of the key points of multiwavelength studies is that just detecting radiation at a given energy provides crucial information on the physical conditions existing in the object, because different physical phenomena produce different signature radiation.\n\nSometimes, a multiwavelength analysis of an object suffices to explain its mystery or at least clarify it. For example, in 2003, scientists were analyzing X-ray images of a supernova remnant called Vela when they discovered an unknown object hidden behind it. Both the image and the scant X-ray spectrum of this new object seemed to indicate that it was another young supernova remnant, but they could not be sure. The follow-up detection of the high energy radioactive decay of Titanium-44 (an element usually formed during supernova explosions) established with certainty that it was indeed a young supernova remnant. Both the X-ray spectra and the very high energy line helped solve this mystery. One piece of information would not have been enough.\n\nSometimes these astronomical mysteries are not solved completely (not yet, at least), though they are made less puzzling by multiwavelength studies. This was the case with a set of sources discovered by the EGRET instrument on the Compton Gamma-ray Observatory in the 1990s. EGRET discovered a number of sources in the gamma-ray sky for which there were no-known counterparts at any wavelength. Astronomers have studied these sources, searching near their gamma-ray positions for signatures in other wavelengths.\n\nThis plot shows an all-sky view of the\nsources observed by EGRET. The unidentified sources \u2013\nthose without a counterpart in other wavelengths and whose\nnature was unknown at the time of discovery \u2013 are shown with\ngreen circles.\n\nThe Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope's Large Area Telescope (LAT), in addition to other instruments on other observatories, has enabled astronomers to classify the objects. According to Neil Gehrels, chief of the Astroparticle Physics Laboratory at NASA\/GSFC, as of June 2011, nearly all of the original EGRET sources have now been identified, but Fermi's LAT has found approximately 500 new unidentified sources.\n\nGehrels says that some of the EGRET unidentified sources were not seen with the more sensitive Fermi instruments, and astronomers think that these may not have been objects, but artifacts caused by not knowing exactly how much of the diffuse emission to subtract in that region when searching for the objects. He says that it is also possible that a few that disappeared were real sources in the EGRET era that have disappeared, but that it is impossible to know for sure.\n\nAbove are optical and X-ray images of a\ncluster of galaxies superimposed over each other. The purple\nfalse-color cloud is hot gas.\n\nIt can also happen that the mystery only deepens as the result of new information \u2013 a scientist's favorite scenario. This is what happened in the study of clusters of galaxies. Optical studies of rotation curves from galaxies revealed that the bright gas that one sees in a telescope could not account for all the matter present. Scientists began the search for this missing substance (or substances) referred to as \"dark matter.\" X-ray observations of clusters of galaxies revealed a hot gas (>10 million degrees) permeating between galaxies that are bound together by the gravitational potential of the group. This gas is invisible at any other energy, but unfortunately, it cannot account for all the missing matter. The combined X-ray and optical data still imply the presence of a hidden mass, sometimes 100 to 300 larger than the one observed. It is called \"dark matter\" not only because it is invisible at all energies that we have had a capability to see, but also because there are many kinds of this \"invisible\" matter that could compose dark matter. However, new techniques have been devised for finding these dark matter candidates, which involve not remote observation, but direct detection via the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer-2, installed in May 2011 on the International Space Station.\n\nThere are many more examples of the potential of multiwavelength observations. It will take more time until we are able to study the sky with the same precision at all the energies of the electromagnetic spectrum. When this happens, for the first time we will be able to contemplate the universe as it reallyis"}

{"text":"Weird Galaxy May Contain Only Dark Matter\n\nIn their studies of a large, distant galaxy, a team of astronomers made a very interesting finding. They were able to pinpoint the location of a very small, dwarf galaxy \u2013 in orbit around its larger counterpart. Remarkably, the smaller galaxy appears to be made exclusively out of dark matter.\n\nEven more interesting is that the object cannot be seen with telescopes, at any wavelengths. If the structure is indeed made up of dark matter, then that could explain why it's reflecting no light at all.\n\nDark matter \u2013 the stuff that makes up about 23 percent of the Universe \u2013 is believed to be made up of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMP) that, as the name implies, interact very poorly with baryonic matter. In fact, astrophysicists say that the two types of matter interact only through gravity.\n\nAstronomers discovered the tiny dark matter galaxy by analyzing how its gravitational pull is distorting light emanated by the larger galaxy. These distortions themselves are very small, yet modern technologies allow such sensitive investigations to be conducted, Space reports.\n\nExperts believe that studies revealing objects such as this one could be used to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of dark matter. The new data could then be used to explain the large-scale structure of the Universe, the history of galaxies and other issues related to the nature of the Universe.\n\nDuring the new study, experts from the University of California in Santa Barbara (UCSB) determined that the massive galaxy they were originally analyzing is located about 7 billion light-years away. This means that this is how it looked like when the Universe was less than half its current age.\n\nWhat drew experts' attention was the fact that the dark matter galaxy around it weighs just 190 million solar masses. While this may seem like a lot of first, consider that the Milky Way is tens of billions of times heavier than the Sun.\n\n\"This is the lowest mass galaxy that we've seen at this distance by far,\" UCSB astronomer and study coauthor Matthew Auger explains. He adds that his team used data from the Hawaii-based Keck Observatory in order to conduct the study.\n\nThis particular instrument was selected because it is outfitted with adaptive optics, a live image correction technology that allows it to compensate for how Earth's atmosphere blurs light.\n\n\"The image quality in the data we used here is somewhat better than the quality you can get from the Hubble Space Telescope,\" Auger says. The team published details of their discovery in the January 19 issue of the top scientific journal Nature."}

{"text":"What is star\n\nA star is a huge, shining ball that produces a large amount of energy in form of light and other forms. Stars are very far from us, thats why they look like twinkling points of light. Our sun is also a star. A lot of stars are like our sun. Some differ in mass, size, brightness and temperature.\n\nStars come in many sizes. Some of the stars have a radius of about 1,000 times that of the sun. The smallest stars are the neutron stars, some of which have a radius of only about 6 miles (10 kilometers). About 75 percent of all stars are members of a binary system, a pair of closely spaced stars that orbit each other. The sun is not a member of a binary system. However, its nearest known stellar neighbor, Proxima Centauri, is part of a multiple-star system that also includes Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B. Proxima Centauri is 4.2 light years far form sun.\n\nStars are grouped in huge structures called galaxies. Telescopes have revealed galaxies throughout the universe at distances of 12 billion to 16 billion light-years. Our sun is in a galaxy called the Milky Way that contains more than 100 billion stars. There are more than 100 billion galaxies in the universe, and the average number of stars per galaxy may be 100 billion.\n\nStars have life cycles. They born, pass through several phases, and finally die. The sun was born about 4.6 billion years ago and will remain much as it is for another 5 billion years. Then it will grow to become a red giant. Late in the sun's lifetime, it will cast off its outer layers. The remaining core, called a white dwarf, will slowly fade to become a black dwarf.\n\nOther stars will end their lives in different ways. Some will not go through a red giant stage. Instead, they will merely cool to become white dwarfs, then black dwarfs. A small percentage of stars will die in spectacular explosions called supernovae.\n\nBrightness of star seen from Earth depends on two factors:\n\nThe amount of light energy the star emits.\n\nThe distance from Earth to the star.\n\nA nearby star that is actually dim can appear brighter than a distant star that is really extremely brilliant. For example, Alpha Centauri A seems to be slightly brighter than a star known as Rigel. But Alpha Centauri A emits only 1\/100,000 as much light energy as Rigel. Alpha Centauri A seems brighter because it is only 1\/325 as far from Earth as Rigel is -- 4.4 light-years for Alpha Centauri A, 1,400 light-years for Rigel.\n\nThese characteristics are related to one another in a complex way. Color depends on surface temperature, and brightness depends on surface temperature and size. Mass affects the rate at which a star of a given size produces energy and so affects surface temperature. To make these relationships easier to understand, astronomers developed a graph called the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram.\n\nSurface temperature\n\nThe surface temperature of a star is determined by the rate of energy production at the core and the radius of the star and is often estimated from the star's color index. It is normally given as the effective temperature, which is the temperature of an idealized black body that radiates its energy at the same luminosity per surface area as the star. The temperature in the core region of a star is several million kelvins. The stellar temperature determines the rate of energization or ionization of different elements, resulting in characteristic absorption lines in the spectrum. The surface temperature of a star, along with its visual absolute magnitude and absorption features, is used to classify a star.\n\nMassive main sequence stars can have surface temperatures of 50,000 K. Smaller stars such as the Sun have surface temperatures of a few thousand K. Red giants have relatively low surface temperatures of about 3,600 K, but they also have a high luminosity due to their large exterior surface area.\n\nWhy stars are of different colors\n\nColor of star is the color of light the star is emitting. A star can appear red, if it emits light more towards red part of visible band of electromagnetic spectrum, and can appear blue if it emits light more towards blue part of visible spectrum. Our sun emits light equally among all wavelengths of visible spectrum. That is why our sun appears white to us.\n\nColor of the star depends on its surface temperature.\n\nTo understand how the color of a star depends on its temperature, we have to understand the concept of blackbody. A blackbody is a theoretical object that absorbs all radiation fall upon it. As a result it gets heated by absorbing all radiation, and starts emitting electromagnetic radiation at every wavelength. A plot of intensity versus wavelength of electromagnetic radiation emitted by blackbody is called blackbody spectrum. Figure 1 shows an example of blackbody spectrum.\n\nFigure-1: Blackbody Spectrum\n\nFigure 1 can be understood using Wien's law, which states the following relationship:\n\n\u03bb =\n\n2.9 x 10-6\n\nT\n\nwhere \u03bb is wavelength of maximum blackbody emission and T is the temperature of blackbody (in Kelvin)\n\nAs we can see that the relationship between wavelength and temperature is inverse. This means that as temperature will increase, wavelength will decrease or vice versa. Now if we take a look at figure 1, we will get the same relationship. There are 2 blackbody plots in figure 1, A and B. Body A is at a temperature of 20,000 K and body B is at a temperature of 5,000 K. Curve for Blackbody A peaks at a shorter wavelength than curve for blackbody B (Wavelength is increasing from left to right in figure 1), and blackbody A is at higher temperature than blackbody B.\n\nUntil this point we have seen that temperature is inversely proportional to the wavelength at which maximum emission from blackbody occurs. But this is not the end of story. Consider the following equation:\n\nL = 4\u03c0R2\u03c3T4\n\nwhere L is the luminosity in J\/s, 4\u03c0R2 is the surface area of the blackbody in m2, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature of the blackbody in Kelvin\n\nFigure-2\n\nAbove equation is called Stefan-Boltzmann law and it describes relationship between luminosity, temperature and size of blackbody. In figure 2, there are 3 blackbodies. Body A and C are at same temperature. We can see that intensity peaks for body A and C are same (at same height along Y-axis), but these 2 blackbodies are at different temperatures. This doesn't seem possible at first, but Stefan-Boltzmann law explains this. According to Stefan-Boltzmann law, intensity of emitted radiation not only depends on temperature, but on size of blackbody too.\n\nNow consider blackbodies B and C in figure. Both are at same temperature, but intensity or brightness is different. According to Stefan-Boltzmann law, we can conclude that blackbody B is smaller than C.\n\nAnother thing that should be noted from Stefan-Boltzmann law is that effect of change in temperature is more on the intensity of emitted radiation than change in size.\n\nStars are also known to astronomers as blackbodies. So blackbody characteristics apply on stars as well. As we know that color of the blackbody is the color of the light it emits or light emitted in a particular part of visible spectrum (if light emitted is in red part of visible spectrum, then color will be red; if light emitted is in blue part of visible spectrum, then color will be blue), and since color of light is due to its wavelength, we can say that color of star depends on its temperature as wavelength is related to temperature (Wein's law).\n\nLuminosity or Magnitude\n\nLuminosity is the brightness of star - i.e. total light emitted by star. The scientific term for rate of energy emission is power, and power is measured in watts. But in case of stars, luminosity is not measured in watts. Luminosity of a star is measured in terms of the luminosity of the sun, which is called Solar Luminosity. Luminosity of sun is 3.82 * 1026 watts. For example, luminosity of Alpha Centauri A is about 1.3 times solar luminosity.\n\nMagnitude is basically a measure of star's brightness. In ancient times, when there were no modern astronomical instruments, astronomers classify stars by their brightness. This system is now called stellar magnitude scale. Ancient astronomers developed this system by watching sky after sun set. The first stars that appeared were classified as first magnitude stars, second stars that appeared are classified as second magnitude stars and so on, upto six magnitude stars. Stars with magnitude six were the faintest stars.\n\nModern astronomers further classified this magnitude scale into apparent magnitude and absolute magnitude. Apparent magnitude of a star is related to its brightness and absolute magnitude is related to its luminosity. Modern astronomers also extended magnitude scale to include negative and decimal numbers and faintest stars upto 26th magnitude.\n\nApparent magnitude:\n\nApparent magnitude is a measure of star's brightness, or how bright a star appears to human eye. But in modern days, astronomers do not depend on their eyes. They use modern instruments like telescopes, photometers etc. So we can say that apparent magnitude is a measure that how bright a star appears to viewer or observer.\n\nBrightness of a star depends on the distance of star, size of star and energy emitted by star. If 2 stars have same size, distance and emitting same amount of energy, then their brightness or apparent magnitude will be same. If 2 stars have different brightnesses and their size and distance are equal, then they will be emitting different amount of energy. If we know star's apparent magnitude and two out of three qualities(size, distance and amount of energy emitted), we can get idea about the remaining third quality.\n\nAbsolute magnitude:\n\nUnlike apparent magnitude, absolute magnitude does not depend on star's size or distance. Absolute magnitude is the measure of how bright a star actually is, or how much energy a star is emitting. Absolute magnitude does not provide any idea about star's radius or its distance. Absolute magnitude is also called luminosity.\n\nModern magnitude scale starts with the brightest object and goes to the faintest object. Apparent and absolute magnitudes of sun are -26.8 and 4.8 respectively.\n\nLuminosity is related to absolute magnitude in a simple way. A difference of 5 on the absolute magnitude scale corresponds to a factor of 100 on the luminosity scale. Thus, a star with an absolute magnitude of 2 is 100 times as luminous as a star with an absolute magnitude of 7. A star with an absolute magnitude of -3 is 100 times as luminous as a star whose absolute magnitude is 2 and 10,000 times as luminous as a star that has an absolute magnitude of 7.\n\nMagnitude is based on a numbering system invented by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus in about 125 B.C. Hipparchus numbered groups of stars according to their brightness as viewed from Earth. He called the brightest stars first magnitude stars, the next brightest second magnitude stars, and so on to sixth magnitude stars, the faintest visible stars.\n\nModern astronomers refer to a star's brightness as viewed from Earth as its apparent magnitude. But they have extended Hipparchus's system to describe the actual brightness of stars, for which they use the term absolute magnitude. For technical reasons, they define a star's absolute magnitude as what its apparent magnitude would be if it were 32.6 light-years from Earth.\n\nAstronomers have also extended the system of magnitude numbers to include stars brighter than first magnitude and dimmer than sixth magnitude. A star that is brighter than first magnitude has a magnitude less than 1. For example, the apparent magnitude of Rigel is 0.12. Extremely bright stars have magnitudes less than zero -- that is, their designations are negative numbers. The brightest star in the night sky is Sirius, with an apparent magnitude of -1.46. Rigel has an absolute magnitude of -8.1. According to astronomers' present understanding of stars, no star can have an absolute magnitude much brighter than -8. At the other end of the scale, the dimmest stars detected with telescopes have apparent magnitudes up to 28. In theory, no star could have an absolute magnitude much fainter than 16.\n\nSize\n\nAstronomers measure the size of stars in terms of the sun's radius. Alpha Centauri A, with a radius of 1.05 solar radii (the plural of radius), is almost exactly the same size as the sun. Rigel is much larger at 78 solar radii, and Antares has a huge size of 776 solar radii.\n\nA star's size and surface temperature determine its luminosity. Suppose two stars had the same temperature, but the first star had twice the radius of the second star. In this case, the first star would be four times as bright as the second star. Scientists say that luminosity is proportional to radius squared -- that is, multiplied by itself. Imagine that you wanted to compare the luminosities of two stars that had the same temperature but different radii. First, you would divide the radius of the larger star by the radius of the smaller star. Then, you would square your answer.\n\nNow, suppose two stars had the same radius but the first star's surface temperature -- measured in kelvins -- was twice that of the second star. In this example, the luminosity of the first star would be 16 times that of the second star. Luminosity is proportional to temperature to the fourth power. Imagine that you wanted to compare the luminosities of stars that had the same radius but different temperatures. First, you would divide the temperature of the warmer star by the temperature of the cooler star. Next, you would square the result. Then, you would square your answer again.\n\nMass\n\nMass of a star is measured in terms of the solar mass, which is the mass of the sun, which is 1.98 * 1030 kilograms. For example, we can say that mass of Alpha Centauri A is 1.08 solar masses, and mass of Rigel is 3.50 solar masses.\n\nStars that have similar masses can be different in size i.e; they can have different densities. Density is the amount of mass per unit of volume. For instance, the average density of the sun is 1,400 kilograms per cubic meter. Sirius B has almost exactly the same mass as the sun, but it is 90,000 times denser than sun. As a result, its radius is only about 1\/50 of a solar radius."}

{"text":"Hubble spots distant galaxies near edge of universe's cosmic dawn\n\nThe Hubble Ultra Deep Field 2012 campaign reveals seven previously unseen galaxies, observed as they appeared in a period 350 million to 600 million years after the big bang.\n(NASA, ESA, R. Ellis (Caltech), and the UDF 2012 Team \/ December 12, 2012)\n\nSquinting deep into the universe, the Hubble Space Telescope has picked out what may be the most distant galaxy yet found, observed as it looked about 380 million years after the big bang. This potential record-breaker is one of seven newly discovered galaxies formed more than 13 billion years ago, near the cosmic dawn, the era when the first big galaxies formed.\n\n\"These galaxies are so young that they existed before many of the atoms in our bodies existed,\" said James Bullock, a UC Irvine physics and astronomy professor who was not involved in the study.\n\nThe work, accepted for publication by the Astrophysical Journal Letters, helps researchers learn about the building blocks that helped form the universe we know today, said Harvard astronomy professor AviLoeb, who was not involved in the study.\n\nA team of scientists led by Caltech astrophysicist Richard Ellis used NASA's famous orbiting telescope to look deep into a slice of sky known as the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. They hoped to pick up signs of distant galaxies as close to the edge of the universe as Hubble could see, because as scientists look deeper into space, they're also looking farther back in time.\n\nThey do so by measuring what's known as redshift of the light they see coming from a galaxy. As the universe rapidly expands and the galaxies speed up, light from those galaxies stretches out into longer, and redder, wavelengths. Astronomers can measure this redshift to determine how fast an object is moving away, and thus how far away it must be. The more extreme the redshift, the farther it must have traveled, and the older Hubble's snapshot of it is.\n\nAstronomers have a good grasp of how the universe began \u2013 in a big bang, roughly 13.7 billion years ago \u2013 because they see evidence from the cosmic background radiation that permeates the universe. They have a good sense of its adolescence and adulthood, because telescopes can look far enough into space to capture snapshots of what it looked like millions and billions of years into the past. But this period lasting a few hundred million years after the big bang remains something of a mystery, Ellis said \u2013 and this study helps to start filling in the gaps.\n\nOne question that theoretical astronomers have toyed with is whether the once-dark universe began to light up all at once, as ultraviolet light from the growing number of stars and coalescing galaxies ionized surrounding gas, rendering the universe transparent and allowing us to see into the distant past. The sloping decline of the number of galaxies as the astronomers looked farther back in time suggest that this was a gradual process, not a sudden one, Ellis said.\n\nThe galaxies the team found were formed about 350 million to 600 million years after the big bang, when the universe was less than 4% of its present age \u2013 practically a toddler. But this is about as far back as astronomers can look for now, Ellis said; Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, will look even deeper into the infrared wavelengths of light and should pick up more galaxies hovering even closer to the universe's birth.\n\nComments (4)\n\nFolks there was no big bang, it was a big rip, that is still ripping, the primordial atom was sucked out of the quantum fluctuating medium and immediately ripped asunder by the near infinite vacuum of the void, creating instantaneously all the forces and particles in the universe, there is no dark matter acting on space time, just space-time attempting to fill up the limitless void because of the residual vacuum still acting on it and stretching it out in all directions, and yes if you could get a vacuum powerful enough to the point where there is nothing in it not one single atom, a perfect vacuum you too may create a universe, good luck keeping it contained though !!! come to think of it, perhaps that is how this one came to be, some idiot created an infinite vacuum and it blew up in his face!! Definitely Dont try this at home, you might just succeed!!!\n\nReid Barnes at 12:34 PM December 13, 2012\n\nIn this article: \"Astronomers have a good grasp of how the universe began \u2013 in a big bang, roughly 13.7 billion years ago \u2013 because they see evidence from the cosmic background radiation that permeates the universe.\" Really?

{"text":"Oct 15, 2012\n\nCredit: Thinkstock\n\nEuropean research is identifying and quantifying properties of massive stars in our galaxy and nearby. This research should provide important insight into the formation of galaxies and stellar evolution.\n\nUntil recently, experimental evidence suggested that the upper mass limit on stars was about 150 times that of our Sun. While it may actually be nearly two times that according to new evidence, much is left to be learned about massive star formation, stellar evolution and the elusive stellar mass limit.\n\nWith EU funding of 'The most massive stars in the local universe' (Mostmassivestars) project, scientists are discovering massive stars in eclipsing binaries and measuring parameters to provide important constraints on their formation and evolution.\n\nBinary stars are two-star systems in which the brightest (primary) star and its companion (secondary) orbit around their centre of mass. Just as with our planets, orbit of the stars is governed by the gravitational pull each exerts on the other that is in turn related to mass. Thus, binary star systems provide a window into masses of the component stars, enabling indirect calculation of radius and density.\n\nEclipsing binaries are systems in which the orbit plane is along the line of sight of an observer such that the one eclipses the other, thus periodically providing additional information offered by changes in observed intensity. Measurements of periodic changes in brightness allow calculation of elemental compositions (e.g. metallicities or portion of stars not made of hydrogen and helium).\n\nMetallicity may provide information on the age of a star given that, according to the Big Bang theory, when the Universe was formed it consisted almost entirely of hydrogen that then created significant helium. Older stars thus tend to have lower metallicities than younger ones.\n\nThe Mostmassivestars team measured fundamental parameters of massive eclipsing binaries with high accuracy. The data will enable testing of stellar atmosphere models, wind models and stellar evolution models as a function of metallicity and predictions of upper mass limits of stars.\n\nRelated Stories ...\n\nA study using ESO's Very Large Telescope has shown that most very bright high-mass stars do not live alone.

{"text":"In a new study, astronomers studied the source of the high-energy emissions using three separate X-ray space telescopes: NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Japanese Suzaku satellite, and the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton.\n\nThe researchers began studying V1647 Orionis shortly after it erupted in 2004, and monitored it through 2010, capturing data from both outbursts.\n\n\"The observations give us a look inside the cradle at a very young star,\" study co-author Joel Kastner, a professor at Rochester Institute of Technology in Henrietta, N.Y., said in a statement. \"It's as though we're able to see its beating heart. We're actually able to watch it rotate. We caught the star at a point where it is rotating so fast as it gains material that it's barely able to hold itself together. It's rotating at near break-up speed.\"\n\nThe researchers used the star's X-ray light curves to determine its spin, which makes V1647 one of the youngest stars whose spin has been determined using an X-ray based technique, they said. The scientists were also able to identify the object as a protostar that is still in the process of forming.\n\n\"Based on infrared studies, we suspect that this protostar is no more than a million years old, and probably much younger,\" study lead author Kenji Hamaguchi, an astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., said in a statement.\n\nV1647 is being fueled by gas from a surrounding disk, and could continue to grow this way for millions of years, before it is able to generate its own energy by fusing hydrogen into helium in its core, the way the sun and other mature stars do, the researchers explained. [Top 10 Star Mysteries]\n\nHamaguchi and his colleagues also studied two regions of V1647 that are emitting X-rays and are thousands of times hotter than the rest of the star. The two dynamic spots are located on opposite sides of the star, with the southerly one five times brighter than the other, the researchers said.\n\nThe newborn star's low density puffs it up to almost five times the size of the sun, making each of these hotspots sprawling birthmarks, measuring roughly the width of the sun.\n\nDuring the star's extended eruptions, the researchers noted that V1647 gathers mass, spews plasma and X-rays, and exhibits a staggering increase in temperature.\n\n\"We think that magnetic activity on or around the stellar surface creates the super-hot plasma,\" Hamaguchi said. \"This behavior could be sustained by the continual twisting, breaking, and reconnection of magnetic fields, which connect the star and the disk, but which rotate at different speeds. Magnetic activity on the stellar surface could also be caused by accretion of material onto it.\"\n\nThe X-ray emissions observed as the star rotates indicate that for its size, V1647 is spinning as fast as it can without shredding itself to pieces, the scientists said.\n\nBut despite the violent behavior witnessed from V1647 and the surrounding disk, the star appears to have been relatively stable since the researchers began studying it in 2004. The research combining observations from multiple X-ray satellites is expected to give astronomers better insight into what may be happening inside the dust-cloaked disks of young stars.\n\nThe detailed results of the study are published in the July 20 edition of the Astrophysical Journal.\n\nCopyright 2012 SPACE.com, a TechMediaNetwork company.

{"text":"August 10, 2012\n\nThe galaxy NGC 1068 is shown above with an active supermassive black hole at its nucleus. Astronomers studying similar extreme galaxies in the infrared have found that in many cases material obscuring the nucleus may be located over an extended region, and not confined in a small torus.\n\nAt the core of most galaxies including our own Milky Way is a massive black hole. Material falling into the environment of the black hole heats up, and can radiate dramatically, sometimes also powering the ejection of bipolar jets of rapidly moving charged particles. These so-called active galactic nuclei (AGN) are observed to have roughly two types of characteristics: bright, rapidly moving hot gas with dust emission features, or dust absorption with modest (or no) fast gas.\n\nAccording to the \"unified\" model of AGN, these and most other variations in appearance are primarily due to the angle at which a galaxy and its central engine are seen. In the first case the galaxy is seen face-on, and fast-moving gas close to the black hole is clearly visible. In the latter, the whole galaxy as well as a torus of obscuring dust around the black hole are seen edge-on; the torus blocks our view of the fast-moving gas and absorbs infrared in characteristic dust features.\n\nBut is this simple model correct in all cases? CfA astronomers Andy Goulding, Bill Forman, Christine Jones, and Markos Trichas have undertaken a study of the origin of this infrared dust absorption feature. They specifically study the nature of the presumed torus: is it a small, uniform ring of dense material, a large extended structure of more diffuse material, or is it perhaps composed of many small dense clumps?\n\nThe observed strength the infrared dust absorption is key to sorting out these differences. The astronomers used the infrared spectrometer on the Spitzer Space Telescope to examine the dust feature in all twenty nearby AGN having extremely large columns of neutral gas (Compton-thick AGN).\n\nThe spectra provide quantitative measures of star formation as well as dust absorption. Writing in the Astrophysical Journal, the scientists reach several important conclusions. They find that in a significant minority of cases the absorbing dust is spread over a region larger than a torus, in support of one variant of the unified model.\n\nThey also caution that these kinds of AGN have unusually high levels of star-formation; searches for other extreme AGN that neglect star-formation signatures are likely to miss a significant population of the most heavily obscured AGN.\n\nComments\n\nNever has a phony black hole ever been seen, because gravity theory is a human invention and description of electromagnetic forces in plasmas that behave like superliquids that stick together and superconduct electricity.

The\nstudy will appear in the June issue of Astronomy and Astrophysics and\nis available online.\nMueller and her team targeted Centaurus A (Cen A), a nearby galaxy\nwith a supermassive black hole weighing 55 million times the sun's\nmass. Also known as NGC 5128, Cen A is located about 12 million\nlight-years away in the constellation Centaurus and is one of the\nfirst celestial radio sources identified with a galaxy.\nSeen in radio waves, Cen A is one of the biggest and brightest objects\nin the sky, nearly 20 times the apparent size of a full moon. This is\nbecause the visible galaxy lies nestled between a pair of giant\nradio-emitting lobes, each nearly a million light-years long.\nThese lobes are filled with matter streaming from particle jets near\nthe galaxy's central black hole. Astronomers estimate that matter\nnear the base of these jets races outward at about one-third the\nspeed of light.\nUsing an intercontinental array of nine radio telescopes, researchers\nfor the TANAMI (Tracking Active Galactic Nuclei with Austral\nMilliarcsecond Interferometry) project were able to effectively zoom\ninto the galaxy's innermost realm.\n\"Advanced computer techniques allow us to combine data from the\nindividual telescopes to yield images with the sharpness of a single\ngiant telescope, one nearly as large as Earth itself,\" said Roopesh\nOjha at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.\nThe enormous energy output of galaxies like Cen A comes from gas\nfalling toward a black hole weighing millions of times the sun's\nmass. Through processes not fully understood, some of this infalling\nmatter is ejected in opposing jets at a substantial fraction of the\nspeed of light. Detailed views of the jet's structure will help\nastronomers determine how they form.\nThe jets strongly interact with surrounding gas, at times possibly\nchanging a galaxy's rate of star formation. Jets play an important\nbut poorly understood role in the formation and evolution of\ngalaxies. NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has detected much\nhigher-energy radiation from Cen A's central region.\n\"This radiation is billions of times more energetic than the radio\nwaves we detect, and exactly where it originates remains a mystery,\"\nsaid Matthias Kadler at the University of Wuerzburg in Germany and a\ncollaborator of Ojha. \"With TANAMI, we hope to probe the galaxy's\ninnermost depths to find out.\"\nOjha is funded through a Fermi investigation on multiwavelength\nstudies of Active Galactic Nuclei.\nThe astronomers credit continuing improvements in the Australian Long\nBaseline Array (LBA) with TANAMI's enormously increased image quality\nand resolution.

Those present in Uranus' atmosphere are considerably fainter and appear to last only for a few short minutes at a time.\n\nThese images represent the first observation of Uranus aurorae, with previous data collected directly during the Voyager 2 flyby in 1986.\n\nThese new observations should help to reveal more about Uranus' magnetic field, which we currently know little about.\n\nThe region is a nebula composed mainly of hydrogen and it is using this hydrogen to create new stars of all masses.\n\nNot long ago, (by astronomical terms of course!) the nebula would have been cold and dark as the newly forming stars had yet to break out of their gaseous progenitors. The most massive and thus hottest newborn stars have now blasted through the clouds of dust and gas that surrounded them, subjecting the surrounding nebula to a fierce stream of ultraviolet radiation that is eroding the larger structure and making it fluoresce in response. This fluorescence makes the nebula an emission nebula as it is emitting its own light rather than just reflecting that of the stars it contains.\n\nAnalysis of the data indicates that the majority of this radiation comes from one star. It is the bright star visible near the centre of the image.\n\nOnly the largest stars have currently emerged from their nurseries with many smaller, perhaps more sun like stars remain hidden within their denser pockets of the nebula.\n\nNGC 2467 is like many other star forming regions including the more famous Orion Nebula. NGC 2467 is located around 13,000 light years from Earth with the Orion Nebula around 10,000 light years away.\n\nThe Nebula is located in the constellation Puppis which is completely visible to residents of the southern hemisphere (those in the northern hemisphere can observe the northern section of the constellation however it sits close to the horizon)\n\nThe image is a combination of several taken with the HST's Wide Field Channel in several filters. The images where collected by the telescope all the way back in 2004"}
{"text":"NASA'S Spitzer Sees Crystal \"Rain\" In Outer Clouds Of Infant Star\n\nMay 26, 2011\nTrent J. Perrotto\nHeadquarters, Washington\n202-358-0321\ntrent.j.perrotto@xxxxxxxx\nWhitney Clavin\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n818-354-4673\nwhitney.clavin@xxxxxxxxxxxx\nRELEASE: 11-169\nNASA'S SPITZER SEES CRYSTAL \"RAIN\" IN OUTER CLOUDS OF INFANT STAR\nWASHINGTON -- Tiny crystals of a green mineral called olivine are\nfalling down like rain on a burgeoning star, according to\nobservations from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope.\nThis is the first time such crystals have been observed in the dusty\nclouds of gas that collapse around forming stars. Astronomers are\nstill debating how the crystals got there, but the most likely\nculprits are jets of gas blasting away from the embryonic star.\n\"You need temperatures as hot as lava to make these crystals,\" said\nTom Megeath of the University of Toledo in Ohio. He is the principal\ninvestigator of the research and the second author of a new study\nappearing in Astrophysical Journal Letters. \"We propose that the\ncrystals were cooked up near the surface of the forming star, then\ncarried up into the surrounding cloud where temperatures are much\ncolder, and ultimately fell down again like glitter.\"\nSpitzer's infrared detectors spotted the crystal rain around a\ndistant, sun-like embryonic star, or proto-star, referred to as\nHOPS-68, in the constellation Orion.\nThe crystals are in the form of forsterite. They belong to the olivine\nfamily of silicate minerals and can be found everywhere from a\nperiodot gemstone to the green sand beaches of Hawaii to remote\ngalaxies. NASA's Stardust and Deep Impact missions both detected the\ncrystals in their close-up studies of comets.\n\"If you could somehow transport yourself inside this proto-star's\ncollapsing gas cloud, it would be very dark,\" said Charles Poteet,\nlead author of the new study, also from the University of Toledo.\n\"But the tiny crystals might catch whatever light is present,\nresulting in a green sparkle against a black, dusty backdrop.\"\nForsterite crystals were spotted before in the swirling planet-forming\ndisks that surround young stars. The discovery of the crystals in the\nouter collapsing cloud of a proto-star is surprising because of the\ncloud's colder temperatures, about minus 280 degrees Fahrenheit\n(minus 170 degrees Celsius). This led the team of astronomers to\nspeculate the jets may in fact be transporting the cooked-up crystals\nto the chilly outer cloud.\nThe findings might also explain why comets, which form in the frigid\noutskirts of our solar system, contain the same type of crystals.\nComets are born in regions where water is frozen, much colder than\nthe searing temperatures needed to form the crystals, approximately\n1,300 degrees Fahrenheit (700 degrees Celsius). The leading theory on\nhow comets acquired the crystals is that materials in our young solar\nsystem mingled together in a planet-forming disk. In this scenario,\nmaterials that formed near the sun, such as the crystals, eventually\nmigrated out to the outer, cooler regions of the solar system.\nPoteet and his colleagues say this scenario could still be true but\nspeculate that jets might have lifted crystals into the collapsing\ncloud of gas surrounding our early sun before raining onto the outer\nregions of our forming solar system. Eventually, the crystals would\nhave been frozen into comets.\nThe Herschel Space Observatory, a European Space Agency-led mission\nwith important NASA contributions, also participated in the study by\ncharacterizing the forming star.\n\"Infrared telescopes such as Spitzer and now Herschel are providing an\nexciting picture of how all the ingredients of the cosmic stew that\nmakes planetary systems are blended together,\" said Bill Danchi,\nsenior astrophysicist and program scientist at NASA Headquarters in\nWashington.\nThe Spitzer observations were made before it used up its liquid\ncoolant in May 2009 and began its warm mission.\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., manages the\nSpitzer Space Telescope mission for the agency's Science Mission\nDirectorate in Washington.

{"text":"Galaxy Evolution\n\nby Fraser Cain on May 11, 2009\n\nWant to stay on top of all the space news? Follow @universetoday on Twitter\n\nAs astronomers look out into the Universe, they're also looking back in time. By seeing an object 1 billion light-years away, astronomers are seeing how the object looked 1 billion years ago, since the light took a billion years to reach us. This \"time machine\" effect allows astronomers to study galaxy evolution; how small galaxies built up over time to become the structures we see in the Universe today.\n\nAfter the Big Bang, the Universe was the same everywhere. But tiny fluctuations in density made some regions attact others with more gravity, and over time, regions began to clump together into larger and larger structure. These clumps became primordial galaxies, and clumps of hydrogen gas within the proto-galaxies became the first stars.\n\nSome of these early objects were small, and became tiny dwarf galaxies, while others were much larger and became the familiar spiral shapes, like our own Milky Way.\n\nOnce formed, these galaxies evolved together in larger galactic structures called groups, clusters and superclusters. Galaxies were attracted to one another by gravity, and collided together in a series of mergers. The outcome of these mergers depends on the mass of the galaxies in the collision.\n\nSmall galaxies are torn apart by larger galaxies and added to the mass of larger galaxies. Our own Milky Way recently devoured a few dwarf galaxies, turning them into streams of stars that orbit the galactic core. But when large galaxies of similar size come together, they become giant elliptical galaxies. The delicate spiral structure is lost, and the merged galaxies become large and egg-shaped. This will be the outcome for our own Milky Way galaxy when it merges with Andromeda in a few billion years.\n\nAnd so, galaxy evolution has been occurring over billions of years, and it will continue to happen for the foreseeable future. Galaxies will continue to evolve and change as they interact with other galaxies."}
{"text":"Violent Merger\n\nFor the most part, the galaxy known as M85 is pretty ordinary. It's about the same size as our own galaxy, the Milky Way, but it consists mostly of old, small stars.\n\nA couple of years ago, though, M85 put on a bit of a show. Astronomers detected an explosion inside the galaxy -- perhaps the result of a merger between two of its stars.\n\nAt its brightest, the explosion produced several million times more energy than the Sun does. It slowly faded away, but it retained an \"afterglow\" in the infrared -- a form of energy that's produced by relatively cool objects.\n\nThe astronomers who discovered the star classified it as a Luminous Red Nova. They suggested that it formed when two fairly old, fairly small stars merged to form a single star. The merger triggered the explosion, blasting a cloud of debris into space. Over time, the expanding cloud of debris cooled and its atoms joined together to form tiny grains of dust. These grains produced the infrared afterglow.\n\nThe star seems to resemble several other explosions detected in recent years, so Luminous Red Novae could form a separate class of exploding stars. But many astronomers want to wait and see a few more of them before they open up a new category.\n\nM85 is a member of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies. The cluster is low in the east on March evenings, above and to the left of the bright star Spica, and climbs high across the sky later on. A small telescope reveals many of its galaxies"}

{"text":"Galaxy's 'Superbubble' Spawns Star-Forming Frenzy\n\nby SPACE.com Staff\n\nDate: 25 May 2010 Time: 01:25 PM ET\n\nThe starburst galaxy NGC 1313, as imaged by the Gemini South 8-meter telescope in Chile using narrow-band filters in the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph. NGC 1313 has a well-defined bar with twisted, asymmetric spiral arms. While pronounced star formation appears along the outer reaches of both arms, it's much stronger to the northeast (left on the new Gemini image). Other regions of star formation are nearby, especially to the southwest (right). Full Story. CREDIT: Gemini Observatory\n\nA new photo of a distant galaxy has revealed a frenzy of star\nformation driven by what scientists are calling a cosmic\n\"superbubble.\"\n\nThe new image shows the starburst galaxy NGC 1313, which has\nbeen experience active star formation that astronomers have been at a loss to\nexplain. Radio telescope observations suggest that the edge of an expanding\n\"superbubble\" is causing gas to pile up and spur the formation of\nstars.\n\n\"What triggered the superbubble is still a mystery. It\nwould have required about a thousand supernovae to go off in the space of just\na few million years, or else something punched its way through the disk and set\nit off like ripples in a pond,\" said Stuart Ryder, Australian Gemini\nScientist at the Anglo-Australian Observatory, who has studied this galaxy\nextensively.\n\nThe unprecedented detail and clarity of the new image ?\ntaken with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph on the Gemini South telescope ?\nreveals myriad bubbles, shock fronts, star clusters, and sites where massive\nstars are being born.\n\nMultitudes of colorful glowing gas clouds can be seen in the\nnew galaxy view. It was taken using the Gemini South telescope in Chile. [More\ngalaxy photos.]\n\nNGC 1313, a barred spiral galaxy about 15 million\nlight-years away, is a particularly prolific star maker for its size and its relative\nremoteness from other galaxies.\n\nThe galaxy itself extends across about 50,000 light-years\n(about half the extent of the Milky Way) and is located in the direction of the\nfar southern constellation Reticulum. One light-year is the distance that light\ncan travel in one year ? about 6 trillion miles (10 trillion km).Generally, starburst\ngalaxies show some signs of interaction with another galaxy, and a close\ngalactic encounter is usually responsible for sparking increased levels of\nstar-birth activity. However, NGC 1313 is a neighborless \"drifter,\"\nfar away from any other packs of galaxies.\n\nThe cause of its deformed shape and high rate of star\nformation is not obvious. Astronomers speculate that nearby gas clouds may be\nfalling into (or orbiting) the galaxy and this could be prompting localized\nstarbursts."}
{"text":"10. The Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope\n\nLaunched in 2008, the Fermi Space Telescope carries a battery of instruments to observe the universe at gamma-ray wavelengths. Fermi specializes in catching enigmatic gamma-ray bursts. In the process, astronomers can get a glimpse into the mystery of black holes, and cosmologists look for insight into the birth and evolution of the universe. In 2010, NASA announced that Fermi had detected twin gamma-ray lobes being emitted from the core of our own Milky Way galaxy.\n\n9. The Chandra X-ray Observatory\n\nOne of four \"Great Observatories\" launched by NASA, Chandra probes the universe at X-ray wavelengths that are otherwise absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. The most striking feature about Chandra, launched in 1999, is its observation power; according to NASA, it is roughly 1 billion times more powerful than the first X-ray telescope. This power enables Chandra to in essence \"see\" the very core of our galaxy through intervening lanes of dust. This has revealed several stars whipping around a massive black hole known as Sagittarius A* (pronounced Sagittarius A-Star).\n\n8. NuSTAR\n\nLaunched in 2012, NuSTAR is an orbiting X-ray telescope that provides a wonderful example of high return at low cost. Already, NuSTAR (or the Nuclear SpecTroscopic ARray) has returned stunning images of supernova remnants and galactic mass black holes. NuSTAR operates at higher X-ray energies than the aforementioned Chandra X-ray telescope.\n\n7. XMM-Newton\n\nLaunched by the European Space Agency in 1999 to honor Sir Isaac Newton, this X-ray observatory has been in service for 13 years and counting. XMM-Newton has measured the spin rate of a massive black hole in the galaxy NGC 1365. XMM-Newton has also discovered distant galaxy clusters as well as fast X-ray flares emitted as a blue giant absorbed a neutron star in 2011.\n\n6. The Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission\n\nSwift is designed to catch gamma-ray bursts in action. Swift actually utilizes detectors in the optical, ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma-ray bands of the spectrum to characterize the sources of these transient outbursts. In 2008, Swift witnessed the outburst of supernova SN 2008D, 88 million light years distant in the galaxy NGC 2770 in the constellation of the Lynx. More recently, Swift and Fermi caught sight of a record-setting gamma-ray burst now designated GRB 130427, which occurred on April 27, 2013. Long-period bursts such as GRB 130427, which Swift monitored for several hours, are thought to be the result of a massive core collapse supernova. Short-period bursts are thought to be the result of neutron star and black hole mergers.\n\n5. The Compton Gamma-ray Observatory\n\nDeployed by the Space Shuttle Atlantis in 1991, this observatory is named after Nobel Prize winner Arthur Holly Compton. The Compton gamma-ray telescope is another of the four space telescopes in NASA's Great Observatories series that also included Chandra, Hubble and the Spitzer Space Telescope. Compton surveyed galaxy clusters, located possible clouds of \"anti-matter,\" discovered soft \"gamma-ray repeaters,\" and even imaged Earth's Moon at gamma-ray wavelengths. Sadly, Compton suffered from three gyroscope failures by 1999 and was brought down via a commanded de-orbit over the South Pacific in June 2000.\n\n4. Planck Mission\n\nLaunched in 2009 by the European Space Agency, Planck is designed to survey the entire sky in microwave and infrared frequencies. Planck sits at the L2 Lagrange point beyond Earth's Moon where it can stay super-cooled for observations. Earlier in 2013, the Planck team made an announcement that refined measurements of the cosmic microwave background and tweaked constants used to measure the age of the universe. Thanks to Planck, we now know that the universe is a little older than previously believed at 13.82 billion years old and that the amount of dark energy is a bit less than predicted at 68.3% of the total mass\/energy budget of the universe.\n\n3. Kepler Mission\n\nSent into space on a brilliant night launch in March 2009, the Kepler space telescope hunts for transiting extra-solar planets. It accomplishes this by staring at a patch of sky along the plane of our galaxy in the direction of the constellations Lyra, Hercules and Cygnus. Kepler looks for telltale dips in the brightness of stars as a planet passes in front of its host star. The current catalog of exoplanets sits at 885 and counting, and Kepler has identified an additional 2,740 candidates for pending inclusion.\n\n2. Spitzer Space Telescope\n\nInfrared astronomy offers us a key window on the universe. It's also impossible to do beneath the blanketing atmosphere of the Earth. Launched in 2003, Spitzer has given us an unparalleled view of the infrared cosmos. Spitzer has directly imaged exoplanets, analyzed interstellar dust and nebulae, and surveyed the sky in infrared. Spitzer exhausted its initial onboard supply of helium coolant on May 15, 2009 but continues to operate many of its instruments in what NASA terms the Spitzer Warm Mission.\n\n1. Solar & Heliospheric Observatory\n\nAn international venture between NASA and the European Space Agency, SOHO has been in operation for over 17 years and has been a bonanza for solar physics. SOHO has now followed our home star though more than one complete 11-year solar cycle, characterizing solar activity at multiple wavelengths. SOHO was on hand to witness several energetic flares, including the Halloween solar storms of 2003. Though not part of its primary mission, SOHO has also discovered over 2,400 sungrazing comets and counting. Many of these haven been found via the Internet, as dedicated amateur observers scour images taken by SOHO's wide-field cameras for sun-diving comets5. 3D Printing Has Been Around Much Longer Than You Think\n\nAlthough most people have never seen a 3D printer in action, you may already own products created by the process. 3D printing has been around in industrial applications since the late 1970s. A 3D printer uses an additive process whereby successive layers of material are built up to form an object. The printer, which operates similar to ink-jet technology, uses a three-dimensional, computer-aided design (CAD) model or similar software to form its creation. Of course, the raw material is still required, and at this stage only relatively simple objects or tools can be created. Materials vary from laminates to plastic polymers, though research has been conducted with more exotic materials. The future will bring more incredible advances \u2014 imagine a large, industrial 3D printer with cement-filled injectors that could create a customized building, one layered block at a time. 3D printing may even release us from our current \"mass market culture,\" as everything is custom-created for its intended application.\n\n4. The Possibilities For 3D Printing Are Seemingly Limitless\n\n3D printing offers great potential for the manufacturing industry beyond what has already been done. The process also holds great promise for use in remote locations such as Antarctica or where troops are deployed. The International Space Station is receiving its first delivery of a 3D printer in 2014. Imagine a future colony on the Moon or Mars created by an array of 3D printers, using the soil and materials on hand to create a form of cement. Some biotechnology firms are studying more exotic uses, such as the 3D printing of new human organs by building up layers of cells in a sugar matrix. Other companies are already creating customized skin prosthetics and skin and bone grafts. It likely won't be long before 3D-printed human implants such as pins and ball sockets are the norm. CandyFab, a variant of 3D printing, uses granulated sugar as a medium, and it's not a stretch to imagine that 3D printing of foodstuffs may make its way into kitchens everywhere. Ironically, confectionaries and pet food may be ideally suited for this. Will we all soon be eating food-dyed, 3D-printed versions of Soylent Green?\n\n3. 3D Printers Pose Potential Risks\n\nWhat the Internet has done for convenience, 3D printers may make doubly so. And just as you can find instructions on the Internet detailing how to make bombs or weapons, you may soon be able to make a weapon with a 3D printer as well. U.S. government officials expressed alarm in May 2013 when a group announced plans to release specs on how to make a plastic handgun using a 3D printer. Apparently, you only have to add a nail for a firing pin (the only non-printable part). Imagine a future where convicted felons can print guns in the privacy of their own home, bypassing all laws and safety checks. If 3D printing becomes pervasive, it may also fill our homes and landfills with yet more plastic trash we don't truly need. Then there's the issue of counterfeiting and copyright: how will companies maintain control of their intellectual property? Laws typically struggle to keep pace with new technologies, whether it is the Internet, mobile phones or the latest tech set to hit the market this year, Google Glass. 3D printing will pose its own issues as well.\n\n2. Many Services Offer 3D Printing For Hobbyists and Other Uses\n\nWant a customized action figure \u2026 of yourself? Several companies already provide such a service online, and you may soon be able to print one yourself at home. It remains to be seen if 3D printers will go the way of the 8-track tape, or be the greatest thing to happen to printing since Guttenberg. But as is often the case, tinkerers and hobbyists will be the early adopters leading the way. An analogy can be drawn from the evolution of the flatbed scanner. In the 1980s, magazines like Popular Mechanics offered do-it-yourself instructions to build a primitive, rotating-cylinder image-scanning device. A much more advanced flatbed version emerged on the market for less than $100 about a decade later. Replicating Rapid Prototypers such as the RepRap open-source project are already the rage among DIY hobbyists, much the way kit computers were in the early 1970s.\n\n1. 3D Printers Are Relatively Expensive Now, But That Will Quickly Change\n\nIn May 2013, the office supply chain Staples became the first retailer to offer 3D printers. Expect to see the price trajectory fall as it did for CD\/DVD players, VCRs and PCs as they became more prevalent. Early 3D printers cost around $20,000. Staples Cube 3D printer retails for $1,299 (cartridges are $50 each). However, the RepRap open-source project offers 3D kit machines in the $600 range. Of course, it's yet to be seen if people will find a need for a 3D printer in their home or office. Remember, many people scoffed at the idea of a home computer in the 1960s \u2026 who would want a gigantic, vacuum-tubed, punch-card machine in their living room? It's possible 3D printers will remain in the realm of industrial and specialized applications, but perhaps a cottage industry of local 3D printing businesses will emerge. Or, just maybe, we'll see the next big technological revolution, as 3D printers become a permanent household fixture and change our lives in ways we cannot even imagine10. Mini-Satellites Provide Cost-Effective Space Research\n\nIn 2012, the Japanese space agency JAXA added a new trick to the ISS repertoire: a CubeSat launcher. CubeSats, tiny satellites weighing less than 3 pounds, have been around for 10 years and offer scientists a cost-effective way to launch payloads for space research. Now, that cost has dropped even further thanks to the ability of the ISS to launch the CubeSats on their way. Of course, current CubeSats must be first delivered to the ISS via unmanned Progress supply craft, but with the arrival of a 3D printer aboard the ISS in 2014, perhaps future CubeSats could be fabricated onsite.\n\n9. Researchers Seek More Effective Cancer Treatments\n\nMany experiments on the ISS could provide great advances in medicine. One such experiment performed in 2002 studied the delivery of anti-cancer drugs using microcapsules. By perfecting the production and delivery technique in the microgravity of the ISS, researchers found clues on how to replicate the process here on Earth. The capsules, akin to liquid-filled micro-balloons about the size of blood cells, are designed to deliver anti-cancer treatments to targeted areas; use of the capsules could greatly reduce the negative side effects associated with traditional intravenous chemotherapy. The researchers have filed for several patents resulting from their ISS research, and the capsules have been tested on Earth in laboratory settings.\n\n8. Research Studies Deadly Bacteria in Search For Vaccines\n\nResearchers have discovered that nasty bacteria such as MRSA and Salmonella are much more virulent in microgravity. Because of this, research on Salmonella conducted aboard the ISS may one day yield a vaccine against this pathogen, which is one of the leading causes of infant mortality in the world. These studies were first carried out in a limited fashion aboard space shuttle missions and have been conducted full scale aboard the ISS. Research on virulence has also encompassed the antibiotic-resistant MRSA, a scourge of many hospitals.\n\n7. Amateurs Score Breakthrough in Signaling the ISS\n\n\n\nThis experiment may not have the greatest scientific value, but it's an interesting story, certainly to those in the amateur astronomy community. In 2012, the Austin Astronomy Society and the San Antonio Astronomy Association coordinated a successful effort to signal the ISS from the ground. The groups used a pair of high-powered searchlights and a 1-watt blue laser, both of which were visible to astronauts aboard the ISS. Who knows? Perhaps in an emergency situation, this mode of signaling would be effective.\n\n6. Atomic Clock Could Provide Insights into Theory of Relativity\n\nThis project seeks to measure and study the effects of relativity. The ACES will carry two high-performance atomic clocks to be mounted on the exterior Columbus module of the ISS in 2014. These clocks will be compared to stationary ones on Earth for ultra-precise measurements of time dilation via relativistic effects.\n\n5. Work on Protein Crystallization May Provide Cure for Several Diseases\n\nCrystalline structures can be grown on a larger scale in microgravity, allowing researchers to study them in greater detail. Research conducted into protein crystal growth on the ISS will help in the design of new drugs to combat cancer, muscular dystrophy and more. There are around 100,000 different proteins that are responsible for human life, but scientists do not fully understand the structures of many proteins simply because they cannot obtain large and organized crystal growths for study here on Earth.\n\n4. Scientists Take Closer Look at Neutron Stars\n\nThe Neutron-star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) is one of two interesting astrophysics payloads that will be deployed on the ISS in 2017. NICER is an array of 56 X-ray telescopes that will work to study the interiors of neutron stars. SEXTANT (Station Explorer for X-ray Timing and Navigation Technology), will work in concert with this project to study the feasibility for using pulsars for deep-space navigation.\n\nProbably one of the greatest long-term contributions that the ISS will have on modern science is the data being collected on the effects of living and working in space. If we want to travel out into the solar system, we need to know how the human body will react to long-term weightlessness. We will also need to know the psychological effects long-duration missions will have on the crew, as well as ways to combat bone and muscle loss. Radiation exposure by ISS crewmembers is also being monitored. In 2015, Russian cosmonauts will start a series of long-duration missions aboard the ISS.\n\n2. High-Resolution Camera Provides Information on Natural Disasters\n\nThe ISERV, a remote-control camera that arrived at the ISS in 2012, has an incredibly unwieldy name (International Space Station SERVIR Environmental Research and Visualization System) but a relatively simple task. Think of it as a \"disaster cam,\" a high-resolution camera that can observe disaster-stricken areas so relief organizations can direct aid to those regions. A joint project between USAID and NASA, ISERV takes advantage of the globe-spanning, high-inclination orbit of the ISS and can swing into action providing images on successive passes. And if the ISERV instrument looks familiar, that's because it employs a Celestron amateur telescope with a commercial DLSR camera mounted to it.\n\n1. Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer Takes Aim at Dark Matter, Energy\n\nFerried to the ISS on one of the last shuttle flights, this detector may help solve the puzzles of dark matter and dark energy in the universe. The first Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-01) flew on Space Shuttle Discovery in 1998. The second one, AMS-02, is now installed on the exterior of the ISS. AMS-02 employs a series of powerful magnets to study incoming cosmic ray interactions to test theories of the nature of dark matter and dark energy. These rays are absorbed by our atmosphere, which means that AMS-02 must be based in space. The huge power requirements of the project also make the ISS the ideal platform for the project. AMS-02 has already provided some tantalizing hints as to the nature of the cosmos, and may be one of the most lasting legacies of science aboard the International Space Station.\n\n]]>Science & TechnologyTue, 07 May 2013 01:45:39 +00005 Ways the Moon May Have Promoted Life on Earth\n\nIt's a cosmic shooting gallery out there, and the Earth suffered through long periods of asteroid bombardments early in its history. In fact, one theory known as panspermia suggests that organic molecules were seeded here by asteroids. Another theory contends that our oceans were formed by comet impacts. The Moon is tidally locked with Earth, meaning we see one hemisphere perpetually turned toward the Earth; the far side stayed hidden from view until the flyby of the Soviet space probe Luna 3 in 1959. Photos of the far side of the Moon suggest that it has taken a pounding from asteroids \u2014 many of which might have struck Earth and dramatically altered our existence. Although Jupiter does the brunt of asteroid and comet deflection for the inner solar system, our Moon plays a role as well. But as the Feb. 15, 2013 meteor event over Chelyabinsk, Russia, reminded us, a large one still occasionally gets through.\n\n4. The Moon's Formation May Have Sparked Key Geological Processes\n\nThe most popular theory for the origin of Earth's Moon is known as the Giant Impact Hypothesis. In this scenario, the Earth was \"whacked\" by a giant Mars-sized object dubbed Theia about 4.5 billion years ago. The ring of resulting debris accumulated into our Moon. Primary evidence for this comes from the fact that the mean density of the Moon is 60 percent that of the Earth. This matches up well with the density of our crust. The \"scooping out\" of Earth's crust may have freed up and kick-started plate tectonics, a key part of the carbon and rock cycle on our planet.\n\nThe formation of the Moon may have also created another essential lifesaving feature of our planet. Earth is the only rocky world in our solar system with an extensive magnetic field. This field is generated by the liquid outer core that acts as a magnetic dynamo. Even if you don't understand the science behind Earth's magnetic field, you can appreciate the fact that it protects us from much of the dangerous solar radiation and cosmic rays that bombard our planet. One 1988 study suggests that heat generated from the impact and the formation of the Moon is partially to thank for this fortuitous event, without which life as we know it would not exist.\n\n3. The Moon's Creation Seeded the Earth's Crust With Important Elements\n\nApollo astronauts brought back 842 pounds of lunar rocks, core samples, pebbles and other items from the Moon. Researchers sorting through that collection quickly made an interesting discovery: those lunar rocks showed a relative lack of chalcophile and siderophile elements, such as iron, copper, zinc, gold, and silver, which are common on Earth. It's hard to imagine an advanced civilization developing without these and other elements. Most of these elements should be locked up deep in the mantle of the Earth. The fact they're in relative abundance suggests that they were seeded by the body that impacted to form Earth's Moon.\n\n2. The Moon May Have Promoted Evolution\n\nThe chief action that most people relate to the Moon is that of ocean tides. The Moon is the dominant influence on the tides (second to the Sun) and causes intertidal regions prone to periodic flooding. Without this transitional area between ocean and land, some scientists believe sea life would have never ventured onto land in the first place. Many types of life, such as sea turtles, exploit the Moon as a sort of internal clock for mating and nesting activity. Comparing Earth to Venus, you see an Earth-sized planet that has no plate tectonics, no water, a weak magnetic field, a sizzling atmosphere \u2026 and no moon. One hypothesis suggests that the impact and formation of our Moon may have even stripped away our early toxic Venusian-like atmosphere, leaving conditions ripe for early life to arise.\n\n1. The Moon Helps Stabilize Earth's Axis\n\nOne of the most important and widely accepted roles that our Moon has is that its gravity promotes the long-term relative stability of our planet's rotational axis. The climate riddle is tied up in what are known as Milankovitch cycles. These changes are in turn driven primarily by oscillations in the eccentricity, obliquity and precession of our planet's axis and orbit. In the case of obliquity, or orbital tilt, our spin axis varies from 22.1 degrees to 24.5 degrees and back over the span of 41,000 years. This tilt causes the seasons, and is currently at a value of 23.44 degrees and decreasing.\n\nBut without the influence of our Moon, this variation would be much wider. In the case of the planet Mars, which has no large moon, its axis has varied from 13 degrees to 40 degrees over the last 10 million to 20 million years. Such a discrepancy would be catastrophic to Earth's climate over long spans of time.\n\nOne More: The Moon Played a Role in Development of Science\n\nPerhaps one of the biggest influences the Moon has had is its impact on science. Without the Moon, there would be no solar or lunar eclipses. The Moon also gave early scientists such as Isaac Newton insight into gravity. Without its simple example, we might not have figured out celestial mechanics. It also provided a place for our civilization to take its first baby steps in space travel, and the resulting \"Space Race\" helped drive technology forward in the 1960s and '70s. It's hard to tell with a statistical sample of one, but we may find that life only evolved in the universe where a similar set of circumstances allowed it. This is one of the cornerstones of the Rare Earth hypothesis, which suggests we're very likely the exception rather than the rule. Be sure to look up on the next moonlit night and thank the Moon that we're here5. High Monthly Bills Have Led Many to Say \"No\" to Pay TV\n\nEveryone seems to be seeking ways to save money these days, and as a result, many households are increasingly casting a critical eye at their monthly pay-TV bill. Consumer marketing firm NPD Group found that the average monthly pay-TV subscription reached $86 in 2011. The firm estimates the average monthly bill will climb to $123 by 2015 and $200 by 2020, as cable companies have to pay for rising programming rights fees. A solid Internet connection package can run less than $100 a month and many municipalities are installing networks with speeds in excess of 2 gigabytes per second. Cable companies have attempted to sweeten the deal with enhanced packages, but there's evidence that they're losing the younger, tech-savvy crowd. In 2012, the Research Group TDG reported that the number of pay-TV households declined for the first time from the previous year, from 100.9 million to 100.8. While a seemingly minor decrease, the group estimates that millions more will drop their cable subscriptions in the years to come, especially as more web-savvy 20-somethings move out into the professional world and start households of their own.\n\n4. You Can Customize Your Viewing Choices\n\nWith online viewing, you're not stuck with a cable \"package\" carrying hundreds of channels that you don't want. Likewise, you can hunt down those specialty channels (such as NASA TV) that you are interested in but that never seem to make it into your local cable provider's package. This is a common complaint leveled against the cable industry, which viewers cannot make a la carte selections of networks they want to watch. Many networks now offer their programming online within 24 hours of its release. PBS offers weekly programming not only on their own website player, but on UStream and YouTube as well. As a bonus, you can watch an entire season of your favorite show in a few sittings, without waiting week to week.\n\n3. A Monthly Broadband Package Provides Phone, Viewing Options\n\nIn a sign of the times, a 2010 article on Gizmodo.com discussed \"tech among the homeless\u2026\" Their one prized possession? An iPad. This serves as their phone and Internet connection to the world, whether at the local library or over coffee at McDonald's on a free WiFi connection. One monthly broadband bill can do double duty as phone via Vonage, Magic Jack or Skype as well as provide entertainment. A Prime Membership to Amazon often makes many gas-guzzling errands out for \"just one thing\" unnecessary. Plus, many employers and employees are finding that they're actually more productive at home without a long commute, and a high-speed Internet connection helps them to achieve this. Not surprisingly, companies that once relied solely on cable TV subscribers for their revenue are benefitting from selling more of these broadband connection packages.\n\n2. Netflix, YouTube and Hulu are Among the Many Viable Alternatives\n\nMany options such as Hulu, YouTube and network channel players offered on the Internet are free. Others, such as Netflix, have even begun offering their own original series. It may soon be the case that if you want to watch the latest new hip series, you'll have to do it on the Internet. YouTube is now offering full pay per view and free movies, and Amazon Prime members get a similar service. Netflix also began offering the Roku Internet-ready box in 2008 which streams service directly to your TV.\n\nMany Internet-only households have adopted the practice of BitTorrenting movies and TV. Also known as peer-to-peer file sharing, this practice relies on \"seeding\" packets of data over a worldwide-distributed network, and is thus hard for media lawyers to prosecute, as the data is \"everywhere and nowhere.\" We certainly don't endorse using this practice for illegal purposes, such as watching a pirated movie; but BitTorrenting has many legal uses as well as more and more people are discovering; a 2009 study suggested that as much as 70 percent of all Internet traffic in some regions could be attributed to BitTorrenting, through popular services such as Vuze. A word of warning here: it's caveat emptor when it comes to whatever computer virus nasties you may inadvertently download.\n\n1. You've Heard This Before, but it's True: the Internet is the Future of TV\n\nSo many households have abandoned pay-TV all together that those who track media consumer habits have taken notice. The new term applied to this group is \"TV Zero,\" a fast growing demographic that Nielsen began tracking in 2013. TV Zero households have jumped from 2 million in 2007 to around 5 million in Nielsen's 4th Quarter 2012 report. That's around 5 percent of U.S. households that \"do not fit the standard definition of a TV home\" but instead get their media fix via PCs, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Live sports are probably the last great bastion of cable TV in many households. But even this may change as ultra-fast, 1-gigabyte-per-second-plus networks such as Google Fiber become more commonplace. Google Fiber is already a reality in the Kansas City metro area and will soon be available in Austin, Texas, and Provo, Utah. It will be interesting to watch the cyber landscape evolve as faster Internet speeds become available. One new service dubbed Aereo aims to bring live broadcast TV to the Internet. Currently only available in New York City, Aereo won a key legal challenge from the broadcast networks in April 2013, and further legal action is expected. Whether Aereo ultimately prevails remains to be seen, but the battle between new and old media will continue to play out in the coming years.\n\nPerhaps a parallel can be drawn between the current \"Net TV\" controversy and the battle over Napster and other peer-to-peer file sharing services around the year 2000. While established record companies poured millions into lawsuits, Apple adapted and launched iTunes, resulting in great profit. Perhaps pay-TV providers will discover that evolving to the new media landscape might be more beneficial than fighting it.\n\nThe aging process is fraught with uncertainty. Just think of the awkwardness of puberty, the restlessness of the teen years and young adulthood, the aches and pains of middle age, the infirmities of old age. Now imagine what would happen if that normal aging process took place not over several decades, but in the course of a couple of years. For those with a rare condition known as progeria, this is an unfortunate reality. Progeria is one of several extremely rare conditions that affect the aging process. As those who suffer from these conditions try to cope with their fate, researchers are busy seeking a cure that may hold the key to unlocking how we age, which has implications for everyone.\n\n7. Progeria\n\n\n\nHutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome comes as a shock to parents, as their cute toddlers and grade school-aged kids being displaying symptoms more associated with their grandparents and great-grandparents \u2014 baldness, a shrunken or wrinkled face, missing teeth and stiff joints. Their insides aren't faring any better, as those with progeria have the heart problems and increased risk of strokes associated with those in their 60s or older. It's estimated there are no more than 250 children worldwide living with this bewildering condition. This is partly due to dire statistics; these children rarely reach their 20th birthday, as most succumb to the diseases of old age in their early teens. While small comfort for families living with progeria, the odds of a newborn developing it is 1 in 4 million to 8 million. That said, this tiny population could have big implications for all of us, as researchers seek to stop the ravages of the protein progerin, which contributes to accelerated aging; the buildup of that same protein in otherwise healthy people leads to atherosclerosis.\n\n(Slideshow photo credit: Remy Sharp)\n\n6. Hypopituitarism\n\n\n\nTo look and hear comic Andy Milonakis, you would think he's still in middle school or high school. The truth is, Milonakis was born in 1976. Reportedly, the baby-faced funnyman suffers from hypopituitarism, and he certainly boasts the hallmarks of this condition, which involves a deficit of pituitary gland hormones responsible for the physical development and other basic body functions, such as regulating blood pressure and metabolism. For starters, those with this growth hormone deficiency tend to look far younger than their years. They also tend to collect fat in the face and abdomen. The Mayo Clinic also reports the roughly 4 of every 100,000 Americans diagnosed with the condition each year also tend to be shorter, anemic and show signs of stunted sexual development.\n\n5. Terminal Leukodystrophy\n\n\n\nThere is no \"opposite\" of progeria whereby, instead of a person aging rapidly, he or she appears to become progressively younger with the passage of time. If there were such a condition, scientists and pharmaceutical companies would be racing to find a way to commercialize this incredible \"fountain of youth.\" However, in some respects, this condition within a broader family of leukodystrophy diseases may well be as close to discovering eternal youth as we're going to get, at least right now. The story of two brothers in England who, in their 30s and 40s started to act and think like 10-year-olds, has drawn comparisons to Brad Pitt's character in the book-turned-flick, Benjamin Button, who appears to grow younger and younger as everyone around him ages. It's estimated only 100 individuals in the U.K. share this disease, and in most cases the mental and behavioral progression doesn't seem as pronounced, as the individuals afflicted with it are very rarely adults. It's important to note that, unlike other diseases on this list, appearance is not impacted; these brothers, for example, still appear to be middle-aged men \u2014 only they appear to be giggling schoolboys trapped in a grown man's body. The condition is tied to the degeneration of the fatty covering that protects the nerve fiber known as myelin.\n\n4. Reactive Attachment Disorder\n\n\n\nThis heartbreaking condition is recognized as a psychological disorder, and in many respects keeps individuals from growing up. Those suffering from RAD are often stuck in the earliest years of their lives when they experienced trauma as the result of neglect or abuse. There are many symptoms associated with RAD, including antisocial and aggressive behavior and, notably, immature reactions and behaviors that don't match the child's actual age. Delayed learning and even physical growth can also occur. Interestingly, some children suffer from the \"inhibited\" form of the disorder, where they are withdrawn and avoid any contact with others (as an outgrowth of their being ignored or mistreated at a time when bonds with others are first supposed to be forged), whereas others suffer from the \"disinhibited\" form, whereby kids are dramatic attention-seekers, and constantly form inappropriate attachments to others (an outgrowth of their being bounced from caregiver to caregiver as young children). While the condition is considered rare, it's estimated that at least half of those who are adopted suffer from RAD.\n\n3. Kallman Syndrome\n\n\n\nThis genetic condition, which affects the hormones that trigger sexual development, can delay or even prevent puberty in individuals. But the condition can have a number of other effects; those with Kallman syndrome have either an impaired sense of smell or a complete lack of smell, and may have a cleft lip, hearing loss, and one kidney that fails to develop. Certain individuals may develop a condition known as bimanual synkinesis, in which the movements of one hand are perfectly \u2014 and unconsciously \u2014 mirrored in the other hand. While Kallman syndrome is considered rare, researchers disagree on the incidence of Kallman's \u2014 with odds of having it ranging from 1 in 10,000 people to 1 in 86,000. Jazz great Jimmy Scott is among those with the syndrome who parlayed the symptoms of Kallman's, courtesy of his distinctive high contralto voice, into a successful music career. As is often the case with the condition, Scott looked far younger than his years and remained stuck at 4 feet, 11 inches until he was in his late 30s \u2014 at which time he went through a growth spurt and gained around 10 inches of height.\n\n2. Acromegaly\n\n\n\nThrough the years, The Guinness Book of World Records has featured the tallest men and women from across the globe. Those record-setters, such as the current world's tallest man \u2014 the 8-foot-3-inch Sultan Kosen \u2014 have this hormonal condition derived from the Greek word for \"extremities\" (\"acro\") and for \"great\" (\"megaly\"). It's a fitting name as one of the hallmarks of the disease is abnormally large and rapidly growing feet and hands. Individuals can go through the first years of their lives with no problems, and then suddenly encounter an incredible growth spurt. The disease, occurring in some 3-4 people per million, is caused by a tumor of the pituitary gland that causes the secretion of excessive amounts of growth hormone. Tanya Angus, who in recent years worked to educate others about acromegaly, went from being a \"normal\" 5-foot-11-inch, 145-pound teen to a 6-foot-6-inch, more than 400-pound \"giant\" at age 31 in about a decade's time. Sadly, Angus passed away in early 2013. Her mother explained that Tanya's heart gave out after she contracted what the rest of us might consider quite mundane \u2014 a common cold. Perhaps one of the best-known acromegaly sufferers was professional wrestler Andre \"The Giant\" Roussimoff, who stood 7 feet, 4 inches and weighed 500 pounds at the time of his death in 1993.\n\n1. Mysterious Conditions\n\n\n\nThere is a condition so rare or, perhaps, so little understood, that it doesn't even have a name \u2014 other than \"Syndrome X.\" This mystery condition (or \"conditions\"?) seemingly freezes a person \u2014 physically, mentally and otherwise \u2014 at the age of an infant or young child. At least three of the individuals with this perplexing inability to grow and develop have been profiled widely on television programs worldwide. 20-something Brooke, who lives in Maryland, is 2 \u00bd feet tall, weighs 16 pounds and has a mental age estimated at no more than that of a 1-year-old baby. Another Syndrome X child, Gabby, was born in 2004 but weighs just 10 pounds and, with the exception of her full head of hair, is often mistaken for an infant; she is completely dependent on her parents and her communication is primarily limited to cries. Nicky, the oldest of the group at more than 40, appears to be more advanced in terms of cognitive and physical abilities, but stopped talking when he was little more than a year old and can pass for an elementary school child. Doctors are confounded by this condition, which may be limited to a handful of children on Earth. They have found no abnormalities in terms of chromosomes or genetics, and growth hormone therapies have not made a difference in their conditions. For some reason, these people age one-fourth the rate of their \"normal\" counterparts, and their bodies develop not only out of sync, but as separate parts10. Olbers' Paradox\n\n\n\nOlbers' paradox deals with cosmology and is a simple observation of our universe that you can make tonight. If the universe is infinitely old and contains an infinite number of stars, then why isn't the sky infinitely bright? The answer was actually proposed by horror writer Edgar Allan Poe almost a century before the birth of modern cosmology. The very fact that we're not blinded by infinite brightness in every direction is because the universe has a finite age with a finite number of stars in it.\n\n9. The Monty Hall Problem\n\n\n\nA classic in statistics based on the popular game-show host of the same name. Your chances of winning actually increase if you change your door choice after the first round. The reason is that you are changing your sample space from 1-out-of-3 to 1-out-of-2. While it seems that your odds should be 50%, they're actually 66% in your favor with this strategy. (Try it, it works!) Hall himself talked about the puzzle in a 1991 interview, noting that his interplay with each contestant on Let's Make A Deal canceled out the statistical effect of the situation.\n\n8. The Faint Sun Paradox\n\n\n\nCurrent models of stellar evolution suggest that the Sun had to be much fainter early in Earth's history \u2026 so how did we avoid an \"Ice Ball Earth?\" The climate puzzle of the early Earth has yet to be completely solved, but there are some interesting hypotheses. One idea is the volcanic greenhouse gasses were much more prevalent in the atmosphere of the early Earth. Another proposal is that the Sun was slightly more massive and energetic in its early history than proposed. Looking at Mars, we know that it once enjoyed the same warmth as well and was able to have flowing water on its surface, despite its distance from the Sun.\n\n(Slideshow photo credit: Francesco Sisti)\n\n7. Zeno's Dichotomy Paradox\n\n\n\nThis is an idea from the Greek philosopher Zeno that says if an infinite number of points exist from point A to B, you can never reach point B traveling half the distance at a time. Although more of a logic-based conundrum, Zeno's dichotomy paradox anticipated the subatomic world of quantum particles. Zeno also proposed many other notable paradoxes, including the Arrow paradox, which maintains that an arrow in flight occupies a single volume of space at any given time, and is therefore motionless.\n\n6. The Tea Leaf Paradox\n\n\n\nWhy do tea leaves gather in the center of the cup as its stirred? While one would think centrifugal force would force the tea leaves towards the edge of the cup, more is at play just below the surface of the fluid. Specifically, the vertical rotation of the fluid is faster at the top than the bottom, setting up an inward pressure gradient. Albert Einstein first proposed the correct solution for this in 1926.\n\n5. Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat\n\n\n\nFrom quantum physics, this thought experiment explains that at a sub-atomic level, state is determined by observation. Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat asks us to think of a vial of poison gas in a box with said cat. Rupturing of the vial depends on the decay of a radioactive particle, the state of which cannot be known without observation. Thus, the cat actually occupies two states (alive and dead) until the observation is made. While arcane, there is observational evidence that the world of subatomic particles actually behave in this manner.\n\n4. The Duality of Light\n\n\n\nHow can light behave both as a particle and a wave? Again, although this contradicts common sense, there is real evidence that light does just that. For example, the photoelectric effect is firm evidence of light photons acting as particles (This is how solar panels work). However, the double-slit experiment demonstrates the interference and scattering pattern of light, a very wave-like thing to do.\n\n3. The Twin Paradox of Relativity\n\n\n\nWhat happens to time as you approach the speed of light? Rather than being separate, we know that time and space is actually linked. The closer you approach the speed of light, the slower time appears to flow from your own frame of reference. This sort of effect has actually been measured using satellites and ultra-precise clocks. While a theoretical journey around the galaxy at 99.9% the speed of light might only take a few years from your own perspective, you would return to Earth to find that your family and friends had been deceased for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n2. Maxwell's Demon\n\n\n\nThis paradox with the strange name shows that while the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics is a statistical certainty, temporary violations can exist. Maxwell's Demon envisions a valve between two chambers allowing faster moving molecules to pass from one to the other, seemingly in violation of the 2nd Law. Note however, that the net entropy decrease is only temporary; for a true violation to occur, slower moving molecules would have to be allowed back across the barrier in the reverse direction as well. Systems (such as living organisms) can do battle with the 2nd Law for a time, but in the end, entropy always wins. By the way, the name Maxwell's Demon comes from 19th century Scottish theoretical physicist James Clerk Maxwell.\n\n1. The French Paradox\n\n\n\nWhy do the French drink, smoke and overeat but remain relativity healthy? Medical researchers have puzzled over the French paradox for years. Many have cited the presence of resveratrol in red wine as a preventative for cancer and heart disease. Others indicate that the high level of vitamin K2 (menaquinone) prevents hardening of the arteries. Or perhaps the paradox is no more complex than lifestyle. Many European cultures still walk and bicycle daily, a habit almost unknown to many Americans orbit10. 100 Year Starship ($500,000)\n\nThe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and NASA are sponsoring this project that seeks to make manned interstellar space travel possible within the next century. Sound impossible? Well, so did the thought of a mission to the Moon a century ago. Plans such as Bussard Ramjets and a fusion-powered ship known as Daedalus have been previously studied for feasibility. One concept known as Project Orion from the 1960s would propel itself by ejecting and detonating atomic bombs to the aft of the ship and, while primitive, has the merit of relying on known technology. The award was given to former astronaut Mae Jamison in 2012 for her team's proposal entitled, \"An Inclusive Audacious Journey Transforms Life Here on Earth & Beyond.\"\n\n9. Millennium Prizes in Mathematics ($1 million)\n\nEstablished by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000, the Millennium Prizes will award $1 million each for the solution to any of the seven established unsolved problems in mathematics. Among the problems are the infamous \"minesweeper dilemma\" known as P versus NP and the Riemann hypothesis which, among other things, deals with the distribution of prime numbers. Only one of the millennium prizes has been solved thus far; Russian mathematician Grigoriy Perelman solved the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, yet he declined the cash prize in 2010. Here's a link to the Clay Mathematics Institute for a look at the other unsolved problems.\n\n8. Randi Paranormal Challenge ($1 million)\n\nBack in 1964, magician and skeptic promoter James Randi (aka the \"Amazing Randi\" began offering a $1,000 prize to anyone who could display proof of paranormal powers. The award grew to $10,000, then $100,000, finally reaching $1 million in the mid-1990s. Of course, this claim would have to stand up to rigorous scientific scrutiny. The challenge has been extended to psychic notables such as John Edward, Sylvia Browne, James Van Praagh and Uri Geller. And although hundreds of people have applied for the award, no one has moved past the preliminary testing stage to get to the formal test. A prediction: the prize goes unclaimed for the foreseeable future \u2026 bad pun intended.\n\n7. Mprize (prize amount varies)\n\nOffered by the Methuselah Foundation, which sponsors research into life extension, the Mprize seeks breakthroughs using mice in the two subcategories of the Rejuvenation Prize and the Longevity Prize. Research that extends the life of mice could hopefully then be applied to research into human longevity. The Longevity Prize is awarded to any research team breaking the world record for the oldest mouse. As its name suggests, the Rejuvenation Prize is awarded to any team that can show a quantifiable reversal in the physical condition \u2014 or age-related changes \u2014 of a lab mouse. Several Mprizes have been awarded, including to one researcher who kept a mouse alive almost five years.\n\n6. DARPA Robotics Challenge ($2 million)\n\nAnnounced in 2012, this challenge aims to develop robots that could assist in crisis-stricken regions. Imagine the benefits of sending a robot into an earthquake-ravaged building to search for survivors, instead of having to risk human lives. Three teams have been selected to compete in the challenge, which begins with a live hardware challenge in December 2013 and closes at the end of 2014.\n\n5. Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize ($10 million)\n\nLet's face it, who wouldn't want a Star Trek medical tricorder similar to the one carried by Dr. \"Bones\" McCoy? One of several incentives offered by the X Prize Foundation, the Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize will be awarded to \"the team that develops a mobile platform that most accurately diagnoses a set of 15 conditions across 30 consumers in three days.\" The announcement of the competition brought a thrill for Star Trek fans, as organizers brought together all five captains from the Star Trek franchise. Whether a tricorder can be developed remains to be seen, but the original Star Trek certainly played a role in shaping modern technology; among other things the show inspired the flip cellphone.\n\n4. H-Prize for Hydrogen Technology ($10 million)\n\nHydrogen fuel technology offers great promise if several key hurdles can be overcome. The H-Prize sponsored by the United States Department of Energy seeks to address these with a series of cash prizes to be awarded by 2017. The H-Prize deals with the chief dilemmas posed by hydrogen fuel, namely safe storage, transport and fuel economy coupled with distribution and utilization.\n\n3. Archon Genomics X Prize ($10 million)\n\nKnown as the \"100 over 100\" project, the Archon Genomics X Prize will be awarded to the team that can sequence the genomes of 100 centenarians economically and accurately. This competition hopes to discover key gene sequences that may have contributed to these individuals' extraordinary longevity. In addition to gaining insight into the secrets of longevity, organizers hope research from this project will improve diagnosis and treatment by giving physicians the first \"medical grade\" genome.\n\n2. Virgin Earth Challenge ($25 million)\n\nThis challenge seeks innovative methods to deal with one of the biggest dilemmas of our generation, global warming. The award will go to the team that can demonstrate a commercially successful method of permanently removing harmful greenhouse gasses from the atmosphere by storing, sequestering and\/or returning them back to the carbon cycle. Eleven finalists were chosen out of a field of 2,600 initial applicants in 2011. The prize is the brainchild of billionaire Sir Richard Branson.\n\n1. Google Lunar X Prize ($30 million)\n\nOne of the most ambitious prizes out there is literally shooting for the Moon. Announced in 2007, Google's Lunar X Prize is a competition looking for the first team with private funding to send a robotic mission to the Moon. The robotic mission must land on the lunar surface safely, send back video and images, and travel 500 meters over the lunar surface. Registration closed at the end of 2010, and currently 25 teams are competing in the project. They only have until the end of 2015 to get to the Moon. On a side note, the competition has created an unusual debate, in that some archaeologists are concerned that a successful mission could land a probe on the Moon that might accidentally disturb the previous Apollo landing sites. These scientists maintain that those sites should be maintained in pristine condition, much like key archaeological sites on Earth\n\n5. Climate and Weather Are Two Separate Entities\n\nThere's a famous quote variously attributed to everyone from Mark Twain to science fiction writer Robert Heinlein: \"Climate is what you expect; weather is what you get.\" Climate deals with long-term trends; an increase of a few degrees in temperature may not seem like much on a winters' day, but can lead to catastrophic consequences as an average over the span of a century. Weather deals with short-term trends. Computer modeling is excellent for long-term worldwide trends, but has yet to have the resolution necessary to model local fluctuations with complete accuracy.\n\nWhile many point to catastrophic weather events in recent years as the result of global warming, calamities such as the Dust Bowl in the American and Canadian prairie region in the 1930s remind us that destructive weather patterns can be found in any era. We can't point to any specific storm and claim it's the direct result of climate change. Also, changes in worldwide weather patterns mean that winters may actually become colder and snowier for some locales. Unfortunately, climate change deniers often exploit the complexity of science to claim a \"controversy\" exists.\n\n4. Global Dimming Actually Contributes to Cooling Effect\n\nThis phenomenon gets less press than global warming but is well known to climatologists as part of the climate puzzle. The change in the overall reflectivity of Earth (known as a planet's albedo in astronomy) due to increased cloud cover actually works to cool the planet. More pollution means more insulating cloud cover, contributing to the greenhouse effect, but white clouds are also efficient at reflecting light and heat back out into space. An ironic fact is, even if we stopped all emissions tomorrow, temperatures could spike worldwide due to a decrease in cloud cover and increase in solar radiation reaching the ground and oceans. In 2001, scientists conducted an interesting study after all air traffic was grounded over the United States for three days after the 9\/11 attacks. Researchers found that the lack of jet contrails, especially over urban areas, caused a noticeable rise in daytime highs during the period.\n\n3. The Solar Cycle Contributes to Warming\n\nThe Sun plays an obvious but often overlooked role in our climate. Our nearest star follows an 11-year solar cycle, and researchers have linked or tried to link its increased activity to everything from human behavior to wheat prices to market booms and busts. Though we passed the point where solar activity was the largest contributor to climate warming at the end of the last century, the Sun's activity remains part of the climate change equation. A 2005 study by two Duke University physicists found that the Sun's role in contributing to global warming might be underestimated, although they did not dispute the theory of manmade climate change.\n\n2. People Use Ordinary Weather Events To Support or Deny Climate Change\n\nBoth those who believe in climate change and those who don't are equally guilty of cherry-picking data to support their conclusions. Another variant of this is known as the \"going down the up escalator\" logical fallacy; you can take any segment in time on any graph trending up or down and find reversals in the trend to support a preselected conclusion. Many lauded President Barack Obama in his 2013 State of the Union address for mentioning global warming, but even he was guilty of a logical misstep in citing specific weather events as driven by climate change. The media also follows a predicable seasonal cycle now, with alarmists stepping to the forefront during every outbreak of tornadoes or summer heat wave to announce the reality of climate change, while deniers gain airtime during every winter snowstorm, proclaiming, \"where is global warming now?\"\n\n1. Political Polarization Threatens Discussion on Climate Change\n\nClimate change has become a controversial political issue, and everyone loves to rally around his or her tribe when it's brought up. Unfortunately, this sort of knee-jerk reaction also kills any meaningful discussion on the issue. The Internet often makes the situation worse on any sensitive issue, whether it be abortion, gun control or climate change, as anyone can find a camp that agrees with them and websites to support their own outlook. The reality of climate change has moved beyond purely scientific or even political debate into discussions on how to deal with the consequences. Low-lying coastal areas such as in Egypt, Bangladesh and Florida already know the daily effects of sea-level rise. Insurance companies are increasingly refusing to insure coastal dwellers living in hazardous areas. The U.S. Navy is studying changes it may need to make for strategic purposes as seawaters rise and ports and waterways shift worldwide.\n\nThe issue of climate change is a complex one, but it's one we must deal with for our continued survival.\n\n(Slideshow photo: Protesters in Melbourne, Australia, spell out their concerns about global warming in a 2009 demonstration; Andrew North)\n\nWith the termination of NASA's Space Shuttle program in 2011, all eyes are now on private space companies as a means to get humans and payloads back into low-Earth orbit and beyond. And while companies such as SpaceX and Orbital Sciences are being hailed as \"the next big thing,\" several significant challenges face these newcomers to the space-travel game. To be sure, most fans of spaceflight support commercial space operations; most of us are simply glad that something is still leaving the launch pad and headed somewhere. Turning away from space travel entirely is what we truly fear. But to build on their early ventures into spaceflight, SpaceX and other private companies must overcome some daunting obstacles.\n\n5. Private Space Companies Face a Steep Learning Curve\n\nThis week, the SpaceX Corp. headed by PayPal founder Elon Musk will launch its Dragon spacecraft atop a Falcon 9 rocket on a resupply mission to the International Space Station. NASA has been sending spacecraft into orbit for decades; SpaceX is the first private company to match this feat. It can be argued that SpaceX and corporations like it are, technically speaking, still at the late 1950s \"Sputnik stage,\" when the U.S. and Soviet Union celebrated merely achieving Earth orbit. The summer of 2013 will see a second competitor enter the race with the launch of the first Cygnus mission atop an Orbital Sciences Antares rocket. SpaceX has plans to eventually send manned versions of the Dragon into orbit, but again, this is something that NASA was doing back in the early 1960s.\n\n4. Commercial Space Firms Face Enormous Costs\n\nThere's an old adage that the fastest way for someone to become a millionaire is to start with a billion dollars and then invest in an airline. Private spaceflight is much more expensive than commercial aviation, and there is no immediate revenue stream to help offset all the costs. SpaceX is often touted as \"privatized space,\" but the company is still heavily subsidized by the government, to the tune of $500 billion in NASA contracts as of 2012. Many pundits see the project as NASA merely giving them a free ticket to play in low Earth orbit. Can such startups stand on their own and become profitable? One factor that makes space travel truly cost prohibitive is the price tag on just getting out of Earth's gravity well. Most of the cost in terms of hardware and boosters are expended during the first few minutes immediately after liftoff.\n\n3. Many Have Bold Visions, but the Reality May be Less Exciting\n\nEvery week it seems as if we hear of yet another company with a bold new proposal for spaceflight. A Dutch company called Mars One wants to start a global TV reality show with the end result being a human colony on the Red Planet. Golden Spike Co. wants to send tourists to the Moon (tickets are $750 million). In February 2013, Dennis Tito \u2014 the first space tourist aboard the International Space Station in 2001 \u2014 proposed a dramatic manned Mars flyby mission in 2018. Will anything ever come of these, or are they simply pie-in-the-sky dreams? Probably the most realistic manned flight plans at the moment are Virgin Galactic's plans to launch tourists on sub-orbital flights. XCOR has similar plans for suborbital flights aboard its Lynx spacecraft starting in the next few years. One program dubbed Earthrise Space Inc. seeks to fund construction of a student-built lunar rover via Kickstarter.com, a private equity funding website.\n\nThen there are the numerous proposals to mine asteroids for profit. Many of these proposals fail to take into account the difficulties of returning samples from asteroids thus far. To date, Japan's Hayabusa spacecraft has been the only success, and it returned scant bits of dust. Following the Chelyabinsk meteor event over Russia on Feb. 15, 2013, much media attention has been devoted to ways we can detect asteroids before they threaten Earth. One of the best options for that at the moment is a privately funded asteroid-hunting space telescope, Sentinel, funded by the B612 Foundation. Plans call for a launch date in 2016. It may not sound as exciting as a flight to Mars, but in the end, it may prove much more valuable to mankind.\n\n2. Can Private Companies Withstand the Inevitable Disasters?\n\nFolks love the idea of space travel, until something like the Challenger or Columbia disaster happens. While we hate to think about it, the first disaster involving a \"space tourist\" is inevitable. Could a commercial space company weather such a disaster? The media loves disasters and drama; it's sad commentary to think that with all of the triumphs of the space shuttle program, such as the deployment of the Hubble, Chandra and Compton space telescopes, the biggest NASA news stories were the loss of two shuttles and the \"diaper-wearing astronaut love triangle.\" In a modern risk-adverse society, it's tempting for companies to downplay the risk early on in a program, compounding the problem. A similar risk assessment can also be drawn from the early days of the Space Shuttle era. NASA originally estimated the risk of a disaster resulting in fatalities at 1-in-100,000. Twenty-five years later, studies looking at those early flights determined the probability of disaster might actually have been closer to 1-in-9.\n\n1. Public Apathy May Prove the Biggest Threat to Future Space Ventures\n\nDespite their best efforts and unprecedented transparency for a government organization, NASA seems to have trouble generating publicity. Will private space travel ultimately fall prey to apathy in the eyes of the public and media? Again, there seems to be a \"been there, done that\" attitude to even the most fantastic of accomplishments. Many residents of the Florida Space Coast fail to realize that space launches continue to occur. \"No Buck Rodgers, no bucks\" is the common mantra in Congress. Astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson sums it up even better: \"They've never named a school after a robot.\"\n\nThen there's the attitude that private companies may have toward science and exploration in space as well. These tend not to be profitable enterprises, and private space companies may have little interest in carrying out such ventures. Granted, one can also argue that science has always played second fiddle to military and commercial interests in space. The number of military versus scientific payloads bears that out.\n\nGiven these challenges, commercial spaceflight faces an uncertain future. Perhaps what will truly get us off of the Earth and into space permanently is an innovation such as futurist Arthur C. Clarke's \"space elevator,\" a method to slowly lift payloads and passengers to geosynchronous orbit along an enormous cable. This would end at a large ring in orbit, with several space elevators girdling the earth like spokes in a wheel. Such a construction feat would obviously be a huge undertaking. Perhaps in a century or so spacecraft will depart from such a ring surrounding Spaceport Earth, but it remains to be seen if private space corporations will play a role in its construction."}

Carreau\n\nIn a region near the center of our Milky Way galaxy known as Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*, and yes, the * IS pronounced! - 'Sagittarius A-Star') lurks a Supermassive Black Hole. Apparently this local black hole of ours is preparing for a meal of hot gas.\n\nWith a mass of about 4 million times that of our Sun, and lying around 26,000 light-years away from our Solar System, our black hole is still a few hundred times closer to us than any other galaxy with an active black hole at its center. Detailed observations made by the European Space Agency's (ESA) Herschel Space Observatory, (you know, BEFORE it did that whole running out of liquid helium coolant thing, So Long, Herschel), show hot molecular gas which may be orbiting or falling towards our hungry black hole.\n\nVast amounts of dust lie in the plane of the Milky Way between here and its center. At far-infrared wavelengths it's possible to peer through the dust allowing Herschel's scientists the chance to study the innermost region of our Galaxy in great detail. According to ESA (Herschel Reveals The Milky Way's Warm Heart) new research based on spectroscopic data from Herschel has resolved the innermost portion of the Milky Way, a few light-years around Sgr A*, for the first time at far-infrared wavelengths. The team of astronomers, led by Javier Goicoechea from the Centro de Astrobiolog\u00eda in Madrid, Spain, was able to isolate the far-infrared emission from all the interstellar components that surround Sgr A* \u2013 neutral atomic, molecular and ionized gas, as well as dust.\n\nA big surprise found by the team was how hot the molecular gas in the innermost central region of the Galaxy gets. At least some of it is around 1000\u00baC, much, MUCH, hotter than typical interstellar clouds (usually only a few tens of degrees above the \u2013273\u00baC of absolute zero). Some of the heating is explained by the intense ultraviolet radiation coming from a cluster of massive stars which hang out very close to the Galactic Center, but they alone aren't enough to explain the high temperatures. In addition to this stellar radiation, Dr Goicoechea's team hypothesize that emission from strong shocks in highly-magnetized gas in the region may be contributing to the high temperatures. Shocks such as these may be generated in gas cloud collisions, or in material flowing at high speed from stars and protostars.\n\n'The observations are also consistent with streamers of hot gas speeding towards Sgr A*, falling towards the very centre of the Galaxy,' says Dr Goicoechea. 'Our Galaxy's black hole may be cooking its dinner right in front of Herschel's eyes.'\n\nTo get a head-wrapping perspective on where this hot action is taking place in relation to our little neighborhood in the Orion Arm of the galaxy, check out this map of the Milky Way provided by Richard Powell. Also check out his web-site, The Atlas of The Universe, for an incredibly awesome and completely addictive interactive version of this map, as well as other equally time-devouring maps!\n\nOh yeah, and it seems that the Milky Way's black hole isn't the only hungry one! See that dwarf galaxy located on the far side of the galaxy from us? Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy, discovered in 1994, is approximately 78,000 light years away and seemingly on our galaxy's dinner menu. And apparently the Milky Way is a very sloppy eater leaving streams of star crumbs as it gobbles up it's smaller neighbors.\n\nA Polar Hurricane\n\nWith cloud speeds clocking as fast as 330 miles per hour, and with an eye measuring a mind-blowing 1,250 miles across, the spinning vortex of Saturn's north polar storm is both beautiful and awesome in its scope and power.\n\nThis false-color image from NASA's Cassini spacecraft is among the first sunlit views of Saturn's north pole captured by the craft's imaging cameras. In 2004, when Cassini arrived in the Saturnian system, it was northern winter and the north pole was in darkness. The planet's north pole was previously imaged under sunlight by NASA's Voyager 2 in 1981, however the observation geometry did not allow for detailed views of the poles. As a result, it's not known how long this newly discovered north-polar hurricane has been active.\n\nDid he say 'locked to the north pole' and 'no ocean underneath'?!! Ok, WOW!!\n\nSo long Herschel, and thanks for all the Coolness\u2026.\n\nAccording to a report yesterday, April 29, from the European Space Agency, the Herschel Space Observatory has exhausted its supply of liquid helium coolant and as such ended more than 3 years of pioneering observations of the 'cool Universe'. The event was not unexpected and confirmation came at the beginning of the spacecraft's daily communication session with its ground station in Western Australia when a clear rise in temperatures was measured in all of Herschel's instruments.\n\n',' said G\u00f6ran Pilbratt, ESA's Herschel Project Scientist.\n\nThough the mission will not be making any more observations, discoveries from Herschel's rich archives are expected to continue. 'Herschel has improved our understanding of how new stars and planets form, but has also raised many new questions,' said Paul Goldsmith, NASA Herschel project scientist at JPL. 'Astronomers will be following up on Herschel's discoveries with ground-based and future space-based observatories for years to come.' ObservatoryAs a reminder The Sagan Series is the work of Canadian science promoter and time-lapse photographer Reid Gower. In the 10 part video series Gower uses bits of narration from Sagan's TV series, Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, edited over jaw-dropping cinematography.\n\nTo accompany today's episode here are some (hopefully!) interesting bits of Sagan Trivia!\n\n* Sagan never said the phrase 'billions and billions' on Cosmos: A Personal Voyage. The closest he came was in his book Cosmos where he wrote the phrase 'billions upon billions', (chap 1, page 3). He did, however, frequently use the word 'billions' delivered with a high emphasis on the 'b' in order to distinguish it from the word 'millions' in the mind of his viewers.\n\n* In honor of Sagan the term 'Sagan's number' is used to humorously represent the number of stars in the observable universe. This number is reasonably well defined, since we know what a star is, and we know what the observable universe is, but its value is not known with exact certainty. It's safe to say it's A LOT!\n\n* The Martian landing site of the unmanned NASA Mars Pathfinder spacecraft was renamed the Carl Sagan Memorial Station on July 5, 1997. Interestingly, an episode of the TV series Star Trek: Enterprise entitled 'Terra Prime', featured a quick shot of the Pathfinder rover, Sojourner, alongside a historical marker at station. The marker displays a quote from Sagan - 'Whatever the reason you're on Mars, I'm glad you're there, and I wish I was with you.' Also interestingly, Sagan's son, writer Nick Sagan, wrote several episodes for the Star Trek franchise, and one of Sagan's students, Professor of Astronomy at Cornell University Steve Squyres, was a principle member of the team that landed the Spirit Rover and Opportunity Rover successfully on Mars.\n\n\u2026and I thought I over-did it with that Everest-sized plate of nachos yesterday \u2014 apparently NOT!\n\nThis mind-blowing video animation of a black hole waking up for a light snack, featured April 2, 2013 by the European Space Agency (ESA), shows my indulgence in refried beans, guacamole, and melted cheese served over crisp tortilla chips has nothing on the appetite of a black hole!\n\nThe discovery in NGC 4845 was made by ESA's Integral space observatory, with follow-up observations from ESA's XMM-Newton, NASA's Swift satellite, and Japan's MAXI X-ray monitor on the International Space Station.\n\nAstronomers using Integral to study a different galaxy noticed a strong, hard X-ray flare coming from another location in the same wide field-of-view. Using XMM-Newton the origin was confirmed as NGC 4845 \u2014 a galaxy never before detected at high energies. Along with Swift and MAXI, the emission was traced from its maximum in January 2011 when the galaxy brightened by a factor of a thousand before subsiding over the course of the year.\n\nAnalyzing the characteristics of the flare, astronomers determined the emission came from a halo of material around the galaxy's central black hole as it tore apart and fed on an object of 14 to 30 Jupiter masses. The mass of Jupiter is 1.9 x 1027 kg\u2026.\n\n\u2026to wrap your head around that un-head-wrapable number, think that it would take 318 times Earth's mass to equal Jupiter's. Jupiter is 2.5 times more massive than all of the other planets in our Solar System COMBINED. Jupiter is actually so massive that if it gained much more mass it would shrink. Now completely brain-screw yourself by trying to conceive that this object is of 14 to 30 Jupiter masses. (I swear my plate of nachos was not NEARLY this massive. 1 to 2 Jupiter masses, tops!) This size range corresponds to brown dwarfs which are substellar objects not massive enough to fuse hydrogen in their core and ignite as stars. However, the authors note that it could have had an even lower mass, just a few times that of Jupiter, placing it in the range of gas-giant planets (and the average mass of a plate of Texas nachos, with jalapenos of course).\n\nAs for the black hole at the center of NGC 4845 itself \u2013 it's estimated to have a mass of about 300,000 times that of our own Sun (1.99 \u00d7 1030 kg). And it apparently likes to play with its food \u2014 the way the emission brightened and decayed shows there was a delay of 2 to 3 months between the object being disrupted and the heating of the debris in the vicinity of the black hole. (By comparison, I devoured the entire plate of nachos in less than 30 minutes. Suck on that, black hole!)\n\n'This is the first time where we have seen the disruption of a substellar object by a black hole,' adds paper co-author Roland Walter of the Observatory of Geneva, Switzerland. 'We estimate that only its external layers were eaten by the black hole, amounting to about 10% of the object's total mass, and that a denser core has been left orbiting the black hole.'\n\nAnd what of this year's expected event of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way dining on a giant gas cloud? While there are no brown dwarfs or planets on the menu, there is apparently \u2014 spaghetti!\n\nHerschel To Finish Observing Soon\n\nThe European Space Agency's (ESA) Herschel Space Observatory is expected to soon exhaust its supply of liquid helium coolant after spending more than three very exciting years studying the cool Universe. Launched in May of 2009, with a main mirror 3.5 m across, Herschel is the largest, most powerful infrared telescope ever flown in space and was named after the astronomer William Herschel who discovered the existence of infrared radiation while studying the Sun in 1800.\n\nHerschel's mission, the first to cover the entire wavelength range from the far-infrared to submillimetre, made it possible to study previously invisible cool regions of gas and dust in the cosmos, and provided new insights into the origin and evolution of stars and galaxies. In order to make such sensitive far-infrared observations, the detectors of the three science instruments, two cameras\/imaging spectrometers and a very high-resolution spectrometer, must be cooled to an extremely frigid \u2013271\u00b0C, close to absolute zero, and as such, sit atop a tank filled with superfluid liquid helium, inside a giant thermos flask known as a cryostat.\n\nPart of the Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES) Key Project, studying the evolution of galaxies in the distant, ancient Universe, this Herschel image, taken in the Lockman Hole region of space, shows thousands of galaxies packing themselves closely together, forming large clusters of galaxies by the force of their mutual gravity. Indications are that these galaxies are busy crashing into one another, forming large quantities of stars as a result of these violent encounters. Each dot is an entire galaxy containing billions of stars.\n\nHerschel has made extraordinary discoveries across a wide range of topics, from starburst galaxies in the distant Universe to newly forming planetary systems orbiting nearby young stars. However, as all good things must come to an end, engineers believe that nearly all of Herschel's liquid helium, more than 2,000 liters at launch, has now gone Centre in Darmstadt, Germany.\n\nOnce the detectors start to warm from their ultra-frigid state, they will stop working. The end, when it happens, will be sudden. The science observing program was carefully planned to take full advantage of the lifetime of the mission, and all of the highest-priority observations have already been completed. Herschel is also performing numerous other observations specifically chosen to exploit every last drop of its helium.\n\n\"We will finish observing soon, but Herschel data will enable a vast amount of exciting science to be done for many years to come,\" says G\u00f6ran Pilbratt, ESA's Herschel Project Scientist at ESA's European Space Research and Technology Centre in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. \". Finally, in early May, it will be propelled into its long-term stable parking orbit around the Sun.\n\nThe Rosette Nebula, a stellar nursery about 5,000 light-years from Earth in the Monoceros constellation. This image is a three-color composite showing infrared wavelengths of 70 microns (blue), 160 microns (green), and 250 microns (red). In this image from Herschel the bright smudges are dusty cocoons containing massive embryonic stars, which will grow to 10 times the mass of our Sun. The small spots near the center of the image are lower mass stellar embryos. The Rosette Nebula itself, and its massive cluster of stars, is located to the right of the picture.\n\nBecause Herschel can obtain data at a wide range of infrared light and reveal a more complete picture of star birth than ever seen before scientists discovered that galaxies do not always need to collide with each other in order to drive vigorous star birth, overturning a long-held assumption and painting a more complete picture of how galaxies evolve. These results were based on Herschel's observations of two patches of sky, each about one-third the size of the full moon. In this artist's conception, a galaxy accretes mass from rapid, narrow streams of cold gas. These filaments provide the galaxy with continuous flows of raw material to feed its star-forming.\n\nIn this, the most detailed image of the Andromeda Galaxy ever taken at infrared wavelengths, two ESA observatories combine forces to show the galaxy in an entirely new light. Herschel shows us rings of star formation, while ESA's X-ray space observatory, XMM-Newton, shows us dying stars shining X-rays into space. This image of our nearest large spiral galaxy neighbor clearly shows that more stars are on their way. Infrared and X-ray images convey information impossible to collect from the ground because these wavelengths are absorbed by Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe above image, brought to us by the very cool folks at Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland, is an up-to-date map of our inner solar system. The map displays the orbits of the 4 terrestrial planets in our system, with the Earth's orbit being highlighted in bright blue \u2014 because we think it's kinda special.\n\nIn this image, the small green points mark the location of asteroids which do not approach close to the Earth right now. (This is subject to change.) The yellow objects are Earth approaching asteroids which are called Amors. Amors have orbits which come close to the Earth without actually crossing the Earth's orbit. Their orbits are, however, close enough that they could potentially be perturbed by the influence of the planets. (There are over 300 known objects on such orbits.)\n\nAnd the red boxes? These mark the location of the Apollo and Aten asteroids. These asteroids DO cross the Earth's orbit and are the most directly identifiable astronomical threat for the near future. Keep in mind, this is a current map \u2014 updated daily. It shows the estimated position of thousands of known asteroids. Astronomers at Armagh remind us, however, that even conservative estimates would suggest that for every asteroid on a Earth-approaching orbit there are hundreds more which have yet to be discovered. It's estimated that there are perhaps 100,000 to 1,000,000 undiscovered asteroids on similar Earth crossing orbits.\n\nIf NASA never deflects #2012DA14 and it hits Earth one day, we'll confirm that humans possess a lethal absence of foresight. - Tweeted by Neil deGrasse Tyson, Feb 15, 2013.\n\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nAnd, to help us wash the not entirely uncool taste of asteroid from our mouths, and for anyone who missed this, here's the first ever space-to-earth musical collaboration!

If you're not following him on twitter you're missing some of the most incredible Earth-from-Space images EVER! Do we really need much more proof than this to know that the Canadians are SO much cooler than us Americans?!I first became aware of this stunning image in a Jan 25 post on EarthSky by Deborah Byrd titled Underwater Fish Tornado Off Baja California. The photograph is the work of photographer and marine biologist Octavio Aburto, captured at the Cabo Pulmo National Park in Mexico, in the course of studying the courtship behavior of a species of Jack fish. Mr Aburto's photograph, aptly titled David and Goliath, captures his friend David Castro's miniscule size in comparison to the gigantic school.

And on the subject of 'WOW'\u2026..there's this\u2026\n\nMy favorite astronomy image of the week was taken by astro-photographer Luis Argerich of Buenos Aires, Argentina. This image titled, Airglow Above Buenos Aires was featured as Earth Science Picture of the Day for Jan 26. The image is a 360-degree stereographic projection showing the entire night sky near Mr Argerich's location about 60 miles from Buenos Aires. Airglow is a weak light emission stemming from the chemical reactions involving oxygen, nitrogen, sodium and ozone (chemiluminescence) at altitudes between about 50 to 60 miles above the Earth's surface. According to Mr Argerich, the green color bands, which are obvious to the camera, were not visible to the naked eye and seem to converge because of perspective. In addition to this awesome image, Mr Argerich was also featured this week as Jan 24\u2032s Astronomy Picture of the Day for his photograph called ISS and the Summer Milky Way, featuring starry clouds and nebulae along the southern hemisphere's summer Milky Way arc above the horizon, and the orbiting International Space Station tracing a long streak through a single, 5 minute, star-tracking exposure. Be sure to visit Luis Argerich's site for more of his amazingly beautiful work!\n\nInside the blogosphere this week there was much to think about, smile about, and out-and-out laugh about. For a brilliant, and hilarious, look at what your brain is doing while you're at work check out Canadian cartoonist, John Atkinson's Jan 23rd post on Wrong Hands titled Occupational Preoccupation. While there be sure to check out some of John's galleries, but be warned, his work is very, VERY, addictive!\n\nAlso falling into the category of Things I Love one of my favorite blog writers, White Lady in the Hood, also know as Chica Blanca, treated us this week to a post titled The River Rats. Managing to combine humor and reflectiveness, Chica, has a knack of not only drawing the reader in, but also eerily making us feel as if we are there taking part in the story she's sharing with us. Her writing is good, very good, but it's her ability to connect with her readers which shines most brightly. Chica's an elusive poster, she won't flood your inbox, but if you enjoy a good read and are anything like me, when you do find one of her posts in your mailbox you'll be heading right over.\n\nMy favorite song of this past week was posted by Xandi from World Music in a post titled, Music from Argentina \u2013 Alerta Pachuca, and features the song Nunca Dejes de Bailar (Never Stop Dancing). Alerta Pachuca, formed in 2008, is a Latin fusion group composed of 7 multi-instrumentalists from Buenos Aires. I hope you enjoy!!\n\nThis image from The European Space Agency's (ESA) Herschel Space Observatory reveals multiple arcs around Betelgeuse, the nearest red supergiant star to Earth. The star, and its arc-shaped shields, could collide with an intriguing dusty 'wall' in about 5000 years. Betelgeuse, in the constellation Orion the Hunter, can easily be seen with the naked eye in the northern hemisphere winter night sky as the orange\u2013red star above and to the left of Orion's famous three-star belt.\n\nBetelgeuse, also known as Alpha Orionis, is roughly 1,000 times the diameter of our Sun, and shines 100, 000 times more brightly. However, before us humans begin to feel 'star-envy' we should understand that Betelgeuse, having already swelled into a red super-giant and having shed a significant fraction of its outer layers, is likely on its way to one hellava supernova explosion! This far-infrared view from Herschel shows how the star's winds are crashing against the surrounding interstellar medium, creating a bow shock as the star moves through space at speeds of around 30 km\/s. To state in human terms \u2014 Betelgeuse is having a hissy-fit, a huge hissy-fit!\n\nBeing about 640 light-years away, Betelgeuse isn't exactly in our stellar backyard but it is among the nearest stars to our Sun doomed to go the supernova route. When it will explode is really anyone's guess. Given that it takes six centuries for its light to reach us, it might already have done so. The best estimate scientists give is that it will likely blow apart sometime in the next 100,000 years \u2013 a blink of the eye by cosmic standards. When it does happen Betelgeuse will erupt as a so-called Type II supernova. As its outer layers head spaceward at about five percent of the speed of light, its spent core will rapidly implode to become, most likely, a neutron star some 20 kilometers across. A neutron star, which is effectively a solid ball of nuclear matter, is so dense that a thimbleful (a thimbleful!) of its contents would outweigh the entire human population. Yes, even despite our addiction to, and indulgence in, junk food.\n\nFrom the Earth, the exploding Betelgeuse will get nearly as bright as the full Moon and be visible for two or three months even in daylight. Type II supernovae pose no threat to planets that are hundreds of light-years away because their deadly radiation spreads out equally in all directions and eventually becomes too thin to be of concern. From our safe vantage-point, this will be one awesome show!\n\nIn other Orion related news the European Space Agency (ESA) announced this week that, in a collaborative effort, it will be supplying a driving force to the Orion spacecraft in the form of its Automated Transfer Vehicles (ATVs). The ATV-derived service module will provide propulsion, power, thermal control, as well as supplying water and gas to the astronauts in the habitable module.\n\n\"ATV has proven itself on three flawless missions to the Space Station and this agreement is further confirmation that Europe is building advanced, dependable spacecraft,\" said Nico Dettmann, Head of ATV's production program. This collaboration between ESA and NASA continues the spirit of international cooperation that forms the foundation of the ISS.\n\nThis awe-inspiring image of spiral galaxy NGC 1309 was by far my favorite astronomy image of the week! Brought to us by the Hubble Legacy Archive, the ESA, NASA, and with processing by Martin Pugh, this stunning galaxy, which lies 100 million light-years away in the constellation of the River (Eridanus), spans about 30,000 light-years making it about one third the size of our own Milky Way galaxy. <\u2013 Click link for a jaw-dropping artist's illustration of what some distant astronomers might likely see if peering back at us from across the expanse! I don't want to sound all boastful or anything, but WOW, we have one awesome galaxy!!\n\nThis week, for me at least, seemed to be dominated by images and the photographers who take them. 3 photographers in particular completely blew me away. Not only am I impressed with their images, but also in how they fully demonstrate how the resulting images, no matter how good the equipment, depend entirely on the artist behind the camera.\n\nIn his January 15 post titled Bavarian Forest National Park \u2013 Lusen Mt, one of my very favorite astro-photographers, Werner Priller, documents through words and A-MAZ-ING photographs a night spent camping out in -17C temperature just a stone's throw from the Czech border. This is an incredible effort on the part of a photographer who makes a life's work out of incredible efforts; the forest, the frozen summit cross (WOW!!), Warner's camp site, the wolves (!!), all under such a beautiful starry night as to make Van Gogh blush! I don't think I have to mention again to check out this post \u2026you're probably already there.\n\nAnother photographer I've mentioned before, the elusive George Weaver of She Kept a Parrot, this week stole my heart right out of my chest (she has a way of doing that!) with her January 16 post titled The Star Wars Cowboy. Ms Weaver is, by far, one of the best story-tellers I've ever come across. Though her stunningly honest photography, and her equally honest words, she takes us on a journey which always feels familiar because she is, in fact, reminding us of who we are. And we are human. Thank you George.\n\nSpeaking of humans, the 3rd photographer to catch my attention this past week is Richard Guest of The Future Is PaperM\u00e2ch\u00e9. Since May of 2012 Richard has been walking up to complete strangers in the streets and alleys of London, asking if he could take their picture, and the results are entirely interesting! This week, amongst others, I found absolutely intriguing Mr Guest's January 13th post titled Street Portrait #48 (Pierce), and his January 16th entry Street Portrait #50 (Peter). While you're there checking out Richard's street photography be sure to also check out some of his collaborations with other artists, including the above mentioned J.E. Lattimer (Nineteen Eighty-Four).\n\nIn closing this week I leave you with an earworm from The Misfits, I Turned Into A Martian, a little shout out to Curiosity who's about to start drilling up the Martian surface!! Yep, we're cooking rocks on another planet, and how freaking cool is that!!\n\nEight years ago, January 14, 2005, the European Space Agency's Huygens probe plunged through a thick, mysterious, and planet-like atmosphere and landed, a bit roughly it seems, on the surface of Saturn's largest moon \u2013Titan. Huygens' descent and landing gave mankind a glimpse of a world never before experience, not even by telescope, and yesterday marked the anniversary of this touchdown on the most remote alien surface ever visited by a landing probe.\n\nThe animation, showing the last part of the probe's 2.5 hour descent through Titan's athmosphere, was created by the European Space Agency (ESA) using data recorded by Huygen's instruments and taking into account Titan's atmospheric conditions, Sun and wind direction, the behavior of the parachute (with some artistic interpretation on the movement of the ropes after touchdown), and the dynamics of the landing itself. A photograph of the landing site returned from the probe is shown at the 1:25 mark in the video. Seen for the first time ever by human eyes, through the Huygens' camera, the view is of 'sand' and 'rocks'. The sand is composed of hydrocarbon aerosol particulates that have settled out of the atmosphere and the rocks are made of water ice.\n\nResults published in October of last year revealed that on first contact with Titan's surface the probe dug a hole 4.72 inches deep, then bounced and slid 10 to 15 inches across a flat surface. The probe then wobbled five times before coming to a standstill about 10 seconds after touchdown. A 'fluffy' dust-like material, most likely organic aerosols that are known to drizzle out of the Titan atmosphere, was thrown up around the probe following impact.\n\nCool Titan \u2013 Image credit: NASA\n\nTitan is a cold world enclosed by a thick, hazy atmosphere impenetrable by telescopes and cameras. Having an equatorial radius of 1,600 miles, it is second only to Jupiter's moon, Ganymede, as to largest moons in our solar system. Titan is not only bigger than our own Moon, its also bigger than the planet Mercury. (To understand the size of Titan consider that it is only 62 miles in diameter lesser than Ganymede, and Ganymede is so large, roughly 3\/4 the size of Mars, that according to NASA were it orbiting the Sun instead of orbiting Jupiter it would be easily classified as a planet.) The temperature at Titan's surface is about -289 degrees Fahrenheit. Titan is of great interest to scientists because it's the only moon in our solar system known to have clouds and a planet-like atmosphere. Titan's atmospheric pressure is about 60 percent greater than the Earth's, or roughly the same pressure found at the bottom of a swimming pool. The chemical composition of Titan's atmosphere suggests to scientists that it may consist of compounds similar to those present in the primordial days of the Earth's atmosphere. Titan's atmosphere is mostly nitrogen, like Earth's, but may contain much higher percentages of smog-like chemicals such as methane and ethane. The smog may be so thick that it actually rains 'gasoline-like' liquids. The organic nature of some of the chemicals found in Titan's atmosphere might indicate that this very COOL moon could harbor some form of life.\n\nTitan IVB rocket, with Cassini-Huygens on board, lifts off.\n\nThe Huygens Probe was named after Christiaan Huygens, a Dutch astronomer, mathematician, and physicist who discovered Titan in 1655. Huygens, the probe (not the astronomer!), hitched a 6.7 year interplanetary-cruise to Titan along with the NASA Cassini orbiter. On October 15, 1997, the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft was launched from Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral in Florida on a Titan IV-B\/Centaur launch vehicle. As tall as a 22-story building, the Titan\/Centaur rocket lifted off perfectly with the 13,200-pound Cassini-Huygens spacecraft on board. Navigation to Saturn, and specifically to Titan, was a very complicated process coordinated by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NASA, JPL). Since it was such a massive spacecraft no existing launch vehicle could have sent the craft directly to Saturn, so a technique called 'gravity assist' (or fly-bys) was used. Gravity assist maneuvers work because of the mutual gravitational pull between a moving planet and a spacecraft. The planet pulls on the spacecraft as it is flying past, but the spacecraft's own mass also pulls on the planet. This permits an exchange of energy. Mission designers planned multiple flybys of Venus, Earth, and Jupiter, using each planet's gravity to boost Cassini's sun-relative speed and send the spacecraft out to Saturn.\n\nFor most of the nearly 7 year journey the probe remained dormant, conserving power, except for bi-annual health checks. Because the distance from Earth is too great to provide signals and commands, this meant the programming of the probe had to be precise and work automatically so that valuable data can be communicated back to the Cassini orbiter for transmission back to Earth. A final health check was performed on December 25, 2004 prior to the probe's separation from the orbiter. Huygens was then detached to coast in space for 22 days en-route to Titan on its own with no systems active except for its wake-up timer. Remaining on the Cassini orbiter was the probe support equipment (PSE), including the electronics necessary to track the probe and to recover the data gathered during its descent. Then, just 45 minutes before reaching the atmosphere of Titan, timers woke up the Huygens probe, and its main mission phase, a parachute descent through a hazy alien atmosphere to touchdown on the largest expanse of un-before seen terrain left in the Solar System, was ready to begin.\n\nHuygens' batteries and resources were sized for a mission duration of 153 minutes \u2014 a maximum descent time of 2.5 hours, plus at least 3 additional minutes (and possibly a half hour or more) on Titan's surface. Early in the descent phase the probe's radio link was activated allowing Cassini to 'listen' to the probe for the next 3 hours which included the descent phase and the first thirty minutes after touchdown. Soon after the end of this three-hour communication window, Cassini's high-gain antenna (HGA) was turned away from Titan and towards Earth. Cassini remains in orbit around Saturn and will continue operations until 2017. The Cassini\u2013Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, ESA and The Italian Space Agency.\n\n10 images \u2014 And yes! It WAS difficult to whittle it down to ONLY 10. My goal was to include not only the year's most stunningly impressive astronomy images, or my opinion of such, but also to include Earth from space, celestial events, exciting milestones in space travel and exploration, humanity in space, and a glimpse of humanity's future in space. (I am aware that it's impossible to tell the entire story of a year in space in only 10 images, I am aware of the images I've omitted. And yes\u2026it was painful to decide on, and include, only 10!)\n\n1 video \u2014 Because I just couldn't help it, and because the message presented is perhaps the most personally inspiring message of 2012.\n\n87 links \u2014 But please don't try to count them! Enjoy as many as you have time and interest to. (I only counted them once and that number could be completely wrong.)\n\n74 tags \u2014 I needed coffee after tagging\u2026\n\nImages are presented in the order of occurrence and not based on preference. Clicking on an image title will present a larger view, in most cases, and clicking on image credit links will present additional information on the folks who brought them to us!\n\n****1****\n\nEarth From Space: A Southern Summer Bloom \u2013 On January 13, 2012 the European Space Agency released this Envisat image of a phytoplankton bloom swirling a figure 8 in the South Atlantic Ocean about 600 km east of the Falkland Islands. During summer in the southern hemisphere the ocean becomes rich in minerals from the mixing of surface waters with deeper waters. Phytoplankton depend on these minerals making blooms like this common during warm months. Blooms may cover hundreds of square kilometers and are easily visible in satellite images. Different types and quantities of phytoplankton exhibit different colors, such as the blues and greens seen here. These microscopic organisms are the base of the marine food chain, and play a huge role in the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and the production of oxygen in the oceans. A bloom may last several weeks, but the life span of any individual phytoplankton is rarely more than a few days. By helping to regulate the carbon cycle, phytoplankton are important to the global climate system, and get enough of them together and they create incredibly stunning satellite images! \u2013 Image credit: ESA\n\n****3****\n\nSpaceX Dragon Berthed to International Space Station \u2013 On May 25, 2012, with rays of sunshine and Earth's thin blue atmosphere serving as a backdrop, the SpaceX Dragon commercial cargo craft is berthed to the Earth-facing side of the ISS's Harmony node becoming the first commercial craft to accomplish this type of space operation. After a series of system tests, and a successful fly-under of the ISS, the Dragon capsule was cleared by NASA to approach the station. Dragon performed a series of intricate test maneuvers required to demonstrate the maneuvering and abort capability of the craft prior to approaching and moving into a 65-foot berthing box where it was grappled by NASA astronaut Don Pettit using the station's Canadarm robotic arm. On May 31, after successfully completing its mission, Dragon splashed down in the Pacific Ocean. Previously only four governments, the United States, Russia, Japan and the European Space Agency, had achieved this challenging technical feat. SpaceX then completed its first official resupply mission in October 2012. \u2013 Image credit: NASA\n\n****4****\n\nVenus Transits The Sun - On June 5, 2012, Hinode captured this amazing view of the transit of Venus just as the planet was fully entering The Sun's disk. The ring seen around the planet is caused by Venus's thick atmosphere scattering and bending the sunlight coming through the other side. If you missed this year's Venus Transit, no worries, you might can catch it again \u2014 in about 100 years. Transits of Venus are very rare among predictable celestial events and occur in pairs, eight years apart, which are themselves separated by more than a century. The last transit of Venus took place June 8, 2004 and the next pair of transits will occur in December 2117 and December 2125. Hinode is a joint mission between NASA and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency to study the connections of the sun's surface magnetism primarily in and around sunspots. \u2013 Image credit: JAXA\/NASA\/Lockheed Martin (Lead U.S. investigator for the Solar Optical Telescope.)\n\n****6****\n\nSunita Williams on Spacewalk \u2013 On September 5, 2012 NASA astronaut Sunita Williams, Expedition 32 flight engineer, sends a wave to team mate Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Aki Hoshide during a 6 hour, 28 minute spacewalk, the mission's third session of extravehicular activity (EVA). 47 year old Astronaut Williams, who also served as Commander of Expedition 33, holds the record for the longest space flight time among female space travelers, she also holds the record for number of spacewalks for a female, as well as most spacewalk time for a female. She is also proof that when looking for positive female role-models for our daughters, all we need do is look up. \u2013 Image credit: NASA\n\n****8****\n\nHubble Goes Deep, eXtremely deep \u2013 On September 25, 2012 astronomers presented a new, improved portrait of mankind's deepest-ever view of the universe. Called What did the first galaxies look like? To help answer this question, Hubble presents this deepest image of the universe ever taken in visible light. Pictured above, the XDF shows a sampling of some of the oldest galaxies ever seen, galaxies that formed 13 billion years ago when the universe was only a few percent of its present age. The XDF contains about 5,500 galaxies even within its smaller field of view. The faintest galaxies are one ten-billionth the brightness of what the human eye can see. This view was taken with Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and the infrared channel of its Wide Field Camera 3 (WFPC3). Astronomers the world over will likely study the XDF for years to come to better understand how stars and galaxies formed in the early universe. The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and the European Space Agency. \u2013 Image credit: NASA \/ESA; G. Illingworth, D. Magee, and P.

This image, beautifully illustrating the action, was captured by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in the 304 Angstrom wavelength of extreme ultraviolet light. The red-glowing looped material is plasma, a hot gas made of electrically charged hydrogen and helium. The prominence plasma flows along a tangled, twisted structure of magnetic fields generated by the sun's internal dynamo. Solar prominences (known as a filament when viewed against the solar disk) are anchored to the Sun's surface in the photosphere, and extend outwards into the Sun's hot outer atmosphere, called the corona. The corona extends more than a million kilometers from the Sun's surface with temperatures reaching two million degrees and is where solar winds originate. A prominence forms over timescales of about a day, and stable prominences can persist in the corona for several months, looping hundreds of thousands of miles into space. \u2013 Image credit: NASA\/SDO (Solar Dynamics Observatory)\n\n****10****\n\nOrion Spacecraft \u2013 On December 18, 2012 NASA, in its 'Image of The Day', featured this photograph of technicians as they prepare to fit a special fixture around an Orion capsule inside the high bay of the Operations & Checkout Building at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Construction on the first space-bound Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) began at NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, in September 2011. Engineering advances by NASA and its industry partners show exciting progress toward Exploration Flight Test-1 (EFT-1), promising that in two years human space exploration will make its biggest leap in more than four decades. The uncrewed EFT-1 mission, launching from Kennedy Space Center in 2014, will test the re-entry performance of the Orion capsule, which, according to NASA, is the most advanced spacecraft ever designed and which will carry astronauts farther into space than ever before, sustain astronauts during space travel, and provide safe re-entry from deep space and emergency abort capability.\n\n'These recent milestones are laying the foundation for our first flight test of Orion in 2014,' said Dan Dumbacher, deputy associate administrator for exploration systems development at NASA Headquarters in Washington. 'The work being done to prepare for the flight test is really a nationwide effort and we have a dedicated team committed to our goal of expanding the frontier of space.'\n\nOrion will be launched by NASA's Space Launch System (SLS), a heavy-lift rocket boasting an entirely new capability for human exploration beyond low Earth orbit. Flexible for launching spacecraft for crew and cargo missions, SLS promises to enable new exploration missions and expand human presence across the solar system. \u2013 Image credit: NASA\n\n2013 \u2013 ?\n\nI'm looking forward to an equally amazing, stunning, mind-bending, and inspiring year in 2013. I hope everyone has a GREAT NEW YEAR!\n\nFor this stunning image, taken during its 174th orbit around the gas giant and while the spacecraft was in Saturn's shadow, Cassini's cameras are purposely turned towards both the planet as well as the Sun giving us this beautifully back-lit view of Saturn and its rings. In addition to its visual splendor this very-high-phase viewing geometry allows scientists to study ring and atmosphere phenomena not easily seen at a lower phase. This view looks toward the non-illuminated side of the rings from about 19 degrees below the ring plane.\n\nAlso nicely captured in the image are two of Saturn's 53 known moons; Tethys, and one of my personal favorite of ALL moons, second only to our Moon, Enceladus! Both moons can be spotted on the left side of the planet, below the rings. Enceladus is closer to the rings; Tethys is below and to the left.\n\nImages taken using infrared, red and violet spectral filters were combined to create this enhanced-color view. The images were obtained with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Oct. 17, 2012 at a distance of approximately 500,000 miles from Saturn. Image scale at Saturn is about 30 miles per pixel.

Expedition 34's crew; NASA astronaut Tom Marshburn, Canadian Space Agency astronaut Chris Hadfield, and Russian cosmonaut Roman Romanenko are now safely in orbit and will dock with the station's Rassvet module at 9:12 a.m. Friday, Dec. 21. Congratulations to everyone involved in this mission, and a great big Thank You to Johnson Space Center for keeping those of us on this side of the planet, and who woke early to witness the event, informed via live coverage on NASA TV. Live coverage of Friday morning's docking begins at 7:30 a.m. And I KNOW where I'll be at that time!\n\nThe above image of a Perseid meteor was captured on August 13, 2011 by NASA astronaut Ron Garan while aboard the International Space Station. From his perspective, orbiting at an altitude of 380 kilometers, Garan captures the Perseid meteors streaking below. Fortunately for those of us here on Earth, one doesn't need to be in orbit to fully enjoy the Perseid meteor shower and this weekend offers the perfect opportunity to do so.\n\nThe Perseid meteor shower , which has been observed for about 2000 years, occurs annually in late July and early August as the Earth passes through the dusty particle stream remains of the comet Swift-Tuttle. The particles, traveling at tens of thousands of miles an hour, are small bits of interplanetary rock and debris vaporizing high in Earth's upper atmosphere and igniting 30 to 80 miles above the ground. The meteor shower appears to radiate out of the constellation Perseus, giving us the name: Perseid meteor shower.\n\nThis event is best viewed in dark skies, roughly 40 miles from the light pollution of big cities. Also, meteor showers are best viewed without telescopes or binoculars as your eyes provide a larger field of view. If this is not cool enough on its own, this year's Perseid meteor shower will be assisted by a waning crescent Moon..and for some added awe Jupiter, Venus, and the Moon will be gathering just as The Perseid reaches it's peak. The video below provides tips on where and when to view, as well as information on getting involved through NASA's Citizen Science!\n\nEnjoy! And remember: alcohol interferes with the eye's dark adaption as well as visual perception\u2026but I'm sure a Shiner Bock or two won't hurt too much!!\n\nThe above image is an artist's conception illustration of a storm of comets taking place in the Eta Corvi planetary system. Eta Corvi, in the constellation of Corvus, is a white-yellow main sequence dwarf star located about 59.4 light years from our own Sun and visible to the naked eye in the northern sky.\n\nEvidence for this comet storm came last year from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, whose infrared detectors picked up indications that comets were recently torn to shreds after colliding with a rocky body. Spitzer detected the infrared glow of a band of dust three times as far from Eta Corvi as Earth is from the sun. Scientists at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory analyzed the spectrum of light from this glow and found that it contains signatures of water ice, organics, and rock -the key ingredients of comets. In the artist's conception above a giant comet is shown crashing into a rocky planet with the resulting impact flinging ice and carbon rich dust into space, while also smashing water and organics into the surface of the planet. Eta Corvi is indicated to the left, with more comets streaming toward it. The Spitzer observations suggest this rocky planet, whose existence has yet to be confirmed though other methods, to be located within Eta Corvi's habitable zone.\n\nThese observations from Spritzer is the first for such a comet storm seen around another star. Eta Corvi, at about one billion years old, is about the right age to experience a hail of comets similar to the Late Heavy Bombardment in our own solar system which took place in a period spanning 4.3 and 3.8 billion years ago, and which was triggered by the migrating positions of Jupiter and Saturn. The resulting incoming comets bombarded our inner planets and scarred our moon. Some astrobiologists believe these comets carried water and organics to Earth with life here emerging suggestively soon after the Late Heavy Bombardment ended.\n\nThis video is a segment of Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson's March 26 talk on Cosmic Quandaries in St. Petersburg, Florida. Though the entire talk is well over an hour long, I found this particular segment, featuring Tyson delivering some incredibly interesting thoughts on the nature of the universe and our place within it, to be both engaging and exciting. I recently finished reading Dr. Tyson's Space Chronicles in which he goes into greater detail on some of the subjects mentioned in this video, as well as his views on NASA, the future of space travel, and America's role in that future\u2026all subjects I find very interesting. If you enjoy the video, I highly recommend Space Chronicles.\n\nIf you've been hanging out anywhere near a calendar, a Gregorian calendar that is, then you're well aware that 2012 is a Leap Year, and that today, February 29, is a Leap Day. Not wanting to miss the opportunity to post on Leap Day, knowing that this would be my only shot for another 4 years to do so, I woke early to begin my research.\n\nSince Leap Day is an Astronomical event I decided to first go right to an expert in this field, the amazingly clever and brilliant Phil Plait over at Bad Astronomy. Plait begins his explanation of Leap Year by telling us that we have two basic units of time: the day and the year. He explains that of the measurements we use daily, these are the only two based on concrete physical events: the time it takes for the Earth to spin once on its axis, and the time it takes to go around the Sun. Okay Phil, so far I'm with you. He then goes into detail concerning the mathematics involved. It's at this point my eyes roll back into my head, my brain goes into overload, and I retreat to the kitchen for another cup of coffee. Math is not fun, especially for those of us who do not get it. I'm convinced it's not even fun for those who DO get it. They only say it's fun to further piss off and frustrate those of us who don't get it. I base my evidence of this from having dated a physicist who would occasionally talk in his sleep concerning such matters. However, if you're into math, or want to be completely amused while being schooled in all things Astronomical, I strongly suggest a visit to Bad Astronomy.\n\nNot being one to allow something silly such as math to deter me of my enjoyment of weird things, I continued my research into to this bissextile event. One weird thing I learned is that there is actually a Leap Year Cocktail, no kidding. It was invented at London's Savoy Hotel and contains 2 ounces gin, \u00bd ounce Grand Marnier, \u00bd ounce sweet vermouth, and \u00bd ounce fresh lemon juice. Not being a gin fan, I'm thinking this would probably be tasty if one were to substitute the gin with vodka, and it's definitely giving me ideas for my later Leap Night festivities. I should point out that if you're born on Leap Day and 2012 is the year you become of legal drinking age\u2026no Leap Year Cocktail for you! Well, not until after midnight. Sorry, but most states do not consider you 'legal' until March 1st. However, since you were born on Leap Day, which is known as a 'Leapster', I'm sure you're use to being unfairly discriminated against by only receiving birthday gifts once every 4 years. You'll learn to appreciate this whole 'only having a birthday once every 4 years' as you get older and realize that birthdays are about as welcome as visits from distant relatives\u2026.in which case, once every 4 years is plenty. Also, having to wait till midnight for a drink is not nearly as bad as if you were in jail on this day. Really?! An extra day?!\n\nAnother fun fact about Leap Day is that it's the one day when it's, traditionally, socially acceptable for a woman to pop the question to a man. While this is somewhat outdated and may be considered a bit sexist, to anyone anal enough to think it so, it IS still fun. I only offer this as a heads-up to any single guys out there. If Joan at the office has been giving you the eye lately, maybe today is the day to call out sick. *cough, cough*\n\nA not-so-fun Leap Day fact, on this particular Leap Day, 56 countries are recognizing today as Rare Disease Day. Are these diseases so rare they only require one day of research every 4 years? I'll leave you to write your own witty response to this not-so-fun fact\u2026.\n\nHowever you enjoy your Leap Day, remember the count down starts again tomorrow\u2026and according to Phil Plait, you remember Phil, Mr Math from Bad Astronomy, we have 1461 days till we get another one. This is, of course, unless we get wiped out by the Scary-Freaking-Asteroid later this year. This, however, is a theory, I'm certain, Phil does not subscribe to"}

{"text":"With a traditional optical telescope, the space between stars and galaxies (the background) is completely dark. However, a sufficiently sensitive radio telescope shows a faint background glow, almost exactly the same in all directions, that is not associated with any star, galaxy, or other object. This glow is strongest in the microwave region of the radio spectrum. The CMB's serendipitous discovery in 1964 by American radio astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson[2] was the culmination of work initiated in the 1940s, and earned them the 1978 Nobel Prize.\n\nCosmic background radiation is well explained as radiation left over from an early stage in the development of the universe, and its discovery is considered a landmark test of the Big Bang model of the universe. When the universe was young, before the formation of stars and planets, it was smaller, much hotter, and filled with a uniform glow from its white-hot fog of hydrogen plasma. As the universe expanded, both the plasma and the radiation filling it grew cooler. When the universe cooled enough, protons and electrons could form neutral atoms. These atoms could no longer absorb the thermal radiation, and the universe became transparent instead of being an opaque fog. Cosmologists refer to the time period when neutral atoms first formed as the recombination epoch, and the event shortly after of photons starting to travel freely through space rather than constantly scattering with electrons and protons in plasma is referred to as photon decoupling. The photons that existed at the time of photon decoupling have been propagating ever since, though growing fainter and less energetic, since the expansion of space causes their wavelength to increase over time (and wavelength is inversely proportional to energy according to Planck's relation). This is the source for the alternate term relic radiation. The surface of last scattering refers to the set of points in space at the right distance from us so that we would just now be receiving photons originally emitted from those points at the time of photon decoupling.\n\nPrecise measurements of cosmic background radiation are critical to cosmology, since any proposed model of the universe must explain this radiation. The CMBR has a thermal black body spectrum at a temperature of 2.725 K,[3].\n\nThe glow is very nearly uniform in all directions, but the tiny remaining variations show a very specific pattern equal to that expected of a fairly uniformly distributed hot gas that has expanded to the current size of the universe. In particular, the spatial power spectrum (how much difference is observed versus how far apart the regions are on the sky) contains small anisotropies, or irregularities, which vary with the size of the region examined. They have been measured in detail, and match what would be expected if small thermal variations, generated by quantum fluctuations of matter in a very tiny space, had expanded to the size of the observable universe we see today. This is still a very active field of study, with scientists seeking both better data (for example, the Planck spacecraft) and better interpretations of the initial conditions of expansion"}

{"text":"Enigmatic star could emerge from its gassy cocoon\n\nThe star Eta Carinae (Eta Car), once one of the brightest in the southern sky, has long been shrouded in mystery. After a huge outburst of gas that occurred more than 150 years ago, it has largely been hidden by a dense cloud of dust--a strong indicator of sporadic eruptions.\n\nNow, Eta Car, which sits in our part of the Milky Way some 2,300 parsecs (7,500 light years) from the Sun, is puzzling researchers and theorists all over again. A U.S.-based team has recorded a steep, inexplicable drop in its stellar wind--the outflow of gas from the star--measured as a change in the emission lines, or lines in the spectrum caused by the emission of light at particular wavelengths.\n\nResearchers from the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis recorded the dip from the eruptive, luminous variable star using data from the Gemini South Telescope in Chile and the Hubble Space Telescope. Their results are detailed in a paper accepted for publication in Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\n\"The collapse in the emission lines seemed almost too rapid and drastic to believe,\" says Kris Davidson, an astrophysicist at the University of Minnesota and a co-author of the latest study.\n\nIn January, Davidson's colleague and the study's lead author Andrea Mehner first noticed the effect in data from the Gemini South Telescope. The team then confirmed Mehner's findings through observations using Hubble.\n\nTheir findings have been independently verified by astronomers affiliated with Stony Brook University in New York and the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.\n\nSupernova impostor\n\nThe root of Eta Car's oddness lies in the supernova-like eruption event that began in the late 1830s and lasted for some 20 years.\n\nHuge stars like Eta Car can erupt for reasons that Davidson says are about 95 percent \"mysterious.\" One theory is that once these massive stars near the end of their short lives--after some 2 million to 3 million years--perturbations in their cores may set off sporadic \"supernova impostor\" eruptions.\n\nSupernova impostors are only one-hundredth the brightness of normal supernovae, but the eruptions can last for decades. And unlike normal supernovae, these impostors survive their eruptions. Eta Car, which is five million times more luminous than the Sun, was the first such impostor detected, although about a dozen are known to astronomers today.\n\nDuring its mid-nineteenth-century eruption, Eta Car lost about ten times the mass of the Sun. Although this loss was equivalent to only 10 percent of its mass, the star's outer 50 percent was ejected. As a result, the star has still not returned to thermal and rotational equilibrium. Since 1858, it has been observed only as a massive gaseous outflow, losing the equivalent of one Jupiter-mass in gas per year.\n\nBefore 1700, Davidson notes that Eta Car was a fourth-magnitude star, recorded by astronomer Edmond Halley and only a few others. By 1843, it was almost as bright as Sirius before suddenly fading in 1858.\n\n\"After a supernova impostor explosion,\" says Davidson, \"the star is in a state [of disequilibrium] that none of the theorists' computer codes are set up to deal with.\"\n\nNathan Smith, a postdoctoral researcher in astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved with the observations, says that Eta Car is a \"key object for understanding the instability of the most massive stars.\"\n\nSmith adds that these eruptions may provide glimpses of what to expect from the Universe's first stars, called population III stars.\n\n.\n\nThe Minnesota team notes that this would finally enable contemporary observations of the radius and surface temperature of Eta Car, which is estimated to have the mass of well over 100 Suns.\n\n5 Comments\n\nThis may be a silly question, but... The stellar wind of Eta Car has dropped drastically, so it may emerge from its gassy coccoon, because - what? The current cloud will fall back in? Be dispersed without fresh gas being ejected? I can imagine a lot of astronomers cannot wait to see the giant 'in the nude' as soon as they have a chance. I know I'd love to see images published, too.\n\nAcoyauh - The best indication may be found in the quoted description of the current state of the star's visibility: \"We still can't see the star itself,\" says Davidson, \"but only an opaque dense wind outflow surrounded by muck--really bright ejecta.\"\n\nand the stated expectations: \".\"\n\nI'd guess that it's expected that the ejecta momentum will continue unabated, eventually clearing the surrounding 'muck'. However, it may simply disperse into a less dense, obscuring cloud of gasses...\n\nAfter all this activity, though, I'd be very surprised if the star eventually appeared the same as it did 300 years ago to Halley, but then we may not be able to tell, having no earlier photographs.\n\nAcoyauh - Good idea, actually looking at it (it would have been nice to have included it in the online article). It appears to me that the Homunculus nebula is analogous to the polar expulsion jets, or even gamma ray bursts, of an actual supernova. I'll bet that the high velocity polar 'jet' facing us clears its nearer leg of the Homunculus as it stops ejecting gaseous molecules, but I guess we'd have to wait around 10 years to find"}

{"text":"Dark energy found stifling growth in Universe\n\nScience Centric\n17 December 2008 10:30 GMT\n\nFor the first time, astronomers have clearly seen the effects of 'dark energy' on the most massive collapsed objects in the Universe using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. By tracking how dark energy has stifled the growth of galaxy clusters and combining this with previous studies, scientists have obtained the best clues ever about what dark energy is and what the destiny of the Universe could be.\n\nThis work, which took years to complete, is independent from other methods of dark energy research such as supernovas. These new X-ray results provide a crucial independent test of dark energy, long sought by scientists, which depends on how gravity competes with accelerated expansion in the growth of cosmic structures. Techniques based on distance measurements, such as supernova work, do not have this special sensitivity.\n\nScientists think that dark energy is a form of repulsive gravity that now dominates the Universe, though there is no clear picture of what it actually is. Understanding the nature of dark energy is one of the biggest problems in science. Possibilities include the cosmological constant, equivalent to the energy of empty space. Other possibilities include a modification in general relativity on the largest scales, or a more general physical field.\n\nTo help decide between these options, a whole new way of looking at dark energy is required, accomplished here by observing how cosmic acceleration affects the growth of galaxy clusters over time.\n\n'This result could be described as 'arrested development of the Universe,'' said Alexey Vikhlinin of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) in Cambridge, Mass., who led the research. 'Whatever is forcing the expansion of the Universe to speed up is also forcing its development to slow down.'\n\nVikhlinin and his colleagues used Chandra to observe the hot gas in dozens of galaxy clusters, which are the largest collapsed objects in the Universe. Some of these clusters are relatively nearby and others are over halfway across the Universe.\n\nThe results show that the increase in mass of the galaxy clusters with time aligns with a Universe dominated by dark energy. It is more difficult for objects like galaxy clusters to grow when space is stretched, as caused by dark energy. Vikhlinin and his team see this effect clearly in their data.\n\nCrucially, the results are remarkably consistent with those from the distance measurements, revealing general relativity works as expected on large scales.\n\n'For years, scientists have wanted to start testing how gravity works on large scales and now we finally have,' said William Forman, a co- author of the study also from SAO. 'This is a test that general relativity could have failed.'\n\nWhen combined with other methods - supernovas, the study of the cosmic microwave background (including WMAP), and the distribution of galaxies - this new X-ray result gives scientists the best clues to date on the properties of dark energy.\n\nThe study strengthens the evidence that dark energy is the cosmological constant. Although it is the leading candidate to explain dark energy, theoretical work suggests it should be about 1 followed by 120 zeroes times larger than observed. Therefore, alternatives to general relativity, such as theories involving hidden dimensions, are being explored.\n\n'Putting all of this data together gives us the strongest evidence yet that dark energy is the cosmological constant, or in other words, that 'nothing weighs something,'' said Vikhlinin. 'A lot more testing is needed, but so far Einstein's theory is looking as good as ever.'\n\nThese results have consequences for predicting the ultimate fate of the Universe. If dark energy is explained by the cosmological constant, the expansion of the Universe will continue to accelerate and the Milky Way and its neighbour galaxy, Andromeda, will never merge with the Virgo cluster. This means that a hundred billion years from now, all other galaxies will ultimately disappear from the Milky Way's view and eventually the local superclusters of galaxies will also disintegrate.\n\nThe work by Vikhlinin and his colleagues will be published in two separate papers in the 10 February issue of The Astrophysical Journal. NASA's Marshall Space Flight Centre in Huntsville, Ala., manages the Chandra program for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory controls Chandra's science and flight operations from Cambridge, Mass."}

{"text":"simulation shows superheated plasma swirling around the black hole at the center of our galaxy.\n\nBy Alan Boyle, Science Editor, NBC News\n\nAstronomers are setting up a virtual grav network of radio telescopes scattered around the Southern Hemisphere has produced the best-ever view of cosmic jets erupting from a supermassive black hole at the center of another galaxy.\n\nThe new image shows a region of space less than 4.2 light-years across at the heart of Centaurus A, 12 million light-years away in the constellation Centaurus (of course). The galaxy, also known as NGC 5128 is anchored by a black hole as massive as 55 million suns. It's a huge radio source. In fact, if our eyes could see radio waves, Centaurus A would look nearly 20 times as big as the full moon, due to the giant lobes of radio-emitting matter spreading out from the galaxy itself.\n\nThe matter is streaming into the lobes via the particle jets that emanate from the black hole.\n\n\"These jets arise as infalling matter approaches the black hole, but we don't yet know the details of how they form and maintain themselves,\" Cornelia M\u00fcller, a doctoral student at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany, said in a NASA image advisory released today.\n\nM\u00fcller is the lead author of a study about the jets, appearing in the June issue of Astronomy and Astrophysics. She and her colleagues targeted Centaurus A with a network of nine radio telescopes in Africa, South America and Australia, known collectively as the Tracking Active Galactic Nuclei with Austral Milliarcsecond Interferometry project, or TANAMI. The telescopes joined forces to zoom in on the heart of the galaxy.\n\nNASA\n\nLeft: The giant elliptical galaxy NGC 5128 is the radio source known as Centaurus A. Vast radio-emitting lobes (shown as orange in this optical\/radio composite) extend nearly a million light-years from the galaxy. Right: The radio image from the TANAMI project provides the sharpest-ever view of a supermassive black hole's jets. This view reveals the inner 4.16 light-years of the jet and counterjet, a span less than the distance between our sun and the nearest star. Undetected between the jets is the galaxy's 55-million-solar-mass black hole.\n\n\"Advanced computer techniques allow us to combine data from the individual telescopes to yield images with the sharpness of a single giant telescope, one nearly as large as Earth itself,\" Roopesh Ojha of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center explained.\n\nThe radio image shows features as small as 15 light-days across, which makes it the highest-resolution view of galactic jets ever made. Studying the jets in such detail should help astronomers figure out how they form \u2014 which would make M\u00fcller very happy.\n\nAn artist's concept of what a future telescope might see in looking at the black hole at the heart of the galaxy M87. Clumpy gas swirls around the black hole in an accretion disk, feeding the central beast. The black area at center is the black hole itself, defined by the event horizon, beyond which nothing can escape.\n\nBy Alan Boyle, Science Editor, NBC News\n\nAstronomers say they've come up with the definitive estimate for the mass and size of the biggest black hole in our celestial neighborhood, using a method that can now be applied to even bigger monsters beyond.\n\nIt's long been known that the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87 was a big one, but over the years, there's been some debate over just how big it was. Some of the estimates have ranged down toward a mass equivalent to 3 billion suns. In 2009, however, Karl Gebhardt of the University of Texas' McDonald Observatory took a fresh look at old data and came up with an estimate of 6.4 billion suns.\n\n\"That had a large uncertainty,\" Gebhardt told me. Today, Gebhardt and his colleagues announced a new estimate that's based on high-accuracy observations from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii as well as the McDonald Observatory. The bottom line: M87's black hole is equal to 6.6 billion solar masses, plus or minus 400 million solar masses.\n\nNot bad for a galaxy that's a mere 50 milllion light-years away.\n\n\"It is remarkable to have a galaxy of this size and a black hole of this mass so close to us,\" Gebhardt told journalists at the American Astronomical Society's winter meeting in Seattle. \"It really is in our backyard.\"\n\nThe study has been accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal.\n\nHow they did it Gebhardt's team used an instrument on the Gemini telescope known as the Near-Infrared Field Spectrograph to measure the speed of the stars orbiting the black hole. The telescope couldn't spot the individual stars \u2014 but thanks to adaptive optics, a technique that compensates for atmospheric distortions, the spectral measurements were fine enough to give the astronomers a sense of the average speed for bunches of stars.\n\nOne of Gebhardt's colleagues, graduate student Jeremy Murphy, used a different instrument on McDonald's Harlan J. Smith Telescope to track the motions of stars on the outskirts of M87. The VIRUS-P spectrograph gathered light from a \"huge chunk of the sky\" and come up with an estimate for the galaxy's total mass, including the mass of the dark matter halo surrounding the visible parts of the galaxy. The total came to 5.7 trillion solar masses, Murphy said.\n\nKarl Gebhardt, an astronomer at the University of Texas at Austin, talks about the VIRUS-P instrument.\n\nAll those observations were fed into a computer model, which spit out the black hole mass of 6.6 billion suns, spread across a distance of about 20 billion kilometers. \"This is three times the size of Pluto's orbit,\" said Gebhardt, who went on to note that M87's monster \"could swallow our solar system whole.\"\n\nGebhardt said his team's efforts demonstrated that it was possible to weigh black holes in distant galaxies by measuring stellar motions with high-resolution instruments. \"It gives us the confidence to be able to probe the galaxies that are much farther away,\" he said.\n\nOne such galaxy, 3.5 billion light-years away, is said to contain a black hole that's 18 billion times as massive as our sun. That would make even M87's black hole look like a pipsqueak. But the current estimate is based on indirect observations. Gebhardt would love to use more direct methods to confirm the estimate.\n\n\"It gives me fodder for future observing proposals,\" he told me.\n\nTo see a black hole As any science-fiction fan knows, black holes are strange objects so dense that nothing, not even light, can escape its gravitational pull within a boundary known as the \"event horizon.\" They may result from the catastrophic collapse of a dying star, or they may develop as the supermassive core of an entire galaxy. Astronomers have observed jets and bubbles of radiation that appear to emanate from black holes, and they've even spotted the whirling disks of hot material that surround active black holes. But no one has yet seen the black holes themselves.\n\nGebhardt would love to see a black hole, or at least the shadow of its event horizon, and he thinks M87 is the best candidate for that because it's so massive. Our own Milky Way's central black hole is much closer, of course \u2014 but it's also much smaller, weighing in at a mere 4 million solar masses. (That's 1 percent of the margin of error for the mass estimate of M87.)\n\nBelieve it or not, some astronomers already have a plan to look for the Milky Way's black hole, as part of a project called the Event Horizon Telescope. The plan calls for outfitting the radio telescopes of the Very Long Baseline Interferometer with submillimeter-wave receivers, which just might be able to produce an image of the event horizon when they're linked together.\n\n\"It's probably two or three years that we'll need to get there,\" Gebhardt said. And when the Event Horizon Telescope is ready to go, he hopes that M87 will be on the list of targets. \"It is by far our cleanest and best case for a black hole,\" he said.\n\nOther black hole news from the AAS meeting:\n\nCaltech\n\nThese images show one of the newly discovered black-hole pairs. On the left is an image from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. On the right is a Keck image that resolves two active galactic nuclei, which are powered by massive black holes.\n\n\u2022 Astronomers have discovered 16 close-knit pairs of supermassive black holes in merging galaxies, using imagery from the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Caltech astronomer S. George Djorgovski said in a news release that the close pairs \"are a missing link between the wide binary systems seen previously and the merging black-hole pairs at even smaller separations that we believe must be there.\" The 16 pairs were found among an array of 50 targets checked with the Keck 10-meter telescopes, with adaptive optics once again playing a crucial role.\n\nThe observations support the view that structures in the universe are assembled \"through a hierarchy of mergers,\" Djorgovski told reporters. He joked that it would have been more interesting if the results contradicted theory, \"but unfortunately, our understanding seems to be correct.\"\n\n\u2022 Another team of astronomers observed the \"heartbeats\" seen in the light from a black hole system, using the space-based Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. The study focused on GRS 1915+105, a binary system in the Milky Way galaxy thought to contain a black hole 14 times more massive than the sun. X-ray pulses emanated from the disk of material surrounding the black hole approximately every 50 seconds. By analyzing variations in the X-ray heartbeat, the astronomers could trace the flow of material into the black hole \u2014 and away from it.\n\n\"Each heartbeat blasts a new blob of material into the line of sight,\" Harvard's Joey Neilsen explained. \"Ninety-five percent of the material coming in from the outside is actually being blown away by the black hole wind.\" The matter blown away from the accretion disk every day amounts to a third of the mass of the moon, Neilsen said.\n\nZoom in on the GRS 1915 black hole, courtesy of the Chandra X-ray Observatory.\n\nThis track is an example of simulated data modeled for the ATLAS detector on the Large Hadron Collider. These tracks would be produced if a miniature black hole was created in a proton-proton collision.\n\nBy Alan Boyle, Science Editor, NBC News\n\nPhysicists using Europe's Large Hadron Collider say they haven't seen any microscopic black holes yet \u2014 and perhaps they never will. The most they can say right now is that if they exist, the exotic objects would have to have a mass of more than 3.5 trillion electron volts.\n\nSome flavors of string theory have suggested that micro-black holes could be created at the LHC if the universe has \"rolled-up\" dimensions in addition to the three space dimensions plus time with which we're familiar. In such a universe, the force of gravity might become dramatically stronger at very small distances, and colliding particles occasionally could create an energy density large enough to produce a black hole for just an instant of time.\n\n\"In order for the LHC to produce some of these black holes, we really have to go beyond the normal theory of gravity,\" he said at the time. \"We have to assume that there are extra dimensions. By the way, there are many theories that have extra dimensions. Not all of them would give rise to black holes at the LHC. It's only highly fine-tuned ones that make this possible.\"\n\nSo it's not correct to say that the lack of black holes suggests string theory is a failure. In fact, string theory covers so many possibilities that another theoretical physicist, Arizona State University's Lawrence Krauss, jokes that it's a \"theory of anything\" rather than a theory of everything. But the latest findings do eliminate some of the theoretical models, which is a useful exercise.\n\nThe current state of things is described in a draft paper submitted to Physics Letters this week by the team analyzing data from the LHC's Compact Muon Solenoid detector, or CMS. It's also summarized in a statement from CERN. The CMS collaboration is due to take much more data next year, and Nature's Geoff Brumfiel quotes CMS spokesperson Guido Tonelli as saying the LHC should be able to exclude the creation of black holes almost entirely by the end of the next run.\n\nFor years, the LHC's critics have worried that microscopic black holes would somehow spin out of control, despite physicists' reassurances that such a doomsday scenario runs counter to theory as well as observations. The latest findings demonstrate that it's harder to create a black hole than some theoretical physicists may have thought. But the bottom line remains the same: DON'T PANIC"}

{"text":"In the news this month: pulsar irregularities\n\nAfter massive stars like Eta Carinae explode, the object left behind is thought to be either a neutron star or a black hole, depending on the final mass of the progenitor star. Pulsars are neutron stars that have strong magnetic fields and behave somewhat like cosmic lighthouses, projecting beams of radio emission into space as they spin. Studying the pulses of radiation as the beams sweep past the Earth can provide valuable information on the physics of these extreme objects, allowing astronomers to probe physics under conditions which are not possible to create in a terrestrial laboratory. While pulsars are known to be extremely accurate natural clocks, their pulse rates are very stable over time, there are however unexplained deviations from the expected spin rate, a phenomenon known as timing noise. Now, a team led by Andrew Lyne at the University of Manchester, have uncovered a mechanism which could explain this noise.\n\nOver long timescales, the rate at which a pulsar spins (known as the spin down rate) decreases slowly in a predictable way due to the conversion of rotational energy into photons. By studying a large number of pulsars repeatedly over 40 years, the team found that the deviations from the expected spin down rate were actually quasi-periodic on timescales between one and ten years, and that several other pulsar characteristics may be linked to the same phenomenon. One particular pulsar, known as B1931+24, only displays radio pulses intermittently, and long term study showed that it also had two different spin down rates: its spin rate decreased faster when the radio signal was detectable.\n\nThe team analysed the data on a large sample of pulsars and found a further seventeen which show evidence of quasi-periodic spin down rates, many of which also show variations in the shape of the pulse profile. The authors suggest that the likely explanation is that the pulsar's magnetosphere is switching between two distinct states. Exactly what causes the pulsar to switch between states is not yet known, but if the changes can be accurately modeled then the timing noise can be reduced, and astronomers will find it easier to compensate for errors in pulsar \"clocks\" in highly sensitive experiments designed to detect gravitational waves.\n\nThis blog post is a news story from the Jodcast, aired in the July 2010 edition\"I saw the old lady was fence stumbled, landing two steps on the plump fall and I immediately stopped the last arm, has not helped up, touch anywhere 'ouch ouch' is called, so did not think to call the ambulance dial 120 car. can pick up the phone thought the old lady's first words, 'I'm on the road to allow the car to hit the ... ...'. \"Xuyun He said,\" I was stupid, but still did not think things will be busy then large. \"\n\ndoes not charge in France; as UGG Boots are so distinctive from other Boots. and a few brands of gunks and goops that are hard to Classic Short Uggs & Chocolate making Gershman an international expert on retail and UGG Classic Mini Boots in Grey because they not merely wear the responsibleness of creating pretty, you want to Classic Argyle Knit Uggs & Black this movement to put on a twain of cheap uggs cm high heels;\n\n* required fields NOTE: Your email address will not be displayed on the website.

{"text":"^ That's a section of galaxy M83 in a composite image of Chandra X-ray and optical data. The large, deep pink spot at the top middle is a new ultraluminous X-ray source, or \"ULX\"; these are objects that give off more gamma ray radiation than typical binary systems, or \"as much energy in X-rays as a million suns radiate at all wavelengths.\" In the case of the most powerful ULXs, the suggestion is that one of the binary partners is a very large black hole, on the order of 40 to 100 solar masses; the largest known stellar mass black hole in our galaxy, by comparison, is more like 15 solar masses.\n\nBut there are a few even more unusual things about this particular ULX. One is its high variability: \"the source had increased in X-ray brightness by at least 3,000 times [between 2000 and 2010] and has since become the brightest X-ray source in M83,\" says NASA. The other is the age of its stellar companion, which is thought to be a red giant, about 500 million years old; in a binary system, the two bodies are usually about the same age, having formed from the same source, so the implication is that this black hole is about 500 million years old. Other ULXs before this one had hot, bright young blue stars for companions, so this is the first time astronomers have seen evidence for a large stellar mass black hole this old.\n\nThis suggests that there could be many more old black holes drifting around, which I suppose most astronomers would predict--given that very large stars almost invariably form black holes at the end of their relatively brief lives, in theory--but they're usually darned hard to spot, so they got a bit lucky that they were looking when this one started eating some material and sending out X-rays (and that its jet was pointing directly at us, of course). I tend to think that once a good way of detecting the quiet black holes is hit upon, we'll find that there are oodles and oodles of them, young and old, pretty much everywhere stars have been."}

{"text":"Stars, such as our Sun, may appear to be ever-present sources of heat and light, but they are highly dynamic objects which will eventually reach the end of their evolutionary paths and die. Although the death of the Sun will be comparatively quiet, more massive stars (with masses greater than 8 times that of the Sun) can be ripped apart when their iron core collapses to an extremely dense stellar remnant known as a neutron star and a shock wave driven by the production of a huge number of particles called neutrinos blasts away the outer layers of material in a supernova explosion. This ejected material does not go to waste however and the elements created, such as carbon and oxygen, provide the Universe with the building blocks it needs for the formation of rocky planets like Earth and all living things upon it.\n\nThe process outlined above will lead to only one of the different types of known supernovae, called core-collapse supernovae. These core-collapse type events can then be further divided into sub-classes (type Ib\/c, type II) depending on the mass of the progenitor star which explodes. One of the most luminous type II explosions was recorded at 100 billion times the brightness of the Sun and could easily be identified despite being 4.7 billion lightyears away. A second type, a thermonuclear supernova (type Ia), is thought to occur when a dead remnant of a star like the Sun known as a white dwarf star which happens to be in a close binary system accretes matter from its companion, pushing it past its upper mass limit (the Chandrasekhar limit) of 1.4 solar masses. In the last two years incredibly bright supernovae (100 times brighter than an average SNe) have been discovered which may require a new physical explanation for their luminosity and observations from the Pan-STARRS 1 survey (PS1) will help further our understanding of these ultra-luminous events and better define the very interesting physics which leads to them.\n\nPre-supernova (top) and post-supernova (bottom) PS1 images showing the discoveries of a supernova with a clear host (left) and a hostless supernova (an orphan, right).\n\nThe basic discovery and classification of supernovae is a two-part process. Difference imaging, where nightly images are subtracted from a previously obtained reference image to highlight any objects with a variable flux, is used to detect these very characteristic transients. This is essentially an interstellar spot-the-difference and some examples of PS1 images containing supernovae can be seen in the images to the left. After the initial discovery of a transient that is thought to be a supernovae, follow up spectroscopy must be done in order to confirm the nature of the variable object (it might be simply a variable star or an active galactic nucleus). If it is a supernovae, the spectra can be used to determine elements involved in the explosion and thus deduce its type. By compiling large datasets of confirmed events, the rates of different species of supernovae can be estimated giving us invaluable information on stellar populations within various forms of galaxies and the intergalactic medium.\n\nUp until now, both professional and amateur searches for supernovae have concentrated their efforts on large galaxies with high star formation rates to ensure a large number of successful discoveries. The PS1 survey is not a dedicated search for transients but hosts a multitude of varied science projects meaning that the Hawai'i based, 1.8m telescope, with its 7 square degree field of view focused onto the world's largest CCD (1.4 gigapixels), surveys massive, unbiased portions of the sky every night. This results in supernovae discoveries in unexpected places as demonstrated in the right hand set of images above. This type of transient is known as an Orphan due to its apparent lack of association with any other object. The object may very well have a host galaxy, but one that is simply too faint to be imaged with the PS1 survey suggesting that it is either at a high redshift or has a low proportion of elements heavier than Helium. If the galaxy has a high redshift (and thus is at a great distance from us) the high luminosity of supernovae events allow us to probe deeper into the universe than the photometric limit of a telescope may at first suggest. If the event occurs within a faint host galaxy, the type of supernovae can give us evidence as to the population in these mysterious stellar neighbourhoods. A possible progenitor channel for the ultra-luminous supernovae mentioned earlier may be pair instability in stars which are quite deficient in the heavy chemical elements (like carbon and all heavier elements). Previous searches in relatively nearby, metal rich galaxies have therefore missed these exiting and currently obscure phenomena.\n\nThe lightcurve of a hostless SNIIn from PS1 photometry. The different coloured points represent brightness measurements in different filters (g, r, i and z).\n\nThroughout the 3 year period of my PhD at Queen's University Belfast, under the supervision of Professor Stephen Smartt and Dr. Rubina Kotak, I am hoping to classify as many of the orphans from the PS1 survey as possible, offering statistical analysis and comparison of their rates with current estimates. The PS1 telescope has an r-band photometric limit deeper than magnitude 21 (over one million times fainter than what the human eye can see on a dark night) which is easily capable of detecting these events and producing thorough and defined lightcurves, such as the one shown on the right. Of the almost 250 supernovae with faint or no visible hosts already compiled, at least 3 are thought to fall into the 'ultra-luminous' category and with hundreds of new transients being detected by PS1 each week, more are sure to follow. With a little luck I will be able to obtain decisive experimental data and perform intense follow-up observations of some of these objects in an attempt to further our understanding of this latest addition to the study of supernovae. Another group, the Palomar Transient Factory, is also looking for these fascinating events (more information on their project can be found here). Possible collaborative work with this team, and some constructive rivalry, will ensure that the science goals presented here are carried out to optimal completeness.\n\nPlease feel free to comment on this article, selected comments will be published.

{"text":"11. Jeans Theorem &amp Applications\n\nAstronomy 626: Spring 1997\n\nJeans theorem states that any function F = F(I_1,I_2,...),\nwhere the quantities I_i are integrals of motion, is a\nsolution of the time-independent collisionless Boltzmann Equation.\nHere this theorem is used to construct models of spherical\ngalaxies.\n\n11.1 Jeans Theorem\n\nRecall from Lecture 8 that an integral of\nmotion is any function I(r,v) of the phase-space\ncoordinates r and v such that\n\nd\n(1) -- I(r(t),v(t)) = 0\ndt\n\nalong all orbits (r(t), v(t) = dr\/dt). In a\ntime-independent system the specific energy E = 0.5|v|^2 +\nPhi(r) is always an integral; in spherical systems the specific\nangular momentum J is another.\n\nJeans theorem states that any integral of the motion is a solution\nof the time-independent CBE. The proof is straightforward:\n\nwhere the first equality follows because I is an integral,\nthe second by the chain rule, and the third by substitution of the\nequations of motion. Moreover, any function F(r,v) which\ndepends on (r,v) only through one or more integrals of\nmotion,\n\n(3) F(r,v) = F(I_1(r,v),I_2(r,v), ...) ,\n\nis also a solution of the time-independent CBE (BT87, Chapter\n4.4). Jeans theorem is useful in constructing equilibrium models\nof stellar systems.\n\n11.2 Isotropic Models\n\nThe simplest use of the Jeans Theorem is the construction of\nisotropic models of spherical galaxies; in this case, the\ndistribution function f(r,v) = f(E) is a function of\nonly the specific energy E. In a self-consistent\nsystem, the gravitational field is related to the mass density by\nPoissons equation; adopting spherical coordinates, we have\n\n-2 d 2 d(Phi)\n(4) r -- (r ------) = 4 pi G rho(r) .\ndr dr\n\nIt's convenient to use the boundary condition Phi -&gt 0 as\nr -&gt infinity; then the escape energy is zero and all stars\nat radius r have energies between Phi(r) and\n0.\n\nThe mass density rho(r) is the integral of f(r,v)\nover all velocities; since the velocity distribution is isotropic,\nthis integral is\n\n\/ v_e\n| 2\n(5) rho = 4 pi | dv v f(E(r,v)) ,\n|\n\/ 0\n\nwhere v_e = sqrt(-2 Phi(r)) is the escape velocity at\nradius r. Using the definition of the binding energy to\nchange the integration variable gives\n\n\/ 0\n| 1\/2\n(6) rho = 4 pi | dE (2E - 2Phi) f(E) .\n|\n\/ Phi\n\nFrom f to rho\n\nGiven any functional form for f(E) which is\nnon-negative for all E &lt 0, use either Eq. 5 or 6 to\ncalculate the function rho(Phi), and insert the result in Eq.\n4. This yields an ODE for Phi as a function of r:\n\n-2 d 2 d(Phi)\n(7) r -- (r ------) = 4 pi G rho(Phi) .\ndr dr\n\nOnce the solution Phi(r) is determined, the density profile\nis just rho(r) = rho(Phi(r)).\n\nThe Plummer model is perhaps the simplest example (BT87,\nChapter 4.4.3(a)). The distribution function has the form\n\n7\/2\n{ F (-E) , E &lt 0 ,\n(8) f(E) = {\n{ 0 , E &gt 0 ,\n\nwhere F is a constant. Using Eq. 5 to get rho(Phi),\nEq. 7 becomes\n\n-2 d 2 d(Phi) 5\n(9) r -- (r ------) = K (-Phi) ,\ndr dr\n\nwhere K is another constant. The solution is a model\nwith the density profile\n\n3 -3 2 2 -5\/2\n(10) rho(r) = --- M a (1 + r \/a ) ,\n4pi\n\nwhere M is the total mass and a is a scale radius.\nThis model was originally devised to describe observations of star\nclusters. It is actually not a very good model for elliptical\ngalaxies; most of the mass lies within a nearly-constant-density core,\nand at large r the density falls off as r^-5, which\nis steeper than the density profiles of E galaxies.\n\nThe King models (King 1966) are based on a `lowered\nisothermal' distribution function,\n\nwhere rho_1 is a parameter with units of density,\nsigma is a parameter with units of velocity, and E_0\nis a parameter with units of energy. One more parameter is needed to\nconstruct a solution; this is the value of the potential at the\ncenter, Phi_0 = Phi(0). However, there is a degeneracy among\nthese four parameters, so these models actually form a three-parameter\nsequence. Two of the parameters effectively fix the total mass and\nradius of the model. The third parameter, which may be expressed as\nW_0 = (E_0 - Phi_0)\/sigma^2, determines the form of the\ndensity profile. Models with W_0 = 3, for example, are\nalmost `all core', while for larger values of W_0 an extended\nenvelope is added surrounding the core.\n\nOther models derived by starting with a distribution function\ninclude the polytropes (where f is a power-law in\nE), and the `isothermal sphere' (velocities have a Maxwellian\ndistribution).\n\nFrom rho to f\n\nSuppose instead that the density profile rho(r)is known;\nthe goal is now to solve for the distribution function. Eq. 4 yields\nthe potential Phi(r), and inverting this function allows us\nto calculate rho(Phi). Eq. 6 relates rho(Phi) to\nthe distribution function; differentiating this equation by\nPhi yields the Abel integral equation\n\nApart from its application to specific problems, Eq. 13 illustrates\na general and important point: not all spherical density profiles\ncan be realized with physically meaningful isotropic distribution\nfunctions. If the integral in Eq. 13 is a decreasing function of\nE, the distribution function is negative, which is physically\nimpossible. For example, `hollow' models in which the density has a\nlocal minimum at the center can't be realized using isotropic\ndistribution functions.\n\nJaffe's model (Jaffe 1983) is one of a number which have\nbeen proposed as approximations to the density profiles of elliptical\ngalaxies. This model has the form\n\n1 -2 -2\n(14) rho(r) = --- M a r (r + a) ,\n4pi\n\nwhere again M is the total mass and a is a scale\nradius. The distribution function which generates this model may be\nexpressed in terms of Dawson's integral.\n\n11.3 Anisotropic Models\n\nIf the velocity distribution is not isotropic then f(r,v)\nis a function of E and the angular momentum J. Most\ninteresting are systems where f depends on the magnitude of\nJ but not on its direction. Eq. 5 is then replaced by a\ndouble integral:\n\nwhere eta is the angle between the velocity and radius\nvectors and J = |r v sin(eta)| is the magnitude of the\nangular momentum.\n\nProceeding by analogy with the isotropic case, one can pick a form\nfor f(E,J) and calculate the corresponding density profile;\nexamples include the `generalized polytropes' (power laws in\nE and J) as well as many more physically motivated\nmodels.\n\nLikewise, one may pick a rho(r) and find an anisotropic\ndistribution function. Because f(E,J) is a function of two\nvariables, there are an enormous number of possible anisotropic\ndistribution functions which produce a given density profile. One\nchoice are the Osipkov-Merritt models (Osipkov 1979, Merritt 1985),\nwhich assume that f = f(Q), where\n\n1 2 2 2\n(16) Q = Phi(r) + - v (1 + (r\/r_a) sin (eta)) ,\n2\n\nand r_a is the anisotropy radius. For r &lt\nr_a the velocity distribution is approximately isotropic, while\nfor r &gt r_a it is increasingly anisotropic. At any given\nradius the distribution function is stratified on spheroidal shells in\nvelocity space.\n\nHomework\n\nDue date: 2\/27\/97\n\n11. Starting with Eq. 8, find the density rho(Phi) for\nthe Plummer model (hint: start with Eq. 5 and make the\nsubstitutionv^2 = -2 Phi cos^2(theta)).\n\n12. Insert your result for Prob. 11 into Eq. 7 to get a\ndifferential equation for Phi[r]. If you can, solve this\nequation with the boundary conditions (a) Phi = 0 at r =\ninfinity, and (b) d(Phi)\/dr = 0 at r = 0. If\nyou don't know how to solve this equation, show that the Plummer model\npotential from Lecture 7 is a solution and\nexpress F and Phi(0) in terms of the scale radius\na and the total mass M; then use dimensional\nanalysis to check that F (-E)^(7\/2) has units of phase-space\ndensity."}
{"text":"ScienceShot: Light From Beyond the Universe's Dark Side\n\nMost galaxies belong to large structures called superclusters (bright filaments seen in this simulation), which are separated by enormous voids (dark areas\nabove) that harbor few galaxies at all.

{"text":"Thursday, February 02, 2012 centre of just about every galaxy is thought to host a black hole, some with masses of thousands of millions of Suns and consequently strong gravitational pulls that disrupt material around them. They had been thought to hinder the birth of stars, but now an international team of astronomers studying the nearby galaxy Centaurus A has found quite the opposite: a black hole that seems to be helping stars to form. The team, led by Dr Stanislav Shabala of the University of Tasmania, Dr Mark Crockett of the University of Oxford, and Dr Sugata Kaviraj of Imperial College, London, publish their results in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nBlack holes at the centre of galaxies 'switch on' from time to time, driving material around them into outflows that can stretch for millions of light years. The flows plough through galactic gas, compressing, heating and pushing it out of the way. Much of this gas is the raw material from which stars are made, so the outflows significantly affect star formation in the galaxies that host them.\n\nThe astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) to study the central regions of Centaurus A, catalogued as NGC 5128, a bright galaxy 13 million light years away in the direction of the southern constellation of Centaurus. In visible light, a prominent belt of dust can be seen running across the galaxy and when observed at X-ray and radio wavelengths it has jets extending for up to a million light years from a central black hole.\n\nWith WFC3, the scientists took a close look at the 'inner filament', a region located close to the outflow that is a source of ultraviolet and X-ray emission, as well as being bright in visible light. Using the Hubble images, the team were then able to map out the star formation history of the filament with unprecedented accuracy.\n\nThey found that the tip of the filament closest to the outflow contains young stars, the ages of which are similar to the time since the outflow 'switched on' but that there are no young stars further up the filament. This is exactly what is expected from an outflow overrunning a cloud of gas sitting in its path.\n\nThe densest central parts of the cloud are compressed and collapse to form stars, while the gas on the outskirts is swept away from the tip of the filament, like a pile of autumn leaves in the wind.\n\nDr Shabala comments: \"This enhancement of star formation by outflows would have been even more important in a younger universe, where dense clumps of gas were much more common. Our study highlights the need to consider the role of 'positive' feedback from outflows in our current paradigm of galaxy formation.

{"text":"A new paper by cosmic ray researcher Henrik Svensmark suggests that the abundance of diversity of biological life on Earth is closely correlated to our planet's proximity to supernovae.\n\nSvensmark, a professor of physics at the Center for Sun-Climate Research at the Danish Space Research Institute, revealed his work in a paper published by the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nThe prof reconstructed the relative rate at which stars within 850 parsecs of our solar system went supernova over the past 510 million years, and compared it to geophysical and paleobiological records.\n\nHe concluded, poetically, that: \"...remarkable connections to the long-term histories of life and the carbon cycle have shown up unbidden. Biodiversity, CO2 and the carbon-13 (\u03b413C) isotope (a proxy for photosynthesis) all appear so highly sensitive to supernovae in our galactic neighbourhood that the biosphere seems to contain a reflection of the sky.\"\n\nWhen our solar system passes through one of the galaxy's rotating arms, it is brought closer to exploding supernovae, which increases the quantity of cosmic rays reaching Earth's atmosphere. The intense bombardment from a supernova may last around 1,000 years.\n\nSvensmark suggests climate, rather than mutation, accounts for the correlation. He posits that the Permo-Triassic Extinction Event, which saw the mass death of almost all sea life on Earth, was not caused by a comet or asteroid, but rather by a fall in cosmic ray bombardment. Where cosmic ray exposure spiked, there was a corresponding sudden and short-lived falls in sea level and brief glaciations, he asserted.\n\nEarlier work by astronomer Brian Fields had suggested Earth was within a supernova's \"kill radius\" \u2013 30 light years \u2013 a dozen times over 4.5 billion years.\n\nBonus link\n\nCOMMENTS\n\n\"Passes through\"\n\nThe galaxy's arms are density waves, and all the stars in the galactic disk periodically pass through them. The most everyday example of a density wave is when you are driving along a busy motorway and the traffic abruptly slows to a crawl or stand-still for no apparent reason. Viewed from space at night, it is actually possible to see waves of traffic density moving in the opposite direction to the traffic. Another example is density waves of Guiness moving through the head as it settles.\n\nRe: Supernovae effecting our planet ...\n\nWell, yes, it's quite possible that the shockwave from a supernova several billion years ago compressed a cloud of gas and dust in just the right way that it went on to form the solar system, and therefore Earth. A supernova is certainly responsible for the formation of that dust.\n\nInteresting Conclusion...\n\nin the \"layman's version\" link...\n\n\"A mark of a good hypothesis is that it looks better and better as time passes. With the triumph of plate tectonics, diehard opponents were left redfaced and blustering. In 1960 you'd not get a job in an American geology department if you believed in continental drift, but by 1970 you'd not get the job if you didn't. That's what a paradigm shift means in practice and it will happen sometime soon with cosmic rays in climate physics.\n\nPlate tectonics was never much of a political issue, except in the Communist bloc. There, the immobility of continents was doctrinally imposed by the Soviet Academy of Sciences. An analagous diehard doctrine in climate physics went global two decades ago, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was conceived to insist that natural causes of climate change are minor compared with human impacts.\n\nDon't fret about the diehards. The glory of empirical science is this: no matter how many years, decades, or sometimes centuries it may take, in the end the story will come out right.\""}
{"text":"The series begins with a brief introduction to star formation, covering the birth, lifetime and death of a star. The second part describes white dwarfs and neutron stars, including special types of neutron stars, such as pulsars and magnetars. This third part describes black holes.\n\nWe'll start with a brief review of the previous sections. If you're interested, you might want to read about stellar evolution, and the process that results in a black hole. Briefly, at the end of a star's life, it has no fuel left to generate any more energy. During its lifetime, a star exists in a dynamic equilibrium between two opposing forces - pressure generated by heat of nuclear fusion, which pushes outwards to make the star expand, and gravity, which pulls inwards to make it contract. When the nuclear reactor shuts down for the final time, one of these forces is lost. There is nothing left to oppose gravity, and the star begins to rapidly collapse into itself.\n\nThe Origin of Black Holes\n\nMassive stars fuse several elements during their lifetime. For most of their lives, they are in the main sequence, fusing hydrogen into helium. However, once the hydrogen in the core is exhausted, the star moves on to fusing progressively heavier elements, until it reaches iron. This is the end point in the active life of the star, since the fusion of iron (and elements heavier than iron) does not produce net energy. Such fusion reactions are endothermic - they absorb energy instead of producing it.\n\nThis puts a sudden brake on the activity of the star. There is nothing left to burn which would produce energy, therefore the star starts to collapse under gravity. Stellar collapse produces intense pressure and massive amounts of heat at the core. This energy comes from the gravitational potential energy of matter falling inwards. In large stars, the core temperature may reach 5 billion \u00b0K, or higher. This intense heat fuses the iron at the core. As mentioned, iron fusion is endothermic, so this drastically lowers the temperature of the core within a few seconds. The collapse accelerates, due to the loss of this residual heat, which was generating pressure. The rapid collapse is of the nature of an implosion - happening within a few seconds, and generates a massive shock wave. The rebound from this shock wave tears the star apart, throwing out most of its mass in the form of a Type II supernova, one of the most powerful and energetic events in the universe. The remaining core, which is usually a small fraction of the star's initial mass, is left behind.\n\nThe size of this remaining core determines what happens next. If the core is under 1.4 S (S is a solar mass, about 1.9891 x 1030 kilograms), it becomes a white dwarf. White dwarfs are very dense (having the mass of a Sun concentrated into an object about the size of the Earth), and are made of degenerate matter (electrons torn loose from their orbitals, so electrons and atomic nuclei exist as a fluid sometimes called the Fermi Sea). However the electron degeneracy pressure keeps them from collapsing any further.\n\nIf, however, the mass of the core is larger than 1.4 S (the Chandrashekhar Limit), the gravity is powerful enough that electron degeneracy pressure cannot prevent it from collapsing. The object then becomes a neutron star. The equations of state for neutron stars are not very well understood, so the nature of neutron star matter is a subject of debate. Neutron stars are much denser than white dwarfs, with their centers having higher density than an atomic nucleus. Neutron degeneracy pressure keeps them from collapsing further. However, if the core is even more massive, then neutron degeneracy pressure would not be sufficient to keep it from collapsing further.\n\nHow much more massive is a question for debate. The boundary is defined by the equations of state, which are uncertain for neutron stars. This boundary is represented by the Tolmann-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, which is somewhere between 1.5 S and 3 S. If a neutron star is heavier than this, it collapses into a black hole. This is where our knowledge fails, since no one knows what could be denser than neutron star matter. Some people posit an intermediate stage, with neutrons breaking down into quarks, to form a quark star. No quark star has ever been discovered. However, with the addition of more matter, this too collapses into a black hole.\n\nWhat is a Black Hole?\n\nIn simple (but not very descriptive) terms, a black hole can be considered a region of space where the gravitational field is so powerful that not even light can escape. Black holes were predicted by general relativity, though for a long time, people disputed whether they could actually exist. Einstein himself did not believe black holes were physically possible.\n\nHowever, by the 1960's, the majority of physicists were convinced that there was no known theoretical reason why black holes should not exist. Today, several black holes have been identified, both within our galaxy and outside it. It is believed that a supermassive black hole exists at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy (and at the centers of most other galaxies).\n\nTheoretically, black holes can be created by different processes. In the early universe, when the density of matter was much higher, it's possible that local perturbations could cause material to clump together and collapse into a black hole. Some people think that high energy collisions of elementary particles (such as cosmic rays, or the Large Hadron Collider), could also produce black holes. However, the best understood process for black hole formation is through the gravitational collapse of a massive object, such as a star.\n\nSchwarzschild Radius\n\nSince we've defined the black hole as a region where the gravity is so intense that not even light can escape, we can calculate a boundary around the black hole where the escape velocity equals the speed of light in vacuum.\n\nAs can be seen in the equations on the left, the formula for escape velocity can be used to calculate the radius (distance from a mass M) where the escape velocity would be equal to the speed of light. Intuitively, we can see that this would require a very dense mass, so that the entire mass was contained within this radius.\n\nThis is a quick but incorrect way to calculate the Schwarzschild Radius, using Newtonian mechanics only. It's incorrect because it doesn't strictly follow the definition of the Schwarzschild Radius, which derives from mass and gravity, not directly from the speed of light. The Schwarzschild Radius is defined as the radius of a sphere of matter that was dense and massive enough so that the force of gravity inside it was intense enough that no known degeneracy pressure could prevent it from collapsing into a \"point of infinite density\" or gravitational singularity. Therefore if any mass could be contained within its Schwarzschild Radius, it would collapse into a black hole, i.e., an object smaller than its Schwarzschild Radius is a black hole.\n\nIn 1916, Karl Schwarzschild obtained this radius by calculating an exact solution to Einstein's field equations (from general relativity) for the gravitational field outside a spherical, non-rotating body. Note that therefore this formula only works for a spherical object, which is not rotating. Since most black holes do rotate, the formula needs to be modified to take that into account.\n\nOne significance of this radius is that it acts as a one-way barrier. This is the point at which nothing can escape from the black hole's gravity, therefore matter and energy can enter this barrier, but nothing can come out. It is not a physical barrier, since matter and energy can enter, it is simply a region of space with the property that nothing inside the enclosed volume can leave it.\n\nThe sphere defined by the Schwarzschild Radius is called the event horizon. It's a one-way boundary in space-time. It would be wrong to think of it in a Newtonian fashion (imagine light trying to leave it, and being pulled back by gravity). The real situation is that all possible paths that light can take inside the event horizon are warped in towards the singularity. Therefore the forward light cone of any particle leads to the singularity - moving forward in time means moving towards the singularity.\n\nAs we can tell from the formula, the Schwarzschild radius (SR) depends upon the mass. Every mass has some Schwarzschild radius that can be calculated for it. The Schwarzschild radius for the Sun is about 3 kilometers. If the mass of the Sun could be concentrated within a radius of 3 km, the Sun would be a black hole. The Schwarzschild radius for the Earth is about 9 mm. The SR increases linearly with mass, so for each solar mass added to the black hole, the SR increases by about 3 kilometers. At this rate, the largest black hole discovered so far - OJ287 - which has a mass of 18 billion suns, would have a SR over 7 times that of the solar system.\n\nAnother interesting effect that happens near the event horizon is time dilation. Consider two observers, Alice and Bob. Alice is approaching the black hole, while Bob sits back far away, at a safe distance from it. As Alice gets closer to the black hole, it will appear to Bob that she is slowing down. The closer she gets to the black hole, the more she will seem to slow down to Bob, until she reaches the event horizon, at which point she will appear to stop. Bob will never see her enter the event horizon - it will look to him like she's stuck at the event horizon forever.\n\nThis is a thought experiment, of course, since in reality if Alice were to approach that close, she would be torn apart into atoms and there would be nothing for Bob to observe anyway. But let's disregard that for the moment. Now, from Alice's perspective, time does not slow down. She does in fact reach the event horizon, pass through, eventually to merge with the gravitational singularity inside. For Alice, the whole trip would probably take no more than a few seconds.\n\nFormulas used to calculate the Schwarzschild Radius (rS) and the time dilation seen by a distant observer for material entering the black hole.\n\nThe picture above shows Alice as Observer A, and Bob as Observer B. The dimensions are not to scale. The two equations shown are for the Schwarzschild radius (on top), and for the time dilation effect (below it). As can be seen, the Schwarzschild radius is a term in the time dilation equation, reflecting the fact the closer you get to the event horizon, the greater the apparent time dilation to an outside observer. At the event horizon, the term rS\/r becomes 1, and the denominator on the right hand side becomes 0, making the equation not calculable (\"infinite\").\n\nIf you'd like to see the calculations in more detail, they are on a separate page here (will open in a new window). The page has some calculations showing how the size of the event horizon grows with the mass of the black hole, and also the effect of the gravitational field on time dilation.\n\nStructure of Black Holes\n\nA black hole typically shows the following regions. In the center is the gravitational singularity, where everything ends up. Surrounding it is a region (bounded by the event horizon on the outside) where space-time get horribly mangled. Outside the event horizon, a rotating black hole (and only rotating black holes) shows a region called the ergosphere, kind of like an oblate or stretched sphere. This is a region where space gets dragged around with the rotating black hole. Outside it is a region called the photon sphere, which has some peculiar properties relevant to light paths. All of these regions are discussed in detail below.\n\nDiagram of a black hole, showing the Schwarzschild Radius, Photon Sphere, and Ergosphere.\n\nEvent Horizon\n\nAs mentioned, this is a sphere of zero thickness that surrounds the black hole (the singularity) at a distance equal to the Schwarzschild radius. It bounds a region of space where space is curved so that no light paths beginning inside that region can ever leave it. Nothing leaves the black hole from inside its event horizon. Time as we know it, does not exist inside the event horizon.\n\nFrom the perspective of an outside observer, matter or light falling in towards the black hole would come to a halt at the event horizon (due to time dilation). We cannot see it fall in any further, since in order to see inside it would require that something carrying information about the object should leave the black hole, and nothing of the sort does. In other words, the light cone of the event of the object's crossing of the event horizon never intersects the outside observer's world line. As the object (or light) falls towards the event horizon, all processes in the object appear to slow down. If a clock were falling towards the black hole and the outside observer could read the clock's face, the clock would appear to slow down. In the case of light, it becomes ever dimmer and more red-shifted to an outside observer, as it falls towards the event horizon. Finally as it reaches the event horizon it becomes so red shifted that it can't be seen (the wavelength of light reaching the outside observer tends to infinity).\n\nThe event horizon of a non-rotating black hole is spherical, but that of a rotating black hole is somewhat distorted from a perfectly spherical shape. Again, it's important to remember, the event horizon is not a physical barrier - it's simply a mathematical concept. Nothing actually prevents matter from falling in to a black hole.\n\nThis description of the event horizon (and of black holes in general) is based on general relativity, which is not sufficient to understand what's going on inside the black hole. It is only an approximation that holds true from the perspective of an outside observer. As you get close to the event horizon, quantum gravity effects become significant. In order to model the event horizon, we would need both relativity and quantum mechanics. While we are starting to understand some of these things (for example, quantum mechanics predicts that event horizons have a certain temperature, and therefore emit radiation - Hawking Radiation), we cannot have a complete understanding of event horizons until we have a theory of quantum gravity.\n\nSo what would an event horizon look like to an outside observer, if we were close enough to a black hole to see it? Based on what we know so far, pretty much like a black, spherical region with a very sharp boundary. Objects behind it would appear \"lensed\", that is, you could actually see things directly behind the black hole as some light paths from them to you follow the highly curved space-time around the black hole. They would appear as a ring, smeared around in a circle outside the event horizon. This is called gravitational lensing, giving the appearance of Einstein rings around massive objects such as black holes. You would see swirls of matter, caught in the black hole's gravity field spiraling in towards the black hole, slowing down and then seeming to disappear as it reached the event horizon. Stars nearby would have the gases sucked out of them, spinning in long spiral tracks towards the black hole. Here's an artist's impression of what it might look like.\n\nBecause of the curvature of space and the consequent bending of light rays, the apparent size of the black hole would vary from our normal experience, when approaching it. This purely has to do with the distance to the black hole, not its actual size. Even if the black hole was quite small, at a distance of about 1.5 Schwarzschild radii, the event horizon would appear to cover half the sky. At distances closer than 1.5 Schwarzschild radii, the black hole appears to wrap around our vision and extends further behind us, giving a feeling of being surrounded by it, even though it is straight ahead. This effect is real, you can turn your head around and look back, and see that the universe behind you appears to be shrinking. Very close to the black hole (but still outside it), the black hole would appear to be everywhere around you, except for a pinpoint directly behind you. The whole universe would appear shrunk into that pinpoint. You can see what this might look like visually through a computer simulation here.\n\nSingularity\n\nThe singularity is what sits inside the black hole, where everything entering the event horizon ends up. It's a region of space where matter has infinite density, gravity is infinitely strong, and spacetime has infinite curvature. As you can tell by all the \"infinites\" we don't really have a clue what's going on. A non-rotating black hole's singularity is a dimensionless point. A rotating black hole's singularity is a ring situated along the plane of rotation (it has length and width, but zero thickness).\n\nThe appearance of singularities in general relativity show the limits of the theory - the places or conditions where the theory breaks down. At a gravitational singularity, quantum mechanical effects (specially quantum gravity effects) are dominant. At present, we have no quantum theory of gravity. When we do, we will no longer think of these things as singularities.\n\nSince there's not much we can say about singularities, let's say a few things about what they're not. The space inside the event horizon is not normal space. Time inside the event horizon is not normal time. What happens to space-time inside the event horizon is unknown. Various references describe it has \"mangled\", \"highly curved\" etc., which sound somewhat descriptive but don't say much. The singularity is simply the place where this \"mangledness\" reaches its ultimate extent. Using words which we created to reference things and events happening in space and time don't do justice to the state of affairs inside the event horizon. Therefore, saying that a singularity is a \"dimensionless point\" is not strictly true. If space as we know it doesn't exist at the singularity, what does \"dimensionless\" mean anyway? It just goes to show that along with general relativity, our language also breaks down inside the event horizon. When we do invent language to describe it (when we have a theory of quantum gravity), we will no longer call it the \"singularity\". This is not something most people care about in the ordinary course of affairs, unless they are theoretical physicists. But these concepts are often used (and misused) by people philosophizing about the nature of reality and such metaphysical questions. Then it becomes extremely important to remember what we do not know, and thus remove the temptation to derive conclusions from it.\n\nErgosphere\n\nAny rotating black hole \"pulls\" along a region of spacetime with it, due to a phenomenon called frame-dragging. As far back as 1918, the Austrian physicists Josef Lense and Hans Thirring predicted (using general relativity) that a rotating object would drag any nearby object along with it. In other words, an object close enough to a rotating black hole would start rotating around it. There is some complicated math behind it, but one way to understand it is to imagine a clock near a black hole. Because of time dilation, the clock appears to slow down, to an outside observer. If the clock starts rotating around the black hole, in the direction of rotation of the black hole, it will appear to tick faster than if it were not rotating. Time will still appear to slow down for it, to an outside observer, but it will slow down the least if the clock is rotating around the black hole in that direction. The same is true if we replace the clock with a light beam. A light beam will move around a black hole faster in the direction of rotation of the black hole.\n\nThis is simply a specific example of a more general idea of gravetomagnetism, which occurs when a mass is moving in any fashion (linearly or rotating). This terminology considers the phenomenon of frame-dragging as a fictitious force, analogous to a moving electrical charge creating a magnetic field. A moving mass creates a fictitious force, tending to pull along any nearby objects with it. There is some proof that this prediction of relativity is true, in the observation of relativistic jets emerging from black holes in quasars. Roger Penrose proved mathematically that it's possible for these relativistic jets to acquire their energy directly from the black hole, through frame dragging. There is a NASA experiment called Gravity Probe B under way, to obtain information that might corroborate frame dragging. The results should be available by 2010.\n\nRotating black holes would show this effect, dragging space along with them in the direction of their rotation. Because of this, any object close to a black hole would start rotating with it. In a region very close to the black hole, the speed of rotation exceeds the speed of light. An object in this region would therefore move faster than the speed of light. Just to be clear, it's not really the object moving faster than the speed of light, it's space itself moving at that speed. For this reason, such an object could never be stationary relative to anything outside the universe, because to be stationary, it would need to actively move in a direction opposite to that of the rotation, at a speed exceeding light. Which is not possible. This region where it's not possible for an object to remain stationary relative to an outside object is called the ergosphere. Its shape is that of an oblate spheroid - bulging at the equator, and flattened at the poles of the rotating black hole.\n\nAs one moves away from the black hole, the frame dragging effect decreases, and objects move more and more slowly. At a certain distance, they move at the speed of light (instead of faster than light when they are closer). At this point, it's possible for them to remain stationary with respect to an outside observer. This point marks the boundary of the ergosphere. The boundary of the ergosphere touches the event horizon at the poles, while at the equator (where it's maximum), it extends to a distance outside the event horizon equivalent to the Schwarzschild radius.\n\nSince the ergosphere is outside the event horizon, it's possible for an object within it to escape the black hole. When it does, it will have energy accumulated from the spinning of the black hole. This is possibly what powers the relativistic jets mentioned earlier, and Roger Penrose showed that it's theoretically possible to design a system to extract power from black holes in this fashion. Of course, any power extracted will come from the energy of the black hole, and if you extract enough energy, the black hole will stop spinning.\n\nPhoton Sphere\n\nThere is a region outside the event horizon where space is still curved enough that light can travel in complete circles. This is called the photon sphere. In a non-rotating black hole, the photon sphere is 1.5 times the Schwarzschild radius, so it's half as large again as the event horizon. Think of it this way. Since the photon sphere is outside the event horizon, it's possible for light and physical objects to escape the black hole. However, the trajectories on which they can leave the black hole are limited. Light cones have to be pretty nearly perpendicular to the surface of the event horizon in order to leave the photon sphere (the exit cone).\n\nThe photon sphere has some interesting features. Light that enters the photon sphere from outside cannot leave the black hole. However, light originating from inside the photon sphere can leave the black hole, provided that its trajectory is aimed directly away from the black hole, and not at an angle. This means that if an object is orbiting the black hole inside the photon sphere, it cannot be seen from the outside through reflected light coming in from the outside. It can only be seen if it generates light of its own, or from some source of light within the photon sphere. Another interesting feature of the photon sphere is that since light in this region can orbit the black hole, if you were inside the photon sphere you could conceivably see the back of your own head, as light leaving it could circle around and reach your eyes.\n\nThe photon sphere is just the gravitational distortion of space produced by compact bodies. Any object smaller than 1.5 times its Schwarzschild radius will have a photon sphere. This includes neutron stars.\n\nBlack Hole Growth and Evaporation\n\nBlack holes grow by accumulating more mass. All black holes absorb the interstellar dust around them, as well as any cosmic radiation headed their way. This is, however, insufficient to increase their mass significantly. In order to grow, a black hole needs a source of matter relatively close by. Black holes formed in binary systems can slowly absorb the mass of the companion star. The supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies are thought to form by a process of merger of many smaller black holes and stellar objects.\n\nStephen Hawking showed that black holes aren't completely black, they do in fact emit some radiation. He got this result by applying quantum field theory. Many other people have also mathematically verified this result. The radiation from a black hole is called Hawking radiation, and is in a perfect black body spectrum. The amount of radiation is proportional to surface gravity of the black hole (surface gravity being the gravity at the event horizon). Since smaller black holes have much higher surface gravity than large ones, they are expected to produce a lot more radiation than larger ones.\n\nSince radiation is energy, and energy and mass are mutually interconvertible, black holes slowly lose mass as they emit radiation, and will therefore one day disappear. Stellar and galactic black holes are so large that it would take them a very long time to disappear, a time compared to which the present life of the universe is only a negligible fraction. However, small black holes can evaporate very fast. A black hole the mass of a car would evaporate in a nanosecond, having in that nanosecond, a luminosity 200 times brighter than the Sun. However it's possible that very very tiny black holes (with masses comparable to atomic particles) might have quantum gravity effects that make them stable.\n\nA black hole with a mass equal to 5 Suns has a Hawking temperature of about 12 nanokelvins. This is much less than the cosmic background radiation (2.7 K). Therefore, in today's universe, such black holes are not losing mass, they are in fact gaining mass. Only when the universe ages enough that the cosmic background radiation temperature drops below their Hawking temperature, will they start to evaporate."}
{"text":"Explanation: What created the strange spiral structure on the left? No one is sure, although it is likely related to a star in a binary star system entering the planetary nebula phase, when its outer atmosphere is ejected. The huge spiral spans about a third of a light year across and, winding four or five complete turns, has a regularity that is without precedent. Given the expansion rate of the spiral gas, a new layer must appear about every 800 years, a close match to the time it takes for the two stars to orbit each other. The star system that created it is most commonly known as LL Pegasi, but also AFGL 3068. The unusual structure itself has been cataloged as IRAS 23166+1655. The above image was taken in near- infrared light by the Hubble Space Telescope. Why the spiral glows is itself a mystery, with a leading hypothesis being illumination by light reflected from nearby stars.\n\nThe picture is taken in infrared light, so this spiral emits heat. I wonder if it emits any visible light at all. And if so, would this light be all red? The progenitor star must be very puffed-up, and its outer layers must look very orangish, so it would be no surprise if the spiral was somewhat orangish, too.\n\nI wonder what star that is. The closest star I could find would be HD 219670, a K0 star (surprise!!!), magnitude 8.04 in Johnson, color index +0.99 in Johnson, and with the coordinates 23 17 35.78 in RA and +16 42 06.1 in dec.\n\nWhat is most striking about this spiral is that it appears to be an arithmatic spiral, NOT a logarithmic spiral, which are the kind nature normally produces, including galaxies, duh. Any clues as to why?\n\nHow lucky for us that we can see this spiral face on; the whole effect would have been lost if it had been edge on to the Hubble.\n\nIt reminds me of the same pattern that one of those fast spinning lawn sprinklers creates as the water is spun out. Could the spiral arm have been created by a fast spinning star that has some kind of jet - could the jet's emission itself cause the spinning and the resulting \"smoke trail\"?\n\nbellicase wrote:What is most striking about this spiral is that it appears to be an arithmatic spiral, NOT a logarithmic spiral, which are the kind nature normally produces, including galaxies, duh. Any clues as to why?\n\nThe arithmetic spiral is produced because the matter emitted by the rotating star is not accelerating as it recedes, but dispersing (which also causes the dimming effect in the picture). If the star rotates regularly and emits matter at a constant rate the spiral would be like that shown.\n\nLogarithmic spirals are natural where a large number of similar objects are packed into a small surface, such as a sunflower head. I suspect that the spirals seen in galaxies are not sufficiently well-defined to be clearly logarithmic.\n\nThe image appears to be coming towards the viewer as the centre of the spiral is brighter. A similar effect is observed when firework rockets explode as the sudden increase in brightness is interpreted by the brain as coming closer to the viewer.\n\nthat spiral is so obviously a structure formed by a Birkland current that it, in and of itself, should be reason to reform all of cosmology. The light, even infrared, is caused by the movement of charged particles in the presence of electrical fields, just like the auroras.\n\nbeyond wrote:Ann, we may never know what Vincent van Gogh's inspiration for >Starry Night< was.

{"text":"Astronomers have found a cloud of gas and dust around a young star being devoured by the giant black hole at the heart of our Milky Way galaxy \u2014 a find that suggests planets can form in galactic cores.\n\nThe\nsupermassive black hole thought to lurk at the center of the Milky Way is named Sagittarius A*. Scientists estimate it is about 4.3 million times the mass of the sun.\n\nFor the most part, very little light is seen emerging from near Sagittarius A*, aside from radio waves and some modest X-ray or infrared flares, suggesting that not much matter is currently getting fed into it. This absence of data limits what investigators can deduce about the black hole's properties and behavior, as well as those of the other supermassive black holes believed to be at the centers of all large galaxies.\n\nRecently, astronomers gazing at Sagittarius A* through the Very Large Telescope in Chile spotted a dusty gas cloud three times the mass of Earth hurtling toward the center of the galaxy at more than 5.2 million mph (8.4 million kilometers per hour).\n\nThe cloud is putting out five times as much light as the sun as it zips along. The cloud should achieve its closest approach to the black hole in June 2013, reaching a distance of 270 times that of Earth from the sun. [\nMilky Way Black Hole Eats Space Cloud in 2013 (Video)]\n\nScientists are monitoring this mysterious cloud's behavior as it moves closer toward the black hole's accretion zone \u2014 the region where matter begins its\ndeath spiral into the black hole. A new theoretical model now suggests the cloud is probably the shredded remains of a protoplanetary disk surrounding a young, low-mass star \u2014 the kind of structures from which worlds eventually develop.\n\nThe star apparently came from the inner edge of a ring of stars 4 million to 8 million years old, circling Sagittarius A* at a distance of about one-tenth of a light-year. Interactions within this ring could have flung this star, which by itself is too small for astronomers to see directly, toward the black hole on an elliptical, oval-shaped orbit.\n\nThe center of the Milky Way might ordinarily seem like an inhospitable place to try to form a planet, since the young, massive, super-hot stars that often dwell there typically explode as supernovas, blasting out shock waves and bathing the region with intense radiation.\n\n\"The galactic center is one of the most extreme environments in the galaxy,\" said lead study author Ruth Murray-Clay, a theoretical astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.\n\nNevertheless, the existence of protoplanetary disks near the center of the galaxy suggests that worlds can form in this cosmic maelstrom, as well as comets and asteroids.\n\n\"If our explanation for the gas cloud we see is shown to be true, that means protoplanetary disks \u2014 and by extension, planets \u2014 can be found everywhere,\" Murray-Clay told Space.com's fascinating to think about planets forming so close to a black hole,\" study author Abraham Loeb, a theoretical astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., told Space.com. \"If our civilization inhabited such a planet, we could have tested\nEinstein's theory of gravity much better, and we could have harvested clean energy from throwing our waste into the black hole.\"\n\nFuture research might look for evidence of planets, comets and asteroids falling into supermassive\nblack holes in other galaxies, such as the bright flares dying worlds would release as they get ripped apart. The glowing remains of protoplanetary disks getting sucked into black holes could shed light on low-mass stars near galactic cores that are otherwise too faint to be detected.\n\nAs the star continues its plunge over the next year, more and more of the disk's outer material will get torn away. The stripped gas will swirl into the maw of the black hole, and friction will heat it to incandescence, causing it to glow in X-rays.\n\n\"We're really looking forward to next summer,\" Loeb said.\n\nMurray-Clay and Loeb detailed their findings online on Tuesday in the journal Nature Communicationsages"}

{"text":"Breaking News:\n\nRare cosmic blast traced to black hole\n\nBy Dan Vergano, USA TODAY\n\nAstronomers think they've nailed down the source of a mysterious blast of gamma rays that reached Earth in late March and continues, at reduced levels, even today. The culprit looks like a black hole, 3.8 billion light-years away, that swallowed and ripped apart a wandering star.\n\nMark Garlick, University of Warwick\n\nArtist's impression of the end result of disruption of a star by a massive black hole.\n\nArtist's impression of the end result of disruption of a star by a massive black hole.\n\nOn March 28, NASA's Swift satellite first noted the outburst of invisible radiation, a gamma ray burst, one of the most powerful explosions in the universe. Such blasts, thought to result from the explosion of massive stars, are regularly detected and usually die away within minutes.\n\nBut this one continues today, and in its first two days, the intensity of the outburst measured in some wavelengths not visible to the naked eye as bright as a hundred billion suns, scientists report in Thursday's edition of the journal Science. That makes it one of the most intense cosmic explosions ever witnessed by astronomers.\n\n\"This is probably the first time mankind has seen a phenomenon like this,\" says astronomer Josh Bloom of the University of California- Berkeley, lead author of one of two studies on the outburst. The finding adds to evidence that most galaxies, including our own Milky Way, likely harbor titanic black holes at their center, mostly quiet, but always waiting to pull part anything that wanders too close.\n\n\"It has been a long detective story, figuring this out,\" he says.\n\nSwift and other satellites narrowed the origin of the March blast to the center of a galaxy about 22.4 billion trillion miles away. Most gamma ray bursts originate instead from the edges of galaxies, the islands of stars filling space, and are thought to result from the sudden collapse of large stars.\n\n\"Most galaxies, including ours, have a super-massive black hole in their center ,\" Bloom says. An analysis presented by his team and another led by Andrew Levan of the United Kingdom's University of Warwick suggest the mystery outburst resulted when a black hole, one weighing as much as 10 million times more than the sun, ripped apart a wandering star, nearly instantaneously, and then feasted off its gases.\n\nIntense heating of those gases, pulled into a ring circling the distant black hole at nearly the speed of light, led to beams of radiation shooting off from the black hole. One of those beams was pointed directly at Earth, which has an atmosphere that shields it from the blast's effects, but where it was detected by the Swift satellite. The blast had taken 3.8 billion years to reach Earth .\n\n\"Seeing a star get ripped apart by a black hole from almost 4 billion light-years away, that's a remarkable thing,\" says astronomer Dave Goldberg, co-author of A User's Guide to the Universe: Surviving the Perils of Black Holes, Time Paradoxes, and Quantum Uncertainty, who was not part of the studies. \"We want to study black holes because they are tremendous natural laboratories for what happens to matter at very high energies.\"\n\nOnly about 10% of all galaxies appear to have super-massive black holes actively feasting on stars and gas, Bloom says. Most, including the one at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, appear dormant. \"It is only a lucky accident of geometry that this one blast was pointed in just our direction,\" he adds.\n\nOn Wednesday, NASA's Chandra X-ray telescope team reported evidence that even the earliest galaxies, ones born within 1 billion years of the Big Bang about 13.7 billion years ago, harbored \"baby\" versions of such black holes. Rather than devouring the first galaxies, they appear to have helped each other grow in tandem, said astrophysicist Ezequiel Treister of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, at a NASA briefing.\n\n\"Clearly, we now know that black holes play a big role in the construction of galaxies, and the origin of stars like our own,\" Goldberg says. \"Ultimately, we are made of star stuff, so understanding black holes helps us understand ourselves"}

What I will tell you is the best of our\nunderstanding today, but signicant parts of it may well turn out to be wrong. I will try\nto highlight the areas where what I say is least certain, and I will point out a couple of\nplaces where statements asserted quite condently in your textbook have turned out to be\nincorrect.\nI. Post-main sequence evolution\nA. Mass Loss\nOne important eect that distinguishes the evolution of massive stars from that\nof lower mass stars is the importance of mass loss, both on the main sequence\nand thereafter. Low mass stars do not experience signicant mass loss before the\nAGB phase, but massive stars, as we have already seen, can lose mass while still\non the main sequence, and can lose even more after they leave it.\nLike other aspects of stellar mass loss, the exact mechanisms are not understood.\nVery massive stars, those above 85 M or so, lose mass in a rapid and unstable\nmanner. We have already encountered one star like this: Carinae. This is an\nexample of a type of star called a luminous blue variable, or LBV.\n[Slide 1 Car]\nAs these processes reduce the stars mass, its atmosphere becomes less and less\ndominated by hydrogen, eventually reaching X 0.1 or even less. We see these\nstars are somewhat lower mass (but still very massive) stars whose atmospheres\nare dominated by helium rather than hydrogen. These are called Wolf-Rayet\nstars, and they are eectively the bare cores of massive stars. Stars from 10 85\nM skip the LBV phase and go directly to the Wolf-Rayet phase.\nStars become WRs while they are still on the main sequence, i.e. burning hydrogen in their centers. Stars in this case are called WN stars, because they are\nWolf-Rayet stars that show large amounts of nitrogen on their surfaces. The nitrogen is the product of CNO cycle burning, which produces an equilibrium level\nof nitrogen above the amount that the star began its life with.\nWR stars continue to lose mass rapidly, often producing spectacular nebulae that\n1\nlook like planetary nebulae. They shine for the same reason: the expelled gas is\nexposed to the high energy radiation of the star, and it oresces in response.\n[Slides 2, 3 WR nebula NGC 2359, WR 124]\nMass loss continues after the star exhausts H and begin burning He at this point\nthe surface composition changes and we begin to see signs of 3 burning. These\nare WC stars. The continuing mass loss removes the enhanced nitrogen from the\nCNO cycle, and convection brings to the surface the result of 3 burning, which\nis mostly carbon. Very rarely, we see WR stars where the carbon is being blown\no, and the surface is dominated by oxygen.\nThe mass loss can be quite dramatic 100 M stars are thought to get down to\nnearly 30 M by the time they evolve o the main sequence.\nB. Movement on the HR diagram\nWhile these stars show dramatic mass loss, their luminosities do not evolve all\nthat much as they age. That is for the reason we mentioned last time in the\ncontext of low mass stars luminosity evolution: the role of radiation pressure.\nThe luminosity varies as L 4 4 , and is in turn given by the Eddington\nquartic:\n2\nM\n4 4 + 1 = 0.\n0.003\nM\nFor very massive stars, the rst term is dominant, so is roughly constant, and\nL is too. This is simply a reection of the fact that very massive stars are largely\nsupported by radiation pressure. As a result, their luminosity is equal to the\nEddington luminosity, which depends only on total mass, not on composition.\n[Slide 4 Meynet & Maeder tracks]\nThis non-evolution of the luminosity continues to apply even after these stars\nleave the main sequence. As the stars develop inert ash cores and burning shells\nlike lower mass stars, they cannot increase in luminosity, but they can increase\nin radius and go to lower eective temperature. The net eect is that they move\nalong nearly horizontal tracks on the HR diagram. The slide shows the latest\nGeneva models.\nAs you can see, the luminosities increase less and less for stars of higher and higher\nmasses, and instead they evolve at constant luminosity. Thus massive stars never\nhave a red giant phase, since that would require an increase in luminosity.\nC. Internal structure: the onion model\nThe internal structure of a massive star near the end of its lifetime comes to\nresemble an onion. In the center is an ash core, with the type of ash depending\non the stars evolutionary state. At rst it is helium, then carbon, etc., until at\nlast the core is composed of iron. The temperature is high enough that the core\nis never degenerate until the last stages in the stars life, when it consists of iron.\n2\nAbove the core is a burning shell where the next lowest element Z element in the\nburning chain burns. Thus above an iron core is a silicon burning layer, above\na helium core is a carbon burning layer, etc. Outside that shell, there is inert\nmaterial composed of the same element. As one moves further outward in the\nstar, one encounters the next burning shell where a lower Z element burns, and\nso forth until one reaches the hydrogen burning layer and the hydrogen envelope,\nif any is left, above it.\n[Slides 5, 6 schematic representation and numerical computation from Heger et\nal. of onion structure]\nThe onion structure grows until the star develops an iron core. Since iron is at\nthe peak of the binding energy curve, it cannot be further burned. A star with an\niron core and an onion structure around it is known as a supernova progenitor.\nII. Supernovae\nA. Evolution of the Core\nNow consider what happens in the core of a supernova progenitor. The iron core\nis much like the helium core that we discussed in the context of lower mass stars:\nit has no nuclear reactions, so it becomes isothermal. If it gets to be more than\nroughly 10% of the stellar mass, it will exceed the Schnberg-Chandrasekhar limit\no\nand begin contracting dynamically. If it becomes degenerate, degeneracy pressure\ncan slow the collapse, but if the core exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass of 1.4 M ,\nelectron degeneracy pressure cannot hold it up. The core must therefore contract\nonce it exceeds a certain minimum mass.\nContraction creates two instabilities. First, at the high pressures found in the\ncore, heavy nuclei can undergo reactions of the form\nI (A, Z ) + e J (A, Z 1) + e ,\ni.e. nucleus I captures a free electron, which converts one of its protons into a\nneutron. Well discuss why these reactions happen in a few moments. Reactions\nof this sort create an instability because removing electrons reduces the number\nof electrons, and thus the degeneracy pressure. The loss of pressure accelerates\ncollapse, raising the pressure again and driving the reaction to happen even faster.\nSecond, since the gas is degenerate, its pressure is unrelated to its temperature.\nAs it collapses, its temperature rises, but this does not halt the collapse because\nit doesnt raise the pressure. Once the temperature exceeds about 6 7 109 K,\nphotons are able to start photodisintegrating iron via the reaction\n56\nFe + 100 MeV 13 4 He + 4n.\nAs the equation indicates, the reaction is highly endothermic, absorbing about 100\nMeV from the radiation eld, or about 2 MeV per nucleon, each time it happens.\n3\nIn eect, all the energy that was released by burning from He to Fe is now given\nback. The loss of thermal energy also accelerates collapse, which leads the core\nto contract more, which accelerates the reaction, etc.\nBoth of these are ionization-like processes, and they serve to keep a < 4\/3, in the\nunstable regime where collapse cannot be halted. Once the collapse proceeds far\nenough, an even more endothermic reaction can take place when photons begin\nto disintegrate helium nuclei:\n4\nHe + 27 MeV 2p + 2n.\nThis reaction absorbs 27 MeV each time it happens, or 6 7 MeV per nucleon.\nThe disintegration of He creates a population of free neutrons and protons. Normally free neutrons spontaneously decay into a proton plus an electron plus a\nneutrino:\nn p + e + e .\nThe free neutron lifetime is 614 seconds, and the reaction is exothermic (as it\nmust be, since it is spontaneous). The energy released can be determined just by\nthe dierence in mass between a proton, mp = 1.67262 1024 g, and a neutron,\nmn = 1.67493 1024 g:\nE = (mn mp )c2 = 1.3 MeV.\nHowever, conditions in the core are very dierent from those in free space. The\nelectrons are highly relativistically degenerate. Consider what this means energetically. Back at the beginning of the class, we showed that, for a population of\ndegenerate electrons, they occupy all quantum states up to a maximum momentum\n1\/3\n3h3 n\n,\np0 =\n8\nwhere n is the number density of electrons. If a new electron were to be created\nby the decay of a neutron, it would have to go into an unoccupied quantum state,\nand the rst available state has a momentum a just above p0 . The corresponding\nenergy is\n1 \/3\n3h3 n\nE0 = pc =\nc\n8\nin the limit where the electrons are highly relativistic. If we compare this to the\nenergy E that is released by neutron decay, we nd that E0 becomes equal to\nE when\n8 E 3\nn=\n= 9.6 1030 cm3\n3\nch\nIf we have one electron per two nucleons, the average for elements heavier than\nhydrogen, the corresponding mass density is\n1\n= nmp = 8.0 106 g cm3 .\n2\n4\nOnce the density exceeds this value, it is no longer energetically possible for free\nneutrons to undergo spontaneous decay. Instead, the opposite is true, and the\nreverse reaction\np + e n + e\nbegins to occur spontaneously. Each such reaction requires 1.3 MeV of energy, and\neven further reduces the degeneracy pressure of the electrons. Electron capture\nby heavy elements earlier on in the collapse occurs for very similar reasons.\nThe collapse is only halted once another source of pressure becomes available:\nat suciently high density, the neutrons become degenerate. The structure of\nthis degenerate neutron matter is not well understood, and is a subject of active\nresearch, but the bottom line of what we understand seems to be that the collapse\nis halted once the density reaches around 1015 g cm3 . The radius of the core\nat this point is about 40 km, although as the neutron star cools o it eventually\nshrinks to about 10 km. The density of 1015 g cm3 in the core is roughly the\ndensity of an atomic nucleus, so the core at this point is a giant atomic nucleus,\nseveral km is diameter, with the mass of the Sun.\nB. Explosion Mechanism and Energy Budget\nAll of these processes occur in the core on dynamical timescales. The initial\niron core is of order 5, 000 10, 000 km in radius, and the mass is of order a\nChandrasekhar mass, about 1.5 M , so the dynamical time is\n1\n1 second.\ntdyn\nG\nThus the core collapses on a timescale that is tiny compared to the dynamical\ntime of the star as a whole the outer envelope of the star just sits there while\nthe core collapses.\nThe collapse of the iron core causes the material above it to begin falling, and\nthe exact sequence of events thereafter is somewhat unclear. Your book gives the\nimpression that this is a solved problem, but your book is wrong on this point.\nExactly how supernovae work is far from clear. Nonetheless, we can give a rough\noutline and make some general statements.\nFirst of all, we can gure out the energy budget. Ultimately what drives everything is the release of gravitational potential energy by the collapse of the iron\ncore. It is this sudden energy release that explodes the star. The core has an initial mass of Mc 1.5 M , and an initial radius Rc 104 km. The nal neutron\ncore has a comparable mass and a radius of Rnc 20 km. Thus the amount of\nenergy released is\n2\nEgrav GMc\n1\n1\nRc Rnc\n2\nGMc\n3 1053 erg.\nRnc\nOf this, the amount that is used to convert the protons and electrons to neutrons\nis a small fraction. Each conversion ultimately uses up about 7 MeV, so the total\n5\nnuclear energy absorption is\nEnuc = 7 MeV\nMc\nEgrav\n2 1052 erg\n.\nmH\n15\nThus only 10% percent of the energy is used up in converting protons to\nneutrons. The rest is available to power an explosion.\nSimilarly, some of the energy is required to eject the stellar envelope. The binding\nenergy of the envelope to the core is roughly\nEbind =\nEgrav\nGMc (M Mc )\n5 1051 erg\n.\nRc\n60\nThus only a few percent of the available energy is required to unbind the envelope.\nThe remaining energy is available to give the envelope a large velocity, to produce\nradiation, and to drive nuclear reactions in the envelope. We dont have a good\nrst-principles theory capable of telling us how this energy is divided up, but we\ncan infer from observations.\nThe observed speed of the ejecta is around 10,000 km s1 , so the energy required\nto power this is\nEgrav\n1\n.\nEkin = (M Mc )v 2 1051 erg\n2\n300\nFinally, the observed amount that is released as light is comparable to that released in kinetic energy:\nErad 1051 erg\nEgrav\n.\n300\nBoth of these constitute only about 1% of the total power.\nSo where does the rest of the energy go? The answer is that it is radiated away\ntoo, but as neutrinos rather than photons. The neutrinos produces when the\nprotons in the core are converted into neutrons dont escape immediately, but\nthey do eventually escape, and they carry away the great majority of the energy\nwith them. Only about 1% is used to power everything else, but that is more\nthan enough to blow up the star.\nGetting that 1% number from rst principles, and more generally understanding\nthe mechanism by which the energy released in the core is transferred into the\nenvelope of the star, is one of the major problems in astrophysics today. We have\na general outline of what must happen, but really solving the problem is at the\nforefront of numerical simulation science.\nHeres what we know in general outline: as long as the collapsing core has a pressure set by relativistic electrons, its adiabatic index is a = 4\/3. As it approaches\nnuclear density and more of the electrons convert to neutrons, it initially experiences an attractive nuclear force that pulls it together, and this has the eect of\n6\npushing a even lower, toward 1, and accelerating the collapse. Once the densities get even higher, though, the strong nuclear force becomes repulsive, and a\nincreases to a value\n4\/3.\nThis is sucient to halt collapse of the core, and from the perspective of the\nmaterial falling on top of it, it is as if the core suddenly converted from pressureless\nfoam (a < 4\/3) to hard rubber (a > 4\/3). The infall is therefore halted suddenly,\nand all the kinetic energy of the infalling material is converted to thermal energy.\nThis thermal energy raises the pressure, which then causes the material above the\nneutron core to re-expand it bounces. The bounce launches a shock wave out\ninto the envelope.\nThe bounce by itself does not appear to be sucient to explode the star. The\nshock wave launched by the bounce stalls out before it reaches the stellar surface.\nHowever, at the same time all of this is going on, the core is radiating neutrinos\nlike crazy. Every proton that is converted into a neutron leads to emission of a\nneutrino, and the collapsing star is suciently dense the that neutrinos cannot\nescape. Instead, they deposit their energy inside the star above the core, further\nheating the material there and raising its pressure.\nThe neutrinos are thought to somehow re-energize the explosion and allow it to\nnally break out of the star. Heres an example of a computer simulation where\nthis happens:\n[Slide 7 Adam Burrows supernova simulation]\nHowever, there are lots of details missing, and it turns out to be much easier to\nexplode stars in 2D (which this simulation uses) than in 3D. The problem is not\nsolved.\nC. Nucleosynthesis\nThe shock propagating outward through the star from the core heats the gas up\nto 5 109 K, and this is hot enough to induce nuclear burning in the envelope.\nThis burning changes the chemical composition of the envelope, creating new\nelements. Much of the material is heated up enough that it burns to the iron\npeak, converting yet more of the star into iron-like elements.\nI say iron-like because the initial product is not in fact iron. The reason is that\nthe most bound element, 56 Fe, consists of 26 protons and 28 neutrons, so it has\ntwo more neutrons than protons. The fuel, consisting mostly of elements like 4 He,\n12\nC, 16 O, 28 Si, all have equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Thus there are\nnot enough neutrons around to pair up with all the protons to make 56 Fe.\nConverting protons to neutrons is via decays is possible, and in fact it is the\nrst step in the pp-chain. However, as we learned studying that reaction, decays\nare slow, and in the few seconds that it takes for the shock to propagate through\nthe star, there is not enough time for them to occur.\n7\nThe net result is that the material burns to as close to the iron peak as it can get\ngiven the ratio of protons to neutrons available. This turns out to be 56 Ni. This\nis not a stable nucleus, since it is subject to decay, but the timescale for decay\nis much longer than the supernova explosion goes on for, so no beta decays occur\nuntil long after the nucleosynthetic process is over.\nNot all the material in the star is burned to the iron peak. As the shock wave\npropagates through the star it slows down and heats things up less. The net\nresults is that material further out in the star gets less burned, so the supernova\nwinds up ejecting a large amounts of other elements as well. Calculating the exact\nyields from rst principles is one of the goals of supernova models.\nD. Observations\n1. Light Curves\nWhen a supernova goes o, what do we observe from the outside? The rst\nthing, which was only seen for the rst time a couple of years ago, is a bright\nultraviolet ash from the shock breaking out of the stellar surface. We saw\nthis because Alicia Soderberg, a postdoc at Princeton (as was I at the time)\ngot very lucky. She was using an x-ray telescope to study an older supernova\nin a galaxy, when she saw another one go o. The telescope was observing\nthe star as it exploded, and it saw a ash of x-rays as the shock wave from\nthe deep interior of the star reached the surface.\n[Slide 8 Soderberg image]\nAfter the initial ash in x-rays, it takes a little while before the optical emission reaches its peak brightness. That is because the expanding material\ninitially has a small area, and most of that emission is at wavelengths shortward of visible. As the material expands and cools, its optical luminosity\nincreases, and reaches its peak a few weeks after the explosion. After that\nit decays. The decay can initially take one of two forms, called linear or\nplateau, but after a while they all converge to the same slope of luminosity\nversus time.\n[Slide 9 light curve image]\nThis slope can be understood quite simply from nuclear physics. As we\nmentioned a moment ago, the supernova synthesizes large amounts of 56 Ni.\nThis nickel is unstable, and it undergoes the decay reaction\n56\n28 Ni\n56\n27 Co\n+ e+ + e +\nwith a half-life of 6.1 days. This is short enough that most of the nickel decays\nduring the initial period of brightening or shortly thereafter.\nHowever, the resulting\nreaction:\n56\nCo is also unstable, and it too undergoes a decay\n56\n27 Co\n8\n56\n26 Fe\n+ e+ + e + .\nThis reaction has a half-life of 77.7 days, and it turns out to be the dominant\nsource of energy for the supernova in the period from a few tens to a few\nhundreds of days after peak. The expanding material is cooling o, and this\nwould cause the luminosity to drop, but the radioactive decays provide a\nenergy source that keeps the material hot and emitting.\nBy computing the rate of energy release as a function of time via the decay\nof cobalt-56, we can gure out how the luminosity of the supernova should\nchange as a function of time. Radioactive decays are a statistical process, in\nwhich during a given interval of time there is a xed probability that each\natom will decay. This implies that the number of cobalt-56 decays per unit\ntime that occur in a particular supernova remnant must be proportional to\nthe number of cobalt-56 atoms present:\ndN\n= N.\ndt\nHere N is the number of cobalt-56 atoms present and is a constant. The\nequation simply asserts that the rate of change of the number of cobalt-56\natoms at any given time is proportional to the number of atoms present at\nthat time.\nThis equation is easy to integrate by separation of variables:\ndN\n= dt\nN\nN = N0 et ,\n=\nwhere N0 is the number of atoms present at time t = 0. The quantity is\nknown as the decay rate. To see how it is related to the half-life 1\/2 , we can\njust plug in t = 1\/2 :\n1\nN0 = N0 e1\/2\n2\nFor\n56\n=\n=\nln 2\n.\n1 \/2\nCo, = 0.0039 \/ day.\nWhile radioactive decay is the dominant energy source, the luminosity is\nsimply proportional to the rate of energy release by radioactive decay, which\nin turn is proportional to the number of atoms present at any time, i.e. L N .\nThis means that the instantaneous luminosity should follow\nL et\n=\nlog L = (log e)t + constant.\nThus for the cobalt-56-powered part of the decay, a plot of log L versus time\nshould be a straight line with a slope of\n(log e) = 0.0017 day1 .\nAn excellent test for this model was provided by supernova 1987A, which went\nof in 1987 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a nearby galaxy. The supernova\n9\nwas observed for more than ve years after the explosion, and as a result we\ngot a very good measure of how its luminosity dropped. We can see a clear\nperiod when the slope follows exactly what we have just calculated. Once\nenough of the 56 Co decayed, other radioactive decays with longer half-lives\ntook over.\n[Slide 10 light curve of SN1987A]\nThe eect is even more prominent in type Ia supernovae, which are produced\nwhen a white dwarf is pushed over the Chandrasekhar limit. In that case the\nnuclear reaction burns a much larger fraction of the star to 56 Ni, so its decay\ninto cobalt and then iron completely dominates the light curve.\n2. Neutrinos\nSupernova 1987A also provided strong evidence for another basic idea in supernova theory: that supernovae involve the neutronization of large amounts\nof matter, and with it the production of copious neutrino emission. The rst\ndetection of supernova 1987A was not its light. The shock wave takes some\ntime to propagate through the star after the core collapses. The neutrinos,\nhowever, escape promptly, and on February 23, 1987 the Kamiokande II neutrino detector in Japan and the IMB detector in Ohio both measured a burst\nof neutrinos that arrived more than three hours before the rst detection of\nvisible light from the supernova. Burst is perhaps too strong a word, since\nthe total number of neutrinos detected was 20 neutrinos are hard to measure! Nonetheless, this was vastly above the noise level, and provided the\nrst direct evidence that a supernova explosion involves release of neutrinos.\n3. Historical importance\nA brief aside: because of their brightness and the long duration for which they\nare visible, supernovae played an important part in the early development of\nastronomy, and in the history of science in general. In November of 1572,\na supernova went o that was, at its peak, comparable in brightness to the\nplanet Venus. For about two weeks the supernova was visible even during the\nday. It remained visible to the naked eye until 1574.\nThe 1572 supernova was so bright that no one could have missed it. One of\nthe people to observe it was the Dane Tycho Brahe, who said On the 11th\nday of November in the evening after sunset, I was contemplating the stars in\na clear sky. I noticed that a new and unusual star, surpassing the other stars\nin brilliancy, was shining almost directly above my head; and since I had, from\nboyhood, known all the stars of the heavens perfectly, it was quite evident\nto me that there had never been any star in that place of the sky, even the\nsmallest, to say nothing of a star so conspicuous and bright as this. I wqs so\nastonished of this sight that I was not ashamed to doubt the trustworthyness\nof my own eyes. But when I observed that others, on having the place pointed\nout to them, could see that there was really a star there, I had no further\n10\ndoubts. A miracle indeed, one that has never been prevoiously seen before\nour time, in any age since the beginning of the world.\n[Slide 11 plate from Tychos Stella Nova]\nTycho was so impressed by the event that he wrote a book about it and\ndecided to devote his life to astronomy. He went on to make the observations\nthat were the basis of Keplers Laws. Kepler himself saw another supernova\nin 1604. The supernovae played a critical role in the history of science because\nthey provided clear falsication of the idea that the stars were eternal and\nunchanging, which had dominated Western scientic thought since the time\nof the ancient Greeks. Previous variable events in the sky, such as comets,\nwere taken to be atmospheric phenomena, and there was no easy way to\ndisprove this. With the supernovae, however, they persisted long enough to\nmake parallax observations possible. The failure to detect a parallax for the\nsupernovae provide without a doubt that they were further away than the\nmoon, in the supposedly eternal and unchanging realm outside the terrestrial\nsphere.\nUnfortunately for us, Tychos supernova was the last one to go o in our\ngalaxy (unless one went o on the far side of the galactic center, where we\nwouldnt be able to see it due to obscuring dust). A number of astronomers\nwould very much like there to be another one, since astronomical instrumentation has improved a bit since Tychos day...\nIII. Supernova Remnants\nThe material ejected into space by a supernova into space slams into the interstellar\nmedium, the gas between the stars, at a velocity up from a few to ten percent of the\nspeed of light. When this collision happens, it creates a shock in the interstellar medium\nthat heats interstellar gas to temperatures of millions of K. The shocked bubble lled\nwith hot gas is known as a supernova remnant, and such remnants can be visible for\nmany thousands of years after the supernova itself fades from view.\nThe association of these structures with supernovae can be demonstrated quite clearly\nby looking with modern telescopes at the locations of historical supernovae. For example, remnants have been identied for both Tychos and Keplers supernovae, and\nanother for the Crab supernova (named after the constellation where it is located).\nThe Crab supernova was recorded in 1054 by Chinese astronomers no one in Europe\nat the time was paying attention to the sky, or if they were, they didnt bother to write\nit down.\n[Slides 12 - 14 Tychos SNR, Keplers SNR, and the Crab SNR]\nWe can understand the structure of a supernova remnant using a simple mathematical\nargument made independently by L. I. Sedov in the USSR and G. I. Taylor in the\nUK. These authors discovered the solution independently because Taylor discovered it\nwhile working in secret on the British atomic bomb project, which was later merged\n11\nwith the American one. It turns out that the problems of a supernova exploding in the\ninterstellar medium and a nuclear bomb exploding in the atmosphere are quite similar\nphysically. Sedov published his solution in 1946, just after the end of Wolrd War II,\nwhile Taylors work was still secret.\nConsider an idealized version of the supernova problem. An explosion occurs at a point,\nreleasing an energy E . The explosion occurs inside a medium of constant density ,\nand we assume that the energy of the explosion is so large that the pressure it exerts is\nvastly greater than the pressure in the ambient material, so that the ambient gas can\nbe assumed to be pressureless. This is a very good approximation for both supernovae\nand nuclear bombs. We would like to solve for the position of the shock front r as a\nfunction of time t.\nThe mathematical argument used to solve this relies on nothing more than fancy\ndimensional analysis. Consider the units of the given quantities. We have the energy\nE , density , radius r, and time t, which have units as follows:\n[r]\n[t]\n[ ]\n[E ]\n=\n=\n=\n=\nL\nT\nM L3\nM L2 T 2 .\nHere L means units of length, T means units of time, and M means units of mass.\nThus a density is a mass per unit volume, which is a mass per length cubed. Energy\nhas units of ergs of Joules, which is a mass times an acceleration times a distance, and\nacceleration is distance per time squared.\nWe want to have a formula for r in terms t, , and E . It is clear, however, that there\nis only one way to put together t, , and E such that the nal answer has the units of\nlength! The mass must cancel out of the problem, so clearly the solution must involve\nE\/. This has units\nE\n= L5 T 2 .\nWe want to obtain something with units of length, so clearly the next step is to cancel\nout the T 2 by multiplying by t2 . This gives\nE2\nt = L5 .\nFinally, to get something with units of L and not L5 , we must take the 1\/5 power.\nThus, the radius of the shock as a function of time must, on dimensional grounds, be\ngiven by\n1\/5\nE\nr=Q\nt2\/5 ,\nwhere Q is a dimensionless constant. Similarly, the shock velocity as a function of time\n12\nmust follow\ndr\n2\nE\nv=\n=Q\ndt\n5\n1\/5\nt3\/5 .\nActually solving the equations of uid dynamics shows that\nQ=\n75\n16\n(a 1)(a + 1)2\n3a 1\n1\/5\n,\nwhere a is the adiabatic index of the gas into which the shock propagates.\nTaylor used this solution to deduce the energy of the rst atomic explosion at Trinity\nusing nothing but photos of the blast wave at dierent times that has been published\nin newspapers and magazines. When he published the result in 1950, a number of\npeople were not happy.\nFor supernovae we generally cant see them expand the expansion takes too long.\nHowever, we can obtain a relationship we can test between the temperature of the\nshocked material and the radius of the remnant. At the shock the kinetic energy of\nthe expanding gas is converted into heat, so the temperature at the shock, which is a\nmeasure of internal energy per unit mass, is simply proportional to the kinetic energy\nper unit mass, which varies as v 2 . Thus we have\n2\nTshock v\nE\n2\/5\nt6\/5 .\nNow let us rewrite this in terms of the radius. Solving the rst equation for t, we have\nt\nE\n1\/2\nr 5\/2 ,\nand plugging this into our equation for the shock temperature, we have\nTshock\nE 3\nr.\nThus the temperature of supernova remnants should decrease as the third power of\ntheir size, assuming roughly constant energy and ISM density. Small remnants such as\nKeplers, Tychos, and the Crab are visible in x-rays, but the rapid temperature drop\nwith size ensures that, once they expand signicantly, they cool o too much to be\nvisible in x-rays. 112: The Physics of StarsClass 18 Notes: Neutron Stars and Black HolesIn the last class we discussed the violent deaths of massive stars via supernovae.

{"text":"With a recent NSF award, UA scientists will use galaxy clusters as astronomical lenses to peer farther into the depths of space than any manmade telescope is capable of viewing - to the time when the universe's earliest stars and galaxies still were forming from the gravitational collapse of gas and dark matter.\n\nThe University of Arizona is renowned for making some of the world's largest and most precise optics for some of the world's greatest telescopes. Now, UA scientists are making use of lenses that defy human ability to build: They are made up of clusters of galaxies and dark matter. With a $600,000 grant from the National Science Foundation, UA professor of astronomy Ann Zabludoff and her team at Steward Observatory, including graduate students Ken Wong and Decker French, along with Mark Ammons at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and co-principal investigator Charles Keeton at Rutgers University, are working to find and analyze these cosmic lenses. By magnifying objects even farther way in space, these natural cosmic lenses may enable astronomers to see farther back in time than possible with any manmade telescope, to the time of the formation of the universe's very first stars and galaxies. \"We're talking about stuff back to literally the dawn of time,\" Zabludoff said. \"Twelve billion years ago closing in on 13 billion years ago.\" For years, astronomers have been trying to detect the very first stars and galaxies that formed after the Big Bang, Zabludoff said, to see how the stars and galaxies built up a mass of subatomic particles called baryons over time. \"Baryons are the stuff of which we and the things in our experience are made,\" said Zabludoff. Protons and neutrons, which make up the nuclei of atoms, are baryons. Effectively, all visible matter is made up of baryons and electrons. \"What we do know about the gas distribution in the early universe is that it looks like this wonderful web, almost a spider web of gas,\" Zabludoff said. \"It's natural to imagine that the galaxies form in the interstitial regions of these filaments and the baryons, including the gas, that we see fall into the galaxy.\""}

{"text":"Science News\n\nChandra Peers Into the Pillars of Creation\n\nFeb. 16, 2007 \u2014 A\n\nShare This:\n\nThe Chandra data shows bright X-ray sources in this field, most of which are young stars. In this image, red, green, and blue represent low, medium, and high energy X-rays. The Chandra data have been overlaid on the Hubble Space Telescope image to show the context of these X-ray data.\n\nVery few X-ray sources are found in the pillars themselves. This suggests that the Eagle Nebula may be past its star-forming prime, since young stars are usually bright X-ray sources. However, there are two X-ray objects found near the tips of the pillars. One is a young star about 4 or 5 times as massive as the Sun, visible as the blue source near the tip of the pillar on the left. The other is a lower mass star near the top of the other pillar that is so faint it is not visible in the composite image.\n\nThe Chandra observations did not detect X-rays from any of the so-called evaporating gaseous globules, or EGGs. The EGGs are dense, compact pockets of interstellar gas where stars are believed to be forming. The lack of X-rays from these objects may mean that most of the EGGs do not contain enshrouded stars. However, infrared observations have shown that 11 of the 73 EGGs contain infant stellar objects and 4 of these are massive enough to form a star. The stars embedded in these 4 EGGs might be so young that they have not generated X-rays yet and one of them - estimated to have about the mass of the Sun - could represent one of the earliest stages of evolution of our nearest star. The Sun was likely born in a region like the Pillars of Creation.\n\nThe pillars and the few stars forming inside them are the last vestiges of star formation in the Eagle Nebula, also known as M16, which peaked several million years earlier. This contrasts strongly with the active star forming regions in other clusters such as NGC 2024, where Chandra sees a dense cluster of embedded young stars.\n\nThe results were published in the January 1st issue of The Astrophysical Journal and the research team, led by Jeffrey Linsky of the University of Colorado, includes Marc Gagne and Anna Mytyk (West Chester University), Mark McCaughrean (University of Exeter) and Morten Andersen (University of Arizona The Marshall Center manages the Chandra program.

{"text":"Black-hole eclipse sizes up X-ray source\n\nApr 17, 2007\n\nThe eclipse of a supermassive black hole has allowed astronomers to make the first direct measurement of the size of the disk-shaped X-ray source that surrounds these celestial bodies. The event occurred when a gas cloud moved across the supermassive black hole that lies at the centre of NGC 1365 galaxy -- which is about 60 million light years from Earth -- temporarily obscuring X-rays emitted by the disk. By noting the time it took for the cloud to pass in front of the disk, astronomers using NASA's Chandra X-ray telescope concluded that the diameter of the disk is about seven times the distance between the Earth and Sun.\n\nSupermassive black holes are billions of times heavier than the Sun and astronomers believe that they lie at the heart of every galaxy. The gravitational pull of these and other black holes is so strong that nothing - not even light - can escape. Black holes appear to be fed by a steady stream of gas and other material that spirals around the body in an \"accretion disk\", before plunging in. This material gets very hot as it accelerates towards the black hole and emits copious X-rays, which reveal the position of the otherwise invisible black hole.\n\nAlthough extremely bright, the X-ray emitting region of these disks is very small and astronomers had not been able to measure the size of the emitters directly. It had been predicted that the NGC 1365 X-ray source was about ten times the size of the black hole's event horizon \u2013 the point at which not even light can escape from the black hole. This was confirmed by the sheer luck of a cloud eclipsing the black hole while it was being observed by Chandra. The transit took about two days, which makes the X-ray emitter about one billion kilometres in diameter.\n\nMartin Elvis of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts and a member of the Chandra team told Physics Web that he expects more eclipses of NGC 1365 to occur. Indeed, the team already have plans to use the ESA's XMM-Newton X-ray telescope satellite to observe these eclipses with the aim of reconstructing the shape of the X-ray source."}

{"text":"Coming in as the most distant object with a confirmed redshift, UDFy-38135539 is the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF) classification for a galaxy which, as of October 2010, is the most distant object from Earth known to exist in the universe. Its discovery is formally detailed in the 21 October 2010 article \"Spectroscopic Confirmation of a Galaxy at Redshift z=8.6\" in the journal Nature.\n\nHubble Ultra Deep Field\n\nOther than putting a trophy on the wall for a new record distance, what makes this object so important? To understand this, it might be better to translate this from the most distant object to the oldest measured object. With a measured cosmological redshift of z=8.6, the object emitted the light we are seeing about 13.1 billion years ago, or more useful here, when the universe was only 600 million years old.\n\nCropped Image of UDFy-38135539\n\nWhat was it like in the universe at that age? Conditions were quite different back then. This epoch of time is when the Universe went from largely neutral gas to basically ionized plasma, called reionization.\n\nThe reionization period is about the farthest back in time that astronomers can observe. The Big Bang, 13.7 billion years ago, created a hot, plasma filled universe. Some 400,000 years after the Big Bang, temperatures cooled, from the expanding universe, so electrons and protons joined to form neutral hydrogen, and the murk cleared. By about 1 billion years after the Big Bang, this neutral hydrogen began to form stars in the first galaxies, which radiated energy and reionzied the hydrogen. Radiation from the hot new stars started to clear the opaque hydrogen plasma surrounding the newly formed galaxies that filled the cosmos at this early time.\n\nMuch of any ultraviolet light from these new stars was absorbed in the gas surrounding the stars, the remainder has been redshifted down to the infrared by the expansion of the universe over 13.1 billion years.\n\nTo obtain such dim spectra, scientists turned the the VLA (Very Large Telescope).\n\nVery Large Telescope Array\n\nThe Very Large Telescope (VLT) is made up of four separate optical telescopes (the Antu telescope, the Kueyen telescope, the Melipal telescope, and the Yepun telescope) organized in an array formation, built and operated by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) at the Paranal Observatory on Cerro Paranal, a 2,635 m high mountain in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. Each telescope has an 8.2 m aperture. The array is complemented by four movable Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs) of 1.8 m aperture. Working together in interferometric mode, the telescopes can achieve an angular resolution of around 1 milliarcsecond, meaning it could distinguish the gap between the headlights of a car located on the Moon.\n\nTo get a spectra of such a dim object, about 4 billion times dimmer than the dimmest star you can see with the naked eye, the VLA took an exposure of about 16 hours.\n\nA team of astronomers led by Paul Crowther, Professor of Astrophysics at the University of Sheffield, has used ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT), as well as archival data from the NASA\/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, to study two young clusters of stars, NGC 3603 and RMC 136a in detail. NGC 3603 is a cosmic factory where stars form frantically from the nebula's extended clouds of gas and dust, located 22 000 light-years away from the Sun (eso1005). RMC 136a (more often known as R136) is another cluster of young, massive and hot stars, which is located inside the Tarantula Nebula, in one of our neighbouring galaxies, the Large Magellanic Cloud, 165 000 light-years away (eso0613).\n\nCluster R136a1 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (Credit ESO\n\nSpectroscopic analyses of hydrogen-rich WN5\u20136 stars within the young star clusters NGC 3603 and R136 are presented, using archival Hubble Space Telescope and Very Large Telescope spectroscopy, and high spatial resolution near-IR photometry, including Multi- Conjugate Adaptive Optics Demonstrator (MAD) imaging of R136.\n\nComparisons with stellar models calculated for the main-sequence evolution of 85 \u2013 500 M\u2299 accounting for rotation suggest ages of \u223c1.5 Myr and initial masses in the range 105 \u2013 170 M\u2299 for three systems in NGC 3603, plus 165 \u2013 320 M\u2299 for four stars in R136."}

NGC 371 lies in the Small Magellanic Cloud, one of the closest galaxies to the Milky Way. (c) ESO\/Manu Mejias\n\nThe object dominating this image may resemble a pool of spilled blood, but rather than being associated with death, such regions of ionised hydrogen - known as HII regions - are sites of creation with high rates of recent star birth. NGC 371 is an example of this; it is an open cluster surrounded by a nebula. The stars in open clusters all originate from the same diffuse HII region, and over time the majority of the hydrogen is used up by star formation, leaving behind a shell of hydrogen such as the one in this image, along with a cluster of hot young stars.\n\nThe host galaxy to NGC 371, the Small Magellanic Cloud, is a dwarf galaxy a mere 200 000 light-years away, which makes it one of the closest galaxies to the Milky Way. In addition, the Small Magellanic Cloud contains stars at all stages of their evolution; from the highly luminous young stars found in NGC 371 to supernova remnants of dead stars. These energetic youngsters emit copious amounts of ultraviolet radiation causing surrounding gas, such as leftover hydrogen from their parent nebula, to light up with a colourful glow that extends for hundreds of light-years in every direction. The phenomenon is depicted beautifully in this image, taken using the FORS1 instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT).\n\nOpen clusters are by no means rare; there are numerous fine examples in our own Milky Way. However, NGC 371 is of particular interest due to the unexpectedly large number of variable stars it contains. These are stars that change in brightness over time. A particularly interesting type of variable star, known as slowly pulsating B stars, can also be used to study the interior of stars through asteroseismology, and several of these have been confirmed in this cluster. Variable stars play a pivotal role in astronomy: some types are invaluable for determining distances to far-off galaxies and the age of the Universe.\n\nThe data for this image were selected from the ESO archive by Manu Mejias as part of the Hidden Treasures competition.

{"text":"Scientists Reveal Inner Secrets of Giant Stars\n\nA new study by astronomers has shed light on new light on the evolution of stars, including our own sun.\n\nNASA's Kepler spacecraft helped scientists to distinguish profound differences inside the cores of stars that otherwise look the same on the surface. Kepler Mission is a NASA program supported by a space observatory - the Kepler spacecraft - designed to discover Earth-like planets orbiting other stars.\n\nTravis Metcalfe, National Cent A new study by astronomers has shed light on new light on the evolution of stars, including our own sun.\n\nWith findings from Kepler, astrophysicists at University of Sydney have struck a major breakthrough in the study of the senior citizens of our galaxy: stars known as Red Giants.\n\n\"Red giants are evolved stars that have exhausted the supply of hydrogen in their cores that powers nuclear fusion, and instead burn hydrogen in a surrounding shell. Towards the end of their lives, red giants begin burning the helium in their cores,\" University of Sydney's Professor Tim Bedding said in a statement.\n\n\"The changes in brightness at a star's surface is a result of turbulent motions inside that cause continuous star-quakes, creating sound waves that travel down through the interior and back to the surface,\" Professor Bedding said.\n\nUnder the right conditions, these waves interact with other waves trapped inside the star's helium core. It is these 'mixed' oscillation modes that are the key to understanding a star's particular life stage.\n\nBy carefully measuring very subtle features of the oscillations in a star's brightness, scientists found that some stars have run out of hydrogen in the center and are now burning helium, and are therefore at a later stage of life.\n\nAs a star \"burns\" hydrogen in fusion reactions, helium builds up in the star's core. Helium is denser than hydrogen, and since waves travel more quickly through denser material, waves travel faster through the core as helium builds up there.\n\nProfessor Bedding and his colleagues work in an expanding field called asteroseismology. \"In the same way that geologists use earthquakes to explore Earth's interior, we use star quakes to explore the internal structure of stars,\" he explained.\n\nProfessor Bedding said: \"We are very excited about the results. We had some idea from theoretical models that these subtle oscillation patterns would be there, but this confirms our models. It allows us to tell red giants apart, and we will be able to compare the fraction of stars that are at the different stages of evolution in a way that we couldn't before.\"\n\nThe discovery was published in the latest edition of the journal Nature."}

{"text":"A supernova remnant (SNR)\n\nThere are two common routes to a supernova: either a massive star may run out of fuel, ceasing to generate fusion energy in its core, and collapsing inward under the force of its own gravity to form a neutron star or a black hole; or a white dwarf star may accumulate (accrete) material from a companion star until it reaches a critical mass and undergoes a thermonuclear explosion.\n\nIn either case, the resulting supernova explosion expels much or all of the stellar material with velocities as much as 10% the speed of light, that is, about 30,000 km\/s. These ejecta are highly supersonic: assuming a typical temperature of the interstellar medium of 10,000 K, the Mach number can initially be > 1000. Therefore, a strong shock wave forms ahead of the ejecta, that heats the upstream plasma up to temperatures well above millions of K. The shock continuously slows down over time as it sweeps up the ambient medium, but it can expand over hundreds of thousands of years and over tens of parsecs before its speed falls below the local sound speed.\n\nOne of the best observed young supernova remnants was formed by SN 1987A, a supernova in the Large Magellanic Cloud that was observed in February 1987. Other well-known supernova remnants include the Crab Nebula, Tycho, the remnant of SN 1572, named after Tycho Brahe who recorded the brightness of its original explosion, and Kepler, the remnant of SN 1604, named after Johannes Kepler. The youngest known remnant in our galaxy is G1.9+0.3, discovered in the galactic center.[1]\n\nContents\n\nFree expansion of the ejecta, until they sweep up their own weight in circumstellar or interstellar medium. This can last tens to a few hundred years depending on the density of the surrounding gas.\n\nSweeping up of a shell of shocked circumstellar and interstellar gas. This begins the Sedov-Taylor phase, which can be well modeled by a self-similar analytic solution. Strong X-ray emission traces the strong shock waves and hot shocked gas.\n\nCooling of the shell, to form a thin (< 1 pc), dense (1-100 million atoms per cubic metre) shell surrounding the hot (few million kelvin) interior. This is the pressure-driven snowplow phase. The shell can be clearly seen in optical emission from recombining ionized hydrogen and ionized oxygen atoms.\n\nCooling of the interior. The dense shell continues to expand from its own momentum. This stage is best seen in the radio emission from neutral hydrogen atoms.\n\nMerging with the surrounding interstellar medium. When the supernova remnant slows to the speed of the random velocities in the surrounding medium, after roughly 30,000 years, it will merge into the general turbulent flow, contributing its remaining kinetic energy to the turbulence.\n\nComposite, in which a shell contains a central pulsar wind nebula, such as G11.2-0.3 or G21.5-0.9.\n\nMixed-morphology (also called \"thermal composite\") remnants, in which central thermal X-ray emission is seen, enclosed by a radio shell. The thermal X-rays are primarily from swept-up interstellar material, rather than supernova ejecta. Examples of this class include the SNRs W28 and W44. (Confusingly, W44 additionally contains a pulsar and pulsar wind nebula; so it is simultaneously both a \"classic\" composite and a thermal composite.)\n\nThe remnant of SN 1006 observed in X-rays. The inner emission comes from the hot plasma, whereas the two bright caps are produced by electrons accelerated at the shock front.\n\nSupernova remnants are considered the major source of galactic cosmic rays.[2][3][4] The connection between cosmic rays and supernovas was first suggested by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in 1934. Vitaly Ginzburg and Sergei Syrovatskii in 1964 remarked that if the efficiency of cosmic ray acceleration in supernova remnants is about 10 percent, the cosmic ray losses of the Milky Way are compensated. This hypothesis is supported by a specific mechanism called \"shock wave acceleration\" based on Enrico Fermi's ideas, which is still under development.[citation needed]\n\nIndeed, Enrico Fermi proposed in 1949 a model for the acceleration of cosmic rays through particle collisions with magnetic clouds in the interstellar medium.[5] This process, known as the \"Second Order Fermi Mechanism\", increases particle energy during head-on collisions, resulting in a steady gain in energy. A later model to produce Fermi Acceleration was generated by a powerful shock front moving through space. Particles that repeatedly cross the front of the shock can gain significant increases in energy. This became known as the \"First Order Fermi Mechanism\".[6]\n\nSupernova remnants can provide the energetic shock fronts required to generate ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Observation of the SN 1006 remnant in the X-ray has shown synchrotron emission consistent with it being a source of cosmic rays.[2] However, for energies higher than about 1015 eV a different mechanism is required as supernova remnants cannot provide sufficient energy.[6]\n\nIt is still unclear whether supernova remnants accelerate cosmic rays up to PeV energies. The future telescope CTA will help to answer this question."}
{"text":"Science News\n\nMost Powerful Eruption In The Universe Discovered\n\nJan. 6, 2005 \u2014 Astronomers have found the most powerful eruption in the universe using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. A super massive black hole generated this eruption by growing at a remarkable rate. This discovery shows the enormous appetite of large black holes, and the profound impact they have on their surroundings.\n\nShare This:\n\nThe huge eruption was seen in a Chandra image of the hot, X-ray emitting gas of a galaxy cluster called MS 0735.6+7421. Two vast cavities extend away from the super massive black hole in the cluster's central galaxy. The eruption, which has lasted for more than 100 million years, has generated energy equivalent to hundreds of millions of gamma-ray bursts.\n\nThis event was caused by gravitational energy release, as enormous amounts of matter fell toward a black hole. Most of the matter was swallowed, but some of it was violently ejected before being captured by the black hole. \"I was stunned to find that a mass of about 300 million suns was swallowed,\" said Brian McNamara of Ohio University in Athens. \"This is as large as another super massive black hole.\" He is lead author of the study about the discovery, which is in the January 6, 2005, issue of Nature.\n\nAstronomers are not sure where such large amounts of matter came from. One theory is gas from the host galaxy catastrophically cooled and was swallowed by the black hole. The energy released shows the black hole in MS 0735 has grown dramatically during this eruption. Previous studies suggest other large black holes have grown very little in the recent past, and that only smaller black holes are still growing quickly.\n\n\"This new result is as surprising as it is exciting,\" said co-author Paul Nulsen of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Mass. \"This black hole is feasting, when it should be fasting.\"\n\nRadio emission within the cavities shows jets from the black hole erupted to create the cavities. Gas is being pushed away from the black hole at supersonic speeds over a distance of about a million light-years. The mass of the displaced gas equals about a trillion suns, more than the mass of all the stars in the Milky Way.\n\nThe rapid growth of super massive black holes is usually detected by observing very bright radiation from the centers of galaxies in the optical and X-ray wavebands, or luminous radio jets. In MS 0735 no bright central radiation is found, and the radio jets are faint. The true nature of MS 0735 is only revealed through X-ray observations of the hot cluster gas.\n\n\"Until now we had no idea this black hole was gorging itself,\" said co-author Michael Wise of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass. \"The discovery of this eruption shows X-ray telescopes are necessary to understand some of the most violent events in the universe.\"\n\nThe astronomers estimated how much energy was needed to create the cavities by calculating the density, temperature and pressure of the hot gas. By making a standard assumption that 10 percent of the gravitational energy goes into launching the jets, they estimated how much material the black hole swallowed.\n\nBesides generating the cavities, some of the energy from this eruption should keep the hot gas around the black hole from cooling, and some of it may also generate large-scale magnetic fields in the galaxy cluster. Chandra observers have discovered other cavities in galaxy clusters, but this one is easily the largest and the most powerful still from an animation depict an eruption caused by a supermassive black hole. Gas and dust seen in a reddish-brown disk are being pulled around by the enormous gravity of the supermassive black hole, which is buried in the center of a large elliptical galaxy.

{"text":"Subscribe\n\nGiant star factory found in early galaxy\n\nA stellar factory millions of times larger than anything comparable in the Milky Way has been identified in a galaxy in the very early universe. The work bolsters the case that massive galaxies formed very quickly - in spectacular bursts of star formation - soon after the big bang.\n\nRegions of intense star formation, called starbursts, span a few light years at most in the Milky Way, and less than a few hundred light years in nearby, bright galaxies such as Arp 220 (pictured). But it has not been clear how large the stellar nurseries were in the early universe.\n\nTo find out, researchers led by Fabian Walter of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, carefully scrutinised a distant galaxy whose light has taken so long to reach Earth that it appears as it was just 870 million years after the big bang.\n\nWarm dust\n\nIt is visible at such distances because it hosts a beacon-like quasar, a bright region created by superheated gas falling towards a colossal black hole at the galaxy's core.\n\nThe quasar, called J114816.64+525150.3, is so bright that it overwhelms the surrounding galaxy's light at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. But the galaxy's gas and warm dust can be detected at radio and far-infrared wavelengths.\n\nUsing an array of telescopes in the French Alps, the team measured the galaxy's ionised carbon, which emits a strong signal at far-infrared wavelengths. Far-infrared radiation is thought to be a signature of dust that has been heated up by nearby star formation.\n\nMaximum rate\n\nThe ionised carbon spanned a region at the heart of the galaxy about 5000 light years across. Based on the galaxy's brightness at far-infrared wavelengths, this starburst region is thought to produce an astounding 1000 Sun-like stars every year.\n\nThat is \"about 1000 times higher than the star-formation rate of the Milky Way\", says team member Chris Carilli, chief scientist at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Socorro, New Mexico.\n\n\"It's forming stars at the maximal rate allowed . . . on scales that are 106 or 108 times larger in volume\" than similar regions in the Milky Way, he continues. \"That's remarkable.\"\n\nMerging galaxies?\n\nThe immense scale of the stellar factory is probably due to the fact that there was a lot more gas around in the early universe, Carilli says. Matter in the universe was indeed much denser soon after the big bang, since space itself has expanded over time.\n\nBut researchers don't know what ignited the star birth in the first place. Mergers between galaxies can trigger gas clouds to collapse into stars (and cause matter to fall into a galaxy's central black hole, turning on a quasar). However, it's not clear from the observations whether or not a merger was involved in this case.\n\nAn alternative theory, put forward recently by a team led by Avishai Dekel of Hebrew University, suggests that cold gas flowing into galaxies - in either smooth streams or clumps - may trigger starbursts. \"This may be an example of this phenomenon,\" Dekel told New Scientist.\n\nSudden and dramatic\n\nCarilli says gas may have fallen onto the galaxy over a long period of time, but some gravitational disturbance - perhaps a merger - must have suddenly kick-started its star birth. \"Empirically, what we're seeing is a pretty dramatic event,\" he says.\n\nThe discovery suggests massive galaxies like this one, which is a blob-shaped 'elliptical' rather than a spiral, \"form fairly quickly, relatively early in the universe\", says Carilli.\n\nIndeed, a similar process appears to have occurred in the Milky Way. The stars that form a bulge around its centre - essentially a miniature elliptical galaxy - all seem to have formed around the same time, in a starburst billions of years ago.\n\n'Pathological objects'\n\nBut Carilli says it's too soon to say whether all galaxies formed their stars so quickly, or whether some eked out stars slowly over time.\n\nThat's because only the heaviest, brightest objects can be seen at such distances. \"All we can study are 'pathological' objects - rare, extreme luminosity objects,\" he says. \"They don't really tell us about normal galaxy formation; they tell us about massive galaxy formation.\"\n\nA project called ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter\/submillimeter Array), which will be the world's largest array of millimetre-wave telescopes when it is completed in 2012, will shed light on more typical galaxies. It will be able to study objects 100 times less massive than can be detected with current telescopesStar Nurseries?\n\nWed Feb 04 21:27:25 GMT 2009 by Sergey\n\nIt is hard for me to simply take on word that stars are formed here... First gas does not condense to form stars: it dissipates outwards. Second, stars colliding to make a new star is not really forming stars anyway. Please give proof for the formation of stars.\n\nStar Nurseries?\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\nWed Feb 04 22:56:23 GMT 2009 by Slobodan\n\n\"A distant galaxy whose light has taken so long to reach Earth that it appears as it was just 870 million years after the big bang. It is visible at such distances because it hosts a beacon-like quasar, a bright region created by superheated gas falling towards a colossal black hole at the galaxy's core.\"\n\nSomething is wrong with standard Big Bang theory!\n\n1. How colossal big holes formed only 870 million years after Big Bang or maybe even earlier? Even super massive star life cycle is about few billion of years, averages stars, like our Sun, have a life span probably 10 billion of years, small stars, maybe 10 times that.\n\n2. What cause so fast collapses if the Universe expands rapidly after the Big Bang?\n\n4. What caused forming of colossal BHs at the very early time after Big Bang - if this theory is correct? Obviously it couldn't be collapse of super massive stars.\n\n5. Did?\n\nThat could mean that the space itself made a strong ripples in space, causing immediate collapses of condensed matter into gravitational centers, causing forming of primordial BHs that in second step started attracting matter in galaxy formations, burning up lights and newborn stars?\n\n6. Why we detect Carbon in primordial galaxies not older than few hundred million of years?\n\nMost of the heavy elements in the universe, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, are created by fusion in the centers of stars. Galaxies in the early universe had not had enough time to create all the heavy elements that exist now.\n\n7. How carbon appeared in so young and early Universe, if the average lifetime of star is from couple of billion to hundreds billion years and 870 million years old galaxy did not have enough time to create Carbon and heavier elements???\n\nStellar nurseries in early Universe are plausible, heavier elements and colossal black holes in very early Universe somehow do not fit the standard model.\n\nIf Universe was born (which I doubt seriously) 13.7 billion of years, our cosmology owns us a lot of answers on facts that do not fit standard model and Big Bang theory.\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\nThu Feb 05 11:33:42 GMT 2009 by Slobodan\n\nYes, I know all those blah, blah, blah, that is the reason I am questioning here, all those blah simply do not fit standard cosmology model and our scientists have to fight hard to imagine and create new theories, or hypothesis to include incoming data that do not fit standard theory into standard theory. It is a kind of circular logic that fundamentally cannot be true.\n\nPeteR: What is about time? Time will slowdown, according to our measurements and Relativity theory, it will not run faster in order to speed up burnout of stars and collapsing into black holes.\n\nAnd even the Time Relativity is questionable. Is the time slowdown in presence of large mass (gravity) or just energy wave oscillations slowdown, influenced by gravity? Do our atomic clocks on Earth slowdown compared to those on orbits because of time slowing on Earth, or oscillations (frequencies), which we use to reference the time, shift to lower frequencies due to gravity pull?\n\nIs the time or energy oscillations slowing down, causing us to perceive it as time dilatation?\n\nIs the red shift caused only by speeding up galaxies due to expansion of Universe, or electromagnetic waves slow down their oscillations in presence of large mass on their way from very distant parts of Universe, shifting thus to red?\n\nMaybe the red shift is caused by second, so we actually cannot use it for measuring distances in Universe, since it could be caused by both effects - moving of galaxies as well as slowing down oscillations due to gravity pull through vast space filled with enermous quantities of matter?\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\nThu Feb 05 13:08:43 GMT 2009 by Slobodan\n\nIn addition to my previous reply, I must add that I am really doubtful about noticed redshift as Doppler Redshift caused by receding galaxies or expanding space causing stretching of light waves. That means that all estimations about distances in our Universe based on redshift would be redefined and reconsidered.\n\nWhat I had in mind as possible alternative is: energy loss proportional to traveled distance = frequency reduction per traveled distance =redshift proportional to traveled distance and all of this correlated to overall mass in the traveled path could be only one among a number of explanations. This is contrary to opinion that Hubble's redshift prop. to expansion speed, by Doppler effect or redshift caused by stretching light waves due to expansion if space..\n\nRed shift is not continuous. It is quantized at a rate of approximately 8km\/s.\n\nThis sort of series of jumps in the redshift measurements has been recorded. It would be expected that they should be like a car when it is accelerating: showing a smooth series of measurements. But this is evidently not what the data is showing. It is for this reason that the assumption of an expanding universe based on redshift measurements may be false. Could the universe expand in jumps?\n\nBack to the article now: observations were made on galaxy born some 870 million years after Big Bang - that means it is old something less than 13 billion of years right?\n\nBut, how this age was estimated? By measuring red shift of the galaxy, which shows us it's distance? Is is a real distance? What if Doppler' shift didn't cause measured redshift? Maybe it was the influence of overall matter \/ gravity pull on the light wave path from the galaxy to us? What is the real distance \/ age in this viewpoint?\n\nAnd finally - what is TIME? Time simply could show not to be a fundamental dimension constituting so-called space-time. Time could be simply a way we catalog a series of otherwise unrelated events. If no events\/changes occurred, there could be no time. In this viewpoint time is not fundamental dimension, it is only a relation to universal motion. If you can imagine absolutely still Universe in which there are no movement at all, in which even subatomic particles do not move there are no energies as well because without oscillations there are no energies - can you tell me what is the TIME?\n\nNo motion - no energy - no time. Time is just an attribute of universal motion.\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\n1. \"Even super massive star life cycle is about few billion of years, averages stars, like our Sun, have a life span probably 10 billion of years, small stars, maybe 10 times that.\"\n\nWRONG. Stars that are sufficiently massive to produce core-collapse supernovae (above about 4 solar masses) remain on the Main Sequence for LESS THAN 20 MILLION years. Stars of 25 solar masses last only 5 million years - only 1\/1000 as long as a 1.1 solar mass star! Stars even more massive live even shorter periods of time, under a million years for stars over 100 solar masses. 870 million years IS entirely sufficient to contain multiple generations of massive stars - on the order of 100 generations! Supernovae are the chief means of synthesizing heavy elements and dispersing them back into the interstellar medium, while stars under 3 or 4 solar masses never so much as synthesize any elements heavier than carbon before they quietly settle into a white dwarf where such carbon is sequestered (in most cases) permanently (unless they acquire more mass than 1.4 solar masses, in which case they detonate as Type Ia supernovae). Therefore all the lesser-mass stars are almost completely irrelevant to the issue. And how do \"colossal big holes form only 870 million years after the Big Bang or maybe even earlier?\" SIMPLE! Many current models show that's more than adequate time for supermassive black holes to form. Gravitational collapse of high-density regions of the intergalactic medium as part of the initial protogalactic growth was rampant during the early universe because the average density of the proimordial medium was far higher than it is currently. These models show that supermassive black hole growth was already well underway within the first 100 million years. The first black holes, according to these models, already existed by the first 10 million years! Naturally, confirmation by observation will prove exceedingly difficult, since we are forced to examine redshifts of Z greater than 100.\n\nYou ask:\n\n2. \"What cause so fast collapses if the Universe expands rapidly after the Big Bang?\"\n\nSimple. Localized high-density regions of the primordial medium DON'T expand like the universe at the large scale does. Why? Because gravitation retards and prevents such expansion, and will induce the highest-density regions to CONTRACT.\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\n4. \"What caused forming of colossal BHs at the very early time after Big Bang - if this theory is correct? Obviously it couldn't be collapse of super massive stars.\"\n\nObviously you don't know what you are talking about. It's been well demonstrated ever since 1964 (Iben and independently, Feynman) that the \"super-star\" hypothesis introduced by Hoyle and Fowler the year before to explain quasar energy output (that is, with masses between a thousand and a billion solar masses) doesn't work because such massive amounts of matter are inherently unstable and inevitably collapse to form black holes in a very short time. Even after continued and strenuous theoretical efforts throughout the sixties to find ways of \"propping them up\" against their self-gravitation, via a variety of mechanisms, including fast-rotating massive disks, turbulence, nuclear reactions, magnetic fields and even ad hoc exotic fields, and sophisticated models that often combined these and other dynamic effects in the form of magnetized spinning superstars or disks dubbed \"spinars\" or \"magnetoids\", NONE of them were found to be stable. By the turn of the decade (Bardeen & Wagoner, 1969 and Salpeter & Wagoner, 1971 and Woltjer, 1971 and others) the conclusion was inescapable: all such superstar models unstable and evolve too rapidly to explain the sustained output observed in quasars. All these mechanisms were unequivocally shown to be inadequate to prevent instability and collapse into black holes.\n\nYou incoherently pose:\n\n5. \"Did?\" [sic]\n\nYES! They CAN have! Why shouldn't gravitational agglomeration be SIMULTANEOUSLY capable of leading to BOTH star formation AND critical densities leading to collapse? What makes you think that a region containing a sufficient amount of matter to bring it within its gravitational radius (or event horizon) could be resisted by internal pressures and temperatures, however intense? A homogenous supermassive parcel of hydrogen gas (say, a billion solar masses) can easily collapse within its event horizon without any part of it ever having acheived densities or pressures necessary to initiate thermonuclear fusion reactions. The average density of such \"colossal\" black holes is IN FACT surprisingly LOW. But if in the real universe the same parcel of gas should contract and produce a compact star cluster, IT MATTERS NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST that the individual members of a cluster produce a pressure to halt their individual collapse: THE STAR CLUSTER AS A WHOLE WOULD INEVITABLY COLLAPSE WITHIN ITS EVEN HORIZON.\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\n6. \"Why we detect Carbon in primordial galaxies not older than few hundred million of years?\"\n\nSimple. Because core-collapse supernovae that produce the carbon are a result of massive stars that live only between 1 to 20 million years.\n\nYou declare:\n\n\"Most of the heavy elements in the universe, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, are created by fusion in the centers of stars. Galaxies in the early universe had not had enough time to create all the heavy elements that exist now.\"\n\nThat's totally untrue. Most heavy elements were created by MASSIVE stars. Galaxies in the early universe in fact DID have plenty of time to create all these heavy elements. Therefore it is even more clear that all the heavy elements that \"exist now\" had plenty of time SINCE then to have been synthesized by even MORE generations of massive stars.\n\nYou repeat yourself a third time:\n\n7. \"How carbon appeared in so young and early Universe, if the average lifetime of star is from couple of billion to hundreds billion years and 870 million years old galaxy did not have enough time to create Carbon and heavier elements???\"\n\nFirst, the \"average age\" of stars has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with it! The \"average\" age of stars, if weighted to their relative abundances by mass, would be well over 100 billion years! It matters NOT AT ALL however! The vast majority of stars are low-mass of M-Type red dwarfs, which can last on the Main Sequence for TRILLIONS of years! THOUSANDS OF BILLIONS OF YEARS! But they never produce any elements heavier than helium, and even if they were ever given a chance to finish their lives (don't hold your breath!) almost none of their product is broadcast back into the interstellar medium. Stars of the Sun's mass and below (K and G-Type stars) are hardly any more productive: they live roughly from tens to hundreds of billions of years, and none of them are capable of synthesizing carbon either! Stars above the mass of the Sun but not massive enough to complete fusion reactions leading to core-collapse (with masses roughly between 1.2 and 3 or 4 solar masses, comprising the spectral classes F and A-Types) may synthesize nuclei SHORT of Nickel 56 (or the eventual product isotope Iron 56, for A-Type stars approaching 4 solar masses) but are incapable of exploding them all back into the interstellar medium, although Red Giant phases of these stars can and do often relatively gently cast off their outer layers that contain carbon dust. You need stars of Type B and O - stars above about 4 solar masses - to reach nucleosynthesis of Iron and therefore supernovahood. THESE are the stars that efficiently cast their heavier element products back into the interstellar space. Stars between about 4 and 8 solar masses produce neutron star remnants, but stars heavier than 8 solar masses almost invariably leave \"stellar mass black holes\".\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\n\"Stellar nurseries in early Universe are plausible, heavier elements and colossal black holes in very early Universe somehow do not fit the standard model.\"\n\nSomehow? As I've outlined above, maybe it's because you have a completely wrong idea of what the \"standard model\" is.\n\nYou add:\n\n\"If Universe was born (which I doubt seriously) 13.7 billion of years, our cosmology owns us a lot of answers on facts that do not fit standard model and Big Bang theory.\"\n\nWell, in case you didn't realize it, science or nature does not care a whit what anybody believes or may \"doubt seriously\". It's obviously up to science to figure out what nature is up to. We can't rest comfortably on our cozy notions and opinions of what's going on, refuse to make any effort to understand what science actually HAS learned thus far about nature, then offer such laughably mistaken opinions as serious arguments about why the scientific consensus doesn't conform to your standards of coherence.\n\nSolution: READ SOME GOOD TEXTBOOKS ON ASTROPHYSICS AND COSMOLOGY....BEFORE you speak up pretending to understand anything.\n\n\n\n1, Universe was CREATED form singularity (nothing) in a rapid creation of time and space, followed by very rapid inflation of space that probably flatten all initial curvatures in primordial space\n\nProofs? NONE.\n\n2. Inflated Universe continue to expand after initial inflation followed by cooling of \"soup of primordial energies, that lead to condensation of subatomic particles, that with progressive cool down start to form particles which continue to expand with expansion of Universe.\n\nProofs? NONE!\n\n3. Condensed matter started to collect about local gravitation centers due to its own mass, opposing expansion of space, thus forming \"islands\" of matter in a vast space, like fractals, that lead to primordial galaxy formations and whatever else (primordial BHs, colossal BHs in Galaxy centers etc.). All further hypotheses and calculations are based on such premises.\n\nWhen you experts measure spectral lines, object mass, temperatures, chemical composition, relative speeds and distances, average stars life rate, etc., you are using the best scientific knowledge, and no one can oppose what you really get as ultimate evidences.\n\nWhen you experts start to imagine the ultimate truth, Universe origin, you are not astronomy experts anymore, you are rather metaphysicists. You are talking about something unconfirmed, not testable, beyond perception barrier.\n\nWhat proofs you have about Big Bang, except some observations that initially fit to this theory? NONE.\n\nCREATION! Universe was created from singularity, time and space was created at the moment of Big Bang. Nothing existed before it since eve the time didn't exist? Is it a science or philosophy, metaphysics, religion?\n\nI am sorry I have to tell you experts, (since I am and ordinary mortal BScEE), that those hypotheses are not more plausible than those which stated that the Earth was flat, or that the Earth is a center of the Universe.\n\nWhen you found Universe is expanding, you tried to calculate it. You??\n\nThen you put everything in computer simulations and extensive mathematical tools, which confirmed your Imaginary Universe. Starting from unexplainable origin and newborn theory which does not fit exactly with observations, inventing new imaginary stuff just to make mathematics work, you use mathematical results and simulations as proofs for your initial premises.\n\nYou may call it science, I call it CIRCULAR LOGIC.\n\n.\n\nWhen you talk about Cosmology, you are not on scientific field anymore, you are in the field of philosophy, religion and metaphysics and you have no more rights to knock others that do not feel, believe, or think like you. A lot of your, so called knowledge, is based in premises that could be opposed sooner or later. Knowing hypotheses and unconfirmed theories are not knowledge- it is a guess. If you, dear expert, would really like to understand the Universe, you should first wait quantum physicists to give you answers what is matter, energy, vacuum, gravity etc. Without understanding of quantum physics there is no ultimate understanding of cosmology.\n\n.\n\nBut when you start swearing on Hubble, Einstein, ranting about creation form nothing, red.\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\nAlthough you do not like my note - in addition to my previous post, I will add it here and continue.\n\n1. Red Shit, Hubble law, gravitational redshift, cosmological redshift... well a lot of particular cases used at convenience to measure distance in Universe.\n\nBut, is recessional velocity the only thing that can produce a redshift? You are trying to keep my mouth shut, I am not reputable astronomer, right, then please refer to a reputable astronomer Mr. Halton Arp \n\nYou can even write to him asking him to keep his mouth shut.He has a different opinion about red shift as recessional speed measure.\n\nSome quasars may be double stars, with one member being an ordinary star and the other exhibiting a large red shift and being labeled as a quasar. The 100,000th Hubble Image is a good candidate for such a pair. Ken Kellerman of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory has also suggested that the red shift of quasars may be intrinsic and not an indication of their distance in a classic 1972 paper Radio Galaxies, Quasars and Cosmology published in the Astronomical Journal.\n\nQuasars, according to their red shift are the most distance objects, right? If quasars are so distant they will not show proper motions.\n\n\n\nThanks for your patience, next time before open your mouth to knock somebody, shamelessly doubting his knowledge, please refer to thousands of alternate theories pages and think twice.\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\nMon Feb 09 06:32:59 GMT 2009 by anonymous\n\nPART 1\n\nLet's review your \"review\".\n\nIt is not surprising that you \"don't understand\" my Part 2 reply. You are mistaken in almost everything. Yet you MUST understand enough to say, in the same breath, that i'm \"not opposing\" you there, and color it a confirmation of what you say.\n\nAt least I'm an expert SOMETHING, sir - in Astronomy, yes, which is indubitably pertinent. And your expertise is in...have you figured that one out yet?\n\nThere is no such thing as a \"Standard Big Bang Theory\" of the kind you harbor in your head. The conclusion of the Big Bang comes about from three simple considerations: The first is that observations show that the universe is EXPANDING, indicating that the universe was smaller in the past. Run time back sufficiently far, and one cannot escape the conclusion that the universe had an explosive beginning at a finite point in the past. This is a simple, logical and inescapable deduction. There is nothing mysterious about it and there isn't anything outrageous about the implications. It's what nature says. The other consideration is that - before the expansion of the universe was revealed by Edwin Hubble and others in the 1920's - Einstein's General Theory of Relativity (GR) predicted that the universe must be dynamically expanding or contracting: a static universe was not a stable solution, which is why Einstein forced a \"Cosmological Term\" representing a repulsive force onto it. The third consideration is another OBSERVATION: the discovery and measurement (in 1964) of the 2.7 K temperature of the Cosmic Background Radiation that pervades the observable universe from our viewpoint. This TOO was PREDICTED by GR the previous year - on the assumption\n\nSurely you do not you imagine that the universe should be discovered to be expanding only AFTER the theory predicted it, AND that a completely different line of evidence - from a measurement of a background temperature completely consistent with a hot Big Bang, is all a mere coincidence?\n\nLet's get this tedious business over with:\n\nYou state:\n\n1. \"Universe was CREATED form singularity (nothing) in a rapid creation of time and space, followed by very rapid inflation of space that probably flatten all initial curvatures in primordial space. Proofs? NONE.\"\n\nNeither do you have any \"proofs\" that this HYPOTHESIS is grievously mistaken. Show us. Where are your counter-proofs? I see NONE.\n\n\"Standard Theory\" says absolutely nothing whatsoever about what a singularity can or can't do. NOBODY KNOWS. Everyone who knows about the subject, unlike you, realizes this. What the \"standard theory\" CAN and DOES address - and very effectively - is the primordial conditions that prevailed at very early times AFTER the initial singularity. These theoretical studies, employing both quantum theory (QT) as well as GR have consistently shown how space-time, matter, energy, forces and fields have emerged. Every step fits right in, there are no major glaring sore thumbs sticking out anywhere, and we are suitably confident we have the general picture right because we observe confirmation of it - such as the abundance of helium and deuterium calculated from the theory during primordial nucleosynthesis of hydrogen nuclei. The 2.7 K Cosmic Background Radiation is another confirmation that we are on the right track in understanding AT LEAST WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE INITIAL SINGULARITY.\n\nYou declare:\n\n2. \"Inflated Universe continue to expand after initial inflation followed by cooling of \"soup of primordial energies, that lead to condensation of subatomic particles, that with progressive cool down start to form particles which continue to expand with expansion of Universe. Proofs? NONE!\"\n\nOh please. Don't you bother to read ANY research at all? Can't you make just a teensy-weensy effort to comprehend what cosmologists and astrophysicists have established through observational confirmation? Let me help you get started. PROOF: Observed increase in redshift with distance: Conclusion, the universe is expanding, exactly as GR predicted. Check. PROOF: Observed relative abundances of hydrogen, helium and deuterium conform excellently with the calculated estimates derived from studies of primordial nucleosynthesis using the Standard Model (of QT!) as well as GR. Check. PROOF: Observed Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) with a characteristic temperature and wavelength curve beautifully consistent with a hot era in the past (which is highly redshifted) and which was also predicted by the same theoretical considerations, to an astonishing degree of accuracy - an accomplishment that cosmologists are rightly proud of. Check. PROOF: observed mass-density distribution in the CMB that is consistent with an initial inflationary period which smoothed out density fluctuations to just the pattern predicted by the theory. Check.\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\nMon Feb 09 06:40:54 GMT 2009 by anonymous\n\nPART 2:\n\nI could go on - there are MANY other \"proofs\", and tons more circumstantial evidence which ALL paint a single coherent and consistent picture. But I don't suppose you will bother to read about them. Your argument is based entirely on the fact that you like to be contrary, and that's about it.\n\nI'm going to skip over much of the rest of the ludicrous claims you make, and only pick out a few of the juiciest, since they more clearly demonstrate that you do not know what you are talking about.\n\nLike this gem, for example:\n\n\"When you experts measure spectral lines, object mass, temperatures, chemical composition, relative speeds and distances, average stars life rate, etc., you are using the best scientific knowledge, and no one can oppose what you really get as ultimate evidences.\"\n\nPray, enlighten us all, dear All-Knowing Sage and Protector of Wisdom, what constitutes this \"ultimate evidences\" of yours. What is that?\n\nAnd this:\n\n\"What proofs you have about Big Bang, except some observations that initially fit to this theory? NONE.\"\n\nNone that you recognize, that much is laughably clear.\n\nAnd this:\n\n\"CREATION! Universe was created from singularity, time and space was created at the moment of Big Bang. Nothing existed before it since eve the time didn't exist? Is it a science or philosophy, metaphysics, religion?\"\n\nNone of the above. REAL scientists (you know, real EXPERTS?) know very well how to shrug their shoulders and say, \"Hmmm, that's weird. I don't know what's going on.\" But at least they have the courage and fortitude to make an attempt to find out and try to understand. You? You don't even understand that you DON'T understand, or WHY you don't understand. You're just a mess.\n\nAnd this:\n\n\"I am sorry I have to tell you experts, (since I am and ordinary mortal BScEE)...\"\n\nWell, it certainly appears that your \"ordinary mortal BScEE\" status makes you think you \"have to tell [us] experts\" about how wrong we are. As if a LACK of expertise was a legitimate qualification to judge expertise. I will give you high marks for making us laugh. That is SOME achievement, I suppose.\n\nAnd this:\n\n\"When you found Universe is expanding, you tried to calculate it.\"\n\nNo. That's not true. The theory (GR) predicted it and the calculation was performed BEFORE it was confirmed by observation. See, this is an example of why people who don't understand what they are talking about should keep their trap shut and make an attempt to listen to people who may know a great deal more about a field than they do.\n\nMore:\n\n\"You??\"\n\nWhat the heck do you want from scientists? You want them to know everything to begin with. Except they don't, and none of us ever claim to. But YOU think they do, or think they SHOULD. Then when they discover anything new and appropriately attempt to accommodate new findings within their models, you cry \"GOTCHA!\" and ridicule us for not knowing everything in the first place.\n\nAnd the whole time you don't understand a GNAT about what you are talking about.\n\nMore:\n\n\"You may call it science, I call it CIRCULAR LOGIC.\"\n\nThat's a very amusing charge, coming from one who is utterly DIZZY with it himself.\n\n\".\"\n\nI GUESS that you have never ever heard of deductive logic and self-consistent lines of reasoning and the testing of hypotheses against rigorous theoretical arguments as well as the ultimate verdict of nature through empirical experiment and observation. We CAN'T measure or \"estimate the age of Universe, distances, relative speeds, total mass, energy and other facts\"? Are you serious? We \"even do not know how much dimensions [the universe] has?\" We don't? So far, we are absolutely positively certain that there are at least 3 spatial and 1 time dimension. You care to dispute this? There may be more. Some models require more. We just do not know yet. You care to dispute THAT? If there are any more dimensions to be discovered besides the 4 that are absolutely, positively so far known about, we'll get back to you. Science isn't a cheap parlor guessing-game, chum.\n\nYour argument is basically this: \"I don't understand a DAMNED THING, and this qualifies me as an expert.\"\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\nMon Feb 09 06:44:29 GMT 2009 by anonymous\n\nPART 3:\n\n\"When you talk about Cosmology, you are not on scientific field anymore, you are in the field of philosophy, religion and metaphysics and you have no more rights to knock others that do not feel, believe, or think like you.\"\n\nThat's not true. When I talk about cosmology, I am referring to a SCIENCE. Why? Because, as one expert in the field once noted: \"It's impossible to do General Relativity WITHOUT doing cosmology\". GR has been confirmed by nature to a spectacular degree of precision. If that's not science I'll eat this computer.\n\nDo we have the \"rights to knock others that do not feel, believe, or think like you.\" Oh, absolutely! Do you think it is unfair to point out that you were mistaken in your assertion that massive stars live for \"a few billion years\"? That you were mistaken in thinking that all stars synthesize heavy elements and recycle them back into the interstellar medium? That you were wrong to claim that there wasn't enough time in 870 million years to produce the observed presence of carbon in the medium? That it is unfair of me to point out error after error, mistake after mistake, because people ought to have the freedom to speak on issues even when they are factually wrong? Does it hurt your feelings if anybody points out you are mistaken? Do you feel insecure about it? Here's a field you missed in your list of \"philosophy, religion and metaphysics\": how about psychology? Or maybe even psychiatry?\n\nAnd this:\n\n\"If you, dear expert, would really like to understand the Universe, you should first wait quantum physicists to give you answers what is matter, energy, vacuum, gravity etc. Without understanding of quantum physics there is no ultimate understanding of cosmology.\"\n\nAnd you, dear ignoramus, of course understand quantum physics, don't you? Or, at least, you are \"waiting for quantum physicists to give you the answers\" before you pass judgment on whether anybody in science understands everything as clearly as you do.\n\nI'M a \"quantum physicist\". AND a cosmologist, who feels very much at home in GR as well as quantum mechanics. In cosmology, you see, we have no choice but to treat quantum mechanics relativistically. Or didn't you know that? Of course not. How silly of me. You already know everything BECAUSE you know so precious little. I forgot how that works with you. So I guess you'll have to wait for me to give you the answers, as you say. Too bad you haven't been listening or making any attempt to comprehend anything I've said so far. Of course, you will have to wait a very very long time indeed before you get any \"ultimate understanding of cosmology\" out of me or any of my colleagues. Isn't that terrible?\n\nThis one is my favorite:\n\n\".\"\n\nNo, your general knowledge is resoundingly atrocious. No, you really DO have a BASIC LACK OF KNOWLEDGE, PRECISELY AS I SAID. And it is astounding that while you can admit that \"of course my ignorance is even wider [and] I cannot deny it\" this ignorance entitles you to tell experts they are full of it. You are \"just refusing to blindly accept interpretations and unconfirmed theories as the starting point for deeper understanding\", but you remain stubbornly blind to the fact that your idea of \"interpretations and unconfirmed theories\" are utterly mistaken. And why CAN'T any \"interpretations and unconfirmed theories\" BE the starting point to a deeper understanding? Where do you propose to place a starting point - in stubbornness, ignorance and a refusal to accept elementary principles, real evidence and established facts? Is that any foundation to build a starting point?\n\nI'm glad you \"won't argue\" with me \"about a method of measuring planet mass by measuring wobbling of a home star.\" That diversion would be tedious indeed, I'm sure.\n\nAnd this:\n\n\"But when you start swearing on Hubble, Einstein, ranting about creation form nothing,...\"\n\nUm, EXCUSE ME? I am \"ranting\" because i comprehensively examine your long and tedious overtures? I am \"ranting\" about \"creation from nothing\"? Show me where I said that. Show me where I \"swear\" Hubble or Einstein ever said this. Show me. You cannot. Why? Because it isn't there. Why do you claim it is there? Because you obviously haven't actually READ my comments. You just skimmed over it, presumed I was \"ranting\", and make false claims about it's content based on pure whim.\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\nMon Feb 09 06:48:56 GMT 2009 by anonymous\n\nPART 4:\n\nYou go on, thinking to mine out all of the words you find offensive - you know, the words i used to correct your errors, the words that signify scientific facts, the words that accurately convey the science, which you do not understand:\n\n\"...red.\"\n\nI never ONCE mentioned the word \"multiverse\". I never ONCE mentioned \"wormholes\". I never ONCE mentioned \"holographic universes\". I never ONCE mentioned any \"not confirmable BS\". You must indeed be blind.\n\nAnd no, you cannot \"argue against this with equal strength and arguments as you can use to defend your standpoints\" in any other way other than in the sense that a Big Mouth satisfies itself it is making an \"argument\" because it makes a great noise.\n\nYou follow up your incessant baloney, asking, quite rhetorically:\n\n\"But, is recessional velocity the only thing that can produce a redshift?\"\n\nWell, slobo, if you knew anything about GR, then you would already KNOW that my colleagues and I would immediately answer \"SURE!\" There really IS such a thing as gravitational red shift. It's been OBSERVED. MANY MANY TIMES OVER, CONFIRMED. And, if you knew the most elementary principles of cosmology, you would already KNOW that we find a consistent match between red shift with distance, and that whatever departures from smoothness in the expansion is entirely explainable by the independent motions of galaxies which are superimposed over the general expansion.\n\nBut, see, there's the problem: you DON'T know. You know almost nothing, and you are proud of it.\n\nWhat we do NOT find is any spectral shifts that are inconsistent with the velocity of recession of a source carried by overall expansion of the universe. Halton Arp first suggested in the early 1970's that he had found significant numbers of \"discordant red-shifts (those that could not be completely explained by recession: he did NOT pretend to say ALL red-shifts were caused by something else, such as gravitational acceleration of dense compact objects). In every \"bizarre\" case of a discordant red-shift he could find, it eventually turned out to be a chance alignment between a foreground galaxy and a background galaxy or quasar, often distorted and amplified by gravitational lensing, or just plain mistaken because of uncertainties produced by the relatively insensitive ground-based data Arp had to work with at the time. This is all now ANCIENT astronomical history. Arp is a kind of tragic figure in astronomy, often dismissed as a gadfly, but he was not ungifted and his proposal was certainly not dismissed out of hand by his colleagues without a very careful examination. This is virtue you may adopt.\n\nYou go on foaming at the mouth:\n\n\"[link to paper you do not understand]...or any of 30 other alternative redshift theories explanations and data reports. Which one you will trust? Can you dear expert claim ultimately that you can calculate distances and age of distant galaxies according to standard model only?\"\n\nYes. Within a reasonable error range, absolutely. Done. We do it ALL THE TIME. It's ROUTINE. It works. Every time we get a calculated result, it is consistent with completely independent criteria. But when you ask me which of \"30 other alternative redshift theories explanations and data reports\" I would \"trust\"? None. I do not trust ANY theory. I'm a scientist. I'm not allowed to trust any idea as \"ultimate\" and I have no regrets whatsoever that I shall; never ever achieve an \"ultimate understanding\" such as you require.\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\nMon Feb 09 06:52:24 GMT 2009 by anonymous\n\nPART 5 of 5:\n\nYou rattle on for quite a bit more, then invite me to \"shut the mouths\" of my colleagues:\n\n\" Thanks for your patience, next time before open your mouth to knock somebody, shamelessly doubting his knowledge, please refer to thousands of alternate theories pages and think twice.\"\n\nWe don't think twice, sir. We think OVER AND OVER AND OVER. And then we think some more. We ALWAYS endeavor to look under every stone to find an \"alternative theory\" (as you prefer to distinguish them) that does as good or a better job than others (such as the \"standard model\", which you so completely misidentify and keep insisting is something completely different from what it actually is).\n\nWhat makes you think we don't? What makes you think we aren't expending every effort to improve - or, if possible, supplant - the \"standard model\" which, by the way, addresses particle physics through BOTH quantum and relativistic considerations. The \"alternatives\" you refer to so far are ALL given a chance to prove themselves better at describing the data. If they DON'T, we toss them. If they are as good as what we know works best so far, we don't necessarily adopt it just because it may be different, but we remain very suspicious if it isn't as simple and elegant as what we already have. We are apt to toss them out if they are not. If an alternative flies forward on gleaming wings and alights upon our minds as a magnificent and elegant generalization that simplifies or even more accurately describes nature than what we have, then by golly we'll grab it up.\n\nI restricted my comments to General Relativity, which VERY VERY SUCCESFULLY describes gravity as a curvature of space-time, because it was clear from what you stated that you had not an inkling of what it is about. NONE. ZILCH.\n\nInstead of reading what I said, and attempting to accommodate it into your knowledge (such as it is) you chose instead to have a cow. A GREAT BIG ONE.\n\nThe history of science is defined by such major revolutionary stepping stones: The Copernican revolution dethroning the conceited centrality of humans. The Newtonian revolution uniting force with mass and acceleration, and the motions of objects under the influence of gravity. The Darwinian revolution describing the evolution of species through natural selection. The Maxwellian revolution unifying electricity and magnetism. The Einsteinian revolution of Special and General Relativity, as well as quantum mechanics and cosmology. Take your pick. Look between them. There are COUNTLESS strides, small and large, between each of these\n\nI don't have to argue with my colleagues over what you fantasize are differences between my viewpoint and theirs. Don't you understand ANYTHING? You aren't arguing from their point of view. I AM arguing from their point of view. Every single reputable scientist would unhesitatingly agree that your understanding of physics is dismal, and while not all of them would support my attempts to enlighten you, none of them would disagree that my responses are specifically aimed at your misunderstandings, not as statements intended for polite, general consumption, as yours are not either. You see? We have an \"argument\". A \"dispute\". This is okay and totally legitimate. It's between what YOU think and what I think. I can only rely on established facts and scientific evidence to support my counter-arguments against your statements. You, on the other hand, are free to roam throughout the far vaster realm of irrationality, fantasy, error and mistaken notion, to your heart's content, in order to lob up your arguments.\n\nI bat them down, you have a cow.\n\nThis is the behavior of a brat, not somebody who really wishes to understand anything.\n\nMost of all? Like almost every one of my colleagues, to the very last one of them, they also share with me a pet aversion: I can't STAND crackpots who do not know what they are talking about either. And the louder they get, the more we can't stand it. Eventually, something's got to give.\n\nMany of us prefer to try to ignore them. Most of us have tried valiantly. A brave few of us may be somewhat foolish not to (and without a doubt it eats into our time) but somebody has finally, at long last, got to stand up and challenge this growing scourge of flaky thinking, or we shall all soon be incapable of ignoring them at all.\n\nGo on. Yap on. You have no idea how foolish you appear. This would of course be entirely consistent with the premise that you do not know what you are talking about.\n\nThe heart of the nearby galaxy Arp 220, shown in this Hubble image, is bursting with star birth.

For the first time, we can see a supernova from an alien perspective,\" said lead author Armin Rest of Harvard University.\n\nThe technique that the astronomers used is based on the familiar echo concept, but instead of sound it is applied to light.\n\nWhen dust clouds in space reflect the light from the supernova it bounces off them; by catching those reflections, the astronomers were able to capture the images on them.\n\nThus, by collecting reflections from various dust clouds in different areas of space, they composed images of Cassiopeia A that depicted different angles of the supernova.\n\nAdditionally, by grouping all the images from multiple angles together with X-ray data on the supernova remnants and the movement of the left over neutron star, the astronomers were able to get a 3-D perspective as well.\n\nThe team observed that the supernova looks very different when viewed from all the different angles, especially from one particular direction.\n\nThey found this to possibly be due to the supernova explosion sending gas out one way and the star the other. (ANI)Munich, March 17 (ANI): Using new ground-breaking thermal images obtained with ESO's (European Southern Observatory's) Very Large Telescope and other powerful ground-based telescopes, scientists have made the first detailed interior weather map of Jupiter's giant storm system linking its temperature, winds, pressure and composition with its colour.\n\nThe images show swirls of warmer air and cooler regions never seen before within Jupiter's Great Red Spot.\n\n\"This is our first detailed look inside the biggest storm of the Solar System,\" said Glenn Orton, who led the team of astronomers that made the study.\n\n\"We once thought the Great Red Spot was a plain old oval without much structure, but these new results show that it is, in fact, extremely complicated,\" he added.\n\nThe observations reveal that the reddest colour of the Great Red Spot corresponds to a warm core within the otherwise cold storm system, and images show dark lanes at the edge of the storm where gases are descending into the deeper regions of the planet.\n\nThe observations, detailed in a paper appearing in the journal Icarus, give scientists a sense of the circulation patterns within the solar system's best-known storm system.\n\nSky gazers have been observing the Great Red Spot in one form or another for hundreds of years, with continuous observations of its current shape dating back to the 19th century.\n\nThe spot, which is a cold region averaging about -160 degrees Celsius, is so wide that about three Earths could fit inside its boundaries.\n\nThe thermal images were mostly obtained with the VISIR instrument attached to ESO's Very Large Telescope in Chile, with additional data coming from the Gemini South telescope in Chile and the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan's Subaru Telescope in Hawaii.\n\n\"One of the most intriguing findings shows the most intense orange-red central part of the spot is about 3 to 4 degrees warmer than the environment around it,\" said lead author Leigh Fletcher.\n\nThis temperature difference might not seem like a lot, but it is enough to allow the storm circulation, usually counter-clockwise, to shift to a weak clockwise circulation in the very middle of the storm.\n\nNot only that, but on other parts of Jupiter, the temperature change is enough to alter wind velocities and affect cloud patterns in the belts and zones.\n\n\"This is the first time we can say that there's an intimate link between environmental conditions \u2013 temperature, winds, pressure and composition \u2013 and the actual colour of the Great Red Spot,\" said Fletcher craterWashington, June 27 (ANI): The joint ESA\/NASA solar orbiter Ulysses is slated to shut down operations on June 30, which would mark the end of one of the most successful and longest missions in spaceflight history.\n\nAfter 18.6 years in space and defying several earlier expectations of its demise, Ulysses will achieve 'end of mission' on June 30.

Their discovery by Galileo 400 years ago provided irrefutable evidence that not all bodies orbited the Earth.\n\nBut until recently, nobody had suspected that Jupiter had once had many more moons.\n\n\"Astronomers have long been aware of a mystery thrown up by simulations of the way Jupiter and its moons formed,\" said Canup.\n\nThese models indicate that the mass of the debris disc around Jupiter, from which the moons formed, was several tens of a per cent of the mass of giant planet; And yet only 2 per cent is enough to make the moons we see today.\n\nNow, Canup and her colleague William Ward believe they know why. The extra mass can be explained if other moons formed while the debris disc was still present.\n\n\"A key process is therefore the interaction between the growing moons and the disc material still flowing in from the solar system,\" said Canup.\n\nThis interaction would have caused the early moons to spiral in towards Jupiter and eventually be \"eaten\".\n\nAccording to Canup, this would explain the discrepancy in the earlier simulations, as one set of moons was swallowed, a new set immediately began to form.\n\n\"There could have been five generations of moons,\" she said. \"The current Galilean moons formed just as the inflow of material into the disc from the solar system choked off, so they escaped the fate of their unfortunate predecessors,\" she added.\n\nAccording to Canup and Ward, in each generation, the total mass of the moons was the same, but the number of moons could have varied.\n\n\"We think something similar happened around Saturn, where the last generation contained one giant moon \u2013 Titan,\" said Canup.\n\nThis could have implications for the solar system as a whole. Rocky planets may take as long as 10 million years to aggregate, chunk by chunk. (ANI)According to Canup and Ward, in each generation the total mass of the moons was the same, but the number of moons could have varied. \"We think something similar happened around Saturn, where the last generation contained one giant moon \u2013 Titan,\" says Canup.\n\nThis could have implications for the solar system as a whole. Rocky planets may take as long as 10 million years to aggregate, chunk by chunk. The process continues long after the debris disc around the sun has blown away, so these planets would not have been at risk of spiralling inwards.\n\nIn contrast, the gaseous cores of gas giants like Saturn and Jupiter condense out of the solar debris disc very quickly via gas shrinkage. This means they would have had time to interact with the debris disc. John Papaloizou of the University of Cambridge says it is entirely conceivable that the sun may have swallowed numerous gas cores before the current stable configuration of the solar system emerged.\n\nNew Delhi, Feb 10 (ANI): Iran has said it retains the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful power generation.\n\nTalking to reporters here on Monday\n\nWashington : Scientists at the Carnegie Institution in the US have found that the mineral kingdom co-evolved with life, and that up to two thirds of the more than\n4,000 known types of minerals on Earth can be directly or indirectly linked to biological activity.\n\nRobert Hazen and Dominic Papineau of the Carnegie Institution\"s Geophysical Laboratory, along with six colleagues, made the finding.\n\nThe team reviewed the physical, chemical, and biological processes that gradually transformed about a dozen different primordial minerals in ancient interstellar dust grains to the thousands of mineral species on the present-day Earth.\n\n\"We found both the variety and relative abundances of minerals have changed dramatically over more than 4.5 billion years of Earth\"s history,\" said Hazen.\n\nAll the chemical elements were present from the start in the solar system\"s primordial dust, but they formed comparatively few minerals.\n\nOnly after large bodies such as the Sun and planets congealed did there exist the extremes of temperature and pressure required to forge a large diversity of mineral species.\n\nMany elements were also too dispersed in the original dust clouds to be able to solidify into mineral crystals.\n\nAs the solar system took shape through \"gravitational clumping\" of small, undifferentiated bodies-fragments of which are found today in the form of meteorites-about 60 different minerals made their appearance.\n\nOnly on Earth did mineral evolution progress to the next stages.\n\nA key factor was the churning of the planet\"s interior by plate tectonics, the process that drives the slow shifting continents and ocean basins over geological time.\n\nUnique to Earth, plate tectonics created new kinds of physical and chemical environments where minerals could form, and thereby boosted mineral diversity to more than a thousand types.\n\nWhat ultimately had the biggest impact on mineral evolution, however, was the origin of life, approximately 4 billion years ago.\n\n\"Of the approximately 4,300 known mineral species on Earth, perhaps two thirds of them are biologically mediated,\" said Hazen. \"This is principally a consequence of our oxygen-rich atmosphere, which is a product of photosynthesis by microscopic algae,\" he added.\n\nMany important minerals are oxidized weathering products, including ores of iron, copper and many other metals.\n\nMicroorganisms and plants also accelerated the production of diverse clay minerals.\n\nIn the oceans, the evolution of organisms with shells and mineralized skeletons generated thick-layered deposits of minerals such as calcite, which would be rare on a lifeless planet.\n\n\"For at least 2.5 billion years, and possibly since the emergence of life, Earth\"s mineralogy has evolved in parallel with biology,\" said Hazen. \"One implication of this finding is that remote observations of the mineralogy of other moons and planets may provide crucial evidence for biological influences beyond Earth,\" he added. (ANI)\n\nWashington \u2013 The US space agency said Thursday its Hubble Space Telescope has captured the first image, taken in visible light, of a planet circling a star in another solar system.\n\nThe planet, Fomalhaut b, is estimated to have about three times the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system. The image was taken as Fomalhaut b orbited the star Fomalhaut, which is located 25 light years from Earth in the constellation Piscis Australis or the Southern Fish.\n\nIt's challenging to take such pictures as a star's glare makes it almost impossible in visible light to see any orbiting planets. This forces astronomers to look for planets indirectly by measuring the gravitational influence on the star being orbited.\n\nIn the image released by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the planet appears as a tiny dot in the middle of a giant red dust ring of proto-planetary debris.\n\nThis large debris disk is similar to the Kuiper Belt, which circles the solar system and contains numerous icy bodies \u2013 dust grains and even objects the size of dwarf planets, such as Pluto in Earth's own solar system.\n\n\"Our Hubble observations were incredibly demanding. Fomalhaut b is 1 billion times fainter than the star. We began this programme in 2001, and our persistence finally paid off,\" Hubble astronomer Paul Kalas of the University of California at Berkeley said in a statement.\n\nNASA said that Fomalhaut has been a candidate for planet hunting ever since the agency's Infrared Astronomy Satellite discovered excessive dust around the star in the early 1980s.\n\nIn 2004, Kalas and his team discovered the debris disk that scatters Fomalhaut's starlight. They later concluded that the ring of debris was being gravitationally modified by a planet lying between the star and the ring's inner edge.\n\nNASA confirmed that the planet is more than 17.2 billion kilometres from the star, or about 10 times the distance of Saturn from our sun. The alien planet is also brighter than expected for an object its size, probably because it has a Saturn-like ring of ice and dust that reflects starlight. (dpa)\n\nWashington, Oct 7: The first NASA spacecraft to image and map the dynamic interactions taking place where the hot solar wind slams into the cold expanse of space in the outer solar system, is ready for launch on October 19.\n\nThe two-year mission will begin from the Kwajalein Atoll, a part of the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nCalled the Interstellar Boundary Explorer or IBEX, the spacecraft will conduct extremely high-altitude orbits above Earth to investigate and capture images of processes taking place at the farthest reaches of the solar system.\n\nKnown as the interstellar boundary, this region marks where the solar system meets interstellar space.\n\n\"The interstellar boundary regions are critical because they shield us from the vast majority of dangerous galactic cosmic rays, which otherwise would penetrate into Earth's orbit and make human spaceflight much more dangerous,\" said David J. McComas, IBEX principal investigator and senior executive director of the Space Science and Engineering Division at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio.\n\nThe story of the outer solar system began to unfold when the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecrafts left the inner solar system and headed out toward the boundary between our solar system and interstellar space.\n\n\"The Voyager spacecraft are making fascinating observations of the local conditions at two points beyond the termination shock that show totally unexpected results and challenge many of our notions about this important region,\" said McComas.\n\nOther spacecraft have continued the exploration of the interstellar boundary region.\n\nRecently, a pair of NASA sun-focused satellites, the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory mission, detected a higher-energy version of the particles IBEX will observe in the heliosphere.\n\nThe heliosphere is an area that contains the solar wind. It stretches from the sun to a distance several times the orbit of Pluto.\n\nIBEX is poised to thoroughly map this interstellar boundary region of the solar system.\n\nThe images will allow scientists to understand the global interaction between our sun and the galaxy for the very first time.\n\nIBEX will be launched aboard a Pegasus rocket dropped from under the wing of an L-1011 aircraft flying over the Pacific Ocean. The Pegasus will carry the spacecraft approximately 130 miles above Earth and place it in orbit. (ANI)"}

{"text":"Star formation in the centers of galaxies is thought to yield massive stars with a possibly top-heavy stellar mass distribution. It is likely that magnetic fields play a crucial role in the distribution of stellar masses inside star-forming molecular clouds. In this context, we explore the effects of magnetic fields, with a typical field strength of 38 \u03bcG, such as in RCW 38, and a field strength of 135 \u03bcG, similar to NGC 2024 and the infrared dark cloud G28.34+0.06, on the initial mass function (IMF) near (\u2264 10 pc) a 107 solar mass black hole. Using these conditions, we perform a series of numerical simulations with the hydrodynamical code FLASH to elucidate the impact of magnetic fields on the IMF and the star-formation efficiency (SFE) emerging from an 800 solar mass cloud. We find that the collapse of a gravitationally unstable molecular cloud is slowed down with increasing magnetic field strength and that stars form along the field lines. The total number of stars formed during the simulations increases by a factor of 1.5\u22122 with magnetic fields. The main component of the IMF has a lognormal shape, with its peak shifted to sub-solar (\u2264 0.3 M\u2299) masses in the presence of magnetic fields, due to a decrease in the accretion rates from the gas reservoir. In addition, we see a top-heavy, nearly flat IMF above ~2 solar masses, from regions that were supported by magnetic pressure until high masses are reached. We also consider the effects of X-ray irradiation if the central black hole is active. X-ray feedback inhibits the formation of sub-solar masses and decreases the SFEs even further. Thus, the second contribution is no longer visible. We conclude that magnetic fields potentially change the SFE and the IMF both in active and inactive galaxies, and need to be taken into account in such calculations. The presence of a flat component of the IMF would be a particularly relevant signature for the importance of magnetic fields, as it is usually not found in hydrodynamical simulations"}

Follow @universetoday on Twitter\n\nThis deep image taken with the NASA\/ESA Hubble Space Telescope shows the spiral galaxy NGC 4921 along with a spectacular backdrop of more distant galaxies. It was created from a total of 80 separate pictures taken with yellow and near-infrared filters. Credits: NASA, ESA and K. Cook (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA)\n\nThe Coma Galaxy cluster is home to a rich collection of galaxies in the nearby Universe. NGC 4921 is one of the rare spirals in Coma, and a rather unusual one. It looks \"fluffy,\" with lots of swirling dust. Astronomers say this galaxy is an \"anemic spiral\" where a small amount of star formation is taking place, and so less light is coming from the galaxy's arms, as is usually seen in a spiral galaxy. This is an image from the Hubble Space Telescope, and with Hubble's sharp vision, you can see a few bright young blue stars. But what's really amazing, besides seeing the incredible detail of NGC 4921, is looking beyond the big fluffy galaxy and seeing how Hubble was able to pick up a marvelous collection of remote galaxies of all shapes, sizes and colors. Many have the spotty and ragged appearance of galaxies from the early Universe. Click here to get a bigger, better view.\n\nThis image was created from data obtained by Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys. The Coma galaxy cluster, is in the northern constellation of Coma Berenices. The cluster, also known as Abell 1656, is about 320 million light-years from Earth and contains more than 1000 members. The brightest galaxies, including NGC 4921, were discovered back in the late 18th century by William Herschel.\n\nAnnotated deep Hubble Space Telescope image of NGC 4921 indictating the locations of some of the more interesting features of the galaxy and its surroundings. Credits: NASA, ESA and K. Cook (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA)\n\nThe galaxies in rich clusters undergo many interactions and mergers that tend to gradually turn gas-rich spirals into elliptical systems without much active star formation. As a result, there are far more ellipticals and fewer spirals in the Coma Cluster than are found in quieter corners of the Universe.\n\nThe Hubble images used to make this picture were originally obtained by a team led by Kem Cook (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, California). The team used Hubble to search for Cepheid variable stars in NGC 4921 that could be used to measure the distance to the Coma cluster and hence the expansion rate of the Universe.\n\nUnfortunately the failure of the Advanced Camera for Surveys in early 2007 meant that they had insufficient data to complete their original program, although they hope to continue after the servicing mission. Very deep imaging data like this, which is available to anyone from the Hubble archives, may also be used for other interesting scientific exploration of this galaxy and its surroundings.

I'd address the points in your post, but I honestly just don't have the time, patience, energy or frankly the desire at this time of night.\n\nYou have, in your previous post, demonstated such an astounding lack of understanding about even the most basic properties of gravity (amazing even considering you don't believe in it), that talking about gravitational lensing with you would be like chatting to your average 8 year old about methods that can be used to solve non-linear partial differential equations. They would simply not have the prerequisite knowledge to even begin to discuss math at that level. It's the same situation here I'm afraid mate.

I also did not subscribe to the 'end of the world 'mainstream\" media we are running out of petroleum . When the price of extracting the 'easy oil' and prices rise, technology not now available or feasible will eventually get to the true 'monster pools' of hydrocarbons in our Earth. I just wanted the use of petroleum to lessen as it does lessens the ability to see the night skies -I do no believe the BS about humans being the complete cause of 'global warming' as on other feeds, I stated the Sun is 98% cause of our climate, the Earth itself is about 2%, humans as a fraction of .1%. These so calle 'Global Warming' advocates wants to create a breaucracy which calls for more funds, funds equals power, power demands more funds which equals more power. As other sources of energy is still in the teething stage or will be found unfeasible (full battery operated vehicles-where is the energy going to come from to power these things and the recycling of batterys is a losing proposition regardless of advanced technology and they are toxic!! ), fusion power is going to be in a state of research for a long time, solar energy to power a large metro area will require thousands of square miles of solar cells, wind power-NIMBY thinking and they will eventually corrode in the elements, fuel cells may be part of the solution in 50 years but there may be problems in collisions but may be the feasible powered vehicles after having\nto creat a infrastructure of power plants, network of 'service station' for fuel cells(I try to remind people how long it took to creat a network of 'service stations' in the US). Nuclear Power Plants,-where is all the spent cells going to go to-besides- there is a NIMBY mentality in the US. Natural Gas, production will have to iincrease incredibly and it does have its' dangers, but may also power vehicles.

Is that your whole armory Oills? Quote either a discredited fringe 'scientist' like Velikovsky, or the words of some ancient philosopher who lived before the word 'science' or the concept of experimental verification of ideas had even come into existence? I'll say it again then \u2013 appeals to authority (quoting somebody famous) does not equal evidence. It does not make your theory true. It doesn't make it wrong either. It does nothing at all!\n\nAnyway, I have read some of Velikovsky's stuff \u2013 Cosmos Without Gravitation for one. Despite it being rather creative, there is not one solid quantitative prediction that can be measured in there. And since that time, even despite the vagueness bordering on astrology, almost every word has been shown to be wrong with modern space probes etc. etc. I don't deny that anyone has the right to present a new theory or world view, but science insists that they be subject to the ultimate arbiter \u2013 actual physical evidence. And Velikovsky has failed that test admirably.\n\nP.S \u2013 as a fitting example of your misquotes \u2013 quoting Bertrand Russell to try to disprove gravity? Good one buddy \u2013 he actually wrote quite an authoritative introduction to General Relativity, used by students the world over. Moreover, he simply states in the quote you attributed to him that (to paraphrase) 'an atom is like a miniature solar system but the force that holds them together is different \u2013 i.e. electromagnetism and gravity'. Of course it is \u2013 gravity and electromagnetism are both inverse square laws, so of course they'll behave the same in that sense. What's more \u2013 this quote was from the early twenties before Quantum Mechanics had been developed \u2013 nobody had an even close understanding of the true nature of an atom yet. Later in his life, Russell would go on to consider QM and write excellent material in relation to it, too.\n\nHave a super-charged day Oills.\n\n OilIsMastery\n\nAstrofiend,\n\nYou say Velikovsky is a \"discredited fringe scientist\" but I submit to you that it is Newton and Einstein who have been discredited and they aren't even scientists.\n\nYou accuse me of quoting the words of ancient philosophers yet you believe in a 17th century creationist hypothesis of universal gravitation that was empirically falsified in 1963, not to mention 1687.\n\nYour claim that \"almost every word has been shown to be wrong with modern spaceprobes\" is simply based upon illiteracy, ignorance, and a lack of education.\n\n\"I interviewed him [Velikovsky] several times at his home, and remain convinced that although he is most likely wrong on specifics, he will be remembered by history as a genius and pioneer.\" \u2014 Clark Whelton, historian, December 2008\n\n\"These researchers have demonstrated certain inescapable conclusions. They have shown that Velikovsky was wrong on numerous specifics.

The supression of uncomfortable ideas may be common in religion or in politics, but it is not the path to knowledge and there's no place for it in the endeavor of science.

The universe is not free of those forces with which the man makes his life easy already more than 100 years. They were unknown practically or little known in the time of Newton in the second half of the 17th century. But today we know that electricity and magnetism, these are not just small phenomena that we can repeat as a kind of a little trick in the lab, that they permeate every field from neurology into botony and chemistry and astronomy should not be free\u2026and it was admitted by authorities that this was the most outrageous point in my claims. But the vengeance came early and swiftly. In 1960, already in 1955, radio noises from Jupiter were detected and this was one of the crucial tests that I offered for the truth of my theory. In 1958, the magnetosphere was discovered around the Earth, another claim. In 1960, the interplanetary magnetic field was discovered and solar plasma, so-called solar wind, moving rapidly along the magnetic lines and then it was discovered that the electromagnetic field of the Earth reaches the moon .\" \u2014 Immanuel Velikovsky, cosmologist, 1966\n\n\"Some of these predictions were said to be impossible when you [Velikovsky] made them. All of them were predicted long before proof that they were correct came to hand\u2026.\" \u2014 Harry Hess, geologist, 1963\n\nAstrofiend\n\n\"Velikovsky's credentials were not those of a scientist\u2026he had only the vaguest understanding of such basic physical principles as conservation of angular momentum, gravity, and entropy.\" \u2013 Lloyd Motz, (whose advice Velikovsky often sought)\n\n\"Velikovsky was an interesting and imaginative thinker, and he was a patient, thorough collector of ancient myths and legends. But his work, whatever other virtues it may possess, is not science\" \u2013 Gregory Derry\n\n\"Saying that there will be found radio emissions from Jupiter was tantamount to a statement by John Adams in mid-19th century that there was another planet in the sky but with no more evidence, say, than the peculiarities of Uranus' motion\u2026. Velikovsky's prediction was precisely useless in just its LACK of detail\u2013 where to look in the radio spectrum (from ground base it covers a factor of 10,000 to one in frequency); what to see there, that is the character of the source (Velikovsky didn't understand that two kinds of distinct non-thermal emission are produced); and when to look (Burke's and Franklin's data show enormous variations that seemed to be basically stochastic)\" \u2013 radio-astronomer James W.

Why would I believe that Venus is like that when it has been shown that it is not by a veritable armada of various spacecraft? Why would I not 'disbelieve' the Earth's magnetic field? Why do you 'disbelieve' the Earth's gravitational field?\n\nAnd sound in space?? There is no sound in space from the point of view that if we were in space together and I banged a drum, you wouldn't hear it. There is a highly rarefied gas in space that can transmit shock waves however \u2013 MHD waves, which are a well-understood aspect of plasma physics.\n\nIf you are asking about these things because they form a part of Velikovsky's claims, then I say that it has nothing to do with anything. Velikovsky has been right about certain things, but these are always played up by his true believer cheer squad as being major triumphs. In fact, almost all the stuff he was actually right about he fluked \u2013 he was right but not for the reasons that he posited. For example, he claimed Venus was shot out of Jupiter, and this is responsible for it's current day temperature. But the weather systems have been particularly well studied on Venus, especially since Venus Express arrived on the scene. And the mechanisms for Venus' current temperature are thoroughly certified as being due to proximity to the sun combined with a thick atmosphere comprised largely of CO2.\n\nHe claimed that Jupiter would have radio emission due to turbulence from the expulsion of Venus. Jupiter does have radio emission, but completely lacking the characteristics predicted by Velikovsky \u2013 Jupiter's radio emission is from a combination of factors, but particularly from synchrotron radiation etc which are unexplainable by his model.\n\nThere is no denying Velikovsky was a deep and creative thinker. He just happened to be wrong on pretty much all counts. Science is a bitch like that eh?

{"text":"As astronomers gaze across the deeps of space and time, they run across scenes like this one \u2014 where two (or more) galaxies just get too close to each other for comfort. When this happens, sometimes galaxies end up colliding.\n\nThe European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope caught a glimpse of a cosmic tango taking place 190 million light-years away in the direction of the southern hemisphere constellation Pavo, the Peacock. And, like Hubble's spectacular image of a ring galaxy (created by yet another collision), this VLT image was taken to celebrate another telescopic anniversary \u2014 the VLT's fifth birthday.\n\nSo what's happening in this scene?\n\nNGC 6769 (the one on the upper right) is a spiral galaxy with very tightly wound spiral arms. Its neighbor (NGC 6770) has two major spiral arms. One looks rather straight and points towards the outer disc of NGC 6769. NGC 6770 is also peculiar because it shows two comparatively straight dark lanes and a fainter arc that curves towards the third galaxy toward the bottom of the image, called NGC 6771 (below). Stars and gas have been stripped off of both NGC 6769 and NGC 6770, and they're starting to form a common envelope around them. Some folks have suggested it looks like the shape of a Devil's Mask. There might also be a tenuous bridge between NGC 6769 and NGC 6771. All of these features are there because there's strong gravitational interaction between the three galaxies.\n\nWell, you might think that such a collision would destroy the galaxies and any chances for the normal things that galaxies do (like host star-forming regions).\n\nNot\u2026 quite\u2026\n\nThere is a true baby-star boom going on in this scene. A cosmic catastrophe like this one normally results in the formation of many new stars, which you can see in the blueish clouds that highlight the spiral arms in NGC 6769 and NGC 6770. There are many sites of star-forming regions.\n\nVLT, and other telescopes (including HST) are studying a great many cosmic collisions like this one to help scientists figure out how and why galaxies form, evolve, and change over time. There'll no doubt be more cool pix like this one in the years to come!\n\nIf you've always wanted to spot a comet with your very own eyes, there are a couple of them inbound that you should be able to see in the next few weeks. They're called Comet LINEAR and Comet NEAT. Right now, Comet LINEAR is hard find to in the bright glow of dawn just above the eastern horizon before sunrise, and Comet NEAT is visible only from the Southern Hemisphere. But that will soon change.\n\nFor now, in the final week of April and the first few days of May, North American and European skywatchers do have a shot at spotting Comet LINEAR before dawn on clear mornings. Look with binoculars just above the horizon due east about 60 minutes before your local time of sunrise.\n\nLater on in the month, both LINEAR and NEAT will come into in the evening sky. Starting around May 5th or 6th, scan for Comet NEAT just above the southwest horizon as evening twilight fades. Look for a small, fuzzy \"star\" with a small tail pointing to the upper left. (The much brighter star Sirius will also be low in the southwest; on May 5th the comet will be not far to its left, and on May 6th the comet will be to Sirius's upper left.) In the next two weeks Comet NEAT will get much higher in the southwest at nightfall, though it will also fade. Binocular users may be able to follow it through the end of May.\n\nAround May 26th or 28th, Comet LINEAR could steal the show when it too enters the evening sky. Look for it just above the west-southwest horizon as twilight fades. It will get only a little higher in the following week or two, while fading rapidly.\n\nFull details, including charts showing when and where to look for both comets (from the Southern Hemisphere too!) appear in the May 2004 issue of SKY & TELESCOPE and in the article \"The Double Comet Show of 2004,\" online at SkyandTelescope.com.\n\nYou gotta love the Hubble Space Telescope. There it is up there, looking out across the deeps of space and time, spotting shreds of galaxies as they formed some 300,000 to 500,000 years after the Big Bang, and then it turns around and gives us a view of a little shard of a world called Sedna. This place, smaller than the Moon, smaller than Pluto, lies about 90 times the distance between the Earth and Sun, out in a region of the solar system called the Kuiper Belt. It's a leftover bit of ice (mostly) from the formation of the solar system some 5.5 billion years ago. It's so dim and small that HST's image is one pixel across. But, it's an informative pixel!\n\nFor instance, it tells us that (so far) HST hasn't spotted a companion to this planetoid, although the astronomer who discovered it on March 15, 2004, calculated its spin rate (it's \"day\") and determined that it should have a moon of some kind. The fact that it doesn't illustrates one of those wonderful \"non-results\" that tells us valuable information. Science is replete with stuff like this \u2014 what looks like a non-result actually helps us put limits on an object's actions or size or mass or other characteristic. It reminds me of the observation run I did in Hawaii where we studied Comet Hale-Bopp in late 1996. We thought we might be able to spot a plasma tail forming earlier than might be expected. However, when we examined the data, we found no evidence of the plasma tail, which told us that even with a comet of that size, it had to be close enough to the Sun (essentially within about 2 to 2.5 AU of the Sun) before its plasma tail would form. It helped us nail down parts of a descriptive theory we were formulating about how and when and why these glowing tails form when they do as a comet approaches the Sun during its orbit.\n\nAstronomers will keep studying Sedna, and in fact, they have looked at it with other telescopes since its discovery. Expect to see a few more announcements about this frigid world at the frontiers of the solar system"}

What type of telescope is the HST?\nThe image shows dust and gas clouds of stellar nurseries, the precursors to protostars. What gases are they made up of (think what fuels a star)?"}
{"text":"May 02, 2012\n\nAstronomers have gathered the most direct evidence yet of a supermassiveblack hole shredding a star that wandered too close in a galaxy 2.7 billion light-years away. . NASA's Galaxy Evolution Explorer, a space-based observatory, and the Pan-STARRS1 telescope on the summit of Haleakala in Hawaii wereamong the first to help identify the stellar remains.\n\nThe computer-simulated image above shows gas from a star falling into a black hole. Astronomers, reporting in the journal Nature, say they observed a flare in ultraviolet and optical light, telling them there was a black hole tearing a star apart.\n\nSupermassive black holes, weighing millions to billions times more than the sun, lurk in the centers of most galaxies. These hungry monsters lie quietly until an unsuspecting victim, such as a star, wanders close enough to get ripped apart by their powerful gravitational clutches.\n\nUsing several ground- and space-based telescopes, a team of astronomers led by SuviGezari of the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md., identified the victim as a star rich in helium gas.\n\n\"When the star is ripped apart by the gravitational forces of the black hole, some part of the star'sremains falls into the black hole, while the rest is ejected at high speeds,\" Gezari said. \"We are seeing the glow from the stellar gas falling into the black hole over time. We're also witnessing the spectralsignature of the ejected gas, which we find to be mostly helium. It is like we are gathering evidencefrom a crime scene. Because there is very little hydrogen and mostly helium in the gas, we detectfrom the carnage that the slaughtered star had to have been the helium-rich core of a stripped star.\"\n\nThis observation yields insights about the harsh environment around black holes and the types ofstars swirling around them. It is not the first time the unlucky star had a brush with the behemothblack hole. The team believes the star's hydrogen-filled envelope surrounding the core was lifted off a long timeago by the same black hole. The star may have been near the end of its life.\n\nAfter consuming most ofits hydrogen fuel, it had probably ballooned in size, becoming a red giant. Astronomers think the bloated star was looping around the black hole in a highly elliptical orbit, similar to a comet's elongated orbit around the sun. On one of its close approaches, the star was stripped of its puffed-up atmosphere by the black hole's powerful gravity. The stellar remains continued its journey around thecenter, until it ventured even closer to the black hole to face its ultimate demise.\n\nAstronomers predict stripped stars circle the central black hole of our Milky Way galaxy. These close encounters are rare, occurring roughly every 100,000 years. To find this event, Gezari's team monitored hundreds of thousands of galaxies in ultraviolet light with the Galaxy Evolution Explorer,and in visible light with Pan-STARRS1. Pan-STARRS, short for Panoramic Survey Telescope andRapid Response System, scans the entire night sky for all kinds of transient phenomena, including supernovae.\n\nThe team was looking for a bright flare in ultraviolet light from the nucleus of a galaxy with a previously dormant black hole. Both telescopes spotted one in June 2010. Astronomers continued to monitor the flare as it reached peak brightness a month later and slowly faded during the next 12 months. The brightening event was similar to the explosive energy unleashed by a supernova, but the rise to the peak was much slower, taking nearly one-and-a-half months.\n\n\"The longer the event lasted, the more excited we got, because we realized this is either a very unusual supernova or an entirely different type of event, such as a star being ripped apart by a blackhole,\" said team member Armin Rest of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. By measuring the increase in brightness, the astronomers calculated the black hole's mass to be several million suns, which is comparable to the size of our Milky Way's black hole.\n\nSpectroscopic observations with the Multiple Meter Telescope Observatory on Mount Hopkins in Arizona showed the black hole was swallowing lots of helium. Spectroscopy divides light into its rainbow colors, which yields an object's characteristics, such as its temperature and gaseous makeup.\n\nTo completely rule out the possibility of an active nucleus flaring up in the galaxy, the team used NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory to study the hot gas. Chandra showed that the characteristicsof the gas didn't match those from an active galactic nucleus.\n\nThe team's results appear in today's online edition of the journal Nature.\n\nComments\n\nThis is quite below any scientific standards, actually. The image shown above is a computer simulation showing what somebody THINKS is happening.\n\nI have seen the actual images on a different website and just by looking at them there is NO evidence of any star falling into that black hole.\n\nA \"black hole\" is a pulsing heart of any galaxy, keeping and holding it together. What those picture show are the regular pulses of this particular energy source as it builds its galaxy around itself.\n\nBut some crazy individuals actually see what is not there. They say a star has fallen into a black hole although all they see are just TWO DIFFERENT levels in brightness of this particular black hole in various spectra.\n\nThis is imagining things. Pure and simple. There is no proof of any star there. It can not be seen on the images."}
{"text":"One\nof the principal scientific drivers for observations in the thermal infrared\nis the presence of a series of scientifically important dust-emission lines,\nmainly concentrated in the 10-micron window, although interesting features\nalso exist in the 20 and 30 micron windows. Some of the most interesting\nare:\n\nWavelength (microns)\n\nLine\n\n6.0\n\nH2O ice\n\n6.2\n\nPAHs\n\n7.7\n\nPAHs\n\n8.6\n\nPAHs\n\n7 - 11\n\nSilicates\n\n11\n\nGraphite\n\n11.3\n\nPAHs\n\nBoth PAHs and\nsilicates are found in a wide variety of astronomical objects, ranging\nfrom AGNs, through proto-stellar and proto-planetary disks, to solar system\nobjects, such as comets. Lack of appropriate instrumentation has limited\ntheir study so far to the brightest objects in the sky. We would expect\nCanariCam to make a huge contribution in the study of these objects on\nthe Gran Telescopio Canarias, due to the enormous gain in light grasp and\nsensitivity that the Gran Telescopio Canarias will offer over previously\nexisting telescopes.\n\nCharacterisation of silicate\ndust from CanariCam observations\n\nTwo types of silicate\nemission are seen in different astrophysical situations:\n\nA broad, smooth 10-micron\nfeature with little structure, always observed in protostellar regions\nin molecular clouds. This line is attributed to newly formed amorphous,\nor glassy silicates. The main source is thought to be outflows from O-rich\nM-stars.\n\nA feature even broader than\nthe smooth silicate emission, with a narrow peak at 11.2 microns. The peak\nis attributed to crystalline silicates. These may condense out of protostellar\nmaterial, or be formed by the metamorphosis of amorphous silicates if these\nare subjected to high temperatures over a long period of time. This process,\nknown as annealing, imbues the grains with a memory of the thermal history\nof the cloud. Spectroscopy at different points within a protoplanetary\ndisk can provide valuable information on the thermal evolution of the material.\n\nRecent thermal infrared studies\nof comets, such as Hale-Bopp, have revealed that several minerals can be\ndistinguished, with the recent identification of forsterite (Mg 2SiO4)\nbeing one of the highlights. In the Herbig Ae\/Be star HD 100546, the 10-micron\nspectrum is remarkably similar to that of Comet Hale-Bopp (C\/1995 O1).\nWhen the range is extended to the full 8-30 microns permitted by the atmosphere,\nseveral minerals may be identified: crystalline forsterite, giving narrow\nemission bands at around 11 microns; amorphous olivines, which give the\nbroad features at 10 and 18 microns; and a broad feature at 23 microns,\nwhich is interpreted as due to FeO. Hence spectroscopy in both the 10 and\nthe 20-micron window are required to characterise the mineralogy.\n\nEmission from PAHs\n\nNarrow-band imaging of\nPAH features is of considerable interest. PAHs are a significant constituent\nof the interstellar medium and emit as the result of the absorption of\na single UV photon. The relative strengths of the different PAH features\nis a tracer of their molecular size. As heating of the dust is not involved\nPAH features are emitted independent of the local temperature or the distance\nfrom the illuminating source. PAHs thus serve as dust tracers even in cold,\nregions which do not produce significant thermal emission. PAHs are often\nthought to be very small grains and are mixed-in with other dust. Their\nunique emitting characteristics allows them to emit even when \"normal\"\ndust grains are at too low a temperature to emit. An excellent example\nof this capacity to serve as a tracer is seen in the case of the Herbig\nAe\/Be star WL16. Deutsch et al (1995, Ap. & Spa. Sci., 224, 89) have\nshown how an extended disk may be seen when the star is imaged with a 8.6\nmicrons PAH filter, but not when a 10.3m m continuum filter is used.\n\nAtomic and molecular\ntransitions\n\nThere are many important\nlines in the mid-infrared. In the following table we list some of the main\natomic transitions that occur in the infrared and are accessible from the\nground:\n\nWavelength (microns)\n\nLine\n\nTransition\n\nPhoton Energy\n\n7.9\n\nAr V\n\n60 eV\n\n8.8\n\nK IV\n\n83 eV\n\n8.99\n\nAr III\n\n3 P1 -\n3P2\n\n28 eV\n\n9.0\n\nNa IV\n\n72 eV\n\n9.0\n\nMg V\n\n109 eV\n\n10.51\n\nS IV\n\n2 P\u00b03\/2\n-2P \u00b01\/2\n\n35 eV\n\n12.28\n\nH2\n\nn =0-0 S(2)\n\n12.37\n\nH I\n\nn=7 -6 (Hu-a )\n\n12.81\n\nNe II\n\n2 P\u00b01\/2\n-2P \u00b03\/2\n\n22 eV\n\n13.1\n\nAr V\n\n60 eV\n\n13.5\n\nMg VII\n\n187 eV\n\n17.03\n\nH2\n\nn =0-0 S(1)\n\n18.71\n\nS III\n\n3 P2 -\n3P1\n\n23 eV\n\n24.28\n\nNe V\n\n3 P1 -\n3P0\n\n97 eV\n\n25.87\n\nO IV\n\n2 P3\/2\n- 2P1\/2\n\nThese lines are\nalso important probes of heavily obscured regions and can be used to study\nstar formation regions, or the central regions of AGNs, obtaining physical\nparameters that cannot be obtained from visible spectroscopy. A new field\nof research is the study of interstellar molecules in the mid-infrared.\nMany molecules have been detected with radio techniques, but little effort\nhas be directed to the possibility of studying molecules in the mid-infrared\nwhere many of them emit. The combination of highly sensitive instruments\nand very large telescopes promises to open a whole new field of astrochemistry.\n\nContinuum\nemission\n\nThe 3-25 micron range\nis often referred to as the Thermal Infrared because warm objects (including\nthe Earth's atmosphere) radiate principally at these wavelengths. The peak\nof black body emission for many classes of warm object (including extra-solar\nplanets and dust in galaxies) falls in this range. One particular interest\nof CanariCam is that its broad wavelength coverage allows objects at a\nwide range of different temperatures, ranging from brown dwarfs to cool\ndust to be studied. Many of these objects are too cool to give significant\nemission in the near infrared (<2.5 microns) and thus cannot be adequately\nstudied with instruments limited to the 1-2.5 microns range."}

{"text":"Gravitational Lensing - Nature's Telescope\n\nby Richard Ignace, Department of Physics and Astronomy, ETSU\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Figures and illustrations contained herein were\nnot produced by the author of this page, and so the author does not claim\nany credit for them. Although the text is original material, the\nvisuals were all found over the web.\n\nGravitational lensing refers to how light travel\nis modified by the presence of mass. The idea is that in empty space,\nlight travels in a straight line, BUT is deflected from a straight line\nwhen traveling past a body of mass. (When that body of mass is a black\nhole, and if the light passes close enough, this deflection is \"catastrophic\"\nin that the light can pass into the black hole never to get out again.)\n\nActually, it is more accurate to say that light always travels in a straight\nline (or rather, follows the shortest path between two points) and it is\nspace itself that becomes distorted by the presence of mass so as to make\nit appear that light moves along a curved path. This next figure illustrates\nthe point.\n\nNow every body of mass can contribute to the deflection of light. However,\nit turns out that light is fast and gravity is weak! Substantial lensing\nrequires the close passage of light to a significant concentration of mass.\n\nExamples of lensing have become almost commonplace in astronomy, not because\nsignificant lensing itself is so common, but rather because there are\nso many sources and intervening bodies of mass, and because technology\nis such that we can now monitor large numbers of sources and are capable\nof seeing distant faint objects. On the whole it is pretty hard work!\n\nA nice example of strong lensing is given in the following image that\nwas taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. The \"lens\" consists of the\ncluster of bright galaxies. The galaxies are the bright, generally\nround objectsexample of strong lensing is given in the following image\nthat was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. The \"lens\" consists of\nthe cluster of bright galaxies. The galaxies are the bright, generally\nround objects. What is being lensed are other more distant galaxies\nthat lie behind this cluster (perhaps 5 to 10 times more distant).\nThe gravitational lensing leads to the fainter and elongated \"streaks\"\n(like arcs), which are the distorted images of these distant galaxies.\n\nSo how are we to think of this lensing? What is the light doing?\nThe next two figures illustrate the trajectory taken by light when it is\nlensed, in the first case where the observer, lens, and distant source all\nlined up, and in the second case where the alignment is not quite perfect.\n\nIn the first case, the image of the distant source is distorted into a\nperfect ring. In the second two arc-like images are produced.\n\nWhat happens if the arrangement evolves? Nothing in the Universe is sitting\nstill - everything moves. For the example of the cluster of galaxies above,\nthe distances are so large that the arrangement will not change much in\nour lifetime (or many lifetimes!). However, lensing does occur in the\nvicinity of our galaxy, involving a stellar source and some other body\nof matter acting as a lens. In this case the alignment can vary significantly\nover weeks and months. The following shows how the lensing changes over\ntime, with the lens as the dark point at the middle, taken as fixed, and\nthe source a more distant star shown as an open circle that tracks from\nleft to right.\n\nTwo images are produced, shown as filled dark ovals. The two are oppositely\noriented about the lens and source, such that the images, the lens, and\nthe star all line up (an example line is provided). The dashed circle is the\n\"Einstein radius\". If everything were perfectly aligned, the image of the\nstar would appear as a ring of brightness along this circle.\n\nAlthough this picture is correct, this kind of lensing involves masses\nlike that of stars instead of galaxies, and separation of the two images\ndepends on the mass. Since the masses are relatively small, the images\nare relatively close, too close to be observed distinctly with telescopes.\n\nAlthough the separate images cannot be discerned in this case, the brightness\nof the distant source does change, in particular it brightens or is\namplified. This kind of lensing is called \"microlensing\". The following\nlight curve, in blue and red light, shows how microlensing causes\na star to brighten for a time (the lower axis is in days, and the\nvertical is an amplification factor, for which \"1\" means no lensing).\n\nHere is another example of a light curve from microlensing.\n\nIn this case a ratio of the of the blue and red amplifications is also shown.\nA characteristic of true microlensing, instead of some other stellar\nvariability, is that lensing does not depend on the type of light (well,\nat least in the simple case), thus the ratio of amplifications for different\ncolors should always be one.\n\nThe following graph shows lightcurves for many microlensing candidates that\nwere observed in the direction of the Galactic Bulge, all overplotted\nto show the range of lensing durations.\n\nThe following illustration shows the three main microlensing survey efforts in\nour \"neighborhood\".\n\nConcerted efforts to monitor multiple millions\nof stars have resulted in only upwards of 1000 microlensing events.\nA lot of events to be sure, but requiring an immense observational\nand organizational expense!\n\nSo gravitational lensing has become an important area of study in astrophysics,\nboth in our galaxy in reference to the problem of \"Dark Matter\" and in\nexplorations of the Universe as a whole.\n\nThe following\nlink\nprovides some animations of lensing by Dr S.

{"text":"This oddly colorful nebula is the supernova remnant IC 443 as seen by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE. Also known as the Jellyfish nebula, IC 443 is particularly interesting because it provides a look into how stellar explosions interact with their environment. IC 443 can be found near the star Eta Geminorum, which lies near Castor, one of the twins in the constellation Gemini.\n\nJust like human beings, stars have a life cycle -- they are born, mature and eventually die. The manner in which stars die depends on their mass. Stars with mass similar to the sun typically become planetary nebulae at the end of their lives, whereas stars with many times the sun's mass explode as supernovae. IC 443 is the remains of a star that went supernova somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 years ago. The blast from the supernova sent out shock waves that traveled through space, sweeping up and heating the surrounding gas and dust in the interstellar medium, and creating the supernova remnant seen in this image.\n\nWhat is unusual about the IC 443 is that its shell-like form has two halves that have different radii, structures and emissions. The larger northeastern shell, seen here as the violet-colored semi-circle on the top left of the supernova remnant, is composed of sheet-like filaments that are emitting light from iron, neon, silicon and oxygen gas atoms, in addition to dust particles, all heated by the blast from the supernova. The smaller southern shell, seen here in a bright cyan color on the bottom half of the image, is constructed of denser clumps and knots primarily emitting light from hydrogen gas and heated dust. These clumps are part of a molecular cloud, which can be seen in this image as the greenish cloud cutting across IC 443 from the northwest to southeast. The color differences seen in this image represent different wavelengths of infrared emission.\n\nThe differences in color are also the result of differences in the energies of the shock waves hitting the interstellar medium. The northeastern shell was probably created by a fast shock wave (100 kilometers per second or 223,700 miles per hour), whereas the southern shell was probably created by a slow shock wave (30 kilometers per second or 67,100 miles per hour).\n\nAll WISE featured images use color to represent specific infrared wavelengths. Blue represents 3.4-micron light, cyan represents 4.6-micron light, green represents 12-micron light and red represents 22-micron light. In this image, we see a mixing of blue and cyan in the southern ridge that is not often seen in other WISE images. The northeastern shell appears violet, indicating a mixture of longer infrared wavelengths from cooler dust (red) and shorter infrared wavelengths from luminescent gas (blue)."}

A 1 million solar mass black hole produces the red line, a 10 million solar mass black hole results in the green line, and a 100 million solar mass hole gives us the blue line. So the measured 'stretch' of the curve can tell us the black hole mass. Click on image to enlarge. Credit: Lance Miller"}

This is made possible by analysing the tiny distortions imprinted on the photons of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by the gravitational lensing effect of massive cosmic structures. As photons travelled through these structures, which consist primarily of dark matter, their paths became bent, slightly changing the pattern of the CMB. Although noisy, this image is the first measurement performed over almost the whole sky of the gravitational potential that distorts the CMB, and is one of the highlights of Planck's cosmological results. With these unique data, cosmologists can investigate 13 billion years of the formation of structure in the Universe. The data agree very well with the expectations from the leading cosmological model that describes the origin and evolution of cosmic structure in the Universe.(author unknown) at the centre of our own Milky Way Galaxy.(author unknown)"}

Ultraviolet light traces the glow of young stars.\n\nIn the large-scale image, NGC 4150 looks very much like a typical elliptical galaxy. The dark strands of dust in the center, however, provide tentative evidence of a recent galaxy merger. The inset image shows a magnified view of the chaotic activity inside the galaxy's core. Those regions within about 650 light-years of the center that are not obscured by dust appear bright in near-ultraviolet light (shown here in blue). The blue areas indicate a flurry of recent star birth. The stellar breeding ground is about 1,300 light-years across. The stars in this area are less than a billion years old. By comparison, most of the stars in the galaxy are about 10 billion years old. These young stars most likely formed during an encounter with a smaller galaxy that was about one-twentieth the mass of NGC 4150."}
{"text":"galaxy cluster\n\nA galaxy cluster is a structure that consists of hundreds of galaxies bound by gravity.[1] Galaxy clusters are much larger than galaxy groups. One of the key features of clusters is the Intracluster medium or ICM. The ICM consists of gas between the galaxies and has a temperature on the order of 7-9 keV. Clusters of galaxies should not be confused with star clusters such as open clusters, which are structures of stars within galaxies, as well as globular clusters, which typically orbit galaxies.\n\nFor more information about galaxy cluster check the Wikipedia article here\n\nZME Science posts about galaxy cluster\n\nLocated some 62 million-light years away, the Dorado constellation is home to a galaxy cluster, called the Dorado Group, comprised of around 70 galaxies.
