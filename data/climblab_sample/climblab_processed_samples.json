      "text": "Contents of the Mathematics Placement Test\n\nSince 1978, UW system faculty and Wisconsin high school teachers have been collaborating to develop a test for placing incoming students into college Mathematics courses. The current test includes four components: elementary algebra, intermediate algebra, college algebra, and trigonometry. These components are available for each UW System campus to use according to its individual needs and resources. Each campus determines the appropriate scores for entry into specific courses. The purpose of this brochure is to introduce you to the test, describe the rationale behind its creation, and outline future plans for its continued development.\n\nBackground and Purpose of the Test\n\nIn 1978, following the publication of the UW System Basic Skills Task Force Report, members of Mathematics Department Faculties from UW System institutions met in Madison to discuss common entry-level curriculum problems. One problem most departments shared was how to effectively place incoming freshmen into an appropriate mathematics course. Placement procedures and tests varied from campus to campus and it seemed that some consistency was desirable. The decision was made to develop a System-wide test for placement into an introductory mathematics curriculum.\n\nThe committee that would begin this task would consist of representatives from any UW System Mathematics Department that chose to participate. The departments would select their representatives and participation would be strictly voluntary.\n\nThe first step in the project was to carefully analyze each of the individual curricula in the System and write a detailed set of prerequisite objectives for all courses prior to calculus. After this list was approved by all campuses, the committee began developing test items on the skills identified in their test objectives. Through a series of pilot administrations at area high schools and UW campuses, the committee obtained valuable information about how the individual items performed, and gained important insights into item writing strategies and techniques. Many items were refined or corrected, as necessary, and repiloted in an effort to improve their ability to distinguish between students with different levels of mathematical preparedness. After a sufficient number of high quality items had been developed, they were assembled into a complete test. The first operational form of the Mathematics Placement Test was administered in 1984.\n\nPlacement into college courses is the sole purpose of this test. The experienced teacher will quickly realize that many skills which are taught in the high school mathematics courses are not included in the test. This was by design, as the test is a tool to assist advisors in placing students into the best course in the university-level mathematics sequence. The questions on the test were specifically selected with this single purpose in mind. This means the test is not a measure of everything that is learned in high school Mathematics courses. The test was not designed to measure program success or to compare students from one high school with students from another. It should be viewed only as a tool to be used for placing students at the university level.\n\nAs a placement instrument, the test has to be easy enough to identify those students needing remedial help, yet it also has to be complex enough to identify those students who are ready for calculus. Scores have to be precise enough to allow placement into many different levels of university coursework. In addition, the test has to be efficient to score, since thousands of students each year need to have their results promptly reported. In order to meet these criteria, the test development committee selected a multiple-choice format. The items measure four different areas of mathematical competence: elementary algebra, intermediate algebra, college algebra, and trigonometry. Each skill area has a different set of detailed objectives, carefully developed to best match university mathematics curricula across the University of Wisconsin System.\n\nEvery year, a new form of the Mathematics Placement Test is published, along with some new pilot items for each component of the test, and administered to all incoming Freshmen in the UW System. All items are subjected to a statistical review to identify which items effectively distinguish the students with the strongest mathematics skills or the weakest mathematics skills from the general population of students. Only the items which are most useful for differentiating among students are ever considered for use on a future form of the test.\n\nAlthough faculty cannot be considered disinterested observers, those who are familiar with the placement test feel that its quality is extremely high. The feeling among faculty at the participating UW institutions is that the test has helped enormously in placing students into appropriate courses. One of the strengths of the Mathematics Placement Test is that it is developed by faculty from throughout the University of Wisconsin System. Therefore, this test represents a UW System perspective with respect to the underlying skills that are necessary for success in our courses. One of the challenges, in this regard, is that the UW System campuses do not have a single Mathematics curriculum. Instead, each campus has its own curriculum and its own courses, which may or may not correspond well with courses on other UW campuses. To ensure that the placement test works well on each UW campus, each UW institution determines its own cutscores so as to optimize placement into its own Mathematics course sequence. Consequently, cutscores will vary from campus to campus as a result of curricular differences and student population differences. Also, on many campuses, the placement test is but one of several variables used for placing students, often also including ACT/SAT score, units of high school mathematics, and grades in high school mathematics courses.\n\nThe ability of this test to appropriately place students into courses rests in the quality of the match between test content and the institutional curricula at each UW campus. To ensure that the test mirrors the curriculum in introductory mathematics courses throughout UW System, the Mathematics Placement Test Development Committee has expanded to include one representative from most of the 14 UW institutions, as well as one Wisconsin high school mathematics teacher. This committee generally convenes twice each year to write and revise test items and discuss issues pertaining to test content and university curricula.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nOver the past few years, the Mathematics Placement Test has changed in several very important ways. Prior to the fall of 2000, the different campuses were combining items in different ways to form placement scores and make placement decisions. The particular set of items used by any one campus was selected to best match that campus' introductory curriculum. However, because campuses combined the test items in different ways, students who transferred from one UW institution to another often found themselves without valid placement scores and needing to retake the test. In 2000, the Mathematics Placement Test Development Committee agreed upon a common method for combining test objectives to create a uniform set of scores for reporting performance on the placement test. The three agreed-upon scores, one corresponding to each new objective, are labeled mathematics basics, algebra, and trigonometry. These three scores are now used by all System institutions.\n\nHistorically, the Mathematics Placement Test has always been organized in three different sections, labeled A, B, and C. Students were instructed to take either sections A and B (which contained elementary and intermediate algebra) or sections B and C (which contained intermediate and college algebra and trigonometry), depending upon their mathematics background and desired college placement. However, our experience was that many students found it difficult to accurately assess their level of preparedness and would often take the wrong two sections. On most campuses, students who scored too high on the AB test or too low on the BC test could not be placed accurately and were required to retest with the appropriate two sections of the test. This was very inconvenient, both for the students and for the university's testing office. Beginning in the fall of 2002, the three different sections were shortened and combined, and all students were asked to complete the entire test. This has helped eliminate the confusion over which two sections to take and has reduced the number of students needing to retest.\n\nGeneral Characteristics of the Test\n\n1. All items are to be completed by all students. The items are roughly ordered from elementary to advanced. The expectation is that less prepared students will answer fewer questions correctly than more prepared students.\n\n2. The test consists entirely of multiple choice questions, each with five choices.\n\n4. The Mathematics Placement Test is designed as a test of skill and not speed. Ample time is allowed for most students to answer all questions. Ninety (90) minutes are allowed to complete the test.\n\n5. The mathematics basics component has a reliability of .85. The algebra component has a reliability of .90. The trigonometry component has a reliability of .85. For all three sections, items are selected of appropriate difficulty to provide useful information within the range of scores used for placement throughout the System campuses.\n\nTest Description\n\nThe Mathematics Test Development Committee decided on three broad categories of items: mathematics basics, algebra, and trigonometry. The entire Mathematics Placement Test is designed to be completed in 90 minutes, sufficient time for most students to complete the test.\n\nItems for each of the three components are selected to conform to a carefully created set of detailed objectives. The percentage of items selected from each component are shown in Table 1 below.\n\nSample Items from the Trigonometry Component\n\nSample Trigonometry Items\n\nSample Geometry Items\n\nAdditional Statements About High School Preparation for College Mathematics Study\n\nCALCULUS\n\nThe number of high schools offering some version of calculus has increased markedly since the UW System Math Test Committee's first statement of objectives and philosophy, and experience with these courses has shown the validity of the Committee's original position. This position was that a high school calculus program may work either to the advantage or to the disadvantage of students depending on the nature of the students and the program. Today, it seems necessary to mention the negative possibilities first.\n\nA high school calculus program not designed to generate college calculus credit is likely to mathematically disadvantage students who go on to college. This is true for all such students whose college program entails use of mathematics skills, and particularly true of students whose college program involves calculus. High school programs of this type tend to be associated with curtailed or superficial preparation at the precalculus level and their students tend to have algebra deficiencies which hamper them not only in mathematics courses but in other courses in which mathematics is used.\n\nThe positive side is that a well-conceived high school calculus course which generates college calculus credit for its successful students will provide a mathematical advantage to students who go on to college. A study by the Mathematical Association of America identified the following features of successful high school calculus programs:\n\n1. they are open only to interested students who have completed the standard four year college preparatory sequence. A choice of mathematics options is available to students who have completed this sequence at the start of their senior year.\n\n2. they are full year courses taught at the college level in terms of text, syllabus, depth and rigor.\n\n3. their instructors have had good mathematical preparation (e.g. at least one semester of junior/senior level real analysis) and are provided with additional preparation time.\n\n4. instructors expect that their successful graduates will not repeat the course in college, but will get college credit for it.\n\nA variety of special arrangements exist whereby successful graduates of a high school calculus course may obtain credit at one or another college. A generally accepted method is for the students to take the Advanced Placement Examinations of the College Board. Success rates of students on this exam can be a good tool for evaluation of the success of a high school calculus course.\n\nGEOMETRY\n\nThe range of objectives in this document represents a small portion of the objectives of the traditional high school geometry course. The algebra objectives represent a substantial portion of the objectives of traditional high school algebra courses. The imbalance of test objectives can be explained in part by the nature of the entry level mathematics courses available at most colleges. The first college mathematics course generally will be either calculus or some level of algebra. A choice is usually based on three factors: (1) high school background; (2) placement test results; (3) curricular objectives. One reason for the emphasis on algebra in this document and on the test is that virtually all college placement decisions involve placement into a course which is more algebraic than geometric in character.\n\nStill, there are reasons for maintaining a geometry course as an essential component in a college preparatory program. Since there are no entry level courses in geometry at the college level, it is essential that students master geometry objectives while in high school. High school geometry contributes to a level of mathematical maturity which is important for success in college.\n\nLOGIC\n\nStudents should have the ability to use logic within a mathematical context, rather than the ability to do symbolic logic. The elements of logic which are particularly important include:\n\n1. Use of the connectives \"and' and \"or\" plus the \"negation\" of resultant statements, and recognition of the attendant relationship with the set operations \"intersection,\" \"union,\" and \"complementation.\"\n\n2. Interpretation of conditional statements of the form \"if P then Q,\" including the recognition of converse and contrapositive.\n\n3. Recognition that a general statement cannot be established by checking specific instances (unless the domain is finite), but that a general statement can be disproved by finding a single counter example. This should not discourage students from trying specific instances of a general statement to conjecture about its truth value.\n\nMoreover, logical thinking or logical reasoning as a method should permeate the entire curriculum. In this sense, logic cannot be restricted to a single topic or emphasized only in proof-based courses. Logical reasoning should be explicitly taught and practiced in the context of all topics. From this, students should learn that forgotten formulas can be recovered by reasoning from basic principles, and that unfamiliar or complex problems can be solved in a similar way.\n\nAlthough only two of the objectives explicitly refer to logic, the importance of logical thinking as a curriculum goal is not diminished. This goal, as well as other broad-based goals, is to be pursued despite the fact that it is not readily measured on placement tests.\n\nPROBLEM SOLVING\n\nProblem solving involves the definition and analysis of a problem together with the selecting and combining of mathematical ideas leading to a solution. Ideally, a complete set of problem solving skills would appear in the list of objectives. The fact that only a few problem solving objectives appear in the list does not diminish the importance of problem solving in the high school curriculum. The limitations of the multiple choice format preclude the testing of higher level problem solving skills.\n\nMATHEMATICS ACROSS THE CURRICULUM\n\nMathematics is a basic skill of equal importance with reading, writing, and speaking. If basic skills are to be considered important and mastered by students, they must be encouraged and reinforced throughout the curriculum. Support for mathematics in other subject areas should include:\n\n– a positive attitude toward mathematics\n\n– attention to correct reasoning and the principles of logic\n\n– use of quantitative skills\n\n– application of mathematics curriculum.\n\nCOMPUTERS IN THE CURRICULUM\n\nThe impact of the computer on daily life is apparent, and consequently many high schools have instituted courses dealing with computer skills. While the learning of computer skills is important, computer courses should not be construed as replacements for mathematics courses.\n\nCALCULATORS\n\nThere are occasions in college math courses when calculators are useful or even necessary (for example, to find values of trig functions), so students should be able to use calculators at a level consistent with the level at which they are studying mathematics (four-function calculators initially, scientific calculators in pre-calculus). A more compelling reason for being able to use calculators is that they will be needed in other courses involving applications of mathematics. The ability to use a calculator is very definitely a part of college preparation.\n\nOn the other hand, students need to be able to rapidly supply from their heads – whether by calculation or from memory – basic arithmetic, in order to be able to follow mathematical explanations. They should also know the conventional priority of arithmetic operations and be able to deal with grouping symbols in their heads. For example, students should know that (-3)2 s is 9, that -32 is -9, and that (-3)3 is -27 without needing to push buttons on their calculators. Moreover, students should be able to do enough mental estimation to check whether the results obtained via calculator are approximately correct.\n\nBeginning in the spring of 1991, the use of scientific calculators has been allowed on the UW Mathematics Placement Test. The test was redesigned to accommodate the use of scientific calculators, so as to minimize the effects on placement due to the use or nonuse of calculators. Exact numbers such as π, continue to appear in both questions and answers where appropriate.\n\nUse of scientific, non-graphing calculators is optional. Each student is advised to use or not use a calculator in a manner consistent with his or her prior classroom experience. Calculators will not be supplied at the test sites.\n\nMathematics curricula and faculty throughout UW are divided on whether or not to permit graphing calculators in classrooms. There remain many college-level courses for which graphing calculators are not allowed. Therefore, the placement test has not been revised to accommodate the use of graphing calculators. Students may not use graphing calculators for the Mathematics Placement Test.\n\nPROBABILITY AND STATISTICS\n\nAlthough university curricula are somewhat in a state of flux, with many basic issues and philosophies being examined, the normal entry level courses in mathematics remain the traditional algebra and calculus courses. Therefore, the placement tests must reflect those skills which are necessary for success in these courses. This is not intended to imply that courses stressing topics other than algebra and geometry are not vital to the high school mathematics curriculum, but rather that those topics do not assist in placing students in the traditional university entry level courses.\n\nProbability and statistics are topics of value in the mathematical training of young people today that are not reflected on the placement test. It is the Committee's feeling that these topics are important to the elementary and secondary curriculum. They are gaining significance on university campuses, both within mathematics departments and within those departments not normally thought of as being quantitative in nature. The social sciences are seeking mathematical models to apply, and in general these models tend to be probabilistic or statistical. As a result, the curriculum in these areas is becoming heavily permeated with probability and statistics.\n\nMathematics departments are finding many of their graduates going into jobs utilizing computer science or statistics. Consequently, their curricula are beginning to reflect these trends. The Committee urges the educational community to develop and maintain meaningful instruction in probability and statistics.\n\nHow Teachers Can Help Students Prepare for the Test\n\nThe best way to prepare students for the placement tests is to offer a solid mathematics curriculum and to encourage students to take four years of college preparatory mathematics. We do not advise any special test preparation, as we have found that students who are prepared specifically for this test, either by practice sessions or the use of supplementary materials, score artificially high. Often such students are placed into a higher level course than their background dictates, resulting in these students either failing or being forced to drop the course. Due to enrollment difficulties on many campuses, students are unable to transfer into a more appropriate course after the semester has begun.\n\nSignificant factors in the placement level of a student are the high school courses taken as well as whether or not mathematics was taken in the senior year. Data indicate that four years of college preparatory mathematics in high school not only raises the entry level mathematics course, but predicts success in other areas as well, including the ability to graduate from college in four years.\n\nTeachers should certainly feel free to encourage students to be well-rested and try to remain as relaxed as possible during the test. We intend that the experience be an enjoyable, yet challenging one. Remember that the test is designed to measure students at many different levels of mathematical preparedness; all students are not expected to answer all items correctly. There is no penalty for guessing, and intelligent guessing will most likely help students achieve a higher score.\n\nUse of the Tests\n\nWhen the UW System Mathematics Placement Tests were developed, they were written to be used strictly as a tool to aid in the most appropriate placement of students. They were not designed to compare students, to evaluate high schools or to dictate curriculum. The way an institution chooses to use the test to place students is a decision made by each institution. The Center for Placement Testing can and does help institutions with these decisions.\n\nEach campus will continue to analyze and modify its curriculum and hence will continue to modify the way in which it uses the placement tests to place students. Cutoff scores might need to be changed over time to reflect the prerequisites for a campus' curriculum. It is also important for follow-up studies to be made to determine the effectiveness of the placement procedures. Contact must be maintained with the high schools so that modifications in the curriculum in both the high schools and in the UW System can be discussed.",

      "text": "The Mathematics Department is committed to expanding students' understanding and appreciation of mathematics through a comprehensive, content-based plan that acknowledges and addresses differences in motivation, goals, ability, and learning styles. All students must complete three years of mathematics and pass a Regents examination.\nAll mathematics courses are year-long courses.\n\nCourse Offerings\n\nIntegrated Algebra - This is the first mathematics course in high school. The completion of this course -- 1 to 2 years -- depends on the entry level of the student. Algebra provides tools and develops ways of thinking that are necessary for solving problems in a wide variety of disciplines such as science, business, and fine arts. Linear equations, quadratic functions, absolute value, and exponential functions are studied. Coordinate geometry is integrated into this course as well as data analysis, including measures of central tendency and lines of best fit. Elementary probability, right triangle trigonometry, and set theory complete the course. Students will take the Integrated Algebra Regents examination at the conclusion of this course.\n\nGeometry - This is the second course in mathematics for high school students. In this course, students will have the opportunity to make conjectures about geometric situations and prove in a variety of ways that their conclusion follows logically from their hypothesis. Congruence and similarity of triangles will be established using appropriate theorems. Transformations including rotations, reflections, translations, and dilations will be taught. Properties of triangles, quadrilaterals and circles will be examined. Geometry is meant to lead students to an understanding that reasoning and proof are fundamental aspects of mathematics. Students will take the Geometry Regents examination at the conclusion of this course.\n\nAlgebra 2 and Trigonometry - This is the third of the three courses in high school mathematics. In this course, the number system will be extended to include imaginary and complex numbers. Students will learn about polynomial, absolute value, radical, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. Problem situations involving direct and indirect variation will be solved. Data analysis will be extended to include measures of dispersion and the analysis of regression models. Arithmetic and geometric sequences will be evaluated. Binomial expressions will provide the basis for the study of probability theory, and the normal probability distribution will be analyzed.

      "text": "Specification\n\nAims\n\nThe course unit will deepen and extend students' knowledge and understanding of commutative algebra. By the end of the course unit the student will have learned more about familiar mathematical objects such as polynomials and algebraic numbers, will have acquired various computational and algebraic skills and will have seen how the introduction of structural ideas leads to the solution of mathematical problems.\n\nBrief Description of the unit\n\nThe central theme of this course is factorisation (theory and practice) in commutative rings; rings of polynomials are our main examples but there are others, such as rings of algebraic integers.\n\nPolynomials are familiar objects which play a part in virtually every branch of mathematics. Historically, the study of solutions of polynomial equations (algebraic geometry and number theory) and the study of symmetries of polynomials (invariant theory) were a major source of inspiration for the vast expansion of algebra in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nIn this course the algebra of polynomials in n variables over a field of coefficients is the basic object of study. The course covers fairly recent advances which have important applications to computer algebra and computational algebraic geometry (Gröbner bases - an extension of the Euclidean division algorithm to polynomials in 2 or more variables), together with a selection of more classical material.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of this course unit students will be able to demonstrate\n\nfacility in dealing with polynomials (in one and more variables);\n\nunderstanding of some basic ideal structure of polynomial rings;\n\nappreciation of the subtleties of factorisation into prime and irreducible elements;\n\nability to compute generating sets and Gröbner bases for ideals in polynomial rings;\n\nability to relate polynomials to other algebraic structures (algebraic varieties and groups of symmetries);\n\nability to solve problems relating to the factorisation of polynomials,\nirreducible polynomials and extension fields.\n\nFuture topics requiring this course unit\n\nNone, though the material connects usefully with algebraic geometry and Galois theory.\n\nTextbooks\n\nThe first two books are useful general references on algebra though neither covers Gröbner bases (which is a relatively new topic). For Gröbner bases see the book by Cox, Little and O'Shea. The last book is a new textbook which combines Gröbner bases with more traditional material.\n\nTeaching and learning methods\n\nTwo lectures and one examples class each week. In addition students should expect to spend at least four hours each\nweek on private study for this course unit.\n\nCourse notes will be provided, as well as examples sheets and solutions. The notes will be\nconcise and will need to be supplemented by your own notes taken in lectures, particularly\nof worked examples.",

      "text": "Math Anxiety\n\nThroughout grade school and maybe even in high school, many students felt there was no reason to take math.\n\nThese students hated math and felt they were never going to use it. There is still the tendency to think that only those who go into technical fields need math. Math teaches us to think. Math helps us to organize or thoughts, analyze information, and better understand the world around us.\n\nThere are myths about math that we have accepted as true and these tend to hold us back when it comes to learning math.\n\nSome popular myths are:\n\nFemales aren't any good at math\n\nThe majority can't do well in math because only a few people really have mathematical minds. (We are happy to get a \"C\" in math whereas we won't accept a \"C\" in English or any other subject that we like. We expect to do poorly in math).\n\nSome hints for studying math:\n\nRead your text first, before you try any problems.\n\nWrite down the theorems and definitions, read them out loud, and then rewrite them into your own words.\n\nDo a lot of problems and practice tests.\n\nDon't cram for tests. Frequent practice and review is the key to learning math. If you cram, you will be unsure of yourself. Formulas will become confused and problems will look differently.\n\nDon't keep looking in the back of your debt at the answers a. You may have the right answer but may not have done the problem correctly. b. If you have the wrong answer, it could affect your confidence and concentration.\n\nWhen you aren't sure of a problem, ask for help, but never erase your work. Even if the problem is wrong, find to where you were wrong and where you were right. You can learn just as much from your mistakes as from what you've done correctly.\n\nSet aside a certain time everyday to study math.\n\nGet extra help when you need it. Come to the PLC for tutoring; ask your teacher or a classmate for help. Remember, you need to understand math; that does not mean memorizing it.\n\nBegin at the right place. If you feel that you need a review, be sure to start with a math class that begins at your level.\n\nA common story instructors hear from math students is that the students can do the work or homework and in class but when it comes down to the test, the students freeze.\n\nThe number one problem of math test anxiety is negative self-talk. Negative self-talk is when you talk yourself deeper into anxiety. You think \"what if\" or \"I can't\". You worry about finishing the test on time. You tend to concentrate on how you are feeling, on how the anxiety is affecting you instead of on the test itself.\n\nSome hints to counteract math test anxiety:\n\nConfront your anxiety by admitting that you are worried about this test. Anxiety and fear react in the body in the same way, and admitting that you re anxious relieves some of the anxiety.\n\nUse positive self-talk. Keep telling yourself that you can do this math, that you know this stuff, and that you are prepared.\n\nControl your physical self. Take a brisk walk around the classroom buildings using positive self-talk while walking. Keep your heart rate and respiration steady by doing slow, five count deep breathing exercises. Loosen tight muscles on your neck by doing shoulder rolls forward and backward. Relax legs and arms by shake outs before you walk into the classroom.\n\nFocus your attention away from yourself and towards the problem.\n\nWhen taking practice tests or working on homework, keep a diary of the kinds of thoughts you are having while working out the problems. Relate these concerns to your tutor or teacher.\n\nWhile the above suggestions will be helpful for the physical and emotional self, the following suggestions may be beneficial for the academic self.\n\nSome hints to better test taking:\n\nWrite down formulas and other memorized information directly onto the test. This eliminates the risk of forgetting or altering the information incorrectly as you work the problems.\n\nPreview the test. Find a problem you are comfortable with and start there. It is not necessary to work in numerical order. Try instead to choose an order that helps you stay positive.\n\nStart with the easier problems. Also keep in mind the total point of the test and plan a strategy to get the most amount of points possible in the shortest amount of time.\n\nPass over difficult problems. Give yourself a certain time limit to solve it; if more time is needed, circle the number and come back to it later. Use the strategy you've planned and remain positive. If you find yourself becoming anxious, try some relaxation techniques to calm down physically and then focus back on the test.\n\nReview the problems you've skipped. Maybe other problems you have solved can give you a better insight to the work needed for this problem.\n\nShow some work for each problem, even if it's a guess. Partial credit is still good.\n\nAllow for some time to look back over your work. Make sure you have read the directions correctly and look for careless errors.\n\nUse all of the test time. Anxiety can induce a need to escape. Try to control the anxiety before this feeling takes over. Leaving a test early may mean a loss of points on your test as well as other negative feedback. Remember, always try to remain positive.\n\nRemember, the key to conquering math anxiety is practice, practice, practice. The more confident you become in your ability, the better you will do.",

      "text": "GOOD COURSES\n\nCONTENTS\n\nI. Undergraduate mathematics\n\nA discussion of what a good undergrad programme in\nmathematics should be about can be found here.\nThe book concerns mathematics in the American system, where applied\nmathematics was\nrarely taught in maths departments (at the time of writing). It also\ndiscusses the content often presented in four-year American liberal arts\ncolleges, and two-year community colleges, and criticises the specialist\nnature of the topics\nchosen. The courses offered to students of science and engineering by\ndepartments of mathematics are also panned, one point being that the\nprofessor doing this job knows no science or engineering at all.\n\nThe author, Morris Kline, talks of the research professor, who hates\nteaching undergraduates of any sort, and also mentions the wide use made\nof graduate student tutors, who have neither training nor\nexperience. Scarce mention is made of full, associate and assistant\nprofessors, who form (in my experience) the bulk of the academic staff in\nmost departments of mathematics in American universities, and who do a\nvery professional job in their teaching, as well as research and admin.\n\nSome of the criticism of present methodology is way off centre. For\nexample, Kline objects to the teaching of applied mathematics by using\nover-simplified models. He argues that there is no point teaching the laws\nof falling bodies as if there were no air friction: tell that to a\nparachutist, he quips. In this he fails to capture the essence of\nscience: we must study models, and compare with experiment, so that we may\nshoot them down, and revise them. More, we can usually find a range of\napplicability of\nthe simple model, outside of which it is no longer a good one. But\nworse: he seems to be saying that only a fully developed, correct model\nshould be taught. This goes against the teaching of Picasso: a teacher\nshould mix a little bit of what we do not know with a lot of what we do\nknow. I taught physics at Virginia Tech., a course in which the technician\nhad prepared the \"Galileo Bench\". This was an inclined plane on an air\ncushion, in which Galileo's laws of falling bodies, s = s(0) + vt + 1/2 at2,\nwas true, to within the experimental error. Some of the students\nfound these laws hard to understand, even without friction. When they had achieved\nthat, we went on to the refinements coming from friction. To start with\nthe full theory, would place them in a similar position to Galileo... who\nhad to cope with Aristotle's dictum that a force was needed to keep a\nbody moving; when Galileo had abandoned this, he broke the 2000 year stalemate\nin science.\n\nMost of the points made about the limited syllabus of a maths degree do\nnot apply to the UK, where applied\nmathematics traditionally forms half of the degree in\nmathematics. However, with the possible replacement of A-levels with a\nbacc., our school programme might become more like the American one. We\nshould then think about whether the university course might also move in\nthat direction. Should we have four-year degree courses in mathematics, with\nthe first year devoted to maths, physics, chemistry and computing? These\ncould cover the four subjects to replace the omitted parts of A-level. The\nmathematics course\ncould cover analytic geometry with calculus, trig, probability and\nstatistics,\ncomplex numbers, and vectors, with a little theory of matrices.\nPhysics could include Newton's laws, with examples from one\ndimension, such as motion under constant gravity, friction,\nsimple damped oscillator, sinusoidal wave\nmotion, interference of waves, the laws of thermodynamics, Eulerian fluid equations,\nand electricity and magnetism (before Maxwell). Chemistry might contain\nthe Bohr atom, the Mendeleev table, the inorganic chemistry of\nacids and bases, salts and metals. Some physical chemistry such as the law\nof mass-action, and some organic chemistry, should be\nincluded. Lab work in physics and chemistry should be at the\nlevel now done in schools in the UK. Computing might introduce a useful\nlanguage such as Java, Maple or Mathematica, and should give a general\ncompetence in Windows.\n\nKline suggests that scholarship in mathematics would serve a purpose,\nto reduce the number of pointless and empty papers, by critical reviews.\nThis used to be the job of Mathematical Reviews, until it changed its\npolicy, and now bans controversy in the reviews. Kline suggests that a new\ndegree of high status, Doctor in Arts, should be awarded, which would not\nrequire\noriginal theorems, but would be readable and deep. We have something\nsimilar, in\nthe M. Phil., which however has not got the status of the Ph. D.\n\nIII.Abstract Algebra\n\nIV. Graph theory\n\nV. The Kentucky Archives on\nMathematics\n\nThe site of the University\nof Kentucky hosts a list of free material on mathematics, of which\nIII. above is just one. I found the course on partial\ndifferential equations very useful. The course\non Hilbert Space Methods for Partial Differential Equations, by\nR. E. Showalter, is very pleasant indeed. It is slightly informal in its\ndefinition\nof distributions, but this is all that is needed for partial\ndifferential equations at this level.\n\nVI.Wikipedia\n\nWikipedia is a free internet\nencyclopaedia, written by its viewers. There\nis quite a large set of mathematics pages, as well as pages on physics and\nother sciences, and all other subjects. Some pages are sketchy, and others\nare literally empty,\nawaiting the first volunteer. I found a mistake in Wightman's\nbiography: it said he was British. I was able to edit that page and\ncorrect it. The statement of the Navier-Stokes equations could not be\nright, as the terms do not all have the same physical dimension.\n\nThe site is worth a browse, and might become more reliable as time\npasses.",

      "text": "The story of geometry is the story of mathematics itself: Euclidean geometry was the first branch of mathematics to be systematically studied and placed on a firm logical foundation, and it is the prototype for the axiomatic method that lies at the foundation of modern mathematics. It has been taught to students for more than two millennia as a model of logical thought.\n\nThis book tells the story of how the axiomatic method has progressed from Euclid's time to ours, as a way of understanding what mathematics is, how we read and evaluate mathematical arguments, and why mathematics has achieved the level of certainty it has. It is designed primarily for advanced undergraduates who plan to teach secondary school geometry, but it should also provide something of interest to anyone who wishes to understand geometry and the axiomatic method better. It introduces a modern, rigorous, axiomatic treatment of Euclidean and (to a lesser extent) non-Euclidean geometries, offering students ample opportunities to practice reading and writing proofs while at the same time developing most of the concrete geometric relationships that secondary teachers will need to know in the classroom.\n\nReadership\n\nUndergraduate students interested in geometry and secondary mathematics teaching.\n\nReviews\n\n\"Lee's \"Axiomatic Geometry\" gives a detailed, rigorous development of plane Euclidean geometry using a set of axioms based on the real numbers. It is suitable for an undergraduate college geometry course, and since it covers most of the topics normally taught in American high school geometry, it would be excellent preparation for future high school teachers. There is a brief treatment of the non-Euclidean hyperbolic plane at the end.\"\n\n-- Robin Hartshorne, University of California, Berkeley\n\n\"The goal of Lee's well-written book is to explain the axiomatic method and its role in modern mathematics, and especially in geometry. Beginning with a discussion (and a critique) of Euclid's elements, the author gradually introduces and explains a set of axioms sufficient to provide a rigorous foundation for Euclidean plane geometry.\n\n\"Because they assume properties of the real numbers, Lee's axioms are fairly intuitive, and this results in a presentation that should be accessible to upper level undergraduate mathematics students. Although the pace is leisurely at first, this book contains a surprising amount of material, some of which can be found among the many exercises. Included are discussions of basic trigonometry, hyperbolic geometry and an extensive treatment of compass and straightedge constructions.\"\n\n-- I. Martin Isaacs, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\n\"Jack Lee's book will be extremely valuable for future high school math teachers. It is perfectly designed for students just learning to write proofs; complete beginners can use the appendices to get started, while more experienced students can jump right in. The axioms, definitions, and theorems are developed meticulously, and the book culminates in several chapters on hyperbolic geometry--a lot of fun, and a nice capstone to a two-quarter course on axiomatic geometry.\"",

      "text": "eBook Ordering Options\n\nDescriptionExamining how information technology has changed mathematical requirements, the idea of Techno-mathematical Literacies (TmL) is introduced to describe the emerging need to be fluent in the language of mathematical inputs and outputs to technologies and to interpret and communicate with these, rather than merely to be procedurally competent with calculations. The authors argue for careful analyses of workplace activities, looking beyond the conventional thinking about numeracy, which still dominates policy arguments about workplace mathematics. Throughout their study, the authors answer the following fundamental questions:\n\nWhat mathematical knowledge and skills matter for the world of work today?\n\nHow does information technology change the necessary knowledge and the ways in which it is encountered?\n\nHow can we develop these essential new skills in the workforce?\n\nWith evidence of successful opportunities to learn with TmL that were co-designed and evaluated with employers and employees, this book provides suggestions for the development of TmL through the use of authentic learning activities, and interactive software design. Essential reading for trainers and managers in industry, teachers, researchers and lecturers of mathematics education, and stakeholders implementing evidence-based policy, this book maps the fundamental changes taking place in workplace mathematics.\n\nContents\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n1.

      "text": "Discovering Geometry Intro\n\nDiscovering Geometry began in my classroom over 35 years ago. During my first ten years of teaching I did not use a textbook, but created my own daily lesson plans and classroom management system. I believe students learn with greater depth of understanding when they are actively engaged in the process of discovering concepts and we should delay the introduction of proof in geometry until students are ready. Until Discovering Geometry, no textbook followed that philosophy.\n\nI was also involved in a Research In Industry grant where I repeatedly heard that the skills valued in all working environments were the ability to express ideas verbally and in writing, and the ability to work as part of a team. I wanted my students to be engaged daily in doing mathematics and exchanging ideas in small cooperative groups.\n\nThe fourth edition of Discovering Geometry includes new hands-on techniques, curriculum research, and technologies that enhance my vision of the ideal geometry class. I send my heartfelt appreciation to the many teachers who contributed their feedback during classroom use. Their students and future students will help continue the evolution of Discovering Geometry.",

      "text": "Post navigation\n\nReading Math\n\nMy Algebra II kids don't like to read the textbook. Heck, neither do my calculus students. This isn't surprising. It's extra work and it's hard. My class also makes it hard for them, because I do not use the textbook as a skeletal structure for the course. I teach mainly out of my own materials, and use the book more as a supplement.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that I don't want them reading math. Kids are never taught to \"read\" a math textbook. If they ever do approach a math textbook, they approach it like a history book. The read it linearly. They also read it passively. Their eyes glaze over. They read words, but they don't try to connect the words to the equations or pictures. They don't read with a pencil in their hands. They hope for some Divine Knowledge to descend upon them simply by having the book open and their eyes on it.\n\nThat doesn't work. We all know this. Reading math is an active thing.\n\nAnd so recently I've started talking with my class about it. To start this process/discussion, one that I hope continues, I gave my students a worksheet to fill out (see above). I love the honesty with which they responded.\n\nFor question A, some representative responses:\n\n\"I read what was assigned to me but did not read anything extra.\"\n\"I find that textbook reading is pretty boring, so I don't do it unless I have to.\"\n\"I did not because I had assumed I wouldn't learn things I needed. All I would do was look at examples.\"\n\"No, I find it difficult to understand math when reading it in paragraphs; it makes more sense to me with a teacher.\"\n\"I did not generally read my math textbooks. I did, however, always look over the example problems.\"\n\nSome responses for Question B:\n\n1. The writing can be confusing, wordy, and not thorough\n2. The book is BORING\n3. Small print\n4. Too many words for math\n5. Outdated examples\n\nSome responses for Question C\n\n1. Everything is all in one place\n2. Have a glossary\n3. Can read at own pace; refer pack to the text when I get stuck\n4. Sidenotes! Diagrams! Pictures\n5. Real life examples\n6. Definitions clear\n7. Key terms are highlighted\n8. Wide range of example problems with step by step instructions\n9. Colors!\n\nI hope to do more as we go along. I might have them learn on their own, using the textbook (and the online video help) a whole section or two. There's no reason they can't learn to use the book to be independent learners. I will give them class time and photocopies of the section they need to learn, and they will have to figure things out by the end of the class for a 3 question quiz.\n\nI also hope that by the end of the year, we can use their critique of math textbooks for them to write their own textbook. Okay, okay, not quite. That's way too ambitious for me. Two years ago I had my Algebra II kids write really comprehensive Study Guides for the final exam. This year I might ask my kids to pick some of the hardest material and create their own \"textbook\" for it. They'll get to write it in pairs, and then they can share their finished product with the rest of the class. That will probably happen in the 3rd for 4th quarter.\n\nAnyway, I thought I'd share. Since I like to emphasize the importance of mathematical communication to my kids (though I don't do it nearly enough), I thought I'd talk about this one additional component in addition to getting students to talk and write math… READING MATH!\n\nPost navigation\n\n3 thoughts on \"Reading Math\"\n\nI found that reading \"How to read a book\" by Mortimer J Adler really helped me learn how to read a book I intended (or needed to) learn from. Most people (according to the book, and I agree) never learn to read beyond an elementary level, and this book teaches you how to read at a higher level. Works really well when you start using the techniques and such while reading the book. I'd encourage you to check it out.\n\nMy son has learned most of his math from reading books—he finds classroom instruction excruciatingly slow and has a hard time staying alert. He does sometimes need an explanation different from the one in the book, which (so far) I've been able to provide for him. Unlike your students, he finds the colors, sidebars, and gratuitous pictures distracting rather than helpful. So far, the best books for him have been from the Art of Problem Solving series, which have very clear but concise explanations.\n\nI think that reading speed makes a big difference: kids who read slower than talking speed have a harder time gathering information from books than from oral presentation.\n\nI still remember that linear algebra class I took at the local college. The prof taught the value of sloooooow reading. (it ruined his ability to read a novel at a fast pace) I turned this into a lesson.",

      "text": "Syllabus Structure and Content\n\n3.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nThe way in which the mathematical content in the syllabuses is organised and presented in the syllabus document is described in sections 3.2 and 3.3. Section 3.3 also discusses the main alterations, both in content and in emphasis, with respect to the preceding versions. The forthcoming changes in the primary curriculum, which will have \"knock-on\" effects at second level, are outlined in Section 3.4. Finally, in Section 3.5, the content is related to the aims of the syllabuses.\n\n3.2 STRUCTURE\n\nFor the Higher and Ordinary level syllabuses, the mathematical material forming the content is divided into eight sections, as follows:\n\nSets\n\nNumber systems\n\nApplied arithmetic and measure\n\nAlgebra\n\nStatistics\n\nGeometry\n\nTrigonometry\n\nFunctions and graphs\n\nThe corresponding material for the Foundation level syllabus is divided into seven sections; there are minor differences in the sequence and headings, resulting in the following list:\n\nSets\n\nNumber systems\n\nApplied arithmetic and measure\n\nStatistics and data handling\n\nAlgebra\n\nRelations, functions and graphs\n\nGeometry\n\nThe listing by content area is intended to give mathematical coherence to the syllabuses, and to help teachers locate specific topics (or check that topics are not listed). The content areas are reasonably distinct, indicating topics with different historical roots and different main areas of application. However, they are inter-related and interdependent, and it is not intended that topics would be dealt with in total isolation from each other. Also, while the seven or eight areas, and the contents within each area, are presented in a logical sequence ­ combining, as far as possible, a sensible mathematical order with a developmental one for learners ­ it is envisaged that many content areas listed later in the syllabus would be introduced before or alongside those listed earlier. (For example, geometry appears near the end of the list, but the course committee specifically recommends that introductory geometrical work is started in First Year, allowing plenty of time for the ideas to be developed in a concrete way, and thoroughly understood, before the more abstract elements are introduced.) However, the different order of listing for the Foundation level syllabus does reflect a suggestion that the introduction of some topics (notably formal algebra) might be delayed. Some of these points are taken up in Section 4.\n\nAppropriate pacing of the syllabus content over the three years of the junior cycle is a challenge. Decisions have to be made at class or school level. Some of the factors affecting the decisions are addressed in these Guidelines in Section 4, under the heading of planning and organisation.\n\n3.3 SYLLABUS CONTENT\n\nThe contents of the Higher, Ordinary and Foundation level syllabuses are set out in the corresponding sections of the syllabus document. In each case, the content is presented in the two-column format used for the Leaving Certificate syllabuses introduced in the 1990s, with the lefthand column listing the topics and the right-hand column adding notes (for instance, providing illustrative examples, or highlighting specific aspects of the topics which are included or excluded). Further illustration of the depth of treatment of topics is given in Section 5 (in dealing with assessment) and in the proposed sample assessmentmaterials (available separately).\n\nCHANGES IN CONTENT\n\nAs indicated in Section 1, the revisions deal only with specific problems in the previous syllabuses, and do not reflect a root-and-branch review of the mathematics education appropriate for students in the junior cycle. The main changes in content, addressing the problems identified in Section 1, are described below. A summary ofall the changes is provided in Appendix 1.\n\nCalculators and calculator-related techniques\n\nAs pointed out in the introduction to each syllabus, calculators are assumed to be readily available for appropriate use, both as teaching/learning tools and as computational aids; they will also be allowed in examinations.\n\nThe concept of \"appropriate\" use is crucial here. Calculators are part of the modern world, and students need to be able to use them efficiently where and when required. Equally, students need to retain and develop their feel for number, while the execution of mental calculations, for instance to make estimates, becomes even more important than it was heretofore. Estimation, which was not mentioned in the 1987 syllabus (though it was covered in part by the phrase \"the practice of approximating before evaluating\"), now appears explicitly and will be tested in examinations.\n\nThe importance of the changes in this area is reflected in two developments. First, a set of guidelines on calculators is being produced. It addresses issues such as the purchase of suitable machines as well as the rationale for their use. Secondly, in 1999 the Department of Education and Science commissioned a research project to monitor numeracy-related skills (with and without calculators) over the period of introduction of the revised syllabuses. If basic numeracy and mental arithmetic skills are found to disimprove, remedial action may have to be taken. It is worth noting that research has not so far isolated any consistent association between calculator use in an education system and performance by students from that system in international tests of achievement.\n\nMathematical tables are not mentioned in the content sections of the syllabus, except for a brief reference indicating that they are assumed to be available, likewise for appropriate use. Teachers and students can still avail of them as learning tools and for reference if they so wish. Tables will continue to be available in examinations, but questions will not specifically require students to use them.\n\nGeometry\n\nThe approach to synthetic geometry was one of the major areas which had to be confronted in revising the syllabuses. Evidence from examination scripts suggested that in many cases the presentation in the 1987 syllabus was not being followed in the classroom. In particular, in the Higher level syllabus, the sequence of proofs and intended proof methods were being adapted. Teachers were responding to students' difficulties in coping with the approach that attempted to integrate transformational concepts with those more traditionally associated with synthetic geometry, as described in Section 1.1 of these Guidelines.\n\nFor years, and all over the world, there have been difficulties in deciding how ­ indeed, whether ­ to present synthetic geometry and concepts of logical proof to students of junior cycle standing. Their historical importance, and their role as guardians of one of the defining aspects of mathematics as a discipline, have led to a wish to retain them in the Irish mathematics syllabuses; but the demands made on students who have not yet reached the Piagetian stage of formal operations are immense. \"Too much, too soon\" not only contravenes the principle of learnability (section 2.5), but leads to rote learning and hence failure to attain the objectives which the geometry sections of the syllabuses are meant to address. The constraints of a minor revision precluded the question of \"whether\" from being asked on this occasion. The question of \"how\" raises issues to do with the principles of soundness versus learnability. The resulting formulation set out in the syllabus does not claim to be a full description of a geometrical system. Rather, it is intended to provide a defensible teaching sequence that will allow students to learn geometry meaningfully and to come to realise the power of proof. Some of the issues that this raises are discussed in Appendix 2.\n\nThe revised version can be summarised as follows.\n\nThe approach omits the transformational elements, returning to a more traditional approach based on congruency.\n\nIn the interests of consistency and transfer between levels, the underlying ideas are basically the same across all three syllabuses, though naturally they are developed to very different levels in the different syllabuses.\n\nThe system has been carefully formulated to display the power of logical argument at a level which ­ hopefully ­ students can follow and appreciate. It is therefore strongly recommended that, in the classroom, material is introduced in the sequence in which it is listed in the syllabus document. For theHigher level syllabus, the concepts of logicalargument and rigorous proof are particularlyimportant. Thus, in examinations, attempted proofsthat presuppose \"later\" material in order to establish\"earlier\" results will be penalised. Moreover, proofsusing transformations will not be accepted.\n\nTo shorten the Higher level syllabus, only some of the theorems have been designated as ones for which students may be asked to supply proofs in the examinations. The other theorems should still beproved as part of the learning process;students should be able to follow the logical development, and see models of far more proofs than they are expected to reproduce at speed under examination conditions. The required saving of time is expected to occur because students do not have to put in the extra effort needed to develop fluency in writing out particular proofs.\n\nStudents taking the Ordinary and (a fortiori)Foundation level syllabuses are not required to prove theorems, but ­ in accordance with the level-specific aims (Section 2.4) ­ should experience the logical reasoning involved in ways in which they can understand it. The general thrust of the synthetic geometry section of the syllabuses for these students is not changed from the 1987 versions.\n\nIt may be noted that the formulation of the Foundation level syllabus in 1987 emphasised the learning process rather than the product or outcomes. In the current version, the teaching/learning suggestions are presented in theseGuidelines (chiefly in Section 4), not in the syllabus document. It is important to emphasise that the changed formulation in the syllabus is not meant to point to a more formal presentation than previously suggested for Foundation level students.\n\nSection 4.9 of this document contains a variety of suggestions as to how the teaching of synthetic geometry to junior cycle students might be addressed.\n\nTransformation geometry still figures in the syllabuses, but is treated separately from the formal development of synthetic geometry. The approach is intended to be intuitive, helping students to develop their visual and spatial ability. There are opportunities here to build on the work on symmetry in the primary curriculum and to develop aesthetic appreciation of mathematical patterns.\n\nOther changes to the Higher level syllabus\n\nLogarithms are removed. Their practical role as aids to calculation is outdated; the theory of logarithms is sufficiently abstract to belong more comfortably to the senior cycle.\n\nMany topics are \"pruned\" in order to shorten the syllabus.\n\nOther changes to the Ordinary level syllabus\n\nThe more conceptually difficult areas of algebra and coordinate geometry are simplified.\n\nA number of other topics are \"pruned\".\n\nOther changes to the Foundation level syllabus\n\nThere is less emphasis on fractions but rather more on decimals. (The change was introduced partly because of the availability of calculators ­ though, increasingly, calculators have buttons and routines which allow fractions to be handled in a comparatively easy way.)\n\nThe coverage of statistics and data handling is increased. These topics can easily be related to students' everyday lives, and so can help students to recognise the relevance of mathematics. They lend themselves also to active learning methods (such as those presented in Section 4) and the use of spatial as well as computational abilities. Altogether, therefore, the topics provide great scope for enhancing students' enjoyment and appreciation of mathematics. They also give opportunities for developing suitably concrete approaches to some of the more abstract material, notably algebra and functions (see Section 4.8).\n\nThe algebra section is slightly expanded. The formal algebraic content of the 1987 syllabus was so slight that students may not have had scope to develop their understanding; alternatively, teachers may have chosen to omit the topic. The rationale for the present adjustment might be described as \"use it or lose it\". The hope is that the students will be able to use it, and that ­ suitably addressed ­ it can help them in making some small steps towards the more abstract mathematics which they may need to encounter later in the course of their education.\n\nOverall, therefore, it is hoped that the balance between the syllabuses is improved. In particular, the Ordinary level syllabus may be better positioned between a more accessible Higher level and a slightly expanded Foundation level.\n\nCHANGES IN EMPHASIS\n\nThe brief for revision of the syllabuses, as described in Section 1.2, precluded a root-and-branch reconsideration of their style and content. However, it did allow for some changes in emphasis: or rather, in certain cases, for some of the intended emphases to be made more explicit and more clearly related to rationale, content, assessment, and ­ via the Guidelines ­ methodology. The changes in, or clarification of, emphasis refer in particular to the following areas.\n\nUnderstanding\n\nGeneral objectives B and C of the syllabus refer respectively to instrumental understanding (knowing \"what\" to do or \"how\" to do it, and hence being able to execute procedures) and relational understanding (knowing \"why\", understanding the concepts of mathematics and the way in which they connect with each other to form so-called \"conceptual structures\"). When people talk of teaching mathematics for ­ or learning it with ­ understanding, they usually mean relational understanding. The language used in the Irish syllabuses to categorise understanding is that of Skemp; the objectives could equally well have been formulated in terms of \"procedures\" and \"concepts\".\n\nResearch points to the importance of both kinds of understanding, together with knowledge of facts (general objective A), as components of mathematical proficiency, with relational understanding being crucial for retaining and applying knowledge. The Third International Mathematics and Science Study, TIMSS, indicated that Irish teachers regard knowledge of facts and procedures as particularly important ­ unusually so in international terms; but it would appear that less heed is paid to conceptual/relational understanding. This is therefore given special emphasis in the revised syllabuses. Such understanding can be fostered by active learning, as described and illustrated in Section 4. Ways in which relational understanding can be assessed are considered in Section 5.\n\nCommunication\n\nGeneral objective H of the syllabus indicates that students should be able to communicate mathematics, both verbally and in written form, by describing and explaining the mathematical procedures they undertake and by explaining their findings and justifying their conclusions. This highlights the importance of students expressing mathematics in their own words. It is one way of promoting understanding; it may also help students to take ownership of the findings they defend, and so to be more interested in their mathematics and more motivated to learn.\n\nThe importance of discussion as a tool for ongoing assessment of students' understanding is highlighted in Section 5.2. In the context of examinations, the ability to show different stages in a procedure, explain results, give reasons for conclusions, and so forth, can be tested; some examples are given in Section 5.6.\n\nAppreciation and enjoyment\n\nGeneral objective I of the syllabus refers to appreciating mathematics. As pointed out earlier, appreciation may develop for a number of reasons, from being able to do the work successfully to responding to the abstract beauty of the subject. It is more likely to develop, however, when the mathematics lessons themselves are pleasant occasions.\n\nIn drawing up the revised syllabus and preparing the Guidelines, care has been taken to include opportunities for making the teaching and learning of mathematics more enjoyable. Enjoyment is good in its own right; also, it can develop students' motivation and hence enhance learning. For many students in the junior cycle, enjoyment (as well as understanding) can be promoted by the active learning referred to above and by placing the work in appropriate meaningful contexts. Section 4 contains many examples of enjoyable classroom activities which promote both learning and appreciation of mathematics. Teachers are likely to have their own battery of such activities which work for them and their classes. It is hoped that these can be shared amongst their colleagues and perhaps submitted for inclusion in the final version of the Guidelines.\n\nOf course, different people enjoy different kinds of mathematical activity. Appreciation and enjoyment do not come solely from \"games\"; more traditional classrooms also can be lively places in which teachers and students collaborate in the teaching and learning of mathematics and develop their appreciation of the subject. Teachers will choose approaches with whichthey themselves feel comfortable and which meet thelearning needs of the students whom they teach.\n\nThe changed or clarified emphasis in the syllabuses will be supported, where possible, by corresponding adjustments to the formulation and marking of Junior Certificate examination questions. While the wording ofquestions may be the same, the expected solutions may bedifferent. Examples are given in Section 5.\n\n3.4 CHANGES IN THE PRIMARY CURRICULUM\n\nThe changes in content and emphasis within the revised Junior Certificate mathematics syllabuses are intended, inter alia, to follow on from and build on the changes in the primary curriculum. The forthcoming alterations (scheduled to be introduced in 2002, but perhaps starting earlier in some classrooms, as teachers may anticipate the formal introduction of the changes) will affect the knowledge and attitudes that students bring to their second level education. Second level teachers need to be prepared for this. A summary of the chief alterations is given below; teachers are referred to the revised Primary School Curriculum for further details.\n\nCHANGES IN EMPHASIS\n\nIn the revised curriculum, the main changes of emphasis are as follows.\n\nThere is more emphasis on\n\nsetting the work in real-life contexts\n\nlearning through hands-on activities (using concrete materials/manipulatives, and so forth)\n\nunderstanding (in particular, gaining appropriaterelational understanding as well as instrumentalunderstanding)\n\nappropriate use of mathematical language\n\nrecording\n\nproblem-solving.\n\nThere is less emphasis on\n\nlearning routine procedures with no context provided\n\ndoing complicated calculations.\n\nCHANGES IN CONTENT\n\nThe changes in emphasis are reflected in changes to the content, the main ones being as follows.\n\nNew areas include\n\nintroduction of the calculator from Fourth Class (augmenting, not replacing, paper-and-pencil techniques)\n\n(hence) extended treatment of estimation;\n\nincreased coverage of data handling\n\nintroduction of basic probability (\"chance\").\n\nNew terminology includes\n\nthe use of the \"positive\" and \"negative\" signs for denoting a number (as in +3 [positive three], -6 [negative six] as well as the \"addition\" and \"subtraction\" signs for denoting an operation (as in 7 + 3, 24 ­ 9)\n\nexplicit use of the multiplication sign in formulae (as in 2 ×r , l ×w).\n\nThe treatment of subtraction emphasises the \"renaming\" or \"decomposition\" method (as opposed to the \"equal additions\" method ­ the one which uses the terminology \"paying back\") even more strongly than does the 1971 curriculum. Use of the word \"borrowing\" is discouraged.\n\nThe following topics are among those excluded from the revised curriculum:\n\nunrestricted calculations (thus, division is restricted to at most four-digit numbers being divided by at most two-digit numbers, and ­ for fractions ­ to division of whole numbers by unit fractions)\n\n(Some of these topics were not formally included in the 1971 curriculum, but appeared in textbooks and were taught in many classrooms.)\n\nNOTE\n\nThe reductions in content have removed some areas of overlap between the 1971 Primary School Curriculum and the Junior Certificate syllabuses. Some overlap remains, however. This is natural; students entering second level schooling need to revise the concepts and techniques that they have learnt at primary level, and also need to situate these in the context of their work in the junior cycle.\n\n3.5 LINKING CONTENT AREAS WITH AIMS\n\nFinally, in this section, the content of the syllabuses is related to the aims and objectives. In fact most aims and objectives can be addressed in most areas of the syllabuses. However, some topics are more suited to the attainment of certain goals or the development of certain skills than are others. The discussion below highlights some of the main possibilities, and points to the goals that might appropriately be emphasised when various topics are taught and learnt. Phrases italicised are quoted or paraphrased from the aims as set out in the syllabus document. Section 5 of these Guidelines indicates a variety of ways in which achievement of the relevant objectives might be encouraged, tested or demonstrated.\n\nSETS\n\nSets provide a conceptual foundation for mathematics and a language by means of which mathematical ideas can be discussed. While this is perhaps the main reason for which set theory was introduced into school mathematics, its importance at junior cycle level can be described rather differently.\n\nSet problems, obviously, call for skills of problem-solving; in particular, they provide occasions for logical argument. By using data gathered from the class, they even offer opportunities for simple introduction to mathematical modelling in contexts to which the students can relate.\n\nMoreover, set theory emphasises aspects of mathematics that are not purely computational. Sets are about classification, hence about tidiness and organisation. This can lead toappreciation of mathematics on aesthetic grounds and can help to provide a basis forfurther education in the subject.\n\nAn additional point is that this topic is not part of the Primary School Curriculum, and so represents a new start, untainted by previous failure. For some students, therefore, there are particularly important opportunities for personal development.\n\nNUMBER SYSTEMS\n\nWhile mathematics is not entirely quantitative, numeracy is one of its most important aspects. Students have been building up their concepts of numbers from a very early stage in their lives. However, moving from familiarity with natural numbers (and simple operations on them) to genuine understanding of the various forms in which numbers are presented and of the uses to which they are put in the world is a considerable challenge.\n\nWeakness in this area destroys students' confidence andcompetence by depriving them of theknowledge, skillsand understanding needed for continuing theireducation and for life and work. It therefore handicaps their personal fulfilment and hencepersonaldevelopment.\n\nThe aspect of \"understanding\" is particularly important ­ or, perhaps, has had its importance highlighted ­ with advances in technology.\n\nStudents need to become familiar with the intelligent and appropriate use of calculators, while avoiding dependence on the calculators for simple calculations.\n\nComplementing this, they need to develop skills in estimation and approximation, so that numbers can be used meaningfully.\n\nAPPLIED ARITHMETIC AND MEASURE\n\nThis topic is perhaps one of the easiest to justify in terms of providing mathematics needed for life, workand leisure.\n\nStudents are likely to use the skills developed here in \"everyday\" applications, for example in looking after their personal finances and in structuring the immediate environment in which they will live. For many, therefore, this may be a key section in enabling studentsto develop a positive attitude towards mathematics as avaluable subject of study.\n\nThere are many opportunities for problem-solving, hopefully in contexts that the students recognise as relevant.\n\nThe availability of calculators may remove some of the drudgery that can be associated with realistic problems, helping the students to focus on the concepts and applications that bring the topics to life.\n\nALGEBRA\n\nAlgebra was developed because it was needed ­ because arguments in natural language were too clumsy or imprecise. It has become one of the most fundamental tools for mathematics.\n\nAs with number, therefore, confidence andcompetence are very important. Lack of these underminethepersonal development of the students by depriving them of the knowledge, skills and understanding needed forcontinuing their education and for life and work.\n\nWithout skills in algebra, students lack the technical preparation for study of other subjects in school, and in particular their foundation for appropriate studies lateron ­ including further education in mathematics itself.\n\nIt is thus particularly important that students develop appropriate understanding of the basics of algebra so that algebraic techniques are carried out meaningfully and not just as an exercise in symbol-pushing.\n\nEspecially for weaker students, this can be very challenging because algebra involves abstractions andgeneralisations.\n\nHowever, these characteristics are among the strengths and beauties of the topic. Appropriately used, algebra can enhance the students' powers of communication, facilitate simplemodelling and problem-solving, and hence illustrate the power of mathematics as a valuablesubject of study.\n\nSTATISTICS\n\nOne of the ways in which the world is interpreted for us mathematically is by the use of statistics. Their prevalence, in particular on television and in the newspapers, makes them part of the environment in which children grow up, and provides students with opportunities for recognition and enjoyment of mathematics in the worldaround them.\n\nMany of the examples refer to the students' typical areas of interest; examples include sporting averages and trends in purchases of (say) CDs.\n\nStudents can provide data for further examples from their own backgrounds and experiences.\n\nPresenting these data graphically can extend students'powers of communication and their ability to shareideas with other people, and may also provide anaesthetic element.\n\nThe fact that statistics can help to develop a positiveattitude towards mathematics as an interesting andvaluable subject of study ­ even for weaker students who find it hard to appreciate the more abstract aspects of the subject ­ explains the extra prominence given to aspects of data handling in the Foundation level syllabus, as mentioned earlier. They may be particularly important in promotingconfidence and competence in both numerical and spatial domains.\n\nGEOMETRY\n\nThe study of geometry builds on the primary school study of shape and space, and hence relates to mathematics in the world around us. In the junior cycle, different approaches to geometry address different educational goals.\n\nMore able students address one of the greatest of mathematical concepts, that of proof, and hopefully come to appreciate theabstractions andgeneralisations involved.\n\nOther students may not consider formal proof, but should be able to draw appropriate conclusions from given geometrical data.\n\nMATHEMATICS\n\nExplaining and defending their findings, in either case, should help students to further their powersof communication.\n\nTackling \"cuts\" and other exercises based on the geometrical system presented in the syllabus allows students to develop their problem-solving skills.\n\nMoreover, in studying synthetic geometry, students are encountering one of the great monuments to intellectual endeavour: a very special part of Western culture.\n\nTransformation geometry builds on the study of symmetry at primary level. As the approach to transformation geometry in the revised Junior Certificate syllabus is intuitive, it is included in particular for its aesthetic value.\n\nWith the possibility of using transformations in artistic designs, it allows students to encounter creative aspectsof mathematics and to develop or exercise their own creative skills.\n\nIt can also develop their spatial ability, hopefully promotingconfidence and competence in this area.\n\nInstances of various types of symmetry in the natural and constructed environment give scope for students' recognition and enjoyment of mathematics in the worldaround them.\n\nCoordinate geometry links geometrical and algebraic ideas. On the one hand, algebraic techniques can be used to establish geometric results; on the other, algebraic entities are given pictorial representations.\n\nIts connections with functions and trigonometry, as well as algebra and geometry, make it a powerful tool for the integration of mathematics into a unified structure.\n\nIt illustrates the power of mathematics, and so helps to establish it with students as a valuable subject of study.\n\nIt provides an important foundation for appropriatestudies later on.\n\nThe graphical aspect can add a visually aestheticdimension to algebra.\n\nTRIGONOMETRY\n\nTrigonometry is a subject that has its roots in antiquity but is still of great practical use to-day. While its basic concepts are abstract, they can be addressed through practical activities.\n\nSituations to which it can be applied ­ for example, house construction, navigation, and various ball games ­ include many that are relevant to the students' life, work and leisure.\n\nIt can therefore promote the students' recognition andenjoyment of mathematics in the world around them.\n\nWith the availability of calculators, students may more easily develop competence and confidence through their work in this area.\n\nFUNCTIONS AND GRAPHS\n\nThe concept of a function is crucial in mathematics, and students need a good grasp of it in order to prepare a firm foundation for appropriate studies lateron and in particular, a basis for further education inmathematics itself.\n\nThe representation of functions by graphs adds a pictorial element that students may find aesthetic as well as enhancing their understanding and their abilityto handle generalisations.\n\nThis topic pulls together much of the groundwork done elsewhere, using the tools introduced and skills developed in earlier sections and providing opportunities forproblem-solving and simple modelling.\n\nFor Foundation students alone, simple work on the set-theoretic treatment of relations has been retained. In contexts that can be addressed by those whose numerical skills are poor, it provides exercises in simple logical thinking.\n\nNOTE\n\nThe foregoing argument presents just one vision of the rationale for including the various topics in the syllabus and for the ways in which the aims of the mathematics syllabus can be achieved. All teachers will have their own ideas about what can inspire and inform different topic areas. Their own personal visions of mathematics, and their particular areas of interest and expertise, may lead them to implement the aims very differently from the way that is suggested here. Visions can profitably be debated at teachers' meetings, with new insights being given and received as a result.\n\nThe tentative answers given here with regard to whycertain topics are included in the syllabus are, of course, offered to teachers rather than junior cycle students. In some cases, students also may find the arguments relevant. In other cases, however, the formulation is too abstract or the benefit too distant to be of interest. This, naturally, can cause problems. Clearly it would not be appropriate to reduce the syllabus to material that has immediately obvious applications in the students' everyday lives. This would leave them unprepared for further study, and would deprive them of sharing parts of our culture; in any case, not all students are motivated by supposedly everyday topics.\n\nTeachers are therefore faced with a challenging task in helping students find interest and meaning in all parts of the work. Many suggestions with proven track records in Irish schools are offered in Section 4. As indicated earlier, it is hoped that teachers will offer more ideas for an updated version of the Guidelines.",

As concentration camps do not provide books, paper, pen or pencils nearly all of his calculations had to be performed mentally. This forced Trachtenberg to develop methods and shortcuts for performing calculations mentally. Trachtenberg developed his discoveries into a complete system of mathematics.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Trachtenberg started teaching his system of mathematics. He started teaching the more backward children to prove that anyone could learn his system. In 1950 he founded the Mathematical Institute in Zurich, where both children and adults were taught the system.\n\nThe system has been thoroughly tested in Switzerland and is found to produce an increase in self confidence and general aptitude to study, as the students prove to themselves what they are capable of, by their accomplishments in calculating results to computations.\n\nThe Trachtenberg system is based on a series of keys which must be memorized. There is no need for multiplication tables or division as the system only relies on the ability to count. The system also places an emphasis on getting the right answer and provides a number of methods for checking the answers achieved by the system.\n\nResearch on the system, indicates that the system shortens time for mathematical computations by twenty percent and produces correct results, ninety nine percent of the time, due to the checking method used as part of the system.",

Construction requires three major types of information: (a) a clear understanding of the interaction within the individual host between the infectious agent and the host, (b) the mode and rate of transmission between individuals, and (c) host population characteristics such as demography and behaviour. Mathematical models can aid exploration of the behaviour of the system under various conditions from which to determine the dominant factors generating observed patterns and phenomena. They also aid data collection and interpretation and parameter estimation, and provide tools for identifying possible approaches to control and for assessing the potential impact of different intervention measures.\n\nRelated Topics: [ model] A set of mathematical equations which attempts to predict the behavior of a physical system(s). For example, the Rational Formula, Q = Cia, is a mathematical model for peak runoff rate prediction with a single dependent variable, Q, and three independent parameter s: C, i and A. Often the term \"simulation model\" is used in lieu of mathematical model, because the relationships are intended to simulate actions of physical systems.\n\nAn abstraction of a real-world problem into a mathematical problem. Creating a mathematical model can involve making assumptions and simplifications; creating geometric figures, graphs, and tables; or finding equations that approximate the behavior of a real event. The mathematical problem can then be solved. When the solution is interpreted it may provide a solution to the real-world problem (Lesson 1.6).",

      "text": "Algebraic Videogame Programming\n\nBootstrap is a FREE curriculum for students ages 12-16, which teaches them to program their own videogames using purely algebraic and geometric concepts.\n\nOur mission is to use students' excitement and confidence around gaming to directly apply algebra to create something cool.\n\nWe work with schools, districts and tech-educational programs across the country, reaching hundreds of students each semester. Bootstrap has been integrated into math and technology classrooms across the country, reaching thousands of students since 2006.\n\nProgramming. Not just writing code.\n\nKnowing how to write code is good, but it doesn't make you a programmer.\n\nSure, Bootstrap teaches students a programming language. But most\nimportantly, it teaches solid program design skills, such as\nstating input and types, writing test cases, and explaining code to others.\nBootstrap builds these elements into the curriculum in a gentle way\nthat helps students move from a word problem to finished code.\n\nAfter Bootstrap, these skills can be put to use in other programming environments, letting students take what they've learned into other programming classes.\n\nWatch the video to hear students, engineers, teachers, and the Bootstrap team describe what excites them about Bootstrap!\n\nReal, Standards-Based Math\n\nUnlike most programming classes, Bootstrap uses algebra as the vehicle for creating images and animations. That means that concepts students encounter in Bootstrap behave the exact same way that they do in math class. This lets students experiment with algebraic concepts by writing functions that make a rocket fly (linear equations), respond to keypresses (piecewise functions) or make it explode when it hits a meteor (distance formula). In fact, many word problems from standard math textbooks can be used as as programming assignments!\n\nThe entire curriculum is designed from the ground up to be aligned with Common Core standards for algebra. Bootstrap lessons cover mathematical topics that range from simple arithmetic expressions to the Pythagorean Theorem, Discrete Logic, Function Composition and the Distance Formula. The program is based on cognitive science research and best practices for improving critical thinking and problem solving.\n\n\"\"\n\n—\n\nOur team\n\nBootstrap is the creation of Emmanuel Schanzer, M.Ed. (in the hat). After earning a bachelors of Computer Science (Cornell University), he worked in the private sector for a number of years as a programmer (Microsoft, Vermonster, and others) until he switched careers and became a math teacher, starting out in Boston Public Schools. He is now a doctoral student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.\n\nOur Supporters\n\nWe would like to thank the following, for their volunteer and financial support over the years: Apple, Cisco, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), Facebook, Google, as well as the Google Inc. Charitable Giving Fund of Tides Foundation, IBM, Jane Street Capital, LinkedIn, Microsoft, The National Science Foundation, NVIDIA, Thomson/Reuters, and the generous individuals who have given us private donations.\n\nIf you would like to support Bootstrap with a donation, send a check made out to Brown University to our PI, Shriram Krishnamurthi,\nat his mailing address.

      "text": "What to learn in pure math for applied math?\n\nWhat to learn in pure math for applied math?\n\nSo I finished my undergrad last year in applied math and physics. I'm currently applying to applied math phD programs (but they are separate depts from the pure math depts). I don't exactly what I want to focus on, but I was thinking something in mathematical physics, PDEs, functional analysis, and operator theory. Perhaps the program I go to will let me work with a pure math prof doing stuff in string theory\n\nThe applied math courses I've taken include proof-based fourier analysis, linear algebra, and analysis. Also, courses in prob/stats, complex analysis, ODEs, PDEs, dynamical systems, and numerical analysis. So what should I self-study in the meantime? I was thinking topology or the second half of real analysis (integration, metric spaces. Lebesgue, etc).\n\nI've been told by three advisor-type people in my department that analysis is absolutely necessary for any math program (and as such, all math majors are required to take one semester). Since most of the math grad programs I've looked at start with a year of analysis study, I'd recommend doing as much of that as possible. Topology is probably a good idea too.\n\nIt really depends on the area of applied mathematics that you want to work on and taking certain courses will be completely useless in other areas, for example if you want to study string theory then a course such as algebraic topology or non commutative geometry seems good but that has almost no applicability in most other areas. However, there are courses that let you keep your options open. I would recommend any of the following courses, if you have not decided on your specialty yet.\n\ndefinitely study complex analysis if you have not taken a course in it already.\na second course in partial differential equations\na course in applied nonlinear equations\nAs many courses as you can in numerical analysis( a good choice is computational methods for PDE's or high-performance scientific computation)\na course in linear programming\na course in combinatorics\nmaybe a course in control theory\n\nIf you are more into mathematical physics then you can take the following courses that don't require serious knowledge of physics.\n\nDifferential Geometry\nmathematics of Fluid Mechanics\nmathematics of Quantum Mechanics\nmathematics of Quantum Field Theory\nmathematics of General Relativity\n\nIf you are interested in theoretical computer science(which is a branch of applied math) you can study,\n\nAs many courses in real analysis as possible\nAs many courses in statistics, probability.\na second course in numerical analysis.\na course in nonlinear optimization\na course in mathematical theory of finance.\n\nBTW, take topology only if you are going into mathematical physics, or you want to do serious\ncoursework in real analysis, other than that topology has little applicability in other areas.\n\nI don't exactly what I want to focus on, but I was thinking something in mathematical physics, PDEs, functional analysis, and operator theory.\n\nIf I wanted to do the math of QFT and relativity, I sure hope those don't require much knowledge of physics. I hate studying relativity\n\nFirst of all, I don't think you should go for mathematical physics if you hate studying relativity. After all, all those courses do involve physics.\nBut I am pretty sure that the courses I listed under mathematical physics don't require any serious knowledge of physics, I myself took General Relativity and did well. The only physics courses I had taken were general physics I and II. The only course requirement for that was introductory differential geometry. Mathematics of QM and QFT require some knowledge of PDE's operator theory and functional analysis and basic probability and again no physics beyond freshman year. Topology is also very helpful in QFT and latter on if you want to study a specialized course in string theory. So I think overall topology is a good idea if you wanna go for mathematical physics.",

      "text": "MA Mathematics Domains of Study\n\nAreas of Study Within the\nM.A. in Mathematics Education Degree\n\nThe WGU Master of Arts in Mathematics Education (K-6, 5-9 or 5-12) program content is based on research on effective instruction as well as national and state standards. It provides the knowledge and skills that enable teachers to teach effectively in diverse classrooms. The M.A. in Mathematics Education program content and training processes are consistent with the accountability intent of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. The degree program is focused on the preparation of highly qualified teachers. As described in the federal legislation, a highly qualified teacher is one who not only possesses full state certification, but also has solid content knowledge of the subject(s) he or she teaches.\n\nThe following section includes the larger domains of knowledge, which are then followed by the subject-specific subdomains of knowledge.\n\nElementary Mathematics Education Domain (for the K-6 program)\n\nThis domain focuses on the following mathematics content, as well as central issues related to the teaching of these topics in grades K–6:\n\nMathematics (K-6) Content\nThis subdomain focuses on the following mathematics content with integrated mathematics pedagogy: Introduction to Number Sense; Patterns and Functions; Integers and Order of Operations; Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages; Coordinate Pairs and Graphing; Ratios and Proportional Reasoning; Equations and Inequalities; Geometry and Measurement; and Statistics, Data Analysis, and Probability.\n\nFinite Mathematics\nThis subdomain focuses on the real number system, symbolic logic, number theory, set theory, graph theory and their applications.\n\nMiddle School Mathematics Content Domain (for the 5-9 program)\n\nThis domain focuses on the following areas of mathematics: Finite Mathematics, College Algebra, Pre-calculus, Probability and Statistics I, College Geometry and Calculus I.\n\nFinite Mathematics\nThis sub-domain focuses on the real number system, symbolic logic, number theory, set theory, graph theory and their applications.\n\nCollege Algebra\nThis sub-domain focuses on equations, inequalities, polynomials, conic sections, and functional analysis including logarithmic, exponential, and inverse functions in problem solvingComprehensive Exam\nThe CYV1 is a comprehensive exam assessing the student's knowledge of the subdomains listed above.\n\nHigh School Mathematics Content Domain (for the 5-12 program)\n\nThis domain focuses on the following areas of mathematics: This domain focuses on the following areas of mathematics: Pre-Calculus, Probability and Statistics, College Geometry, Calculus and Analysis, Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra, and Mathematical Modeling and ConnectionsCalculus II\nThis sub-domain focuses on integration techniques and applications, the solution of differential equations, and the analysis of sequences.\n\nResearch Fundamentals Domain (for the K-6 and 5-9 programs)Capstone Project (for the K-6 program)\n\nThe Capstone Project is the culmination of the student's WGU degree program. It requires the demonstration of competencies through a deliverable of significant scope that includes both a written capstone project and an oral defense.\n\nStudents will be able to choose from two areas of emphasis, depending on personal and professional interests. These two areas include instructional design and research. If carefully planned in advance, the individual domain projects may serve as components of the capstone. For capstones with the instructional design emphasis, students will design, manage, and develop an instructional product for which there is an identified need. The product can be delivered via the medium of choice (e.g., print-based, computer-based, video-based, web-based, or a combination of these), but you must provide a rationale for the medium selected. The instructional product you develop for your capstone should be an exportable form of instruction designed to bring your target audience to a mastery of predetermined knowledge and skills.\n\nFor capstones with the research emphasis, students will design and conduct a data-based investigation of a conclusion-oriented question (decision-oriented investigations are most generally considered to be evaluation projects). The project report should be of publishable quality and may be submitted to an appropriate professional journal at the completion of the project. At the minimum you should plan to share your results with your school or organization questions covering the mathematics content domain. The purpose of the exam is a checkpoint to ensure that you have acquired the critically required skills and knowledge specified in the program competencies.\n\nTeacher Work Sample Written Project (for the 5-9 and 5-12 programs)\n\nThe Teacher Work Sample Written Project is the culmination of the student's WGU degree program. It requires the demonstration of competencies through a deliverable of significant scope that includes both a written project and an oral defense.\n\nThe Teacher Work Sample is a written project containing a comprehensive, original, research based curriculum unit designed to meet an identified educational need. It provides direct evidence of the candidate's ability to design and implement a multi-week, standards-based unit of instruction, assess student learning, and then reflect on the learning process. The WGU Teacher Work Sample requires students to plan and teach a multi-week standards-based instructional unit consisting of seven components: 1) Contextual factors, 2) learning goals, 3) assessment, 4) design for instruction, 5) instructional decision making, 6) analysis of student learning, and 7) self-evaluation and reflection a presentation (typically PowerPoint) and defense of the Teacher Work Sample (TWS). Candidates will be asked to reflect upon the TWS, note its strengths and weaknesses, discuss its impact on student learning, and suggest future improvements. The purpose of the exam is a checkpoint to ensure that you have acquired the critically required skills and knowledge specified in the program competencies.\n\nNBC News Reports on WGU\n\n\"The dreams of 19 governors have become [WGU Grad Angie Gonzalez's] dream fulfilled.\"",

I have used Saxon 1, 2, 3 and 5/4 now. Thus far, we have been very pleased with the curriculum. It allows me, the teacher to move a quickly or as slowly as the student needs. I am able to use the tests and assessments included in the student workbook to determine where to place the child and to even skip ahead if needed so that valuable time is not spent on things already mastered. The Teachers Manual is able to be reused with other students, but we always purchase a new workbook for each new student. The price of the workbooks are very reasonable.\n\nWe used four other math curricula in the course of 15 years of homeschooling. I looked at Saxon Math when our oldest was in the 5th grade and didn't think I could do it. I was wrong. After years of struggling with other math programs I made the switch for our two smallest in 1st grade. We have used the Saxon Math for three years now and it has made a big difference in how we look at Math. I would highly recommend this curriculum. There is no DVD from Saxon for k-3, but starting in 4/5 you can purchase one. There is a company called Destination Math that has an online program that runs right with the Saxon Math. Just for the record, Math was not my best subject when I was in school. So those first years of teaching were a struggle for me to try to teach something I had a hard time understanding. Saxon Math has helped me while I have been teaching. It's very easy to follow and one of the few subjects that I actually follow very closely by the teacher's book.\n\nWe just switched to Saxon month a few months ago. I have a daughter who really doesn't like math. I took her to Mardel's and let her choose a math program (I got final approval rights. ;) ) She surprised me and picked Saxon. It is extremely black and white and not like the colorful books we have used before. She loves it so far and seems to be grasping the concepts. We didn't buy the manipulatives as I had a lot of them at home already (from other math programs we've used.) I can't really give this an excellent review as we are still new into it.\n\nThis curriculum was perfect for my sons needs at the moment. He did go through the years worth of work very quickly, but he has a real thirst for math. My son wanted a few math games added to suppliment his text work. It is a good curriculum.",

Pre calculus is a topic which comes from the study of motion. It deals with different ideas, areas and volumes, rates of change, the orbits of planets, and infinite sequences.\nPre calculus consists of those subjects, skills, and insights which are necessary to recognize calculus. It involves arithmetic, algebra, coordinate Geometry, trigonometry, and, functions. In Pre calculus we study many different type of topics which includes, sets, real numbers, complex numbers, composite and polynomial Functions, trigonometry, limits, vectors, metrics, binomial theorem, and many other topics. Let's understand few basic topic of pre calculus.\nSet: - We know that Set is a collection of different type of objects which are defined in proper manner. Different types of operation are present in the set that are Union, intersection, complements and Cardinality product. Sets are of different type like Empty set, Universal set, etc.\nIf no element is available in the set then it is known as empty set, and the Sets are present in the universe of conversation are universal set.\nEmpty set is denoted by the symbol '∅' and universal set is denoted by 'U'\nReal number: - In the Real Numbers all the Rational and Irrational Numbers and whole numbers are present.\nFor example: Whole numbers are (1, 4, 6, 8, 10). Sometime the number 0 is also involved in Whole Number.\nRational number – The Rational Numbers are 3/5, 0.16, 0.33…2.2 etc.\nIrrational number – Irrational numbers are (⊼, √ 3) etc.\nIf we have √ -3, this number is not considered in the category of real number because it contains imaginary value and '∞' and it is not a real number.\nThis is a brief introduction to Precalculus in which we come across few Basic Terms of pre calculus.",

Beginning with an overview of the principles of inheritance such as cell division and Mendelian genetics, we explore the foundations and frontiers of modern human genetics, with an emphasis on understanding and evaluating new discoveries. Descending to the molecular level, we investigate how genetic information is encoded in DNA and how mutations affect gene function. These molecular foundations are used to explore the science and social impact of genetic technology, including topics such as genetic testing, genetically modified foods, DNA fingerprinting, and the Human Genome Project. Laboratory projects emphasize the diverse methods that scientists employ to study heredity.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0306 Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior Prof. SuzukiFALL 2010 V55.0309 Natural Science II: The Body - How It Works Prof. Goldberg (Chemistry) syllabus The human body is a complex system of mutually interdependent molecules, cells, tissues, organs and organ systems. We examine the human body with the goal of understanding how physiological systems operate at these varying levels. Examples include the circulation of blood, the function of our muscles, the utilization of oxygen in respiration, and how our immune system detects and fights foreign invaders. Disturbing the delicate balance of these systems can produce various human diseases, which will also be examined throughout the course. Laboratory work provides firsthand experience with studying molecular processes, cell structures, and physiological systems.\n\nFALL 2010FALL 2010 V55.0313 Natural Science II: The Brain: A User's Guide Prof. Azmitia (Biology) syllabus The Human Brain is the most complex organ. Despite the central position it has in nearly every aspect of our daily lives, it remains to many a mystery. How does it work? How can we care for it? How long will it function? This MAP course is designed to provide answers to these questions, and many more at an academic level accessible to the non-scientist student, and of interest to the scientist with little exposure to neuroscience. The aims of the course are to provide the student with a firm foundation in what the brain looks like and what each of the parts do. To accomplish this, we will learn about the functions of the cortex in higher learning and memory, as well as discuss the basic work of the brainstem in regulating the internal environment of the body. The importance of nutrition on neurotransmitter synthesis, the function of sleep on memory and why we need so much of it, and the effects of alcohol and drugs on brain harmony and the meaning of addiction will be some of the points covered in this course. We will look at brain development and the special needs of children, as well as brain aging and illness and the difficulty of helping. The laboratories are designed to provide hands-on experience in exploring the structure of the brain as well as learning how to measure brain functioning. We will provide specially prepared slides so the student can recognize a neuron and differentiate a dendrite from an axon. The molecular shape of neurotransmitter will be covered, as well as learning how to measure alcohol and determining its levels in your body. It is expected that by the end of the course, the student will be familiar with the biological basis of brain structure and function, and not only be able to detect how a normal brain works, but also how to help keep it healthy.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0305 Natural Science II: Human Origins Prof. Bailey (Anthropology) syllabus An introduction to the approaches and methods scientists use to investigate the origins and evolutionary history of our own species. This interdisciplinary study synthesizes research from a number of different areas of science. Topics include reconstructing evolutionary relationships using molecular and morphological data, the mitochondrial Eve hypothesis, ancient DNA, human variation and natural selection, the use of stable isotopes to reconstruct dietary behavior in prehistoric humans, the Neandertal enigma, the importance of studies of chimpanzees for understanding human behavior, and the 6-million-year-old fossil evidence for human evolution.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0306 Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior Prof. HawkenSPRING 2011SPRING 2011 V55.0311 Natural Science II: Lessons from the Biosphere Prof. Volk (Biology) syllabus Provides a foundation of knowledge about how Earth's biosphere works. This includes the biggest ideas and findings about biology on the global scale-the scale in which we live. Such knowledge is especially crucial today because we humans are perturbing so many systems within the biosphere. We explore four main topics: (1) Evolution of Life: How did life come to be what it is today? (2) Life's Diversity: What is life today on the global scale? (3) Cycles of Matter: How do life and the non-living environment interact? (4) The Human Guild: How are humans changing the biosphere and how might we consider our future within the biosphere? Laboratory experiments are complemented by an exploration at the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0314 Natural Science II: Genomes and Diversity Prof. Siegal (Biology) syllabus Millions of species of animals, plants and microbes inhabit our planet. Genomics, the study of all the genes in an organism, is providing new insights into this amazing diversity of life on Earth. We begin with the fundamentals of DNA, genes and genomes. We then explore microbial diversity, with an emphasis on how genomics can reveal many aspects of organisms, from their ancient history to their physiological and ecological habits. We follow with examinations of animal and plant diversity, focusing on domesticated species, such as dogs and tomatoes, as examples of how genomic methods can be used to identify genes that underlie new or otherwise interesting traits. Genomics has also transformed the study of human diversity and human disease. We examine the use of DNA to trace human ancestry, as well as the use of genomics as a diagnostic tool in medicine. With the powerful new technologies to study genomes has come an increased power to manipulate them. We conclude by considering the societal implications of this ability to alter the genomes of crop plants, livestock and potentially humans.\n\nTexts and Ideas\n\nNote: Previously listed as Conversations of the West\n\nFall 2010 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics - Animal Humans Prof. Lezra (Comparative Literature) syllabus \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness…\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway.\n\nFall 2010 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics - Spectatorship—Ethics, Politics, Aesthetics Prof. Harries (English) syllabus Are you responsible for what you see? Sometimes? Never? Always? How do you decide? Why do works of art so often represent suffering? Does art allow us to witness suffering without having to take responsibility for that suffering? What happens when we witness real suffering as though it were art? We consider crucial texts on spectatorship from Plato to the present, how various thinkers and artists have approached these and other questions, and how looking from a distance has informed thinking about aesthetics, ethics, and politics. Throughout our discussions of these readings, we ask what it means that thinkers insist that looking has power: power to produce various emotions from desire to sympathy, or power to produce social and even political bonds. These thinkers will, in turn, challenge us to think about the function of images in the present. Readings and films: Plato's Republic, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Shakespeare's King Lear, Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments, Rousseau's Letter to M. d'Alembert on the Theatre, Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy, selections from Freud, Beckett's Endgame, Buster Keaton's Sherlock Jr., Hitchcock's Rear Window.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics-- The Deliberating Citizen Prof. Connolly (Classics) syllabus What do we need to function as citizens of a democracy--capacities of reason, imagination, or eloquence? Skills in analyzing public discourse or habits of historical memory? Is belief in God required, or particular emotional tendencies or sympathies? What kind of humanistic values, if any, can and should a democracy promote? We examine these questions on the assumption that intensive close reading (and listening, in Mozart's case) promotes the habits of engaged, articulate talking and writing that are the bedrock of civic education. Music of Mozart and readings from Plato, Thucydides, Vergil, Shakespeare, Rousseau, Kant, Adam Smith, John Dewey, Hannah Arendt.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0402 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Bolduc (French) syllabus Explores how books give shape, meaning, and purpose to the world and human experience. As it reinterprets the Greek and Roman legacy, the Renaissance faces crucial epistemological shifts triggered by new discoveries that call to mind our own struggles: making sense of a world in constant flux where truths are not only put into question but also lead to bloodshed. Grouped under four main themes--epic and the human experience, tales of beginnings and ends, battles for truth, writings of the self--we consider the purpose of this conversation between writers of different epochs and its relevance for understanding our own culture. Reading: Vergil's Aeneid, Cervantes' Don Quixote, Hesiod's Theogony, selections from Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Machiavelli's Prince, Navarre's Heptameron, Sophocles' Antigone, Shakespeare's Hamlet, Plato's Symposium, Augustine's Confessions, selections from Montaigne's Essays.\n\nFALL 2010FALL 2010 V55.0403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Garrett (Philosophy) syllabus All animals live, but only human beings consider how to live; and only reflective human beings deliberate among different ways to decide how to live. Should one look for guidance to tradition, to religion, to the state, to nature, to feeling, to reason? Versions of this question were raised and addressed repeatedly and with urgency in both Antiquity and the Enlightenment. We examine some of the most important and influential attempts to answer it and some of the dialogue that such attempts have had with one another. Readings include Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Greek tragedy and philosophy, Spinoza, Locke, Rousseau, Hume, Kant, Wollstonecraft.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ulfers (German) syllabus A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught. Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in Venice.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Corradi (Sociology) syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, freedom, rationality, democracy, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. They are 'classic' in the sense that they have not finished saying what they have to say. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. From the particularity of the West, these themes show a vocation for universality. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus and Antigone; Plato's Apology and Republic; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Pericles' Funeral Oration; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origins of the Species; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; Lincoln's Gettysburg Address; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Calhoun (Sociology) syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, faith, ethics, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, 1 Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus; Plato's Apology and Crito; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Shelley's Frankenstein; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Marx and Engels' The Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; and Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0412 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance - Writing Intensive Prof. Gerety (Collegiate Professor) syllabus What is the soul? Is it the conscious self or something more? Does our identity persist beyond death? What is the relation between the soul and good and evil? Some say that Socrates 'discovered' the human soul, but the idea that we have souls that outlast our bodies is as old as humanity. Our understanding of the nature of our souls often dictates the way we feel we should live. We will explore ideas from Homer and Heraclitus through Socrates himself and then on to Sophocles, Plato, Aristotle, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament (including the Gnostics), Augustine, and Vergil. We look for the elements that make up personal identity and value in the ancient world, both religious and secular, and see how much these change from Homer's world to that of Augustine and the Roman Empire. We then turn to Dante, who provides a bridge to some of the great thinkers and artists of the Renaissance--most notably Shakespeare and DaVinci but also Montaigne and Villon. In all of these, the permanence and even presence of our souls seem more uncertain, more threatened by death and obliteration, than in Plato or Paul, and this threat reaches our morality and values as well. In this way, the Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now find our way.\n\nNote: Offered in conjunction with selected sections of V40.0100, Writing the Essay.\n\nNote: Offered in conjunction with selected sections of V40.0100, Writing the Essay.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Justice and Injustice in Biblical Narrative and Western Thought Prof. Weiler (Law) syllabus Issue of justice and injustice and other normative concerns. Each week pairs a core reading from the Hebrew Bible or the New Testament with another work in the Western tradition to explore a broad range of complex normative issues. Often God will be \"on trial:\" Was the Deluge genocide? Is Abraham guilty of attempted murder and child abuse? Was Jesus guilty as charged? Was Socrates? The themes are all of relevance to contemporary issues: communal responsibility vs. individual autonomy, ecological crisis, ethics vs. religion, freedom of speech and thought, genocide, rule of law and civil disobedience, the Other, punishment and retribution, religious intolerance, sanctity of human life, sex and gender. The course will be taught at the Law School in Law School style—rigourous but academically and intellectually rewarding. Primary readings include: Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology; Xenophon's Apology; Sophocles' Antigone; selections from Hebrew Bible, New Testament, Aristotle, Maimonides, Aquinas, Luther, Kant, Kierkegaard, Mill, Thoreau, Kafka, Camus.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Free Will in Western Thought Prof. Krabbenhoft (Spanish and Portuguese) syllabus The freedom of the human will has been a foundational premise of Western civilization from the early centuries of the Christian era to the present, and yet it has been questioned and even rejected by some of the most influential thinkers of the modern period. We look at the sources of the modern debate in passages from the Hebrew Bible and Greek philosophy, in key texts by Augustine, Luther, and Erasmus, and in the shift toward a deontological view in Kant, Schopenhauer, and nineteenth-century materialism. From this historical overview we move to contemporary theories of freedom and determinism, as well as a discussion of the intersection of neuroscience and the philosophy of free will, and read a number of literary texts in the light of theory: Sophocles' Philoctetes, Tirso de Molina's Trickster of Seville, Tolstoy's Death of Ivan Ilyich, and Stanislaw Lem's Fiasco.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Literature in Wonderland Prof. Momma (English) syllabus How to Play with Language: We use language every day, and yet we do not seem to know exactly how it works. Communicating with others through language sometimes feels like playing a game. But does this mean we have only one language game to play, or that we follow only one set of rules all the time? Just like Alice, who was constantly frustrated by the logic of the inhabitants of Wonderland, we are often baffled by difficulties in communicating even the simplest idea. We explore issues on language that may be raised by reading literary and philosophical texts written by \"language-conscious\" authors: Is language the only way to communicate? Do we know anything about the origin of language? Do grammar and rhetoric help us communicate well or persuade others? Do etymology and the history of English tell us anything new about the language we know already? Do our minds work exactly the same way regardless of the language we speak? How do we do things with words? Readings: Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, Plato's Cratylus, Aristotle's Poetics, Shakespeare's Hamlet, Beowulf, Chaucer's House of Fame, Melville's Bartleby the Scrivener, Borges' Library of Babel, Achebe's Things Fall Apart.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Freedom and Oppression Prof. Kunhardt (History) syllabus Examines the human quest for freedom—freedom from slavery, from sexual oppression, and from the shackling of the mind—as these three came to a crisis in nineteenth century America. We begin with a critical reading of formative biblical texts and ideas; touch down on the passionate thought-world of the American founders; and culminate in a close look at mid-nineteenth century reform efforts, and the ideas of freedom that animated them. Exploring the dawn of biblical humanism, the embrace of the secular, and efforts to widen the circles of inclusion, we pay particular attention to the writings of Abraham Lincoln and his generation, as he and others, both allies and critics, worked to eradicate slavery from American society. Why did the Bible condone slavery, helping Americans justify continuing the practice? In what ways are competing ideas of freedom to be judged? How is the idea of freedom related to that of human equality? Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Psalms, Isaiah, Matthew, Luke; and works by Paine, Jefferson, Madison, Garrison, Douglass, Sumner, Stanton, Anthony, Rose, Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman, Parker, Mill, Ingersoll, Lincoln.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Mortal and Immortal Questions Professor Mitsis (Classics) syllabus A wide-ranging selection of works that have framed in memorable, though often contradictory, ways some basic questions about the nature of religion, the successes and failures of rational argument, the justification of social and political obligations, the benefits and dangers of technology and scientific knowledge, and the value of emotions and our attachments to others. Throughout the semester, students have the opportunity to become more practiced in formulating moral, political, and aesthetic arguments and in what used to be characterized as the proper use of one's solitude, that is, examining what it means to be a human being faced with death--or, perhaps, worse, faced with eternal life. Readings: Homer, Sophocles, Euripides, Thucydides, Plato, Epicureans, Stoics, Hebrew and Christian scripture, Augustine, Teresa of Avila, Hume, d'Holbach, Rousseau, Mill, Marx, Tolstoy, Freud, Proust.\n\nSPRING 2011SPRING 2011 V55.0403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Rubenstein (Hebrew & Judaic Studies) syllabus Beginning with the collision of the \"Judeo-Christian\" and Hellenistic traditions and their encounter in the Christian Scriptures and Augustine, we see Enlightenment thinkers grapple with the fusion of these traditions they had inherited, subjecting both to serious criticism and revising them as a new tradition—science and technology—rises to prominence. Reading from the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Sophocles, Plato, Augustine, Montesquieu, Pope, Voltaire, and Rousseau.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Deneys-Tunney (French) syllabus The Enlightenment was a Europe-wide movement, which concerned all aspects of culture of the time: philosophy and literature, the arts (painting, music, architecture), as well as politics and society as a whole. The Enlightenment defined itself as a new birth, a subversive movement that would free mankind of all its prejudices--philosophical, religious, political, sexual, racial. In doing so, the Enlightenment appears today to be indeed the beginning of our modernity, as it invented key concepts that define or frame our contemporary representations of ourselves and the world around us: the concept of the subject or subjectivity, of nature, of origins, of equality, of critical philosophy and democracy, of pleasure, of sexuality, of happiness. It is a unique moment in history, where philosophy aims not only at interpreting the world but also at changing it to make it a better place for mankind. It culminates at the end of the 18th century in France with the French Revolution, which declared for the first time in human history that all men are born free and equal. Readings: Genesis, Plato's Symposium and Phedrus, Epicurus' Maxims and letters, Descartes' Discourse on Method, Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality and Rêveries, Diderot's Indiscreet Jewels and Jacques the Fatalist, Voltaire's Candide and Zadig, Marivaux's Dispute and Double Unfaithfulness, Kant's \"What is Enlightenment?\"\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ertman (Sociology) syllabus Explores the ancient foundations of traditional Western culture by examining the political and social institutions, religious beliefs, and value systems of the Israelites, Greeks, Romans, and early Christians; then turns to the radical challenges to this traditional culture, in the areas of the economy, politics, religion, and morality, that arose over the course of the 19th century, challenges that continue to reverberate to this day. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Luke, Acts, Romans; Thucydides' Peloponnesian War; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Smith's Wealth of Nations; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origin of Species; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents.\n\nCultures and Contexts\n\nNote: Previously listed as World Cultures\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0502 Cultures and Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Chelkowski (Middle Eastern & Islamic Societies) syllabus Examines the common base and regional variations of Islamic societies. An \"Islamic society\" is here understood as one that shares, either as operative present or as historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical, topical, and regional. Here our particular focus is on the society of Shi'i Muslims. Shi'ism has been neglected in the last 200 years of the Western study of Islam, and only since the 1978–79 Islamic Revolution in Iran has it received attention in the West. Now, with American forces in Iraq, Shi'ism is suddenly one of the main topics of interest for the news media. The Shi'is of Iraq are the majority—some 60%—of the population, but historically they have been deprived of power in the government and of access to the political and economic life of the country.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa Prof. Gomez (History) syllabus Major issues and questions relating to Africa's development from early to contemporary times, approached through its literature. While not a formal study of the history of Africa, establishes the historical context for understanding the literary texts in the periods in which they are embedded. Examined regionally and over time are questions concerning the relationship of the production of literature to centers of power, the meaning of literature in societies espousing orality, the problematics of sustaining both content and intent upon the conversion of oral literature into written form, the specific and at times parochial uses of literature, the interplay of gender and voice, and the politics of translation into European modalities.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0506 Cultures and Contexts: Chinese and Japanese Traditions Prof. Roberts (East Asian Studies) syllabus Essential aspects of Asian culture—Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Shintoism—studied through careful reading of major works of philosophy and literature. A roughly equal division between Chinese and Japanese works is meant to give a basic understanding of the broad similarities and the less obvious, but all-important, differences among the cultures of Confucian Asia. One reading is a Vietnamese adaptation of a Chinese legend. The last two readings, modern novellas from Japan and China, show the reaction of the traditional cultures to the Western invasions.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0509 Cultures and Contexts: Caribbean Prof. Khan (Anthropology) syllabus Examines the impact of the Caribbean's long colonial history from the perspective of its diverse populations, through race, class, culture, gender, and sexuality. Known for its beauty, cultural vitality, and mix of peoples, cultures, and languages, the Caribbean is where today's global economy began, some 500 years ago. Its sugar economy and history of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable influx of peoples from Europe all along. Readings examine the history of the region's differing forms of colonialism; the present postcolonial economic and political structures; anthropological material on family and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and ideologies; and ways in which national, community, and group identities are expressed today.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0514 Cultures and Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. D. Fleming (Hebrew & Judaic Studies) syllabus The people of the Hebrew Bible understood themselves to be united as an ancient tribe called Israel, a name that lay behind even the eventual state. Working backward from the fullest early definition of Israel, when the Hebrew Bible was taking final form, toward the time of older origins, we push back in time, using the Bible as the primary point of reference, while examining various independent evidence. Writing projects focus mainly on interpretation of biblical texts.\n\nFall 2010 V55.0515 Cultures and Contexts: Latin America Prof. Abercrombie (Anthropology) syllabus Spanish, African, and Amerindian Sources of Latin American Identities. Explores the emergence of contemporary Latin America through the past and present doings of its persons and their representations, religious manifestations, song, dance, and literature. Through in-depth treatment of selected cases, and via the perspectives of history, anthropology, and cultural criticism, focusing on texts but also film, dance, music, and performance, the aims is both to uncover the roots of Latin-Americanness (and of global modernity) in the historical confluence of Europe, Africa, and America, and to discover how those roots are continually remade as each generation strives to rise from the ashes of its forebears. Case studies include the samba schools and Candomble religion in Brazilian carnival, the role of Vodou in the Haitian revolution and in New York City, the Mexican burlesques of death in the Day of the Dead, and \"Indian\" saints whose processions are associated with rites to underworld beings as well as to national integration. At base, we seek to answer more fundamental questions: What does it mean to have an identity, Latin American or Gringo, White, Black, Indian, or Mixed? How are the collectivities called nations, ethnicities, races, and classes brought into being and sustained? How is the vanished past resuscitated to serve the needs of the present? What does it mean to be Latin American in the age of so-called globalization? Includes frank and explicit discussion of race, sex, and religion.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0534 Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic Prof. Morgan (Social and Cultural Analysis) syllabus A range of intersecting questions concerning the African Diaspora and what it produces: What does the trans-Atlantic slave trade create in the early modern and modern world? How is our understanding of trade, culture, capitalism, justice, race, gender, and work shaped by the histories of dispersal that characterize the Atlantic World? What aspects of culture, politics, identity, and social formations are illuminated when we think critically about the African Diaspora and the forces that propel it?\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0537 Cultures and Contexts: Modern Israel Prof. Zweig (Hebrew & Judaic Studies) syllabus Modern Israel—Society and Culture: Despite its small size and population, Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years will be examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20%) in Israeli society will be discussed. The special role of religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew speaking culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched on, the focus is the character of Israeli society and the impact on everyday life of living in the international limelight.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0539 Cultures and Contexts: Asian Pacific American Cultures Prof. Tu (Social and Cultural Analysis) syllabus Major issues in the historical and contemporary experiences of Asian Pacific Americans, including migration, modernization, racial formation, community-building, and political mobilization, among others. Asian Pacific America encompasses a complex, diverse, and rapidly changing population of people. As an expression/reflection of their cultural identities, historical conditions, and political efforts, we pay particular attention to Asian Americans' use of cultural productions-films, literature, art, media, and popular culture.\n\nFall 2010 V55.0541 Cultures and Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Lane (Spanish & Portuguese) syllabus What was America before it was called America? How did indigenous cultures understand and document their first encounters with Europeans? We focus on peoples, events, and cultural expressions associated with the conquest and colonization of the Americas, concentrating on three key areas: central Mexico, home to a several pre-Columbian societies, most notably the Aztec Empire, and later the seat of Spanish power in northern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of New Spain); the central Andes, home of the Incas and later the site of Spanish power in southern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of Peru); and finally, early plantation societies of the Caribbean, where the violent history of enslaved Africans in the new world unfolded. On one hand, we explore how those subjugated by conquest and colonialism interpreted, resisted, and recorded their experience. On the other, we ask what new cultural forms emerged from these violent encounters, and consider their role in the foundation of \"Latin American\" cultures. Readings balance a range of primary documents and art created during the \"age of encounter,\" including maps, letters, paintings, and testimonials, along with historical and theoretical texts.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0545 Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Morris (ISAWFALL 2010 V55.0546 Cultures and Contexts: Global Asia Prof. Ludden (History) syllabus Explores the expansive transformation of Asian cultures from ancient times to the present, focusing on networks of mobility, interaction, social order, and exchange that form the particularity of Asian cultures through entanglements with others. Beginning in the days of Alexander the Great and the formation of the Afro-Eurasian ecumene, follows tracts of Buddhist, Confucian, Hindu, and Muslim expansion; then turns to the age of early modern landed empires, Ottoman-Safavid-Mughal-Ming/Ching, and their interactions with seaborne European expansion. Studies truly global formations of culture in the flow of goods, ideas, and people among world regions, during the age of modern empires and nationalism, including the rise of the nation as a cultural norm, capitalism in Asia, and Japanese expansion around the Pacific rim. Concludes by considering cultural change attending globalization since the 1950s, focusing on entanglements of Asian cultures with the globalizing culture of the market, consumerism, and wage labor, and transnational labor migration as well as Asian cultural spaces in and around New York City, including our nearby Chinatown.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa Prof. Hull (History) syllabus Focuses on several major African cultures that influenced each other's development from the pre-colonial through the postcolonial eras. These multi-dimensional cultures are examined through a variety of films, primary and secondary sources, and museum artifacts, with emphasis on concepts of cultural identity and interchange, modernization, and cosmopolitanism. Africa is examined not only within the context of indigenous cultures but within the context of the world at large. In this vein, we weigh the contributions African cultures made to each other but also to the wider world.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa Prof. Beidelman (Anthropology) syllabus Key concepts for understanding sub-Saharan African cultures and societies, and ways of thinking critically and consulting sources sensibly when studying non-Western cultures. Topics include: problems in the interpretation of African literature and history, gender issues, the question of whether African thought and values constitute a unique system of thinking, the impact of the slave trade and colonialism on African societies and culture, and the difficulties of and means for translating and interpreting the system of thought and behavior in an African traditional society into terms meaningful to Westerners. Among the readings are novels, current philosophical theory, and feminist interpretations of black and white accounts of African societies.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0507 Cultures and Contexts: Japan Prof. Solt (History) syllabus Postwar Japan, 1945 to Present. An inquiry into Japan's social, political, and economic transformation since World War II. Examines the role of the Cold War, the U.S. Occupation, the \"Peace\" Constitution, the symbolic monarchy, the economic \"miracle,\" corporate structure, the gendering of labor, and the legacy of war in shaping the history of postwar Japan. An underlying theme is the connection between political economy and culture. As such, we focus on the geopolitical and economic structures underpinning the visible transformations in everyday life and try to connect these transformations in Japanese history to broader themes in global history.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0510 Cultures and Contexts: Russia—between East and West Prof. Borenstein (Russian & Slavic Studies)syllabus What is Russia? What does it mean to be \"Russian\"? These questions have troubled Russians for centuries. Certainly, most nations engage in such soul-searching at one time or another; but Russia, thanks to special historical circumstances, has been obsessed with the problem of its own identity. Central to this concern is an issue that would appear to be more geographical than cultural: Is Russia a part of Europe (the West), or of Asia (the East)? Or, is it some hybrid that must find its own unique destiny? As we trace the development of this problem throughout Russia's history, we also become acquainted with the major characteristics and achievements of Russian culture, from its very beginnings to the present day.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0512 Cultures and Contexts: China Prof. Button (East Asian Studies) syllabus However one might choose to define the nature of human being, no one is ever merely human. Apart from whatever common essence we may be said to share, we are always also a combination of racial, ethnic, national, and gender differences. Over the course of several millennia Chinese culture has produced different conceptions of human being. We explore the variety of ways those conceptions have changed over time. Central to our inquiry is the question of how contending visions of the human are expressed and contested in different kinds of philosophical and literary texts, as well as artistic works in other media, including visual culture and film. Our guiding focus is on how ideas about human being in China have shaped gender roles and relations, the discourses of spirituality and the supernatural, as well as modern problems of race, nationalism, and revolution.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0516 Cultures and Contexts: India Prof. Ganti (Anthropology) syllabus Utilizing a variety of sources—novels, films, and academic scholarship—students are introduced to the history, culture, society, and politics of modern India. Home to one billion people, eight major religions, twenty official languages (with hundreds of dialects), histories spanning several millenia, and a tremendous variety of customs, traditions, and ways of life, India is almost iconic for its diversity. We examine the challenges posed by such diversity as well as how this diversity has been understood, represented, and managed, both historically and contemporarily.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0529 Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures Prof. Rosaldo and Prof. Gaytan (Social and Cultural Analysis) syllabus Addresses immigration, social movements, figures of resistance, testimonials, identities, popular culture, and language. Using an interdisciplinary approach that draws on readings from imaginative literature to social science, we explore Latino communities in the United States and the issues that divide and unite them.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0533 Cultures and Contexts: Iran Prof. Chelkowski (Middle Eastern & Islamic Societies) syllabus From Ancient Persia to Contemporary Iran: For 2500 years, the culture and civilization of Iran, (known in the West prior to World War II as Persia), has survived innumerable attacks and vicissitudes, which swept away many other cultures, languages, and nations. The first empire in human history to be multiracial, multicultural, and multi-religious, based on tolerance, expanded ultimately to encompass all the lands from the Hindu Kush to North Africa. Emphasizing the growth of ancient Iranian culture--particularly art, architecture, literature, and their influence--we investigate the traditional myths and religions of ancient Iran, the rebirth of Iranian self-consciousness, the establishment of Shi'i Islam as the state religion, and the conflict of the vision and mysticism of traditional Iranian culture with that of the West. We survey the political organization of the Empire, Alexander the Great's conquest of Iran and its aftermath, and the impact of the Arab-Islamic conquest. We examine the rebirth of Iranian self-consciousness after World War II, and the transformation of the country during the Islamic Revolution.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0545 Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Roth (Hebrew and Judaic StudiesSPRING 2011 V55.0549 Cultures and Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Ortolano (History) syllabus Introduces students to the peoples, cultures, and histories of the British Isles. Today home to a pair of European states, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, this grouping of islands off the northwestern coast of Europe has historically been home to an astonishing variety of peoples, kingdoms, religions, nations, and states. Rather than collapsing this diversity into a study of the English people or the British state, we think about the United Kingdom as a multinational formation, produced through the experience of repeated invasions, encounters, and migrations. Our ultimate goals are twofold: to learn about the peoples of the British Isles, and to use this knowledge to think critically about claims regarding national characteristics, ethnic stability, or cultural homogeneity--in Britain, and beyond.\n\nExpressive Culture\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0722 Expressive Culture: Images - Architecture in New York Field Study Prof. Broderick (Art History) syllabus New York's rich architectural heritage offers a unique opportunity for firsthand consideration of the concepts and styles of modern urban architecture, as well as its social, financial, and cultural contexts. Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to prominent buildings. Attention is given both to individual buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century architecture and to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper and the adaptation of older buildings to new uses0751 Expressive Culture: Television Prof. Polan (Cinema Studies) syllabus The Twilight Zone and Expressive Culture of the 1950s and 1960s. According to cliché, the 1950s in America were a period of conformity and consensus, but it is clear that there were many signs of discontent with and within the image of cheerful homogeneity. For example, at the end of the decade, the television program The Twilight Zone, showed everyday life as a source of paranoia in which ordinary existence revealed its frightening underside. Then, as the nation engaged with the New Frontier of the Kennedy 1960s, the show used science fiction to represent dreams as American nightmares. We look at The Twilight Zone in terms of its expressive rendition of 1950s and 1960s America. Along the way, we examine the shift in American television from East Coast production of liberal drama to West Coast production of escapism and entertainment and will situate Rod Serling's career within that shift. We also examine other renditions of paranoia (and symbolic resolutions of it) across the popular culture and politics of the moment. Most broadly, we attempt to examine the medium of popular television as an expressive cultural form which enlightened liberals like Serling tried to use as a mode of moral and aesthetic uplift. Critical methods that might help us understand the potentials of television as expressive culture are emphasized.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0721 Expressive Culture: Images - Painting and Sculpture in New York Field Study Prof. Broderick (Art History) syllabus New York's public art collections contain important examples of painting and sculpture from almost every phase of the past, as well as some of the world's foremost works of contemporary art. Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to the museums or other locations where these works are exhibited.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.0730 Expressive Cultures: Sounds Prof. Zayaruzny investigateSpring 2011 V55.0730 Expressive Cultures: Sounds Prof. MuellerSPRING 2011 V55.0750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Simon (Cinema Studies) syllabus American narrative films, produced primarily during the period 1965-75, considered as an innovative cycle of filmmaking in dialogue with significant historical, political, and cultural transformations in American society. Examines developments in film genre during this period especially in relation to political and cultural change. Narrative innovations are emphasized, with special attention to the specificity of film form and style (e.g., editing, mise-en-scène, sound). Provides an introduction to the methods and principles of film analysis as well as dealing with this period of filmmaking in depth. Includes films by Kubrick, Coppola, Altman, and Scorsese.\n\nStudy Abroad at NYU Global Sites\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9549 Cultures and Contexts: Multinational Britain\nProf. Woods (NYU in London) syllabus The idea of British national identity has been built around a sense of united statehood within the confines of the four nations comprising the United Kingdom, ruling overseas territories. As such, it conveyed a sense of a multi-national empire ruled by monarchs, but developing over time into a benign, democratic, constitutional monarchy, generally through peaceful, not revolutionary change. The British have seen themselves historically as freedom-loving, independent, industrial, tolerant, Protestant and individualistic. These myths of national image have been forged partly through conflict with other nations over many centuries and reflect a nationalistic pride in military success and the maintenance of the largest empire the world has ever seen. Changes since 1945 have seen the collapse of that empire, membership in the European Union, large-scale immigration, changing gender politics, and the devolution of power to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. This has inevitably led to major challenges to traditional British views of their national identity. Includes fieldtrips to key sites.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa\nProf. Adams (NYU in Ghana) syllabus African culture through autobiography. Texts consist of chronological life histories and memoirs, e. g., by writers of aristocratic birth and those of peasant birth, by individuals accomplished in the arts and others in the sciences, by Nobel laureates and by political leaders, by women and by men. Each narrative provides an intimate acquaintance with the traditions, aspirations, challenges, and strategies from the writer's own society. Collectively they provide the skeleton of a usefully subjective narrative of modern African history. The depicted lives include an 18th-century enslaved Nigerian child, who, ultimately, as a free man, would become a respected abolitionist; the U.S.-educated leader of Africa's first nation to gain independence from colonialism; the passionate Kenyan crusader for the preservation of Africa's environment as the source of its self-development; and the physically and morally courageous exemplar of the battle that overthrew South African apartheid.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9544 Cultures and Contexts: Spain—At the Crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and America\nProf. Galban (NYU in Madrid) syllabus Analyzes the ways in which historical, geopolitical, cultural, artistic, and popular views function to constitute and continuously transform a national culture. Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain—the idea of Spain—that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain's New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933–36). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9547 Cultures and Contexts: Multicultural France\nProf. Epstein (NYU in Paris) syllabus France and the U.S. have a habit of looking at one another as anti-models when it comes to discussions of assimilation and difference, \"race,\" identity, community, and diversity. We explore this comparison as a productive means for re-considering these terms. Why is the notion of \"ethnic community\" so problematic in France? Why do Americans insist on the \"homogeneity\" of the French nation, even as, at various points throughout modern French history, France has received more immigrants to its shores than the United States? Through readings, film screenings, and site visits we study the movements and encounters that have made Paris a rich, and sometimes controversial, site of cultural exchange. Topics include contemporary polemics on questions such as headscarves, the banlieue, the new Paris museums of immigration and \"primitive\" art, affirmative action and discrimination positive, historic expressions of exoticism, négritude, and anti-colonialism. Occasional case studies drawn from the American context help provide a comparative framework for these ideas.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9548 Cultures and Contexts: Prague—In the Heart of Central Europe\nProf. Mucha (NYU in Prague) syllabus The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East, many scholars see a distinct Central European culture based on historical, social, and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity, the result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic, and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of history. Identified as having been one of the world's richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures, such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe, and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel, and Dvorak, to mention at least some. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region.

Given its unique geo-political circumstances and its symbolic position, Israel attracts much media coverage as well as more scholarly treatment of the Israeli-Arab or Israeli-Palestinian conflict. More often than not, Israel is portrayed through the lens of high politics or treated as an exotic anomaly. Whether popular or academic in its orientation, the study of Israeli society has thus tended to neglect everyday life in Israel. We consider aspects of Israeli politics and culture; visit art exhibitions, music venues, and the cinema; and observe street life in Tel Aviv (day and night).\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9730 Expressive Cultures: Sounds\nProf. Cusick (NYU in Florence",

You\nare provided with a text book and a CD-Rom which displays the contents of the\nbook plus many exciting new interactive features which will assist teachers and\nstudents.\n\nThe book is language rich and technology rich. Whilst some of the exercises are\nsimply designed to build skills, every effort has been made to contextualise problems,\nso that students can see everyday uses and practical applications of the mathematics\nthey are studying.\n\nThe book contains many problems, from the basic to the advanced, to cater for\na wide range of student abilities and interests. Much emphasis has been placed\non the gradual development of concepts with appropriate worked examples. However,\nwe have also provided extension material for those who wish to go beyond Stage\n1 and look towards further studies or applications of mathematics for their career\nchoices. It is not our intention that each chapter be worked through in full.\nTime constraints will not allow for this. Consequently, teachers must select exercises\ncarefully, according to the abilities and prior knowledge of their students, in\norder to make the most efficient use of time and give as thorough coverage of\nwork as possible.\n\nThe extensive use of graphics calculators and computer packages throughout the\nbook enables students to realise the importance, application and appropriate use\nof technology. No single aspect of technology has been favoured. It is as important\nthat students work with a pen and paper as it is that they use their calculator\nor graphics calculator, or use a spreadsheet or graphing package on computer.\n\nThe interactive features of the CD-Rom allow immediate access to our own specially\ndesigned geometry packages, graphing packages and more. Teachers are provided\nwith a quick and easy method of demonstrating concepts, or students can discover\nfor themselves, and revisit when necessary.\n\nTeachers should note that instructions appropriate to each graphics calculator\nproblem are available on the CD-Rom and can be printed for students. These instructions\nare written for Sharp, Texas Instruments, Casio and Hewlett-Packard calculators.\n\nIn this changing world of mathematics education, we believe that the contextual\napproach shown in this book, with the associated use of technology, will enhance\nthe students' understanding, knowledge and appreciation of mathematics.",

Algebra 1 skills and conceptual relationships are the foundation of the CORE 40 graduation exam but will also prepare you for future math and science courses. We are committed as a team to providing quality instruction and appropriate materials and supporting you with plenty of attention, patience, and other resources. We understand the importance of the content of this class and we truly want you to succeed.\n\nSome of the \"big ideas\" we emphasize in Algebra 1 include properties of real numbers, solving equations and inequalities and proportions, functions and graphs, understanding lines and slope, polynomials and factoring, radicals and quadratic functions.\n\nOur measuring sticks are that darn CORE 40 test and your future success in Algebra 2, but our focus is on mastering those \"big ideas\" along the way. Some of these skills will be difficult for you to understand at first. I encourage you to keep these three P's in mind:\n\n1)Practice! Math is a skill and can only be mastered through routine,\n\nrigorous and disciplined practice.\n\n2)Pace! Don't try to rush or skip ahead until you fully understand what we have already done.\n\nTake breaks and ask lots of questions.\n\n3)Perspective! This class is imperative regardless of your goals. I encourage you to\n\ntake a step back from the mechanical steps of the arithmetic and try to understand\n\nthe concepts and relationships. When you understand why certain steps are required\n\nCongratulations! You made it to the second semester of Algebra 1. Only the students who have demonstrated a solid understanding of the concepts in the first semester are here right now. Yes, it's that important. The second semester is notable more difficult than the first, but we're confident you'll make it through or it would not have been recommended that you be here. We have two goals this semester: 1) to make sure everyone is prepared for the Algebra 1 End-of-Course Assessment (ECA) graduation exam in May, and 2) to help ensure your future success in Algebra 2.\n\nOur seventh unit explains the rules for exponents and multiplying and dividing factors with the same base. We'll follow that up with a unit on polynomials to get comfortable adding and subtracting like terms with exponents, then multiply polynomial groups together using the Distributive Property. In the next unit we will change directions and go backwards through the distributive process to factor polynomial expressions, especially quadratic trinomials. As the quarter draws to a close, we'll be breaking down and solving quadratic equations.",
