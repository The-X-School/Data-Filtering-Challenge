{"text": "This paper proposes to analyze the press coverage of the French nuclear effort in the two decades following World War II to extract the public image pertaining to nuclear power and the atomic bomb effort the French undertook. In so doing, it shows that imaging the atom occupied a liminal space that was influenced by political necessity as much as secrecy in a time period characterized by economic difficulty and constitutional crisis\n\nThe history of French nuclear power, but more specifically of the French atomic bomb in the French Fourth and Fifth Republics is very much a mix of clear and blurred mosaic pieces. For example, as the French government sought to accelerate the development of nuclear power in the wake of the Suez Canal crisis in 1956, it faced an inherent tension associated with the need for military secrecy. Within four years, however, the newly formed Fifth Republic would use the first French nuclear explosion as grounds to trumpet technological achievement. The coverage of the development and testing, as well as associated events were the subject of a series of reports in the French weekly Paris-Match. The magazine's own appearance shortly after World War II and its evolution into an important source of mass information and entertainment makes it an obvious choice to discuss popular perceptions of French nuclear power. By applying a narrative analysis, I show how the French weekly accompanied its readers into accepting the development of the French bomb. In so doing, it contributed to what Pierre Nora has identified as \"divertissement dramatique,\" the coding of an event that went out of the ordinary, yet made use of a series of conventional signals understandable to all."}

The carbon atom turns into a nitrogen atom.\nClick on image for full size Original artwork by Windows to the Universe staff (Randy Russell).\n\nMost elements come in various \"versions\", called isotopes. Different isotopes have different numbers of neutrons. Some isotopes are radioactive. For example, the isotope of carbon called carbon-14 is radioactive. It has 8 neutrons (instead of the usual 6) and radiates beta particles. When an atom emits radiation it undergoes radioactive decay. It may be transformed from one isotope to another. It might become a different element altogether. When carbon-14 decays by emitting a beta particle, it becomes nitrogen-14. Isotopes that do not decay are called \"stable\" isotopes.\n\nDifferent radioactive materials take different amounts of time to decay. Scientists use the idea of a half-life to describe this. The half-life of a radioactive material can be very short (less than a second) or very long (thousands of years) or anywhere in between. After one half-life, half of a sample of radioactive material has decayed. After another half-life, half of what was left decays.Some materials are radioactive. Their atoms give off radiation.

A meter stick placed lengthwise on the ground is stable -- if you push it a little bit, it doesn't move much. A meter stick balanced on its end is unstable, meaning a small push will result in a drastic and significant change of state.\n\nNo radioactive isotope is \"stable\" -- they fall apart all by themselves.\n\nA non-radioactive isotope with a very high mass defect per nucleon is more analogous to a meter stick on the ground lengthwise -- it's unlikely to fall far since there are relatively few places for it to fall to, even if pushed.\n\nFarsight\n\n05-10-11, 10:00 AM\n\nIn any case, the point of my question is which description describes stability - the mass defect or radioactive half-life?The mass defect indicates the binding energy between the neutrons and protons. The more bound they are, the more likely you've got a stable configuration. But not necessarily - you might have two sub-configurations that are each very tightly bound, but not to each other.

{"text": "imatter contamination?\n\nOk, here's a question I guess most people here can deal with handily: Does antimatter reactions with matter produce fallout or other kinds of radioactive contemination?\n\nAssume a typical mad scientist succeeds in creating a large amount of antimatter. (HA HA! The Fools! They laughed at me! Now, they shall tremble!) He then sets it up as a bomb in a remote area and detonates it as a show of his power and what will happen if the worlds does not meet his demands.\n\nOk, now is there any radioactive fallout or residual radiation left over from this? I'm not sure as most nukes leave fallout from the amount of fissile matter in the fission trigger, even if the atoms get stripped of their electrons the nuclei are still radioactive, after all.\n\nBut what about an antimatter reaction that involves no radioactive matter? WOuld it leave radioactivity behind?\n\nFor that matter, assume another mad scientist invents a laser pumped fusion bomb that doesn't use a fission trigger but fusions deuterium by laser pulse. Would that create fallout or be a clean WMD?\n\nIt depends on the antimatter used. electron/positron annihilation will produce gammas, none of which will exceed 511 keV, which is probably not enough energy to cause activation (cause to become radioactive) of anything they hit \u2014 for a gamma to knock out a proton or neutron, possibly producing a radioactive nuclide, will require several MeV.\n\nIf you use something more massive, though, this might occur. Proton/antiproton or neutron/antineutron will produce gammas of almost 1 GeV, and possibly lower-mass particle/antiparticle pairs that will have significant kinetic energy. These could cause activation.\n\nAlso, it's possible that when the annihilation starts occurring, not all the material interacts immediately, and gets accelerated by the explosion. So you might have some very energetic neutrons or protons flying about, which could also activate materials.\n\nAt this level you could undertake to explain the subject a little better. I understand critical mass and radiation. At a very basic level. This subject is fascinating as from this research could come the way forward. How much energy is released in the anti mater and mater collision. what is known about this science. Should I run and hide now or can you help me learn what is actually happening here.\n\nMy guess is there will typically be a surplus of matter, plus some delay in the last of the antimater reacting in a practical anti-matter bomb.\nI think one neutron in a chlorine atom might be annialated by an anti-neutron. If this was a chlorine isotope with atomic weight 37, it is now the radioactive chlorine isotope (atomic weight 36) with a half life of 310,000 years. This emits a positive beta, a negative beta and an EC. I don't know the meaning of EC. Neil\n\nEC = electron capture. Proton captures an electron and becomes a neutron and a neutrino.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThere's no critical mass for antimatter; it's not a chain reaction. Antimatter will tend to annihilate with matter, converting the mass, usually into gammas. The ones you get from e-e+ annihilation don't have enough energy to knock a particle out of a nucleus and make it (possibly) become radioactive. For the more massive particle, you probably will. Or other reactions could occur.\n\nSwansont's answer is basically right. If the mad scientist somehow had a few kilograms of positrons captured in a magnetic bottle, and then let them go, the energy released would be quite large, and there would be lots of non-radioactive fallout. There would also be a lot of corrupted molecules potentially creating dead or mutated life, and or biochemical toxins. It is also possible that enough energy could be released that some nuclear interactions could happen in the shock wave as to cause some strange short-lived isotopes, but probably not many.\n\nIf on the other hand, your mad scientist released several kilograms of solid (very cold) anti-Hydrogen. The gamma rays released would be enough to alter the nuclei of the atoms nearby, and create a nasty soup of strange short-lived elements in the material blasted up into the atmosphere (from which it would later fall out)."}

It talks about terrorists wanting to make a dirty bomb but doesn't specify any material. It also states that terrorists want to get fissile material (which could be uranium OR plutonium, it doesn't state which) to make something beyond a dirty bomb (ie, nuclear bomb). Seriously, if a terrorist goes after plutonium, or even uranium, to make a dirty bomb... I can't even explain the stupidity of that.\n\nCan you tell me why a terrorist would try to get through ENORMOUS security to get plutonium when they can get Cobalt 60 from medical/dental and food processing facilities without even trying?\n\nThe whole point of a dirty bomb isn't to kill, it's to scare and to play psychological games while causing a lot of money to be spent/lost in the cleanup. There was a pretty amazing study done at USC showing the damage that would be caused by a dirty bomb at a US port. If you are interested it's worth the time.\n\nAs far as reprocessing, China, France, UK, India, Japan, and Russia all reprocess spent fuel. The article you chose doesn't do much service as there are inconsistencies. First it states that Frances outside customers dropped reprocessing because it did not make economic sense. This is a half truth. It didn't make economic sense to send it to FRANCE to be recycled. Japan actually opened their own reprocessing facilities. Economic factors were part of Germany's discontinuance, but that's partly because they chose not to reprocess in Germany, and partly due to the nuclear rebuttal that Germany went through and are now paying for with energy supply problems.\n\nNext, the article plays some games with numbers and makes it sound bad and is a little disingenuous. According to the Charpin report quoted by your article, reprocessing only raises the cost by about 1%. While it's still a lot of money, the French reasons for reprocessing are to limit waste, fully realizing it will cost a little more. The article makes it sound like the economics are bad so it isn't worth it, while the French say that even though it's more expensive it's worth it.\n\nNext, the leakage discussion in France. The amount of tritium they are leaking into the groundwater is about the same amount of radioactive material that we eat every year from bananas and other potassium containing foods. It sounds scary (and really should not be leaked regardless), but it's not as consequential as they want you to believe.\n\nI could continue to go subject by subject to talk about the weirdness of the article, but with all the nice little facts I found, not to mention who it is written by, I'm not impressed with that article. can we get a different article?"}

{"text": "videocomment: Creating jewelry with old clock and watch parts is a fun art form, but one must be aware that old watch and clock faces and hands are sometimes coated with radium paint. The radiation levels measured here are not particularly dangerous UNLESS this radium coating falls of and gets inhaled or swallowed. Then some unlucky internal organ will get a constant close-up dose of radiation. Not so good.\n\nIf you're going to be disassembling old clocks to harvest gears and other parts, please consider borrowing or buying a radiation meter for your safety and that of the people who buy your steampunk creations.Lume paint primarily consists of two active compounds. One is the radioactive material and the other is a luminescent material. I point this out because typically the luminescent material becomes inert after a couple of decades. The radioactive compound, however, is typically still active. So don't assume that because the paint doesn't glow that it isn't radioactive.\n\nThe radioactive part of the compound, in watches made prior to the 40's, was most commonly radium. Radium is reasonably safe as long as it's inside the watch, and the case is intact. The radioactive energy that is able to escape through the crystal is usually fairly weak; similar to sun exposure. Very little energy makes it through the watch and out the back to your arm. Radium has a half life of 1600 years, so your radium based parts will still be radioactive for many thousands of years. The main risk of Radium comes from inhalation or ingestion. If inhaled, it tends to get stuck in the lungs, where it sits irradiating your lung tissue forever. If injested, your body can't distinguish between radium and calcium, which means that usually it will end up getting flushed from your body. However, there is a chance that your body will use it to do things that it normally does with calcium. Like build bones. Which means you'll have a chunk of radium sitting in your skeleton. Not good.\n\nPast the 40's, most consumer watches switched over to Tritium. Tritium is a hydrogen based radioactive substence (the \"tri\" in tritium refers to the 3 hydrogen atoms in its structure). Tritium is fairly low energy, and typically you'll get little or no reading outside of the case. As with radium, there is a risk of inhalation and ingestion. Past the 90's, even tritium paste has been phased out, and modern watches use sealed glass tritium vials. Tritium only has a half life of about 6 years, so often the tritium will be inert before the luminescent.\n\nThere there is the category of \"other\". Back before people realized how dangerous radioactive stuff was, companies would experiment with other radioactive substances in an effort to differentiate their products (usually to make them brighter). Brighter tends to mean \"more energy\"; I've seen some dials/hands with crazy levels of radiation; no idea what they used. I've seen references to the use of Strontium 90 in the 40's though.\n\nI am a complete noob when it comes to things like this, so sorry if I ask stupid questions (but hey, no such things as stupid questions, right? ), but, say if one brought a geiger counter along before buying old clocks and the like, would that work?\n\nI also bought (and took apart) an old clock a while ago, that was basically completely open case, is there a chance there was something dangerous in there?\n\nIn a general sense, you don't need to be worried about radiation exposure if you're just looking at the thing; its the long-term effect that's a concern, and that's only going to be a problem if you buy the thing and put it beside your bed, or if you have, say, 100 of them. The big concern is from the perspective of taking the thing apart and disturbing the radioactive paint. American military watches from the 70's onward have radiation symbols and warnings on them, even though they only use Tritium (or theoretically, Promethium), because while the radiation risk is low for a single watch, it becomes more problematic when you've got 1000's of them to dispose of.\n\nso if I just took the gears and didn`t do anything to the mostly-closed-off part with the numbers and stuff, and just put everything else aside, I should be fine?\n\nReally, if it was just me here I wouldn`t even be bothered that much, but I have 4 housemates that I`m pretty close with, and I don`t feel much like causing trouble for them too. (plus I worry easily :p )"}

{"text": "Both reactions involve the nucleus of an atom, and in both reactions, lots and lots of energy are released. Other than that, the two reactions are pretty much opposite. Fission involves the splitting of an atomic nucleus. Fusion involves the fusing of two or more smaller units to create a new, heavier nucleus.\n\nIn nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, nuclear fusion is the process by which multiple like-charged atomic nuclei join together to form a heavier nucleus heavier than iron absorbs energy; vice-versa for the reverse process, nuclear fission. Nuclear fusion occurs naturally in stars. Artificial fusion in human enterprises has also been achieved, although not yet completely controlled. Building upon the nuclear transmutation experiments of Ernest Rutherford done a few years earlier, fusion of light nuclei (hydrogen isotopes) was first observed by Mark Oliphant in 1932, and the steps of the main cycle of nuclear fusion in stars were subsequently worked out by Hans Bethe throughout the remainder of that decade. Research into fusion for military purposes began in the early 1940s, as part of the Manhattan Project, but was not successful until 1952. Research into controlled fusion for civilian purposes began in the 1950s, and continues to this day.\n\nfusion reaction:- nuclear fusion is the process by which multiple like-charged atomic nuclei join together to form a heavier nucleus. It is accompanied by the release or absorption of energy.\n\nfission reaction:- nuclear fission is a nuclear reaction in which the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts, often producing free neutrons and lighter nuclei. Fission of heavy elements is an exothermic reaction.\n\nFission is the process of splitting of a heavier nucleus into fragments of smaller mass by bombardment with slow moving neutrons. Fusion is the is a process in which lighter nuclei of atoms fuse together to form a heavier nucleus.\n\nNUCLEAR FUSION is the fusing of two particles,i.e. two particles combine togrther into one and in this process they release energy. FOR EX--- atom bombs use the nulear fission process.\n\nNUCLEAR FISSION is the process where a big particle break downs into many more such relatively small particles.This process again releases nuclear energy.\n\nIn other words you can simply say that fission involves the breakdown of the big particle whereas FUSION involves the combinning of the many paricles ti form a single particle AND in both these processes NUCLEAR ENERGY is released.\n\nfission is a reaction where big molecules breaks into small molecules and makes energy. This is the reaction which happens in Atom Bomb. Fusion is just reverse in this small molecules meets and make big molecule. This is the reaction which happens in SUN.

{"text": "April 21, 2011\n\nOf Terms in Biology: Millisievert\n\nReports in the media of the nuclear plant disasters in Japan often cite the amount of radioactivity released in units called millisieverts. Not knowing what a millisievert is, I resorted to Wikipedia for the needed clarification. We reproduce some of their explanation here as a public service.\n\nThe sievert (symbol: Sv) is the SI derived unit of dose equivalent radiation. It attempts to quantitatively evaluate the biological effects of ionizing radiation as opposed to the physical aspects, which are characterised by the absorbed dose, measured in gray. It is named after Rolf Sievert, a Swedish medical physicist renowned for work on radiation dosage measurement and research into the biological effects of radiation.\n\nAs with every SI unit whose name is derived from the proper name of a person, the first letter of its symbol is upper case (Sv). When an SI unit is spelled out in English, it should always begin with a lower case letter (sievert), except where any word would be capitalized, such as at the beginning of a sentence or in capitalized material such as a title. Note that \"degree Celsius\" conforms to this rule because the \"d\" is lowercase.\n\nFor those used to older units such as the rem, (a unit for the equivalent dose), one sievert = 100 rem; 1 rem = 0.01 Sv = 10 mSv.\n\nComments\n\nThe most frequent use of radiation units in public media is to mislead\npeople about radiation risks. The universally cited linear extrapolation\nof health risks, from high exposures to low, has never been based on\nmeasurements. It's hard to see how it ever could be. What we can say with\nconfidence is that it's almost certainly not linear.\n\nWorse, full-body exposure is meaningless when radionuclides concentrate in\nspecific body tissues -- dust in lungs, iodine in the thyroid gland, metals\nin bones. Then, your total radiation exposure may be indistinguishable\nfrom nominal background, yet reliably destroy and mutate cells near the\ncontaminant over a long period. John Wayne was much more probably killed\nby the picograms of fallout dust he breathed in and retained than the few\ndays' irradiation he got on-set downwind of that H-bomb test.\n\nThe curie is an interesting unit. It make releases of long half-life\nradionuclides seem less harmful than short half-life materials. You may\nrelease overwhelmingly more cesium than iodine, but the same number of\ncuries each. The level of iodine exposure may be considered small, given\nthat it will decay to nothing in a few weeks, but the much more abundant\ncesium, when an immeasurable bit of it finds its way into your bones, will\ncontinue radiating long after your death.\n\nExamples of such misleading usage are easy to find, such as in the\nfrequently repeated Three Mile Island statistics. Average gamma radiation\ndosage in a radius around TMI extrapolated from a few high-ground samplings\nmeans nothing for the people in the valley basin downstream bathed in heavy\ngaseous and suspended radionuclides for days.\n\nAs scientists we are congenitally disposed against misleading anybody.\nIt's all too easy, though, to repeat published numbers and seem to be\nsaying -- and even to believe ourselves -- what the numbers do not really\nsay at all"}

Is this an urban legend or truth?\n\nA\n\nThere are bits and pieces of the story you relate that are true, while others are an exaggeration. You are probably thinking of an article written in Harper's magazine in 1998 by Ken Silverstein (who recently published a book called The Radioactive Boy Scout). You can find a copy of the article on the Looksmart website or you can do a Google search under the phrase \"radioactive boy scout.\"\n\nTrue: a high school student DID collect all sorts of radioactive materials in an attempt to build a nuclear reactor. This included collecting smoke detectors and trying to chemically extract radioactive materials from a variety of objects.\n\nTrue: the student heavily contaminated his home, which later became a Superfund site.\n\nFalse: the student built a working nuclear reactor (in fact, the student made some progress towards producing fissionable materials and the work he did was impressive. But it would have taken him a VERY long time to produce enough fissionable material to make a nuclear reactor.)\n\nSo\u2014the bottom line is that a very bright student did make a fairly sophisticated effort to extract radioactive materials and construct a neutron \"gun,\" and he tried to produce fissionable materials, with the goal of making a breeder reactor. However, he never accumulated enough material to create an actual reactor, and the methodology he used would have taken too long to make the materials. Even if he had manufactured the requisite kilograms of fissionable materials, he would still have had to assemble them into a nuclear reactor, which is not easy to do. The most likely outcome of his experiments, had they been carried through to fruition, would have been poisoning (from the chemical toxicity of the materials he was working with) and disappointment. However, the level of scientific sophistication exhibited by this boy was impressive!\n\nAndrew Karam, CHP, PhD\n\nAnswer posted on 29"}

But if you think nuclear energy is an efficient and pollution-free way to make electricity, consider \"thorium\" and \"molten salt reactors.\"\n\nHuh? On the periodic tables, thorium rests just two spots away from uranium, which is the prevailing fuel used by today's nuclear reactors. Once uranium is used as a fuel, it becomes highly radioactive. That waste is then cooled in spent fuel pools before is stored in above-ground, concrete-encased steel caskets. As the world learned from Japan's Fukushima nuclear accident, that radioactive material could escape and do a lot of potential harm.\n\nThorium, on the other hand, can also be used to generate nuclear energy. But its proponents are saying that \"molten salt reactors\" that burn such fuels won't \"meltdown\" because, unlike today's high-pressured units, they are low-pressured and won't vaporize.\n\n\"Thorium is the most abundant nuclear material on earth,\" says Clinton Bastin, who was with the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and the U.S. Department of Energy from 1955 until 1997. \"It should eventually be used in nuclear reactors because it is so plentiful. But it should not be used now because it introduces the problem of highly radioactive material that is very difficult to deal with.\"\n\nBastin, who is also a former VP of the World Council of Nuclear Workers, explained to this reporter that there are demonstration projects now occurring involving thorium. Active trials are taking place in China and India, and to some extent in Canada. But no country is using a significant amount of thorium to produce electricity, much less in molten salt reactors. . .View Full Article"}

Here's what you need to know to understand the news, as it happens\n<!--paging_filter--><p>.<br />\n<!--break--></p>\n<h3>What Is a Nuclear Reaction?</h3>\n<p>A nuclear reaction is at its most basic nothing more than a reaction process that occurs in an atomic nucleus. They typically take place when a nucleus of an atom gets smacked by either a subatomic particle (usually a \"free neutron,\" a short-lived neutron not bound to an existing nucleus) or another nucleus. That reaction produces atomic and subatomic products different from either of the original two particles. To make the kind of nuclear reaction we want, a fission reaction (in which the nucleus splits apart), those two original particles have to be of a certain type: One has to be a very heavy elemental isotope, typically some form of uranium or plutonium, and the other has to be a very light \"free neutron.\" The uranium or plutonium isotopes are referred to as \"fissile,\" which means we can use them to induce fission by bombarding them with free neutrons.</p>\n<p>In a fission reaction, the light particle (the free neutron) collides with the heavy particle (the uranium or plutonium isotope) which splits into two or three pieces. That fission produces a ton of energy in the form of both kinetic energy and electromagnetic radiation. Those new pieces include two new nuclei (byproducts), some photons (gamma rays), but also some more free neutrons, which is the key that makes nuclear fission a good candidate to generate energy. Those newly produced free neutrons zoom around and smack into more uranium or plutonium isotopes, which in turn produces more energy and more free neutrons, and the whole thing keeps going that way--a nuclear fission chain reaction.</p>\n<p>Nuclear fission produces insane amounts of energy, largely in the form of heat--we're talking several million times more energy than you'd get from a similar mass of a more everyday fuel like gasoline. </p>\n<h3>Getting Usable Energy From Fission</h3>\n<p>There are several types of nuclear fission reactors in Japan, but we're going to focus on the Fukushima Naiishi plant, the most hard-hit facility in the country. Fukushima, run by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), has six separate reactor units, although numbers 4, 5, and 6 were shut down for maintenance at the time of the earthquake (and more importantly, the subsequent tsunami). Numbers 1, 2, and 3 are all \"boiling water reactors,\" made by General Electric in the early- to mid-1970s. A boiling water reactor, or BWR, is the second-most-common reactor type in the world. </p>\n<p>A BWR contains thousands of thin, straw-like tubes 12 feet in length, known as fuel rods, that in the case of Fukushima are made of a zirconium alloy. Inside those fuel rods is sealed the actual fuel, little ceramic pellets of uranium oxide. The fuel rods are bundled together in the core of the reactor. During a nuclear fission chain reaction, the tubes heat up to extremely high temperatures, and the way to keep them safe turns out to also be the way to extract useful energy from them. The rods are kept submerged in demineralized water, which serves as a coolant. The water is kept in a pressurized containment vessel, so it has a boiling point of around 550 \u00b0F. Even at such a high boiling point, the burning hot fuel rods produce large amounts of steam, which is actually what we want from this whole complicated arrangement-the high-pressure steam is used to turn the turbines on dynamos, producing electricity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Safety</h3>\n<p>Since lots of heat is being produced, as well as the production and use of lots of pretty nasty radioactive materials, nuclear plants employ a variety several safety efforts beyond simply the use of the cooling water (which itself is backed up by redundant diesel generators--more on that later). The plant's core, the fuel rods and the water, is encased in a steel reactor vessel. That reactor vessel is in turn encased in a giant reinforced concrete shell, which is designed to prevent any radioactive gases from escaping. </p>\n<h3>Isn't There an \"Off\" Switch?</h3>\n<p>Sure! But needless to say, safely shutting down and controlling a nuclear reactor is not at all as simple as unplugging a rogue kitchen appliance. This is due to the extreme heat still present well after fission has subsided--mostly due to chemical reactions inherent in the fission reaction. </p>\n<p>A functioning fission plant employs a system of control rods, essentially structures that limit the rate of fission inside the fuel rods by absorbing roaming free neutrons. The rate of fission can be controlled--even stopped--by inserting and removing the control rods in the reactor. At the time of the quake, the Fukushima reactors' control rods functioned normally, shutting down the fission reaction. But even with the fission reaction stopped, the fuel rods remain at extremely high temperatures and require constant cooling.</p>\n<p>Which isn't typically a problem, so long as the cooling system (and, failing that, its diesel-powered backup) is still intact. But after losing main power in the quake, the subsequent tsunami wave also destroyed Fukushima's diesel backup generators. Which is a serious problem; even though the fission had stopped, coolant is still very much required to keep the plant safe.</p>\n<p>That's due to the heat that remains in the nuclear core, both from the recently-disabled but still-hot fuel rods and from the various byproducts of the fission process. Those byproducts include radioactive iodine and caesium, both of which produce what's called \"decay heat\"--residual heat that is very slow to dissipate. If the core isn't continuously cooled, there's still more than enough heat to cause a meltdown long after it's been \"turned off.\"</p>\n<p>In the case of the Fukushima plant, with both the main and backup coolant systems down for the count, TEPCO was forced to rig a method to flood the core with seawater laced with boric acid (the boric acid to stave off another fission reaction if one were to restart due to a meltdown--more on that below). That's a bad sign--it's a last-ditch effort to prevent catastrophe, as the salt in the seawater will corrode the machinery. It's also a temporary fix: TEPCO will need to pump thousands of gallons of seawater into the core every day, until they can get the coolant system back online. Without it, the seawater method might have to go on for weeks, even up to a year, as the decay heat slowly subsides.</p>\n<h3>The Dreaded Meltdown</h3>\n<p>First of all, a \"meltdown\" is not a precisely defined term, which makes it fairly useless as an indicator of what's going on. Even the terms \"full meltdown\" and \"partial meltdown\" are pretty unhelpful, which is partly why we've written this guide--you'll be able to understand what's actually happening without relying on spurious terms that the experts themselves are often loathe to use. </p>\n<p>Anyway, let's start at some of the less severe (though still unsettling) things that can happen when the coolant liquid is no longer present in the core. When the fuel rods are left uncovered by water, they'll get far too hot--we're talking thousands of degrees Celsius here--and begin to oxidize, or rust. That oxidation will react with the water that's left, producing highly explosive hydrogen gas. This has already happened in reactor No. 1 at Fukushima (see the video below). The hydrogen gas can be vented in smallish doses into the containment building, but if they can't vent it fast enough, it'll explode, which is exactly what happened at reactor No. 1. Keep in mind, this is not a nuclear reaction, but a simple chemical explosion that often (as in this case) results in little or no radioactive material being leaked into the outside world.</p>\n<p>TEPCO has announced that after the explosion, radiation levels in the area around the plant were still within \"normal\" parameters. This is an important distinction--not to say that a hydrogen explosion at a nuclear plant is particularly fun news, but it is not nearly as panic-inducing as a meltdown. </p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"525\" height=\"424\" src=\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The problem with a full meltdown is that it's usually the end result of a whole boatload of other chaos--explosions, fires, general destruction. Even at Chernobyl, which (unbelievably, in retrospect) had <em>no containment building at all</em>, the damage was caused mostly by the destruction of the plant by explosion and a graphite fire which allowed the corium to escape to the outside world, not the physical melting of the nuclear core.</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano somewhat hesitatingly confirmed a \"partial\" meltdown. What does that mean? Nobody knows! The <a href=\" York Times notes</a> that a \"partial\" meltdown doesn't actually need to have any melting involved to qualify it as such----it'll be much more informative to find out what's actually going on, rather than relying on a vague blanket term.</p>\n<p>As TEPCO grapples with the damage the earthquake and tsunami did to the nuclear system, there's going to be lots of news--there could be more explosions, mass evacuations, and more \"meltdowns\" of one kind or another. All we can do is learn about what's going on, think calmly about the situation, and hope that TEPCO can eventually regain control of the plants. </p>\n</div>ScienceFeatureDan Nosowitzearthquakeenergyhow it worksjapanmeltdownnuclear fissionnuclear meltdownnuclear powerpowerTsunamiMon, 14 Mar 2011 21:19:05 +0000Dan Nosowitz52720 at  space is devoid of oxygen, how does the sun burn?\nStrictly speaking, the sun does not burn.

{"text": "Spent Nuclear Fuel a Bigger Threat in U.S. than in Japan\n\nSpent nuclear fuel rods, which have garnered considerable attention since the nuclear plant crisis in Japan, represent an even larger threat in the United States, home of the world's largest collection of radioactive refuse.\n\nThe Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) says that American nuclear reactors have generated about 65,000 metric tons of spent fuel, of which 75% is stored in pools. Storage of the waste in this manner is considered unsafe and vulnerable to attacks and natural disasters, as evidenced by the aftereffects of the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan.\n\n\"Spent fuel storage pools are often housed in buildings no more secure than a car dealership,\" according to an IPS report. \"Instead, these fuel rods should be safely stored in dry, hardened, and sealed storage casks.\"\n\nSealed in metal tubing thinner than a credit card, the rods, if exposed to air, can give off enough radiation to kill a person in a matter of seconds.\n\nThe nuclear waste is spread all around the United States. In Southern California, the spent fuel at the Diablo Canyon nuclear reactors have nearly 2.7 times more radioactivity than the combined total in the spent fuel pools at the four troubled Fukushima reactors. The two Indian Point nuclear reactors 25 miles from New York City have triple the radioactivity of the Fukushima spent fuel pools."}

The beam energy, typically 1000 MeV, is enough for a single proton to smash a target atom into atomic fragments. This so-called spallation process generates large numbers of neutrons (around 20 to 30 per proton) amid the atomic debris. These neutrons are of high value because they can be used to transmute neighboring atoms by neutron capture. Three distinct ADT{sup 2} program elements will be described. These are ADEP - accelerator-driven energy production, ABC - accelerator based conversion (of plutonium) and ATW - accelerator transmutation of waste."}
{"text": "James Lovelock, a father of the modern environmentalist / green movement, is now a strong and outspoken advocate of Nuclear power. In a recent SONE (Supporters of Nuclear Energy) podcast, Lovelock expands on the benefits of Nuclear power and chides the modern green movement for being based so strongly on scaring people about cancer even though today people live longer than ever before and cancer rates (when adjusted for age) continue to decrease.\n\nThe Earth itself, Lovelock says, is actually the left over debris of a giant nuclear explosion. Planets form from the debris of supernovae explosions, where stars, exhausting too much of their nuclear fuel, explode in sudden bursts of energy that outshine galaxies. The uranium and heavy elements the earth is made of was formed from these explosions. The implication being that, to be afraid of 'nuclear' power in general, but for 'the earth, is to ignore the very evolution of the Earth and its natural ties to Nuclear reactions.\n\nLovelock warns that as global warming gets worse, no rational person ought to oppose nuclear power in the face of these global environmental changes. I would argue, in fact, that the modern green movement is largely responsible, to whatever degree it is actually occuring, for global warming, because they elevated a completely irrational fear of nuclear power and thus drove the United States to be almost wholly dependant on oil and coal. It has, in fact, been *illegal* to build a nuclear reactor in this country since the Carter administration. Thus dependance on foreign oil has also funded the murderous dictatorships of the middle east and bred the terrorist that now threaten the western world.\n\n\"I think we need nuclear power, urgently, and soon\" warns Lovelock. What of Nuclear waste? Lovelock laughs in this interview, and says \"I have offered to store nuclear waste in my backyard, because I know that in a proper storage container in a concrete pit there is no danger, and in fact I could run a pipe into the ground to pick up the exceess heat\" Lock notes that these the waste from nuclear power is one of it's greatest benefits because there is so little of it! Think of the invisible mountains, hundreds of cubic miles, of CO2 that is produced from the combustion of fossil fuels, compared to 10's of cubic meters from a nuclear plant.\n\nNatural gas, he notes, though it produces less than half the amount of CO2 through combustion, is often in practice much work because, as a gas, it is piped through lines and industry standards are around 4% for leakage rates, but methane, a primary component of natural gas, is over 25 times worse as a green house gas than CO2 is. The gas that leaks out is worse than burning the original fuel.\n\nAs I expand on in me Nuclear vs Coal essay, new nuclear technologies are even safer and impossible to melt down, and fast breeder reactors can create over 100 times the power existing reactors can, and can be used to consume their own waste. A handful of these kinds of reactors could power the entire United States.\n\nIf you care about the health and well being about yourself and the people on the Earth, nuclear power is the way to go. If you think Global Warming is a big issue than Nuclear power is also the best possible choice. If you want cheap, safe, reliable electricity, Nuclear power is also still the way to go.\n\nNuclear Power vs Coal Power"}
{"text": "This strip is a common misconception. Yes, Fermi did one of his famous orders-of-magnitude calculations to see if the atmosphere would ignite, but it was followed up with very careful calculations afterward--prior to the a-bomb test. The probability of atmospheric ignition was on the order of the probability of causing an atomic blast by scratching your head.\n\nIt's true that Bethe and Compton had worked out the numbers on fusion of nitrogen in the atmosphere a couple years earlier, but the possibility was just barely still live enough that Fermi included it in the betting pool he was running on the yield of the Trinity test. (Mostly as a joke, since of course in that eventuality, it would be rather difficult to collect the pool.)\n\nAnd it's not like there weren't some catastrophic miscalculations in the early days of nuclear weapons.

{"text": "Video Transcript\n\nFor a change of routine, I wanted to do a science experiment today. Back in 1978 I was the lead nuclear engineer on a project in upstate New York, and the company I worked for at that time bought the last nuclear reactor that was ever bought during the first nuclear renaissance. The project was later cancelled, but as part of that, one of the things the vendor [who we bought the reactor from] gave me, was a piece of a nuclear fuel rod. This is a nuclear fuel rod. This is zircoloid. It's the element that's inside of the Fukushima reactors. Now, [in the reactors] these are about twelve feet tall and there are thousands of them inside the Fukushima reactor. This is a simulated pellet of uranium. Now, it's not the real thing; it's plastic. If it were the real thing, and had been operating in Fukushima, I'd be dead by now. These pellets go into these fuel rods, and over four years create a lot of heat. When the reactor shuts down, they remain hot. What I wanted to do today was to show you what happened to zircoloid when it gets hot, as it happened when the water stopped in the Fukushima reactors.\n\nOkay, we've got our experiment set up here, and this is what we plan to achieve. Here's that fuel, that I took that plastic out [of], and we're going to heat it with a torch to simulate the heat that's coming out of the inside. Then we're going to spray water on the outside, and you'll see steam coming off, which represents the steam that's coming out of Fukushima right now. Now, in that steam is also hydrogen gas because the water hits the zircoloid and creates not just steam, but [also] hydrogen gas.\n\nThis is my friend Jim. He's a great neighbor, and he's going to be the acetylene torch person.\n\nOkay, the zircoloid is cherry red. Now I'm going to spray it with water as if it were getting some water in the bottom of the reactor.\n\nWhat we just did was we oxidized the zirconium. You can see it's a different color now. The metal that was quite strong becomes very, very brittle, and we were just able to break pieces off the end of it. Inside of the nuclear reactor, it ran at that temperature for seven to twelve hours. The fuel got brittle, and all those nuclear pellets, then, were allowed to fall out. We just created what went on inside the Fukushima reactor. Note: those rods glowed that hot for twelve hours or more. Now what happens is we've created an oxide. This is zirc oxide now, and it's very, very brittle. I think you can see these sharp edges. The fuel that was inside is now free to fall out, and onto the bed of the nuclear reactor and begin to melt through as is happening right now in Unit 2 at least, and perhaps Unit 3 as well.\n\nThank you for watching. Arnie Gundersen, Fairewinds. We'll do another video in a couple days."}

{"text": "The Struggle for International Control\n\nCommunication Breakdown\n\nEdward Teller, a prominent member of the Manhattan Project, had been working on calculations for a more powerful bomb since his time in Los Alamos. According to his theoretical work, a two-stage bomb in which a fission reaction compressed material to create a secondary fusion reaction would be several hundred times more powerful than a conventional atomic weapon like Little Boy. He envisioned a bomb that used tritium gas, also known as hydrogen-3, to create the fusion reaction. In honor of that gas, he called this new weapon the hydrogen bomb.\n\nFollowing a great deal of discussion among America's political elite - including the USAEC, the Senate and House Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, and the President himself - it was decided that a hydrogen bomb program should begin in earnest.1 There was much resistance to such a weapon but the Soviet threat was a persuasive one. In 1952 the first hydrogen bomb was exploded in the Ivy Mike test on the Eniwetok Atoll. The bomb proved to be nearly 1000 times more powerful than the weapon detonated at Hiroshima.\n\nThe nuclear era was progressing in other arenas as well, and the year 1954 saw the creation of one of the most important pieces of atomic legislation in American history. \"The Atomic Energy Act of 1954,\" an amended version of the 1946 act, was designed to facilitate the communication of atomic technical information.2 The bill encouraged the development of a civilian atomic industry by allowing nuclear-related patents, granted private companies access to certain technical data, and allowed limited sharing of atomic information with foreign nations. The law was a direct result of President Eisenhower's \"Atoms for Peace\" initiative which aided foreign nations in studying peaceful uses for atomic energy.\n\nDespite any surface efforts to create an international climate of open discussion, the Cold War was in full bloom: the Iron Curtain had descended over Eastern Europe, violence had erupted in Asia, and a secret war was raging between clandestine Soviet and American agencies. Ultimately, the level of mistrust between the U.S. and Russia lead to the creation of war plans like Operation Trojan, which dictated the virtual annihilation of large and mid-sized population and industry centers in Soviet-controlled Europe through an aggressive program of nuclear strikes. Hostilities, both violent and political, would continue until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991."}

However, depending on the scenario, a [dirty bomb] explosion could create fear and panic. Making prompt, accurate information available to the public could prevent the panic sought by terrorists.\n\nI would like to point out that there is an alternative to the traditional dirty bomb. Much like how terrorist cells use rat poison and other chemicals to \"dirty\" their shrapnel bombs and make them more lethal, I could also see N Korea trying a similar tactic.

{"text": "India rethinks reliance on nuclear energy\n\nAudio clip: Adobe Flash Player (version 9 or above) is required to play this audio clip. Download the latest version here. You also need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser.\n\n(Photo: Petr Pavlicek/IAEA)\n\nThe disaster at Japan's Fukushima nuclear complex has led India to rethink its increasing reliance on nuclear power. New York Times correspondent Vikas Bajaj tells anchor Marco Werman the demands for power in India are huge and growing, with 40 percent of the population without access to electricity there was an antinuclear protest in Toyko today. The ongoing radiation leaks from the crippled Fukushima plant have caused many around the globe to reconsider nuclear power. That's certainly the case in India. Here's how a group of fifty scientists, academics and activists there put it, \"The Japanese nuclear crisis is a wake up for India.\" The group is calling for a moratorium on new nuclear projects in their country. India's galloping economy is hungry for energy and the government has plans to build many new reactors. The goal is that by 2050 a quarter of the country's energy needs will be covered by nuclear power. That would be up from just 3 percent right now. New York Times correspondent Vikas Bajaj is in Bangalore, India. He says he the Indian government is facing stiff resistance to its nuclear plans.\n\nVikas Bajaj: People are saying let's pause. Let's rethink this. Let's rethink the pace of our redevelopment. Let's think about the size of our development. And figure out if the new reactors that we're building are safe and are safe for Indian conditions. Not just in general.\n\nWerman: Let's focus for a moment on the protest in Jaitapur. That's where India's government essentially took more than 2000 acres of land from local farmers to build 6 nuclear reactors. It would be the biggest nuclear power plant proposed anywhere in the world. What's the latest on that plan and has that turned into a national debate?\n\nBajaj: Yes. That becomes the center point of the debate in the country right now because it is the biggest proposal in the world right now and of course in India. It is also a very large project for a small area. The government says that it's still going to go on. That it's within its rights. It hasn't done anything illegal. But, the number of people coming out against this project suggests that there will have to be some changes. They'll have to be some compromises. Because the local people there are very opposed to it. They don't want this project to happen.\n\nWerman: So you've got the government taking land away from people for these plants, there's also environmental problems. What do you do with nuclear waste and what happens in the event of an accident. There's also the liability issue in India. There's this law that allows nuclear plants that have a failure or some accident to hold the builders of those plants responsible. And in the case of some of these new plants a number of them are being built by American companies like General Electric. How has that played into the debate?\n\nBajaj: Yea, so the American companies at the moment are saying we're not going to enter the Indian market until this liability issue is worked out in our favor. GE doesn't want to be held liable for any accident that occurs down the road. You know, you take the example of what happened in Japan, if the Indian liability law was in practice in Japan GE which built those reactors that are now in trouble would be responsible for paying damages to the people of Japan. If it is found, you know, that some fault of the GE technology was responsible for the catastrophe. GE is at the moment staying away from India. They really want to be here but at the same time they want the liability laws changed.\n\nWerman: India is no doubt a major emerging power with huge energy needs. I'm just wondering if you could quantify what those needs are going to be and is there any alternative to nuclear power to satisfying those needs?\n\nBajaj: There is wind. There's biomass. There's solar. There's hydropower. India's already a big user of hydropower. About 20 percent of its power comes from dams. One stark statistic that stands out is that 40 percent of Indian people, mostly living in the villages do not have electricity connection. So they are reliant on kerosene for lighting, for instance, or to cook their food. It's not just a question of building power plants but you also have to string the wire to every home and every hut before you can sort of address that 40 percent.\n\nWerman: Well, Vikas, we'll leave it there. Vikas Bajaj the New York Times correspondent in India. Thank you very much."}
{"text": "The earliest detonation of a Soviet atomic bomb, codenamed First Lightning, occurred at the Semipalatinsk Test Site on August 29, 1949, barely four years after the horrors at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. During the remainder of the Cold War, the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Polygon, an area covering 18,500 square kilometers on the steppe of northeast Kazakhstan, was the center of the Soviets' secret testing program. In all, over four hundred atmospheric and underground nuclear detonations were carried out there over a period of forty years.\n\nLocals were used as guinea pigs to test the effects of radiation on human populations. Doctor Nailya Chaizhunusova from the Scientific Research Institute of Radiation, Medicine, and Ecology tells me, \"The army experimented on civilians. They would move people close to the test sites, leave a hundred people in the village, give a test group 200 grams of vodka to drink, and monitor their health after they detonated a nuclear weapon.\" The military prohibited doctors from attributing the sharp rise in illnesses and deaths from cancer, leukemia, and radiation exposure in the region to the nuclear tests."}

Whether this is possible given the apparent utility of nuclear weapons for (hypothesized) deterrence or would affect the likelihood of war waged with other weapons is unclear.\n\nAfter the fall of the USSR, the republics of Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan surrendered the Soviet nuclear weapons stationed on their territory to Russia. Many nonproliferation and disarmament treaties have been signed as well, which have helped the cause to some extent. However, the only country that has ever fully dismantled its nuclear arsenal is South Africa."}

XD\n\nNo, for a start they are using two different isotopes of hydrogen (H2 and H3), when they are fused tgether, they form an isotope of helium (that rapidly decays back to hydrogen) and emits a neutron and energy.\n\ni don't know how it works in Quebec, but at least submerging areas from time to time limits the pollution to one specific area, and that is important because the reason why coal and oil are a pain is because the pollution\npollutes a much wider area...\n\nNuclear wastes are a pain too, but i think it's fission is still worth it until we master fusion (and then we should stop fission plants asap )\nIt was voluntary... it just wasn't voluntary to be France. But whatever. :3 I didn't really have an opinion on nuclear power before, except slight support, but after that - okay, and a few arguments in debates for Ontario nuclear plants - I support them.\n\nActually the best way to get rid of nuclear waste is to store it.\nAfter about 100-50 years, it's now safe to handle since the most energetic parts have decayed, and the long-term radiants can be easily handled and resused. In fact, you get some DAMN useful exotic compounds after having let witches brew of chemicals be exposed to hard-rad for a century.\n\nAnother way is to actually store a large amount of the waste together, that way it chain-reacts [You'd need an impressive cryogenic cooling system though, otherwise you can say hello to Mr. Meltdown] and rapidly decays.\n\nPractical fusion is the fusing of a Tritium and Deuterium hydrogen nuclei. [Since they will be stripped of their electrons as they're turned into a postively charged plasma] Directly trying to fuse single hydrogen nuclei would require conditions that are simply not possible with human technology.\n\nOkay , what i meant by saying that our powerplants use water , i meant that the only thing it use it water. No Coal , No Nuclear product.\n\nThe river goes in a barrage that containt an certain amounts of tubines ,who pushed by the speed of the water comming from the river and it pressure, making the turbine spinning and use this energy to make electricity."}

So far there hasn't been a \"real\" meltdown and there is an ever increasing likelihood that there will be one or rather somewhere between 4 and 6 of them.

If an accelerator beam hits into a target, it can spray neutrons into a cloud, called neutron skyshine for example. What happens to these neutrons that float around?\n\nMy guess would be that they float around until they beta decay into a proton and an electron. What happens to these protons and electrons?\n\nSome neutrons may hit other nuclei and produce some radioactive isotopes. The majority decays into protons and electrons. The protons eventually capture an electron and become hydrogen atoms that diffuse away. The quantities of hydrogen are so minute that they are undetectable.\n\nDepends what materials are around them, to some extent. They bounce around and loose their KE to the nucleii they bounce into. Bodies that bump into like-masses transfer the greatest magnitudes of energy, so water, or fully saturated hydrocarbons like polyethylene, will slow down the neutrons until they become 'thermal' the quickest. This process is called 'moderation'. Usually, the neutrons will then just float around, like hydrogen in a sponge, until a nucleus absorbs the thermal neutron and undergoes 'activation'.\n\n'Activation' products are [obviously] more neutron-heavy that they were before, so usually decay by electron emission, leaving behind the proton and causing that nucleus to transform into the next element up. Some nucleii will absorb thermal neutrons so readily that effectively none will remain in a very short period of time after moderation.\n\nHowever, they may also moderate into other materials that do not readily absorb neutrons, and those neutrons would then decay with a half-life of around 20 mins into a hydrogen atom. This can get pretty serious for nuclear reactors because what effectively happens, with enough neutrons, is that surrounding metals such as stainless steel exposed to neutron flux will become 'sponge-like' - filled with interstitial hydrogen which embrittles the metal."}

{"text": "Is this the future of nuclear power???\n\nThe problem with nuclear power is that it comes with an unpleasant side-effect: highly radioactive waste material that will still be dangerous in thousands, if not millions, of years. But what if we could build a reactor that ran on nuclear waste \u2013 a reactor that generated power by cleaning up the most toxic substance in existence?\n\nTucked among the fertile vineyards of central California is a machine that promises to do just that. Today, work officially finishes on the National Ignition Facility, ahead of its official opening in May. As we reported earlier this year, the NIF contains the most powerful laser in history, a billion-pound machine in a building the size of three football pitches.\n\nThe aim is to split the laser into 192 separate beams, then focus them on a speck of fuel little bigger than a pinhead. The resulting temperatures and pressures will be millions and billions times greater than those on Earth, triggering the start of a fusion reaction. This will allow researchers to peer into the hearts of planets and stars \u2013 but it also has a more practical application, which has nuclear scientists salivating.\n\nBy using hydrogen as its fuel, the NIF should become the first fusion machine that gives off more energy than is needed to trigger the reaction. But there is a problem: due to the enormous energies involved (1,000 times the amount produced by America's national grid), the laser can only fire once every three hours. For a commercial fusion power station, that would need to be 10 times a second.\n\nSo far, so disappointing. But the scientists at the NIF have a crafty solution. Rather than creating a pure fusion reaction, they plan to combine their technology with a traditional nuclear fission reactor, which would require the laser to fire at a far lower frequency.\n\n\"Using the laser to trigger nuclear fusion and drive a fission reaction means we can deliver the benefits of fusion to the utility companies far sooner,\" explains Ed Moses, director of the NIF. \"We will be getting energy from both the fission reaction and the fusion reaction, so for each kilo of fuel used in a traditional fission reaction, we will get about 20 times more energy.\"\n\nNuclear fission occurs when heavy atoms such as uranium or plutonium split into smaller, lighter atoms, releasing neutrons and energy. The neutrons released trigger fission in nearby atoms, setting off a cascade: a chain reaction.\n\nNuclear fusion, on the other hand, occurs when two small atoms, typically forms of hydrogen, are heated and compressed together until they fuse to form a heavier atom, releasing large numbers of neutrons and vast amounts of energy.\n\nUnder the NIF's plan, the neutrons that power the fission would come from the laser-triggered fusion reaction: a \"fission fusion\" reactor in which the nuclear fuel is encased in a blanket around the fusion reactor. The team claim they can have a working power station running by 2020.\n\nDr Jeff Wisoff, a former astronaut who is deputy principal associate director of science at the NIF, thinks this type of hybrid energy source could transform the way the world views nuclear energy.\n\n\"This is our vision for a safe, clean and sustainable energy source of the future,\" he says. \"As the source of the neutrons is separate from the nuclear fuel, it becomes highly controllable and it can never go into meltdown by accident.\"\n\nBut there are more advantages to the concept. In nuclear fission, the cascade of neutrons eventually becomes too weak for the fuel to be a viable energy source. The waste, however, continues to undergo radioactive decay, remaining highly dangerous.\n\nYet by using a separate source of neutrons \u2013 taken from the fusion reaction \u2013 the fuel can be burned up almost completely. The NIF claims that spent nuclear fuel, and even weapons-grade plutonium, could be put into the fission blanket and used up over a 50-year period in a highly controllable way"}

Why the world community forbid the Japan after 1945 to have a army for 50 years? Does anyone remember Philippines 1941-42?

This is a relatively minor tweak. Overkill would be removing all the guns from the game; something intrinsic to Fallout's gameplay.\n\nProblem is with such news announcements, all the Japanese will be playing the game with the thought: \"Hmm this grenade launcher used to be called the Fat Man.\" It's not like Japan is totally unaware of what happens in the rest of the world...\n\nIt's kind off like making an antisemitic game where you have to beat up Jews, then release it in Israel, but change the Jews to baby seals or aliens or whatever. That won't make them approve of the game!

{"text": "01 May, 2007\n\nPressurized Water Reactor (PWR)\n\nPressurized water reactors (PWRs) (also VVER if of Russian design) are generation II nuclear power reactors that use ordinary water under high pressure as coolant and neutron moderator. The primary coolant loop is kept under high pressure to prevent the water from boiling, hence the name. PWRs are one of the most common types of reactors and are widely used all over the world. More than 230 of them are in use to generate electric power, and several hundred more for naval propulsion. They were originally designed by the Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory as a nuclear submarine power plant.The below diagram shows the PWR and its main parts.\n\nThe pressurized water reactor belongs to the light water type: the moderator and coolant are both light water (H2O). It can be seen in the figure that the cooling water circulates in two loops, which are fully seperated from one another.\nThe primary circuit water (dark blue) is continuously kept at a very high pressure and therefore it does not boil even at the high operating temperature. (Hence the name of the type.) Constant pressure is ensured with the aid of the pressurizer (expansion tank). (If pressure falls in the primary circuit, water in the pressurizers is heated up by electric heaters, thus raising the pressure. If pressure increases, colder cooling water is injected to the pressurizer. Since the upper part is steam, pressure will drop.) The primary circuit water transferes its heat to the secondary circuit water in the small tubes of the steam generator, it cooles down and returns to the reactor vessel at a lower temperature.\nSince the secondary circuit pressure is much lower than that of the primary circuit, the secondary circuit water in the steam generator starts to boil (red). The steam goes from here to the turbine, which has high and low pressure stages. When steam leaves the turbine, it becomes liquid again in the condenser, from where it is pumped back to the steam generator after pre-heating.\nNormally, primary and secondary circuit waters cannot mix. In this way it can be achieved that any potentially radioactive material that gets into the primary water should stay in the primary loop and cannot get into the turbine and condenser. This is a barrier to prevent radioactive contamination from getting out.\nIn pressurized water reactors the fuel is usually low (3 to 4 percent) enriched uranium oxide, sometimes uranium and plutonium oxide mixture (MOX). In today's PWRs the primary pressure is usually 120 to 160 bars, while the outlet temperature of coolant is 300 to 320 \u00b0C. PWR is the most widespread reactor type in the world: they give about 64% of the total power of the presently operating nuclear power plants.\nTwo things are characteristic for the pressurized water reactor (PWR) when compared with other reactor types:\n\nIn a PWR, there are two separate coolant loops (primary and secondary), which are both filled with ordinary water (also called light water). A boiling water reactor, by contrast, has only one coolant loop, while more exotic designs such as breeder reactors use substances other than water (i.e., liquid metal as sodium) for the task.\n\nThe pressure in the primary coolant loop is at typically 15-16 Megapascal, notably higher than in other nuclear reactors. As an effect of this, the gas laws guarantee that only sub-cooled boiling will occur in the primary loop. By contrast, in a boiling water reactor the primary coolant is allowed to boil and it feeds the turbine directly without the use of a secondary loop.\n\nCoolant\nOrdinary water is used as primary coolant in a PWR and flows through the reactor at a temperature of roughly 315 \u00b0C (600 \u00b0F). The water remains liquid despite the high temperature due to the high pressure in the primary coolant loop (usually around 2200 psig [15 MPa, 150 atm]). The primary coolant loop is used to heat water in a secondary circuit that becomes saturated steam (in most designs 900 psia [6.2 MPa, 60 atm], 275 \u00b0C [530 \u00b0F]) for use in the steam turbine. Moderator\nPressurized water reactors, like thermal reactor designs, require the fast fission neutrons in the reactor to be slowed down (a process called moderation) in order to sustain its chain reaction. In PWRs the coolant water is used as a moderator by letting the neutrons undergo multiple collisions with light hydrogen atoms in the water, losing speed in the process. This \"moderating\" of neutrons will happen more often when the water is more dense (more collisions will occur). The use of water as a moderator is an important safety feature of PWRs, as any increase in temperature causes the water to expand and become less dense; thereby reducing the extent to which neutrons are slowed down and hence reducing the reactivity in the reactor. Therefore, if reactor activity increases beyond normal, the reduced moderation of neutrons will cause the chain reaction to slow down, producing less heat. This property, known as the negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, makes PWR reactors very stable. FuelThe uranium used in PWR fuel is usually enriched several percent in 235U. After enrichment the uranium dioxide (UO2) powder is fired in a high-temperature, sintering furnace to create hard, ceramic pellets of enriched uranium dioxide. The cylindrical pellets are then put into tubes of a corrosion-resistant zirconium metal alloy (Zircaloy) which are backfilled with helium to aid heat conduction and detect leakages. The finished fuel rods are grouped in fuel assemblies, called fuel bundles, that are then used to build the core of the reactor. As a safety measure PWR designs do not contain enough fissile uranium to sustain a prompt critical chain reaction (i.e, substained only by prompt neutron). Avoiding prompt criticality is important as a prompt critical chain reaction could very rapidly produce enough energy to damage or even melt the reactor (as is suspected to have occurred during the accident at the Chernobyl plant). A typical PWR has fuel assemblies of 200 to 300 rods each, and a large reactor would have about 150-250 such assemblies with 80-100 tonnes of uranium in all. Generally, the fuel bundles consist of fuel rods bundled 14x14 to 17x17. A PWR produces on the order of 900 to 1500 MWe. PWR fuel bundles are about 4 meters in length.Refuelings for most commercial PWRs is on an 18-24 month cycle. Approximately one third of the core is replaced each refueling. ControlGenerally, reactor power can be viewed as following steam (turbine) demand due to the reactivity feedback of the temperature change caused by increased or decreased steam flow. Boron and control rods are used to maintain primary system temperature at the desired point. In order to decrease power, the operator throttles shut turbine inlet valves. This would result in less steam being drawn from the steam generators. This results in the primary loop increasing in temperature. The higher temperature causes the reactor to fission less and decrease in power. The operator could then add boric acid and/or insert control rods to decrease temperature to the desired point.\nReactivity adjustments to maintain 100% power as the fuel is burned up in most commercial PWR's is normally controlled by varying the concentration of boric acid dissolved in the primary reactor coolant. The boron readily absorbs neutrons and increasing or decreasing its concentration in the reactor coolant will therefore affect the neutron activity correspondingly. An entire control system involving high pressure pumps (usually called the charging and letdown system) is required to remove water from the high pressure primary loop and re-inject the water back in with differing concentrations of boric acid. The reactor control rods, inserted through the top directly into the fuel bundles, are normally only used for power changes. In contrast, BWRs have no boron in the reactor coolant and control the reactor power by adjusting the reactor coolant flow rate.Due to design and fuel enrichment differences, naval nuclear reactors do not use boric acid. Advantages\n\nPWR reactors are very stable due to their tendency to produce less power as temperatures increase, this makes the reactor easier to operate from a stability standpoint.\n\nPWR reactors can be operated with a core containing less fissile material than is required for them to go prompt critical. This significantly reduces the chance that the reactor will run out of control and makes PWR designs relatively safe from criticality accidents.\n\nBecause PWR reactors use enriched uranium as fuel they can use ordinary water as a moderator rather than the much more expensive heavy water.\n\nPWR turbine cycle loop is separate from the primary loop, so the water in the secondary loop is not contaminated by radioactive materials.\n\nThe reactor has high power density.\n\nThe reactor responds to supply more power when the load increases.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nThe coolant water must be heavily pressurized to remain liquid at high temperatures. This requires high strength piping and a heavy pressure vessel and hence increases construction costs. The higher pressure can increase the consequences of a Loss of Coolant Accident.\n\nMost pressurized water reactors cannot be refueled while operating. This decreases the availability of the reactor- it has to go offline for comparably long periods of time (some weeks).\n\nThe high temperature water coolant with boric acid dissolved in it is corrosive to carbon steel (but not stainless steel), this can result in radioactive corrosion products to circulate in the primary coolant loop. This not only limits the lifetime of the reactor, but the systems that filter out the corrosion products and adjust the boric acid concentration add significantly to the overall cost of the reactor and radiation exposure.\n\nWater absorbs neutrons making it necessary to enrich the uranium fuel, which increases the costs of fuel production. If heavy water is used it is possible to operate the reactor with natural uranium, but the production of heavy water requires large amounts of energy and is hence expensive.\n\nBecause water acts as a neutron moderator it is not possible to build a fast neutron reactor with a PWR design. For this reason it is not possible to build a fast breeder reactor with water coolant.\n\nBecause the reactor produces energy more slowly at higher temperatures, a sudden cooling of the reactor coolant could increase power production until safety systems shut down the reactor."}

{"text": "A guy was seated next to a 10-year-old girl on an airplane. Being bored, he turned to the girl and said, \"Let's talk. I've heard that flights go quicker if you strike up a conversation with your fellow passenger.\"\n\nThe little girl, who in true Lisbeth Salander fashion was reading a book about quantum physics, closed it slowly and said to the guy, \"What would you like to talk about?\"\n\nOh, I don't know,\" said the guy. \"How about nuclear power?\"\n\n\"OK,\" she said. \"That could be an interesting topic. But let me ask you a question first. A horse, a cow and a deer all eat the same stuff... grass. Yet a deer excretes little pellets, while a cow turns out a flat patty, and a horse produces clumps of dried grass. Why do you suppose that is?\"\n\nThe guy thought about it and said, \"Hmmm, I have no idea.\"\n\nTo which the girl replied, \"Do you really feel qualified to discuss nuclear power when you don't know shit?\"\n\nAs funny as that joke is, it describes exactly the position most of us are in when it comes to our personal health. That includes doctors, nurses and almost everyone else connected to health care with the aberrational exception of those individuals who take a personal interest in the subject. It also includes everyone in the nuclear industry.\n\nMost of you actually know more about nuclear power than you do about the most important internal functions your body carries out \u2013 respiration, digestion and excretion. Of the three, digestion is somewhat better known. But to truly understand digestion and even respiration, you need to know about excretion \u2013 taking a dump, pitching a loaf, first.\n\nEveryone knows that different makes and models of cars have varying amounts of available power. Sports cars are well known to be more powerful than the mundane sedans owned by the average commuter. What people generally don't know is where that extra power comes from when you consider we're all using the same fuel.\n\nYes you can have a bigger engine but modern technology has shown that even small engines can produce prodigious amounts of power.\n\nOne of the important ways of producing that power is by fast, efficient removal of spent gases from inside the engine. Once a spark plug has fired, the smoke that's left has to be removed or the next spark will falter or die because the combustion chamber (stomach) is contaminated. If that happens often enough then the engine will sputter and quit. The way the engine cylinder is cleaned after the spark plug burns the gas is with the use of the exhaust system. Exhaust systems on performance cars are designed to extract spent (burned) gases and get rid of the wastes very quickly. The next fuel charge then burns more cleanly and generates smooth predictable power.\n\nThe human body and indeed all animate living creatures operate on exactly the same principle \u2013 food in, garbage out. If there is any impediment or delay, there are negative consequences.\n\nWhen I was five years old, I remember walking along Eglinton Avenue on my way to kindergarten. The road was bumpy and the brick bed of the streetcar tracks was bumpier. Cars and trucks driving by made all sorts of noises. I wondered what cars or trucks would sound like if there were nothing wrong with them. When I was older and starting to learn to rebuild engines (in my driveway) it was obvious that I wouldn't get far unless I knew exactly which parts were in fact the engine and which weren't. In other words in order to fix something, you have to know exactly what it's supposed to look like when there isn't anything wrong with it.\n\nNo doubt you've all taken a look at the contents of your toilet bowl after taking a dump. More than likely it was brown and an evil smell. What you see there is not what your shit is supposed to look like if you're eating a typical North American diet.\n\nThe first thing to clear up is what a healthy shit smells like. For one thing, a healthy turd doesn't smell much at all. In fact if your shit stinks, you my friend are not only eating the wrong food, you're also setting yourself up for some nasty future ill health consequences.\n\nYou don't believe me do you? Well think of this \u2013 when you walk through the woods on a hot summer day, what do you smell? Unless there's a garbage dump nearby you smell the fresh clean earth, the trees, flowers, pine needles and so on. What you don't smell is the fact that every animal, insect and bird has been shitting in those woods since time began. There are no toilets and most of those creatures don't bother to bury their scats.\n\nSo why doesn't all that shit stink? Well when it first comes out there is a bit of an odor. But it doesn't last because wild animals aren't walking, flying or crawling around with their shit rotting inside them like people do. Wildlife eats what it's supposed to eat. What they eat is in natural balance. People, other than aboriginals, eat food that isn't real food that is way out of balance and generally in quantities that don't match our energy outputs. To make matters worse, the chemicals we consume make our shit stink even fouler and hang around a lot longer because it's so full of preservatives. Not only is our shit not good for us, it's the worst sort of shit for the environment of any species on the planet. For that reason it's a terrible fertilizer.\n\nOther than the foul odour in your toilet, most often you have a turd or a collection of same that are log shaped, curved if long enough, solid looking and sort of smooth with cracks and sections that roughly mirror the walls of your colon. Sometimes you get round ones and odd shaped ones. The colour can be any shade of brown imaginable and maybe several at once. Yellow, pink, orange and black are fairly common depending on how much of what you ate. Sometimes the food you ate passed right through you without change. Corn kernels commonly do that when they aren't chewed properly.\n\nThe consistency of those ghastly little (all the way to humungous) shits feel anything from rocklike to water if you have diarrhea. Some are small and take so long to drop into the bowl that washrooms are often the family library. Others are so wide you end up with hemorrhoids.\n\nNone of that is normal or healthy. A normal turd takes no more than seven seconds to pass and usually less than a second.\n\nA healthy turd is soft fibrous and does not float. It disintegrates easily in the toilet bowl. It will still be brown. Or orange, or pink. If you eat a lot of watermelon or oranges and nothing else, chances are that's what colour your shit will be. That happens because your shit is so fibrous and voluminous that your body expels it before it's fully digested so it retains some of the original colour.\n\nIf the food has time to digest properly, the turd ends up brown because that's what colour bile turns it. Dead shit is black or dark brown, slimy, looks like and looks like it has the consistency of a truck tire. We'll talk about the digestion process in another chapter.\n\nAnyway, for a turd to be fibrous it has to have travelled the length of your digestive tract quickly enough for the turd not to have been sucked dry of moisture by your colon walls. Fecal matter while in the colon gives up nutrients to the colon walls by releasing moisture. If there's no fiber in your meals, most of the moisture in the feces is lost to digestion causing the turd becomes smooth and hard.\n\nBeing smooth is a big deal for a turd. Fibers are what alert the sparse nerve endings in the colon walls to the fact that there is waste material present that needs to be moved out. If the fibers aren't sticking out of the turd like fuzz, then as far as your colon's concerned, there's nothing in the colon even it's packed solid.\n\nWhen the shit sits in your colon for longer than the few hours it should be there, problems start. The refuse from the next meal bangs into the back of the stalled turd causing a pile-up just like a train wreck. If that doesn't stimulate some action, the pile-up grows with each meal consumed. Luckily colons can stretch. Colons can stretch to hold up to twenty five pounds of dead, poison shit.\n\nOf course twenty five pounds of shit is quite a pile and that pile is part of what constitutes a pot belly. So the next time you look in the mirror and see a pot belly, get used to the idea that a part of that pot is you full of shit. Or better yet, don't get used to it, start eating enough vegetables and fruit to get rid of it.\n\nThe consequences don't end with you carrying a pile of shit around with you for no good reason by any means. Your intestinal tract didn't evolve to carry what amounts to a pile of hard, lethal mud around and in fact when there's too much weight in the colon eventually your guts start to obey the law of gravity and it all starts sliding towards the floor. That in turn causes everything else to be pulled out of place.\n\nIf you're a man, guess what's in the way of all that sinking shit? Your prostate gland. It has the consistency of a marshmallow. And is roughly doughnut shaped. With a few pounds of shit sitting on top of it, it soon looks like a pancake and as you might expect, it stops functioning properly if at all. At that point you're a candidate for prostate cancer. Can I offer you a doughnut?\n\nDid you ever hear that song about the knee bone being attached to the thigh bone and the thigh bone's attached to the hip bone and so on? Well every part of your body is attached to every other part. When your guts start travelling to the center of the earth because you eat too much or eat the wrong things, there's no cell in your body that isn't negatively affected. Blood flow is also affected along with every other flow and neuro-communication that your body needs to perform so that you continue to act like a fully functional person.\n\nAbout John\n\nJohn Newell - Biography\nFrom childhood, my passions continue to be the environment and art expanded to include muscle cars in the sixties because the emerging lifestyle, excitement and the sheer artistry embodied in the muscle car era, reinforced by the music..."}

I think the nature of issue makes it's impossible to deliver a definitive answer.\n\nI think I may see a problem with this technique, if it doesn't decrease atmospheric CO2 the ocean will still be acidifying, atmospheric CO2 would probably be worse if our activities hadn't converted so much land to C4 autotrophs. A catastrophic change to the most important ecosystem on earth could still be falling apart while people continue to pollute believing we have the problem licked. Aha, he gets around to covering that near the end. Moral hazard.\n\n----------\n\nI skimmed through the actual journal article about the 14,000 deaths, and it seems to actually say that 822 are related to fukushima, 1/4 of which are reported as increase over average infant/fetus death rates with 3/4 assumed unreported, guess it's best to look through the source not the fringe news reporting it, nor the others debunking it.\n\nMicrotraders effectively bet on the noise in market prices. You win and lose fractions of a cent at a time, but do this millions of times. Statistically, you lose as much money as you make (seeing as it's nearly random at that level) but securities and hedges absorb their losses, making it a net-win as long as the market is rising.\n\nIt's really quite ingenious, but detractors can imagine millions of scenarios where this comes back to bite you. There was a major dive last fall because of this system's inability to handle things like power glitches, and a human can't possibly hit the panic button fast enough to avoid a runaway selloff. I'd imagine the algorithms are built to expect shit like that, but it's the unexpected that computers aren't able to deal with. In short, it's only as safe as the programmer makes it. If you're a banking firm, do you trust a programmer any more or less than the day trader?\n\nThank you for bringing this to the science thread and not the government thread. This article makes a LOT more sense than the I feel he misinterprets the two famous \"97% of scientists accept ACC\" surveys (which I have written extensively about HERE) and disregards their conclusions and methods, treating them as \"soundbites\" and unable to be understood by the rest of the world. I strongly disagree with this. Each of those papers address the EXACT 'question' which he claims is ambiguous. True, the question of Anthropogenic Climate Change being real (or not) may be ambiguous for laypeople like you, me and Mr. Meyer, but those polled thought long and hard about semantics of the question because the surveyors make absolutely sure they were asking a concise, clear and explicit question. When you get a paper refereed for a scientific journal, you are EXTREMELY careful to only comment on what you have evidence for, as any loose or poorly-worded claim is an open invitation for 30 papers countering your arguments.\n\nMr. Meyer posits intriguing questions, and talks a lot about a few methods that went into this research. However, I don't think we can walk away any wiser from reading this article except for more evidence that laypeople don't know what the hell they're debating. His conclusion is that the experts' advice and recommendations can't be understood? Maybe it's just a call for more surveys of those scientists. Even if they continue to say the exact same thing, I'm sure we'll still have this debate.\n\nA scientist's voter registration or sexuality matters not. It also matters not whether his or her research was funded by the industrialist Koch Brothers or Greenpeace (the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature report, counter-intuitively, was sponsored in part by the Koch Brothers). The scientific method's only job is to look at the theories or measurements, the data, the analysis and the conclusions. As most of us are not climate scientists by trade, the best we can do is to listen to the advice of their consensus. Rest assured, if there were a bullet-proof refutation of anthropogenic climate change or cosmic acceleration, I'd bet the barn that it would make the cover of Nature the very next month.\n\nI am a scientist as well and I wholeheartedly agree with you in theory but but have to disagree with you here because of how easily science can be manipulated and biased. Asking carefully calculated questions and then framing the results in such a way to benefit a particular agenda is done over and over again, especially when a special interest group is involved with funding. This betrays the point of science, as does the falsification of data, but that's an acceptable casualty when a special interest is looking to prove or refute a point critical to its platform.\n\nIt's for this reason (amongst many) that I would love to see critical, independent thinking instilled at a far younger age in schools and for the general public to learn and appreciate how to question much of what we're presented with. Alas marginalizedIn short, it's only as safe as the programmer makes it. If you're a banking firm, do you trust a programmer any more or less than the day trader?\n\nI'm really wondering if anyone asked the programmers how it works. Quite a bit of the mystery there is \"Oooh a computer's doing it! Who knows what's going on in that magic box!?\" But there's no mystery or smoke and mirrors to code and algorithms. Someone came up with an algorithm and a set of parameters and some coders implemented it. It certainly doesn't mean it's a valid or safe way to trade stock, but it's not like they put a computer in the NYSE and it started learning on its own marginalizedI really wouldn't equate global warming with economics. For one, scientists regularly change their models when new valid information is gathered. How often do economists change their predictive models based on new valid information? The climate itself is pretty well understood, as are the effects that mankind is doing to it. What's really changing is how quickly the changes are happening and what sort of changes are occurring.\n\nHonestly, I think global warming is much harder to determine than what is going on with the economy. We shall see if Bad Astronomy can convince me. Can you recommend any particular articles as a primer (hopefully something fairly recent)? EDIT: Actually at this point I would like to see a point for point refutation of the Forbes article I linked. The quality of the response to a high quality counter claim would say a lot about which side is being honest.\n\nAs for the economy, it's not as hard to figure out as you think. It's just that most economists are on the take in one form or another. If you want good info, check out this independent website"}
{"text": "In the meantime there is one technology that could dramatically reduce America's greenhouse-gas emissions\u2014and yet environmentalists are fervently opposed to it. Al Gore doubts it has much potential. But the only cost-effective way we know right now to produce thousands of megawatts of zero-emissions electricity is nuclear power. America, of course, hasn't built a new nuclear plant since Three Mile Island, but that's going to change. Just how many plants are built, and how quickly, will depend in part on how fierce the environmental opposition is. Will Al Gore lead the way?\n\nI remember a Kristof editorial last year with the perfect title: \"Nukes are Green.\" Anyone who calls themselves an environmentalist *should* be in support of nuclear power, and it is unfortunate that it has been met with resistance.\n\nWhile the current age of the plants (Average=35 years) puts them in their max lifetimes (60 years) and a 10 year construction timeline might lead someone to think we've got 5 years left to mess around, the 10 year average construction time is from breaking ground, not the start of the eco protests.\n\nOh, and the last wave of plants to make grid connections was in the mid to late 1980's (Yes, there's that one outlier in 1996). All the people who managed those projects and have the experience to build a commercial reactor are nearing or in retirement. Sure, we could build them again with no help, but waiting and losing that knowledge would be a waste.\n\nI remember that the same luddits who are behind Al Gore, were the same people back in the 1970's who did all they could to kill the domestic nuclear industry. They had rock concerts (No Nukes) and stupid movies (The China Syndrome) full of fearmongering and crock science. Just like today.\n\nWith respect to the costs (read \"subsidies\") of constructing and operating a nuclear power plant, I've seen the \"fact\" asserted that nuclear power is much more expensive than any other form of power. I have no idea if this is true or not, and I'm wondering if anyone here has reliable data (pro or con) regarding the issue. Thoughts?\n\nI've seen the \"fact\" asserted that nuclear power is much more expensive than any other form of power\n\nI'd have to question that. Even if it were true, how much of the \"costs\" come from legal delays and lawsuits by the \"No to power\" crowd? The utilities make money on the plants operation, the plants pay into a trust fund to cover waste disposal (Current estimate has that trust fund containing 100 years of operating costs for Yucca when it opens), they establish and fund a trust fund to pay for decomissioning of the plant. (Maine Yankee's shutdown seems to be showing that trust fund is funded properly.)\n\nThis sounds very similar to the arguent that capital punishment is more expensive than life sentances. Only true because the same people agitating against the death penality on a cost basis are doing everything they can to drive the costs up"}
{"text": "Japan radiation causing tornadoes?\n\nJapan radiation causing tornadoes?\n\nIs it possible? Sorry if it's a dumb question, but can radiation in the jet stream from Japan cause severe weather? Is that possible?\n\nI've been looking at weather radar a lot lately and i've never seen such activity on such a large scale, and it seems rather isolated in the jet stream area. Even though the activity is within the 'tornado alley' area, it just seems like these recent super-cell storms are way bigger than usual.\n\nMods, please move to appropriate sub-forum if in the wrong place, thanks.\n\ncan radiation in the jet stream from Japan cause severe weather? Is that possible?\n\nI don't see how these could be related.\n\nLevels of radiation are very low - they are detectable with sensitive instruments, but it doesn't mean quality of the air is substantially different from the quality of the air in other years.\n\nThen, severe weather is an effect of energy accumulated - in the form of different temperatures and levels of moisture of air masses colliding. No accumulated energy, no thunderstorms, tornadoes, whatever. And this accumulated energy has nothing to do with radiation from Fukushima.\n\nAnd before someone will start to argue that radiation is a form of energy - yes, it is. But we are talking about amounts of energy differing by many, many orders of magnitude.\n\nHowever, it is highly unlikely that the current tornadoes are the result of this particular butterfly (the Fukushima radiation). You would be far more likely to find that the removal of substantial areas of housing and vegatation in the Tsunami zones changed atmospheric conditions in Japan, which in turn could impact on global weather patterns. However, it seems even more likely still that the tornadoes are simply an example of the normal variation of intensity that occurs in all weather patterns. I think you'll find that's why we distinguish weather from climate.\n\nI think that this is rather seriously misunderstanding what the butterfly effect is. A small change to a chaotic system can have very large changes far down the line. But these changes are impossible to predict and unrepeatable. The Fukushima event is far to recent to have had this kind of result, and because of it's low physical energy, it is not likely to have an effect any greater then someone driving a truck cross country.\n\nA butterfly effect is just as likely to prevent bad weather as cause it, and would most likely just moves similar storms to different areas.\n\n============\nAm I correct that radiation doesn't effect the physical behavior of materials much? I think it's mainly chemical reactions and the introduction of heat that are changed.\n\nAm I correct that radiation doesn't effect the physical behavior of materials much? I think it's mainly chemical reactions and the introduction of heat that are changed.\n\nThat's basically right, although it may have some unexpected effects. Ionization may speed up nucleation in clouds, after all that's how cloud chamber works. I remember reading hypothesis that cosmic rays may add ionized paths in atmosphere that facilitate lightning creation during storms. But you need a preexisting specific conditions for these effects to be at workBut it still doesn't follow.\n\n1] If we're tallking about, say, the explosion, then this one is no different from any other large explosion, such as the propane tank that went up here in Toronto a few years ago. Do we start looking for increased tornado activity here?\n\n2] If we're talking about radiation then there's still no plausible connection.\n\nAnd finally,\n\n3] The butterfly effect is not description of a creation of weather events like tornadoes. It is a description of the nature by which they might change.\n\nAs per chaos, if you could roll back a day and run it forward again, you'd see a different pattern of weather - one town might get missed by a tornado, another might get hit, or one might even form where it would not have before - but you wouldn't see a dramatic increase in the number of tornadoes - it just doesn't work like that.\n\nLooking at it from the other side, if we did suddenly observe more tornadoes occurring in the area, we could not look to the butterfly effect as the cause of them."}

I don't want to get too much into nuclear chemistry (though I can do that too if you guys want), but basically, nuclear reactors have something called control rods, which can be used to retard the rate of a nuclear reaction when they are inserted into a reactor (you can think of it as them blocking the exchange of nuclear particles). Due to a technical oversight (a pretty damn big one), when the control rods protocol at Chernobyl was initiated, it would displace a small amount of water from the reactor before inserting the control rods. This turned out to be more important than you might think, because by displacing the coolant they ended up temporarily increasing the rate of nuclear exchange, causing a spike in power production.\n\nThe experiment involved testing to see whether, if the reactor core were to overheat, the momentum of the precessing steam turbines would be able to provide enough electricity to maintain power to coolant pumps long enough for auxilary diesel generators to come online. At the end of the experiment (which dangerously overheated the nuclear reactor), all the available control rods were inserted into the reactor.\n\nThe reaction rate spiked. The reactor core overheated.\n\nThar she blows.\n\nThank you for subscribing to Chernobyl FactsTM . If you would like to hear more facts, please reply to this post.

It hasn't run to the surface since the 60's though. The water table has dropped since they now pump water out. But I don't think it'd be very confusing why the the previous civilization built a large city there. You've got a giant dam which provided plenty of water and electricity.\n\nA lot of other major dams have large cities associated with them as well. Look at Aswan. A nothing garrison point and quarry town on the Nile for thousands of years. Egypt builds a massive dam south of it in 1970 and boom; a major city with three hundred thousand people living in it.\n\nThey'd probably come up with something like, \"Clearly, this means the region once known as Nevada used to have much more water. Perhaps this dehydration could point to the reason for the collapse of the Vegasian civilization.\"\n\nImagine, you are an explorer walking through a desert under the boiling hot sun. You are tired, thirsty, hungry, you feel like there is no hope for you to corss this evil desert. And the you see it, slowly rising over the dunes, giant palaces made of glass - so tall that they touch the sky itself. You climb on top of a large dune, and you see before your eyes a magical city made of glass, filled with rich treasures, with great monuments build by the ancient arabic people. Some people say it was the most beautiful city build by men. Some say that these ancient men were so advanced that they could create land on the surface of the water. And all of this right in the middle of a desert. An oasis of lost beauty.\n\nHonestly, stuff like this wouldn't be confusing at all. Humans makes statues of famous humans. It's one of the earliest and most common form of statues. They would think the statues were of famous powerful people or of gods. Even primitive societies can easily understand stuff like this. Imagine if some ancient greeks saw Mount Rushmore. They would immediately think it was a temple to the gods or something. On the other hand, the eiffel tower would make no sense to them. Here's a huge structure that is open air so it can't contain anything useful and has no anthromorphic features at all. There are no pictures or writing on it. It's shaped like nothing from nature either. What the heck is it???\n\nLook how they emulated all the architecture from all over the planet. And each building had a large floor with tables and chairs for diplomatic meetings. Obviously this was the political meeting place for a global government.\n\nI could see them viewing it the same way we see Delphi. Delphi was full of treasuries from different city states, basically all wanting to show off their spoils of war and build monuments to outshine the other guy. It was a pretty major hub despite its somewhat solitary location in the mountains, especially since Apollo's oracle was there as well. I always compared it to Hollywood since there was a pretty big celebrity culture there with athletes and such, but I think Las Vegas works well too.\n\nThere's also one in the Kings Island theme park north of Cincinnati. Theme parks themselves would probably leave them scratching their heads, thinking it was some gigantic elaborate test facility or torture complex.\n\n\"And here we have a sample of an ancient monetary token.

I don't know whether there will be more or less fossilization of humans than of other animals because it depends how we die out. Do we die in peat bogs? Are we rapidly covered in layers of sediment? Do we die a sudden death? In some areas our cemeteries will likely tell a tale because of their rigid layout and tombstones in a variety of materials (granite, cement, metal, marble), some of which will survive. The weather conditions and burial customs (caskets, internment in tombs, concrete casements for caskets, etc.) in some areas may mean that some burial grounds are completely destroyed while others remain highly intact.\n\nNot to mention that there is currently a UN organization that is trying to change certain symbols because, while we know what they are, people in the future may misunderstand them.

{"text": "will the new ITER fusion reactor actually work?\n\nwill the new ITER fusion reactor actually work?\n\nI am hopeful that the new large ITER tokamak style fusion reactor will be successful.\n\nAccording to wikipedia:\n\nThe ITER fusion reactor itself has been designed to produce 500 MW of output power for 50 MW of input power, or ten times the amount of energy put in. Hereby the machine is expected to demonstrate the principle of getting more energy out of the fusion process than is used to initiate it, something that has not been achieved with previous fusion reactors. Construction of the facility began in 2008 and first plasma is expected in 2018.[6] When ITER becomes operational it will surpass the Joint European Torus which is the current largest magnetic confinement plasma physics experiment in use. \n\ni would appreciate any comments on the chances of ITER actually producing more energy through fusion than the energy used to initiate fusion.\n\nwhat is it about the design of ITER that leads researchers to predict a net production of energy, whereas other tokamak fusion reactors have as yet failed to pass the break even point?\n\nITER scientists are extremely hopeful and rather confident that it will work as planned, but no one knows for sure until it actually runs. The main difference between ITER and previous tokamaks is that ITER is larger. Experiments on previous tokamaks have shown and theoretical calculations predict that as the tokamak gets larger the energy out increases faster than the energy in. If this pattern continues to hold, ITER will produce more energy than it consumes. There are many complicated details, but that's the big picture.\nBest,\nJim Graber\n\nwill the new ITER fusion reactor actually work?\n\nQuote by Macocio\n\nSo this is like a perpetual 'motion' machine or am I getting it wrong?\n\nNo, perpetual motion machines do not require fuel. This does.\n\nThink of how you would start a fire, you need just a little match, a little flame, and boom your fire is lit. You gave the fuel (paper and wood) a tiny bit of energy and it ignited to give a lot of energy. Fusion is really awful at this concept. So far we have to give massive amounts of energy for the fusion to give us energy back. It would be like having to set off a bomb just to lite your fire placeYes, there are many engineering details to make tokamaks more reliable and more efficient that still need to be discovered and tested. It might not work, but I think that's very unlikely. In my mind, the riskiest part of the whole business is whether taxpayers around the world will keep putting out the big bucks until it is obvious that fusion in general and tokamaks in particular will eventually pay for themselves. At this point, it looks like ITER has enough backing to be completed, but more than ten years to a live-fuel break-even test is a long time in politics.\nBest.\nJim Graber\n\n[QUOTE=northernbear;3074497what is it about the design of ITER that leads researchers to predict a net production of energy, whereas other tokamak fusion reactors have as yet failed to pass the break even point?[/QUOTE]\n\nThe main reason that ITER is expected to have a net energy production while other tokamaks have not is that ITER is simply larger than past tokamaks. Since energy is lost through the surface (which scales as L^2), and energy is produced in the volume(which scales as L^3), scaling up the size of the reactor inevitably improves the ratio of energy produced to energy lost. The attached slide shows how much larger ITER is than past machines, and the impact that this is expected to have on energy loss rates (and hence confinement time).\n\nI would like to ask, where did you get that pdf about the sizes of tokamaks?\n\nI downloaded it several years ago, but can no longer find the link. The entire presentation is very informative. I can't upload it to this forum, because it is too big. Try accessing it here on Google docs:...\n\nIs fusion the only component of a star? Are their other factors comprise a star that are lacking in a terrestrial fusion reactor? What factors combine to make a star explode?\n\nNo expert, but the problem of fusion devices has never been getting fusion to start, but rather how to keep it going.\nIndeed, in the early days of hydrogen bomb research, the summary report about the progress of the fusion reaction was 'icicles are beginning to form'.\nThe ITER is most likely going to join a long list of interesting and useful fusion devices which generate some fusion reactions, perhaps for as long as a few seconds if they are lucky.\nShutting it down will not be a problem, all it would take is a minute air leak to allow the atmosphere to chill the very thin plasma essential for the fusion reaction.\nAs for stellar type explosions, the inside of ITER holds a high class vacuum, not superdense matter crushed by the gravity of a star. It could not explode, although the powerful magnetic fields needed to focus the plasma do put big stresses on the ITER structure.The amount of plasma in the reactor is on the order of a few grams. This will never explode or collapse into a black hole. If the reactor is suddenly shutdown, confinement is lost and the plasma simply impacts the wall of the reactor and cools instantly."}
{"text": "Archives\n\nAdmin\n\nNuclear Fusion Power\n\nThere's a joke in physics that asserts that the time until commercial fusion power generation becomes viable is 15 years - and has been since 1940. Maybe that 15 years is a constant of nature, and like a jogger on a treadmill there's no forward progress despite all the effort in the world.\n\nMaybe, but there's reason for optimism. Unlike the treadmill, there is forward progress being made. But let's step back and ask why we should care. The answer is pretty simple: the world needs more and more power because technological devices need electricity. And especially as China and India develop at great speed, the total number of people using lots of electricity increases dramatically. Right now we get most electricity from fossil fuels. These generate enormous amounts of pollution, and add to the level of CO2 in the air. Renewable power is nice and getting better, but they tend to be rather poor at providing base-load power. Wind and solar farms take up valuable space and fill the local environment. Startup costs are very large.\n\nNuclear power is very promising, but the public tends to be wary of it. Chernobyl is impossible in a modern design and radioactive waste is fairly easily and safely stored, but the stigma is prohibitive. Further, fuel is not incredibly cheap and they require lots of valuable water for cooling. I think nuclear fission is still the best of the currently viable alternatives to fossil fuel, but it's far from perfect.\n\n\nmelting down. It's a physical impossibility.\n\nUnfortunately, those extreme conditions of temperature and pressure are very difficult to achieve. Thus far, it takes much more energy to generate those conditions than it the reactor produces. In the early years of nuclear fusion the reactions required millions of times more energy than they produced. Now it's much less of a hurdle - depending on how optimistic various theoretical considerations are assumed, we might even be within a factor of 2 of true breakeven. Once we reach the level of breakeven, it's possible we will have found a low-cost, safe, and powerful source of abundant energy fueled by the hydrogen found in all water.\n\nITER is the next step in this process. It is expected to operate at several times higher than breakeven, but it's not possible for this design to actually generate electricity. It's just a proof-of concept. Here's hoping it works spectacularly well!\n\n6 responses so far \u2193\n\n\".\"\n\nYou have a bit of disinformation here for some reason. If you know the physics you choose to write about, you are aware that the easiest fusion process to achieve is tritium+deuterium -> helium + neutron + 17.6 MeV.\n\nSince 80% of the mass is helium and only 20% is the neutron, 80% of the energy, i.e. 14.1 MeV of that is carried by the neutron, so in each fusion event of 17.6 MeV, you get 14.1 MeV of neutron energy which can potentially induce radioactivity into the reactor containment vessel or building.\n\nIn fission, an average of about 200 MeV of energy is released in each fission event of which only about 30 MeV is residual radioactivity from fission products.\n\nSo in fission, about 15% of the energy is released as radioactivity, while in fusion of tritium and deuterium it can be anything up to 80%.\n\nNeutron induced activity is a less severe problem in fission reactors than in experimental fusion reactors, because the neutrons are thermalized to low energy (about 0.025 eV ) and don't irradiate the entire reactor structure, whereas the 14.1 MeV fusion neutrons are highly penetrating and do go everywhere, turning structural steel radioactive, etc. This is not 'easily handled'.\n\nMatt here: You're entirely right up until your conclusion. The difference between this and fission processes are the particular radioactive products which tend to be generated. There is no high-level waste, and within a century or so it's decayed down to safe levels. Here's a brief bit of information from the ITER site.\n\n'On.'\n\nTo make a nuclear fusion reactor work at an energy density that gives the gigawatts of power required for economic or meaningful commercial use, you need a massive amount of fuel with an immense pressure, exerted on the plasma by strong magnetic fields which can squeeze the conductive (ionized) plasma.\n\nIf anything goes wrong, you get an explosion. Trying to compress a plasma with magnetic fields is like trying to squeeze and compress an orange with your fingers anyway, which is one reason why fusion has always been a crackpot activity (all hype, no commercially viable success).\n\nMatt: If anything goes wrong, you get a small and contained explosion at worst. The same could be said for a natural gas power plant. The ITER site has more detail about the specific amounts of material involved - it's measured in grams, and a commercial design would likely never be tremendously larger due to your correct assessment of the difficulty of magnetic confinement. It's certainly numerous orders of magnitude less dangerous than a fission meltdown. I have no argument about the difficulty of fusion, it's entirely possible that fusion may never be commercially viable. But it would be folly not to at least do the experiments and find out.\n\nIt is the nuclear fission reactor which is inherently stable, because it has built-in 'fail safe' design. The control rods fall back in and make it sub-critical if power fails. By contrast, if power fails to the electromagnets containing plasma as a thousand atmospheres or more in a fusion reactor, you get a nuclear explosion as a matter of course.\n\nMatt: The explosion is not nuclear, it's thermal. Nuclear reactions would cease the instant the reactor core was damaged, as the delicate balance of confinement and pressure would collapse. Even gigawatts of power only require a very small amount of fuel (ITER produces 500MW and only contains a few grams).\n\nThe more you go into the details, the more stupid nuclear fusion becomes. If you want to use the most easy to achieve fusion reaction, you need to use tritium as well as deuterium, and tritium is exceedingly expensive (it's produced by bombarding lithium with neutrons in a fission reactor).\n\nIf you just want to use just deuterium, the amount of pressure and temperature you need to make the reaction exothermal is far higher, because the reaction has a higher threshold for ignition, like a high activation energy in a chemical reaction.\n\n'The DT fusion reaction creates helium, which is inert and harmless, and neutrons, which can make surrounding materials radioactive for varying amounts of time.'\n\nThis seems to indicate that they are planning to demonstate the concept using DT fusion, using tritium presumably made at great expense in fission reactors. (Which would be extremely expensive, but cheap compared to the cost of trying to extract the tiny amount of natural tritium in seawater.)\n\nThe whole fusion spin industry is a complete fraud and pseudoscience. If you want to promote safe nuclear fusion energy, make do with sunlight and its derivatives.\n\nChernobyl didn't blow up because it was an old design. It blew up because the Soviet RBMK reactor was a stupid design with a massive positive reactivity when the control rods are withdrawn, and the engineers in charge in April 1986 were cowboys, carrying out an unauthorized experiment (to see if the reactor could power its own energency water cooling pumps in the event of losing external electric power), which was obviously dangerous. They switched off the water cooling system, they switched off all the automatic safety systems (which can't be switched off in Western reactor designs when the reactor is in use), then they withdrew most of the control rods. The reactor design was stupid because the control rods were driven by only slow electric motors which couldn't quickly insert them in an emergency. It would take 18 seconds in the RBMK reactor to fully insert the control rods (in Western reactors it takes only 2-3 seconds), and the reactor exploded 40 seconds after the experiment began due to stupidity.\n\nAlso, nuclear fission waste is easy to handle and has been proved safe for 1.7 billion years, which is longer than any other kind of industrial waste has been verified to be safe for!\n\nFission products have been proved to be safely confined with only a few feet migration over a time span of 1.7 billion years, as a result of the intense natural nuclear reactors in concentrated uranium ore seams at Oklo, in Gabon:\n\n\"Once the natural reactors burned themselves out, the highly radioactive waste they generated was held in place deep under Oklo by the granite, sandstone, and clays surrounding the reactors' areas. Plutonium has moved less than 10 feet from where it was formed almost two billion years ago.\"\n\nMatt: I share your enthusiasm for fission, and agree with your assessment of Chernobyl. Fission is a beautiful, safe, and proven technology; one which we should use much more of. Fusion could potentially join or surpass fission someday - if it works. The one thing that separates pseudoscience from science is that science can be tested by experiment. Let's see what happens at ITER and perhaps we'll have the data needed for a definitive conclusion.\n\nMatt replies: It depends on the area and other factors, but believe it or not the nuclear cost-per-kilowatt is pretty competitive. The total cost is huge because the power produced is also large. Wikipedia is not always the most accurate thing in the world, but they have a pretty good and well-cited summary of some specific numbers here.\n\nI do like wind and solar though. I live in a sunny area, and when I buy a house I plan on looking into supplementing my energy needs with solar. The future of electric power will probably not be a magic bullet but instead a combination of technologies.\n\nYour wikipedia reference (I've no problem with wikipedia, if I find what I think is a mistake I'll contribute) refers to commercially deployed installations.\n\nMany of those have been done without the substantial subsidies and insurance guarantees required for nuclear and at lower entry costs.\n\nYou can't have it both ways. If wind (and solar) have low entry costs and are therefore \"insubstantial\" in some way, they can't also have \"startup costs are very large\"\n\nThe market is speaking on this issue, and nuclear is losing.\n\n\"The future of electric power will probably not be a magic bullet but instead a combination of technologies.\"\n\nOf course, but the market says that nuclear's role is small.\n\nMatt replies: It fails to perform in the US market because of massive regulatory hurdles (not that safety regulation is bad!) and public NIMBY opposition. The worldwide situation is more interesting. In France nuclear power accounts for about 80% of total electricity. India currently is conducting a quarter of the world's new reactor construction. Japan and China are both expanding their nuclear power programs. It's quite viable, it's just hideously expensive to get started. The energy market in the US could do it - if it weren't true that the investment might well go to waste because no one will allow the plants to be built anywhere near them. A lot of new reactors are in the preliminary planning stages in the US, but it remains to be seen if they'll actually get anywhere.\n\nFusion, nuclear (fission), wind, and solar share the important detail that a substantial part of the cost is the cost of money. This makes all of them sensitive to interest rates. Nuclear has an additional cost for fuel and dealing with waste, but an actinide burner could fix that and earn a profit.\n\nAt the current cost of capital, it is pretty clear that nuclear is cheaper than solar in the absence of subsidies, with the exception of solar hot water. (Even there, the $5000 capital cost is a bit much for most homeowners, who also have to pay property tax on it.) I don't recall the numbers for wind, but what makes the \"entry costs\" low is that you don't have to install solar or wind power in 1 GW chunks. You may not realize it, but interest rates in the 10 to 14% range played a major role in killing nuclear power at the time of TMI.\n\nThe analysis of fusion power by \"nc\" misses on many points, but the most significant is that slow neutron capture to produce actinides is a much bigger problem than capturing fast neutrons in, say, a lithium blanket to breed t. A MUCH bigger problem.\n\nThe explosion problem is silly. Boilers at regular power plants have been known to explode. That is an engineering problem.\n\nWhere you miss the boat with fusion is in not noticing the differences between the different kinds of breakeven that are involved. Muon catalyzed \"cold\" fusion meets the scientific breakeven point and maybe even the engineering breakeven point, but cannot be commercially viable. ITER claims it might reach the engineering breakeven point (running on its own power) if all goes perfectly, but if you pay attention to what they write, you will see that this is only while it is actually burning. It will likely be well short of this point as a facility when you include costs between burns.\n\nBuilding ITER will mainly answer the question of whether a larger facility can be economical. They don't really know that yet."}

Am I remembering this correctly, or just drunk?\n\nYou are correct. At high enough temperature and pressure, any nucleus lower than iron will combine to make iron and give off energy (after that, they will still combine, but will lose energy). After exhausting hydrogen fuel, a big enough star will then burn its helium, then go up through boron, carbon, oxygen, neon, etc. until it either blows itself apart (switching fuels isn't easy, as the star collapses until the necessary pressure / temperature is reached, blowing of a fair amount of material in the process), or just doesn't get hot enough.\n\nIn the end, after saving itself by burning everything, it's left with iron combining into heavier elements and soaking up energy.\n\nOne common alternative is when a star gets almost to the iron-burning stage, but not quite. If it then arranges to pick up material slowly (as from an orbiting companion star), it will eventually go over the mass limit, and start making iron, blowing up in the process. This is a type II supernova. We can occasionally see these puppies blow up, and then watch them cool off / lose brightness. The nifty thing is, the way they lose brightness confirms that the end result is iron. The half life of the brightness is the same as the half life of an isotope as it decays to iron (don't have the source for which it is, sorry).\n\nYou don't like Castle Bravo? The largest above-ground US nuclear test! The origin of the concept of the 'unexpected fission surplus'.... rather than use a lead tamper around the 'sparkplug', they used U-238. The neutron flux from the fusion reacton caused the U-238 to (AFAIK) turn into Pu239 then quickly fission. (this is what I recall; I may be slightly off) It ended up bigger, and way more fallout-y than anyone expected.\n\nYou missed the point of the neutron bomb - not so much to leave the cities and whatnot, but that for a \"regular\" bomb at a decent distance a buttoned up tank (and the crew inside it) won't be all that effected by the concussive overpressure of the blast.\n\nSure the crew dies of radiation poisoning eventually, but that might take weeks.

{"text": "What is a Nuclear Reactor?\n\nA device that initiates and controls a sustained nuclear chain reaction is known as nuclear reactor. The thermal energy released from nuclear fission is used for generating electricity. Heat energy is also used for moving submarines and aircraft carriers. They are also used to produce medical isotopes for cancer treatment, imaging and for researchpurposes. Many industrial power plants run on nuclear power.\n\nHow Does a Nuclear Reactor Works?\n\nNuclear reactors are a great source of thermal energy. The fuel for the nuclear reactor comprises heavy atoms such uranium-235 or plutonium-239. These atoms are placed inside the reactor vessel along with a small neutron source. Each atom absorb a neutron and undergo nuclear fission. A large amount of energy is generated each time an atom is split. Each heavy nucleus decompose into 2 or more lighter nuclei, releasing kinetic energy, gamma radiation and free neutrons. All these are collectively known as fission products. Enormous heat is expelled out of the turbine with the help of a coolant( such as water). Evaporated coolant reaches the turbine and spin the generator shaft.\n\nWhat Are the Components of a Nuclear Reactor?\n\nFuel: Uranium or Plutonium is the basic fuel. Usually the fuel rods consist of Uranium oxide pellets.\n\nModerator: Moderator is implanted in the core of the reactor. It helps to slow down the neutrons release from fission chain reaction. Heavy water or graphite is commonly used.\n\nControl Rods: These are made with neutron absorbing material such as boron or cadmium. They are used to control the reaction rate.\n\nCoolant: Potable water, heavy water, liquid sodium, or helium is used as coolant. It absorbs heat and passes it to the turbine.\n\nTurbine: It converts heat energy to electricity.\n\nContainment: It is a dome-shaped structure made of steel that separates the reactor from the environment.\n\nCooling Towers: Some amount of heat energy cannot be converted to electricity. Cooling tower is specifically used to absorb this excess heat and convert them to pure water vapor. Later it is released to the atmosphere.\n\nWhat is Fuel Assembly?\n\nMany fuel pins put together form a fuel assembly. Fuel is lifted into and out of the reactor in assemblies. In a PWR reactor(Pressurised Water Reactor), a fuel assembly consists of 179-246 fuel rods. Approximately121-193 fuel assemblies are loaded in each nuclear reactor.The assemblies are packed with structural materials that keeps the pins without touching them. After every 5 years, one third of the assemblies are removed and stored in what are called storage pools. They lose their radioactivity over a period of 10 years. These assemblies are called Spent Nuclear Fuel. When the spent Nuclear fuel is reprocessed, it is known as High Level Waste. A 100MW reactor ends up with a discharge of 2 metric tons of High Level waste.\n\nWhat is Nuclear Full Core?\n\nSeveral hundred of assemblies put together form a full core. A nuclear full core is the part that contains nuclear fuel. This fuel is used to trigger nuclear reactions. Different assemblies can have different fuels. They can vary in their composition and in their age. The core of the nuclear reactor generates thermal power. It contains low-enriched uranium or plutonium, control systems and structural materials. In a boiling water reactor, the nuclear fuel rods are equivalent to the diameter of a large gel type ink-pen, each measuring about 12 feet (3.7 m) long. These fuel rods are grouped in bundles known as \"fuel assemblies\". Each fuel rod contains pellets of uranium, or uranium oxide, and are stacked end to end. The control rods inside the core are filled boron or cadmium which readily capture neutrons. The control rods absorb the neutrons and hence slow down the fission reaction. The absence of control rods intensify the chain reaction. An alternative nuclear fuel like fissile uranium-233 (U-233) made by the neutron-bombardment of the common thorium-232 can also be used.\n\nWhat Are the Different Types of Nuclear Reactors?\n\nThere are about six types of nuclear reactors. Each vary in terms of fuels and coolants used.\n\nWhat Are the Recent Nuclear Reactor Disasters?\n\nFukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant Disaster is one of the largest man-made hazards in recent years. It occured on 11th March 2011 in Japan. The disaster involved nuclear meltdowns, equipment failures, and release of radioactive materials at the Fukushima nuclear plant. It happpened due to tsunami and earthquake. This is the largest nuclear accident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.\n\nThe Chernobyl disaster occurred in 1986 in Ukraine. An explosion released large quantities of radioactive materials to the atmosphere. Around 9,85,000 people died of cancer between 1986 and 2004 due to this disaster."}

{"text": "Answer to Question #435 Submitted to \"Ask the Experts\"\n\nThe following question was answered by an expert in the appropriate field:\n\nQ\n\nWhat is the ALARA principle? The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommends a system for limiting the doses received by persons. What are two features of the system?\n\nA\n\nThere are actually three features in the system of dose limitation recommended by ICRP, namely justification, optimization, and dose limitation. Justification means that any proposed activity that may cause exposure to persons should yield a sufficient benefit to society to justify the risks incurred by the radiation exposure. This feature is based on the assumption that any radiation exposure, no matter how small, carries with it a certain level of risk that is proportional to the level of exposure. This hypothesis is known as the linear, non-threshold hypothesis, or LNT. An example of an activity that was considered unjustified was the now-discontinued practice of fitting shoes to people's feet using x rays. The exposure resulting from this activity was considered to be unjustified, and the practice was discontinued. The second feature, or element, is optimization, which is also known as the practice of ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable). This means that the radiation exposures resulting from the practice must be reduced to the lowest level possible considering the cost of such a reduction in dose. Optimization, or ALARA, is required by nearly all licensing agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This feature is also based on the LNT. The third element is dose limitation. This involves setting upper limits on the dose that may be received by any member of the public from all man-made exposures other than medical exposures. These limits are imposed by regulatory agencies.\n\nThe system is actually more complicated than that. ICRP recommends that each source of exposure, such as a hospital or reactor site, be constrained to a fraction of the dose limit. For exmple, if the dose limit is 100 mrem/yr for members of the public, then the constraint might be set at 30 mrem/yr. This may be viewed as that site's share of the allotted exposure of 100 mrem/yr to any member of the public, some of whom may be simultaneously exposed to radiations from several facilities. Each site will then optimize its doses as far below 30 mrem/yr as possible, that is, ensure that the doses are ALARA.\n\nIn this system of dose limitation, optimization plays the central role, and dose limits play a very secondary role, mainly as guidance for setting action levels and other operating parameters, and also as a guide for allocating dose to various sources, that is, as a guide in setting constraints.\n\nSami Sherbini Senior Health Physics Advisor, NRC\n\nAnswer posted on 18 October 2000"}

{"text": "This collection of \"dose plots\" or \"survival curves\" starts with it origin at the red \"1\". From it arise three plots, a, b, and c. Plot \"a\" is of the most sensitive critter, while that of \"c\" is of the least sensitive critter.\n\nGame theorists have proven that if you extend asymptotes from the straight portions of the curves back to the vertical axis, where that line crosses indicates the minimum number of lethal hits.\n\nLet's discuss the meaning of that for a moment. It has been shown in battle scenarios that the average soldier is usually shot several times and still doesn't die - although it is plausible that one bullet in just the right place - brain, heart, can kill. Thus the minimum number of hits to be lethal for a soldier is one. On the other hand, if we talk not about bullets but gamma rays, then the minimum number of lethal hits in a human must be much larger for immediate death. Perhaps there are a critical 1,000 cells in the body such that if ALL of them are knocked out - each by a single gamma ray, then the minimum number of lethal hits is 1,000. Thus if you were to irradiate a large population of people with gamma rays and make your dose plot, you would find the extrapolated asymptote crossing the vertical axis at 1,000. (Again, remember that most people will be hit with millions of gamma rays - but most of them would be in inconsequential places.)\n\nThus when you look at this figure, you see that both \"a\" and \"b\" are critters for which the minimum number of lethal hits is one. But for \"c\" the line extrapolates to \"2\", and so that critter requires at least two hits to kill it.\n\nAnother consideration that you can derive from these plots is the LD50 (\"lethal dose for 50%\"; the dose that kills 50% of the critters). For \"a\" the LD50 is about 5. You find this by moving down the red line to where it crosses the horizontal 0.5 line and at that point look down at the bottom to see how many hits that indicates.\n\nFor \"b\" LD50 is about 10, but you run into a problem with \"c\" because its curve doesn't start declining immediately. So, for \"c\", you must go to a straight portion and then determine how many hits it takes to decrease the number to a half. So go down the blue line where it is straight to some convenient place and then measure off how many more hits it takes to drop in half. You should get something like 16 hits."}

{"text": "Nuclear advocates are dismayed that fears over Japan's Fukushima\nplant might kill an industry that has a better safety record than\nvirtually any other. But they ignore the fact that nuclear's\npotential for catastrophe is orders of magnitude greater than any\nof its alternatives. Hence, only when investors are willing to foot\nthe entire bill for its construction and liability can we believe\nthat nuclear is truly safe.\n\nThat, however, is not the case anywhere\u2014least of all in Japan,\nnotes Reason Foundation Senior Analyst Shikha Dalmia in her latest\ncolumn at The Daily. Japan's mercantilist rulers have made\nnuclear a major stepping-stone on Japan's road to energy\nindependence nirvana. As Dalmia notes, the Japanese government has\neffectively privatized the profits of nuclear and socialized the\nrisks. \"It uses taxpayer money to diminish the industry's concern\nwith safety\u2014which government regulations can't restore,\" she\nwrites. \"In 2008, Tokyo actually started offering bigger subsidies\nto communities that agreed to fewer inspectionsuclear power I think can be incredibly competitive, but the\ntechno-stagnation over the past thirty, forty years has been pretty\nbad. Its not just the modern nuclear plant technically that's\nrisky, its the social construct that informs its design.\n\nFor instance, why have a power-station and then worry about\ntransporting and burying the spent fuel somewhere? A power station\nincorporating something like a big PWR -> Hot Re-pro Cell ->\nIFR -> Glass-encasement fuel cycle would not only minimize the\nwaste generated, but allow a plant where nuke-fuel goes in, and\nnothing comes out.\n\nBut with govt. calling the shots, nuclear power isn't going\nanywhere. Here's a pattern worth noting for both space-travel and\nnuclear tech: Once the government figured out how to wring every\nbit of boom out of SNM in bombs (>90% burn-up in a W-87) and get\nthose things to anywhere on the planet (MX, Trident D5) it lost all\ninterest in advancing either technology. Both those 'strategic\ninvestments' and prestige-projects became stagnant PC make-work\n(space shuttle, RRW, NIF) that don't push the envelope anymore. But\nonce all the violent potential is wrung out, the government loses\ninterest. Naturally.\n\n.\n\nLots of the cost of nuclear is involved in preventing the worst\ncase scenarios that are worse than that of other energy sources.\nMuch like airplane travel is safer than car travel, nuclear is\nsafer than other sources of energy because people recognize the\npotential dangers are high and design to minimize them.\n\n\".\"\n\nIt's a perfectly appropriate choice. The 3 Mile Island nuke\nplant is in the US while Chhernobyl is in Russia.\n\nThe safety of US plants built and operated to US standards is\nthe only data set that matters regarding decisions about further US\nnuke power development.\n\nWhat happens in other countries is irelevant. They are going to\ndo what they want to do in the way they want to do it regardless of\nwhat we think about it over here. We have no control over them or\nwhat they do.\n\nI've been in some really nasty earthquakes in Southern\nCalifornia, and I drove by San Onofre last weekend. There are some\nnuclear plants in Northern California too, where the earthquakes\nare even stronger and even more likely.\n\nAny system that's set up to make any commodity as artificially\ncheap as possible through interference is a bad system, and there\nare lots of people in Northern California getting cheap nuclear\nenergy, where the price they're paying isn't compensating the\nlocals for the risks.\n\nThe other point here is that the Japanese problem is due to a\nbroke government looking the other way on even the most reasonable\nregulation (enforcement of reactor lifespan). They made it more\nexpensive to build a newer safer one so instead opted to extend the\nuse of an older one that shoul have been retired. Blaming the\nprivate nuclear industry for that is moronic.\n\nI would be happy to see the nuclear industry cover it's own\nliability, provided the regulations are also based on a fair and\nequiable assessment of the actual risks associated with energy\nindustry. Let's include carbon emissions in that as well.\n\nBullshit fear-mongering bullshit. Liability for nuclear isn't\nthat bad. You want to know what liability for a 50-year nuclear\nplant would be? Average out the total damages caused by them. The\nnumber is relatively small.\n\nThe liability on a 50 year old reactor should be astronomical\ncompared to a new one. The fact that it isn't is a result of\nsubsidies to the insurance business and the fact that building a\nnew reactor is front loaded with liability costs for all the\ngoddamned fear based regulation.\n\nBut they ignore the fact that nuclear's potential for\ncatastrophe is orders of magnitude greater than any of its\nalternatives.\n\nNot really. The worst case scenario with current reactor designs\nis that a particular region suffers marginally higher rates of\ncertain types of cancer. That's really no worse than incidents of\nchemical contamination such as Love Canal.\n\nIt's physically impossible for a nuclear reactor to turn into a\nbomb. Deaths from radiation sickness amoung emergency workers at\nChernobyl are dwarfed by people killed in accidents at oil and gas\nrefineries, coal mines and oil platforms.\n\nUltimately, the cost of Fukushima will be orders of magnitude\nless than the cost of the BP oil spill last year.\n\nThere is no reason for libertarians to defend nuclear power.\nThere is absolutely no way it would exist in the free market. Even\nleaving aside the fact that government invented the technology,\nthere is not an insurance company on earth big enough to handle\nnuclear plants. Nuclear is essentially a wholly government-backed\nindustry managed by corporations.\n\nI don't get the point of the article. Nuclear takes all the\nsubsidies thrown at them and all the disasters have been because of\ngovernment laziness/greed.

And to avoid the fate of Egypt's deposed leader Mubarak, the Saudi royal family knows they have to meet their subjects' demand for energy, both liquid fuels and electricity, into a future beyond peak oil.\n\nBut just like Texans, the Saudis also understand how magically delicious petroleum is from a net energy standpoint, that one barrel of crude can do more work than hundreds of strong laborers.\n\nWhich means the Saudis comprehend what many people in the West who want to get the world off of fossil fuels don't \u2014 oil is so powerful and so handy that no amount of renewable energy will replace the cheap oil we're now starting to lose to keep the global economy chugging along.\n\nOperation Desert Doom\n\nWhat the Oil Sheiks don't seem to understand is their new toy, nuclear power. Otherwise, why would they be so confident that they could just safely deposit all the nuclear waste in a cave under the desert sands of their tiny Gulf neighbor, the United Arab Emirates, following the example of the Scandinavian nations?Comments\n\nIt is shocking that the Saudis believe they will need nuclear energy as a part of their mix of future supplies, considering that they control the largest (though shrinking) reserves of sweet crude in the world, along with what would seem to be virtually unlimited access to solar energy, enough to power the world if it could be distributed. It would seem that they plan to remain 'energy moguls' even after the oil runs out, although it is questionable whether they will have customers at that point.\n\nIt is pretty amazing, RJ. I think they recognize that, at 60 cents a gallon, Saudi drivers are getting addicted to their own crude.

I must have the hands of a 7ft human (according to the article); I use my phone one handed all the time.\n\nI guess it just goes to show: there is no one right size for everyone, a variety of sizes and price ranges is better for the consumer than a very limited one, who woulda thought the economists were ever right?\n\n@imanidiot Re: @proto-robbie\n\nSpeaking from first hand experience (ie, I have both a nuclear power plant AND a crap ton of windmills in my \"back yard\"), I have to agree that the nuclear plant is far less impactful on the aesthetic of the area. Windmills, when installed, have to be everywhere; every ridge of all of the surrounding hills/mountains (highly variable term based on the altitudes that you are used to) has to be covered in the windmills. If you happen to like the hills/mountains or the overall horizon, then, with windmills, you are out of luck.\n\nHaving lived next to two different nuclear plants, I can say; they need not be any more aesthetically unpleasant than any quirky architect's grand design.\n\nRe: Gas?\n\nThe only Nuclear decommissioning I've any personal experience with is the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant in Oregon. It's decommissioning cost is estimated to be roughly $230 million (they still have some non-nuclear related buildings to remove, and of course the spent fuel to continue to store). Construction costs were roughly $500 million.\n\nIt seems that your rough estimate is inverted in this case; decommission costs roughly half of construction.\n\nPlease...\n\nBuild enough Nuclear power plants to supply the world's base-line electric needs + 10%, along with ready-to-go plans for more to keep up with the massive increase in demand that will come with cheap energy. Please build them in my back yard. Everyone who wants to be employed can move here; the few who are concerned about more nuke plants can move away (we've already got one).\n\nThen everyone can stop debating about it and get on with the leap in progress that more energy could (and has) provided us.\n\nRe: Worrying...\n\nIt is quite possible that any/all of the data \"leaked\" was either already publicly available, or, worst case, easily obtainable with a FOIA request. If either or both of those is the case, then why worry about the data stolen?\n\nDoesn't make any sense at all...\n\nLooking at both Dell's unrealistically weak example spec and the author's dream spec, it strikes me that, for the price, you'd be way better off just buying desktop machines. Dell's spec is silly, but obviously intended for a single person, but, for $2700, you could set up a much better desktop pc than the spec they provided. As for the author's; it looks like it is meant for 2 workstations, so, if we take the $34000 budget and split it into 2 we get two $17000 workstations; the listed spec is pretty weak compared to what you could set up with $17000 for a desktop machine.\n\nProbable Cause (as legally defined in the US) and Reasonable Suspicion (as legally defined in the UK and US) are not the same; Reasonable Suspicion is a much weaker test: with Reasonable Suspicion you need only have some explanation of why something is probably amiss (for example, someone in a dark ally looking like they are trying to hide something), whereas with Probable Cause you actually need proof that something is amiss (for example you saw that they are trying to hide a baggy of white stuff).\n\nGiven that, it appears that, legally at least, the treaty IS actually one sided: since it is easier to get arrested in the UK it is easier to get extradited from the UK. However, once they get extradited from the UK to the US the Probable Cause part takes over, so it is also easier to get exonerated. This implies that, while there will be more extraditions to the US, there will be more convictions, as a percentage, amongst those extradited to the UK.\n\nnot quite...\n\nAmazon Prime in the US is $79; very close to \u00a349 at Google's reported exchange rate as I write this. Also worth noting; the reason Amazon often does not give this kind of benefit to those outside the US is because the owners of the content do not allow it.\n\nChildren aren't a distraction for telecommuters because...\n\nAnyone with children knows that they will get nothing done if they try to telecommute, therefore they do not telecommute unless they are already sufficiently motivated to not get anything done anyway (regardless of children).\n\nJarhead is ok...\n\nI think devil dog is more entertaining, though. And, of course the perhaps too obvious \"bullet sponge\" is always a great way to identify them, after all, the purpose of US Marines is to eliminate the enemy's ammunition stores, generally by absorbing as much of it as possible, so the Army can roll in and not have to worry about armed opposition.\n\nObviously...\n\nIn the second video the lady is so happy to see her visitor, it must be her other son, who is in a SWAT team... he's always so busy, she's just happy he could come to visit, even if it did have to be during a quick lunch break.\n\nre: Shame\n\nexcept for two niggling problems. The first is kind of obvious; you are speaking only of an average number of heartbeats in a lifetime - any individual, of course, could have more or less. The second tiny (itsy bitsy, really) issue is that your whole premise is total cobblers: mammals do not, in fact, have the same number of heartbeats per lifetime. Humans, for instance, average around 2.21 billion, whereas small dogs average around only 0.53 billion.\n\nreference: \n\nIf you then say \"well, all humans have the same average number of heartbeats per lifetime,\" then I reply with: all humans also have the same average hat size, so wearing a hat that is too big obviously must shorten your lifespan. You should only wear hats that are too small.\n\nRe: Yeah - I wondered about that...\n\nI'd be willing to wager that the law indicates that anyone in the driver's seat cannot text (or less specifically, cannot use an electronic device requiring the use of their hands or the ilk)... and that Google wants an exemption that says that, if that person is not in control of the vehicle (ie; it is a robot car), then they are not bound by such a restriction.\n\nLikely...\n\nGiven that NASA is an American institute, they would be unlikely to wave two fingers at anything, unless they were attempting to indicate a love of peace. For the implied purpose, we (Americans) would be far more likely to employ only a single digit.\n\nSince this article appears to be more for bemusement than for serious enlightenment, I'd say that both the reference to the two finger salutation and the mere facts of the case can be safely ignored in the spirit of enjoyment.\n\nbigger?\n\nWell, there are over 300 million Americans (restricting ourselves to the usage meaning people from the USA), and, it seems to me, growing the usage of wifi from 115 million to 201 million in a \"couple of years\" when that is one of the biggest growing computer related tech areas during those two years doesn't seem unusual, nor does it seem to require any excessive immigration or annexation of a continent.\n\nSure...\n\nIt has \"austere bombing capabilities\" - austere being defined as being capable of destroying undefended and indefensible scrap. Handy, that. You know, just in case the junkyard wars people make a military move - you can get their parts supply chain.\n\nIt seems...\n\nIf you actually need the device to perform your work, then the fastest way would HAVE to be to break it. All of the other ways involve you continuing to be productive, so the company doesn't have to worry about lost time.\n\nThat being said; it is also the riskiest, I think, since you would, most likely, be fired if you were caught, and the likelihood of being caught seems somewhat high.\n\nI couldn't help but notice...\n\nThere is definitely a pessimist vs optimist thing going on with this story. The original interpretations of the report (by other journos) are all squarely in the pessimist camp (oh, woe is me; Australia is in the suck). The author also falls in this camp, though a bit more ambiguously.. but he does imply that, while it is un-exceptional for the situation to be like it is, there are all kinds of people who suck.\n\nI say: around 50% of Australians NEVER make a mistake when dealing with arithmetic, holy shit OMG, Australia kicks ASS!!!!!. What a high rate of perfection!\n\nBatteries like ammo...\n\nSeems like the best solution would be to have magazines with embedded batteries, then, when you need more ammo, you also change the battery at the same time. As long as the Mag holds enough juice to fire all its shells plus enough extra to last for a while, you should be in good shape.\n\nNot forgetting...\n\n\"The hundreds of thousands who died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki as a direct result of nuclear energy?\"\n\nIf we don't forget those, then we also mustn't forget all the people who have died to weapons created using non-nuclear forms of energy as well, right? I'm sure that, even if we restrict ourselves to only fuel-air type bombs, we'd find that petrochemical munitions have a far higher death toll than nuclear...\n\nto the contrary...\n\nAfter reading the description of what a following sea is, it seems to me that, for a space shuttle, which goes at supersonic speeds, the wind is rather likely to be following it at times.... and, in general, fair seas are a nice thing for most space travel thus far (though that part isn't really applicable to the space shuttle).\n\nnot only foreign but...\n\nNo questions asked...\n\nObviously you have not bought a gun from a commercial vendor in the US; if you had you'd know that there are certainly questions asked. If you buy a rifle then that is it; they ask the questions and you answer them, then you can buy. If you are buying a handgun, though, they ask the questions, you answer, then you wait for a while to buy the weapon.\n\nI'me pretty sure...\n\nThat the test itself does not change the legal rights of the \"father\" in question. If he has been the legal father of the child before (and has the right to give consent on behalf of the child), then he will still be, even if the test comes back negative. This, really, is as it should be; this test doesn't test for dad-ness, just genetic father-ness.\n\nI suspect that what appears in the article is kind of a summary, since there are some obvious cases where the mother would not have legal right to give consent for the child (ie adopted children or cases where the father has been granted sole custody), and some of these cases are where this kind of test could be quite beneficial.\n\nNASA\n\ngreat idea... except\n\nthe FEL doesn't fire ions. It uses Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation to deliver it's killign energy... ie. it is not a particle weapon (which could fire ions), but rather an EM energy weapon/LASER.\n\ngarbage and prostitution\n\nGarbage men are not obliged to let strangers fuck them for a few minutes for a relatively large hourly rate.. but neither are prostitutes obliged to virtually swim in shed loads of baby diapers and used tampons for hours at a time for a much more modest hourly rate.\n\nIf the women are not being literally forced (as opposed to \"coerced by economic conditions\") then it is simply a career choice; there are others, but they don't pay as well.\n\nThe same arguement (about economic conditions) applies, literally, to almost all people who do some sort of work. There are those of us who enjoy our work, but, even we, ultimately, would probably do something else (even if ever so slightly different) if it were not that we needed a paycheck.\n\nIndeed, Ms. Bee, would you be trolling these comments being forced to have your mind soiled if it were not that you would like to receive your paycheck? Wouldn't it be better if you could just read them after the most extreme comments were already eliminated?\n\nno iphones on sprint\n\nCurrently the only way (and it is indeed quite new) to get an iphone on Sprint would be to buy one from verizon (with the 2 year contract) then jailbreak it (if the cdma iphones can even be jailbroken yet), unlock it from verizon, then get sprint to activate it.\n\nI guess if you are willing to go that far, Sprint will probably categorize you along with the people who make the minor change to their user agent to look like dumb phones.\n\nmore than 0 wives\n\nI was once informed by someone older (and possibly wiser) than I that the only good number of wives is either none or enough that no one would notice one less than what you have. Any state in between is unacceptable.\n\nLucky gal\n\nIt seems quite fortunate for her that she survived. A bull white-tailed deer in rutt can easily kill someone, and reindeer are generally quite a bit larger; from the description of the event it almost sounds like the bull in question was treating this lady with kid gloves, though of course that could be due to simple understatement. At any rate, I'd say this woman was pretty lucky.\n\nhmmm..\n\nAll things considered, when I really think about it, I think I'd rather someone groping me that enjoyed it over someone who didn't, if I have to be groped by a stranger. Maybe the TSA should seek out homosexual chubby chasers for the enhanced pat downs; then, at least, someone could be enjoying themselves. It would certainly de-stress the situation somewhat."}
{"text": "Description/Abstract\n\nThis paper presents the basics of this model, including what physical conditions could produce a calibration constant shift and what might cause those conditions to arise. The new evidences are discussed and it is shown that the possibility of at-the-electrode recombination cannot be eliminated, in fact prior photographic evidence is shown to be reasonable evidence of this phenomenon. Thus in the absence of definitive data, the conclusion that apparent excess heat arises from a nuclear cause is premature. If the apparent excess heat signal is not representative of a true heat source, but is instead an equipment/method malfunction, integrating the signal is of no value. This paper proposes that is the situation, and will therefore focus on examining the phenomenon of apparent excess enthalpy (sometimes called excess heat). Not addressed will be the myriad of other purported evidences of nuclear reactions. The apparent excess heat claims form the largest block of claims for a nuclear FPHE cause, and the correlation of apparent excess heat with apparent nuclear ash detection is often cited as evidence of the nuclear nature of the FPHE. But confidence in the validity of the apparent excess heat signal is of critical importance in validating a nuclear explanation. If the heat signal is erroneous, any correlation to nuclear ash production must also be erroneous, and the nuclear ash measurements likely spurious. This is a critical realization."}

{"text": "New York man builds nuclear reactor in warehouse, hoping to make the \"holy grail\" of energy production.\n\nMark\nSuppes, a web designer for Gucci, has a unique night job. Suppes is\nworking to harness the power of the sun in a way that can help fuel\nthe world. As the U.S. contemplates\nits nuclear future and other countries around the world look\nto harness nuclear power, the 32-year-old works to build a\nsustainable nuclear reactor in his Brooklyn neighborhood.\n\nSuppes\ntinkers around on his pet project in a warehouse across from\nresidential apartments on a tree-lined street. It is perfectly\nsafe, say experts, and as\nlong as the parts are purchased legitimately, it is all perfectly\nlegal in the U.S.\n\nNuclear fusion doesn't rely on radioactive\nmaterial and would be a clean power source. It does not require\nuranium or plutonium fuel, which are required for nuclear fission\nreactions.\n\nSuppes has used $35,000 of his own funds and\n$4,000 that he received from investors to purchase parts that he\nbought on eBay for the project. According\nto BBCNews,\nSuppes goal is to build a device that produces more energy than it\ntakes to power it; a goal that scientists have been trying to achieve\nfor more than 50 years.\n\n\"I was inspired because I\nbelieved I was looking at a technology that could actually work to\nsolve our energy problems, and I believed it was something that I\ncould at least begin to build,\" Suppes told the BBC.\n\n\"I\nreally started from scratch. I was a web developer. I've always\nbeen interested in this. It's exciting. I've learned so much and\nmastered so many skills that I didn't know about before.\"\n\nSuppes\nuses a bubble detector to pinpoint the energy, which has been hard to\ndetect. The bubble detector is gel-filled. A leftover\nneutron travels through the gel when fusion occurs and a bubble is\ncreated. Suppes recorded an emergence of four bubbles in less\nthan three hours in early June. He believes that he achieved\nfusion at this time.\n\nBill Gates has made plans to collaborate\nwith Toshiba to create\na nuclear reactor that wouldn't need to be refueled for 100\nyears.\n\nSuppes is the 38th independent amateur physicist in the\nworld recognized as creating a working fusion reactor.\n\nComments\n\nThreshold\n\nUsername\n\nPassword\n\nremember me\n\nThis article is over a month old, voting and posting comments is disabled\n\nquote: According to BBC News, Suppes goal is to build a device that produces more energy than it takes to power it; a goal that scientists have been trying to achieve for more than 50 years.\n\nI did some research into this and to produce an actual fusion reaction at the temp of our sun only at stp here on earth... the plasma in the chamber would have to be on the order of 15 trillion degrees. That's because of the ratio of temperature and pressure. The sun is 1.3 million times the size of earth so the pressure at the center of the sun is way higher than we can create here on earth (hence why its been 50 years and no nuclear fusion). So in order to compensate for the lack of pressure we are using increased temperatures. The highest temp plasma weve been able to create is just under a billion degrees (like 900 million) and only for a fraction of a second at that. So if you put the standard temperature and pressure into the equation (I forget its name off the top of my head) and solve for temperature you get a very large 15 trillion some odd degrees.\n\nGranted the break even point will be much lower than that but in order to create enough electricity from the mini sun (what we'll call created break even) you will have to have the reaction sustained for a long time. I say CBE will require a long time because the mini sun will be used to heat water and possibly be surrounded by solar panels (though I dont know if thats really possible since the plasma has to be held away from the walls by huge magnets I dont know where they'd put the solar panels in the thing). So the amount of electricity that has to be created via steam turbines is much greater than the measurable amount given off at that break even point. Meaning they will have to sustain the reaction for months uninterrupted (or aided) to make it viable as an energy source. Right now they can only sustain the reaction for a few seconds and the governments of the world have spent billions of dollars doing it.. this web designer wont do jack squat in his garage.\n\nThe laws of thermodynamics are based on Newtonian physics, which does no always hold up to quantum physics. Pressure is nothing more than the number of instances in which two subatomic particles collide in a nondestructive manner. By thinking outside the box, an inventive and novel way to overcome this temperature requirement will be achieved.\n\nAs a side note, I hate nay sayers to people trying something outside the norm. If we stayed with what the scientific community said was certain, we would still believe the world is flat, that the earth is still the center of the universe and that the sound barrier could never be broken. By looking outside of the box, human kind has found these things to be false; who knows what discoveries lay just beyond the horizon.\n\nquote: If we stayed with what the scientific community said was certain\n\nWrong. The scientific method directly contradicts what you implied to its very core.\n\nquote: Scientific is a picture of a core barrel, which is basically the inside lining of a nuclear fission reactor pressure vessel. It is the structure which holds the fuel in place, and it tends to become fairly hot (radioactive wise) after decades of high neutron exposure. That is why it is glowing with Cerenkov light.\n\nHey Guys, All you educated people with all the letters after your name,think about this. Fusion reaction/energy is working fine right now! {THE SUN} Somehow this got started. It can be duplicated!! Think outside the box!\n\nreminds me of crappy childish LED \"enhanced\" PC fans. So much of nuclear. On the other hand, if somebody wants to waste his (and other suckers) money and time - good luck! But why should we read about such suckers on DT? On a daily basis? Site renaming should be in order. I suggest DTS - DailyTech for Suckers .\n\nBecause this sort of reactor doesn't produce usable amounts of energy. Getting atoms to fuse isn't that hard (well, it's not easy but not out of the reach of an amateur physicist/engineer). It's getting a nuclear reaction that emits more energy than you put into it in the first place. This particular kind of reactor has been scientifically proven to be energy negative, regardless of how much you improve the basic design.\n\nThey're handy to use as a neutron source for various other experiments, but they'll never produce a watt of energy.\n\nWhen you fuse the hydrogen atoms you must do this protected in a magnetic environment that can hold the extreme temp.This is done with the sun by extreme gravity. Figure this problem out and you have your reactor.Good luck.\n\nish, I suppose you might consider costed spent energy different from total energy consumed. It emits more energy than WE put into it to create the process, but the uranium itself is consumed. We are releasing and reforming existing energy in the atom. Just like a hydro electric power plant changes water movement energy into electricity, nuclear fission releases existing energy translating it to another form (our end goal of electricity). We have yet to find the free lunch.\n\nIn terms of making a power plant, it's net energy yield that matters. In a water plant, water moves down, in a wind plant, wind slows down, in a fission plant, matter is lost. Since energy conservation is a rule of the universe to the best of our knowledge, it's useless to talk about what are, to our civilization, the essentially 'free' inputs.\n\nThe specific problem with fusion reactors today is that they all have a substantial, non-free to our civilization input: massive amounts of energy in the form of electrical current. There is only one fusion experiment that has even broken even on the electrical input <= electrical output equation.\n\nThe article doesn't mention what kind of reactor he has built but given the low price point, very slow rate of fusion, and the fact that internet research was sufficient to design and build it the reactor is almost defiantly a Farnsworth Fusor (and before you ask: no, not that Farnsworth but rather the scientist he is named after).\n\nIn other words there is no theoretical model that will allow this reactor to break even. Because of the way it works, even assuming the best conditions and the best fuel, it will always produce less energy than you put into it. Sadly, this Gucci web designer isn't going to be revolutionizing world energy production any time soon.\n\nI do believe it is a Farnsworth, from what I remember reading in a NY-based news thread on this.\n\nAnd those of us that have posted about this thing being harmless are correct. The \"reactor\" doesn't use nuclear fuel, just deuterium, and doesn't generate enough power to even light a single bulb from a string of Christmas lights.\n\nHowever, I'll say right now, that this sounds like a really fun DIY project, and I wish I had enough money to start building one myself. Not to try and make something that actually works, but to enjoy a challenge of seeing how far I get.\n\nIt's not dangerous, at all, yet, because basically what he has doesn't do anything useful. He has a supply of water, and some way of encouraging fusion that has resulted in 4 fusion events. His invention will be useful (and quite dangerous) when he gets to somewhere in the neighborhood of 10^30 fusion events. It wont even pass the background radiation from the solar wind for another few orders of magnitude.\n\nThere was a time, way back in the nineteen-hundred and nineties, when we would read an article about a \"cold fusion scientist\", chuckle a little and toss it in the pile with the stories of alien implant victims and contrail conspiracy theorists. When did we stop calling it cold fusion? Haven't we seen enough clueless reporters stand agog in front of perpetual motion machines to recognize the same old pitch?\n\nI'm sure many of us are trying to violate perfectly good laws of physics on the weekend with wrenches and after-market turbo kits for Honda Civics. And some of us aim higher. But the results are bound to be the same until some things change. Like Planck's constant, for starters.\n\nThis article is misleading, misguided and misplaced. It has bare little to do with technology, except that tech is certainly being employed, though the purpose is fairly pointless. Perhaps someone will discover a great use for this phenomenon through so much 'research', but cold fusion will never generate any more energy than a glass-filled 'dunking bird' novelty toy.\n\nThis isn't called cold fusion because it isn't cold fusion. Words in science have specific meanings. In this case, though the fusion is taking place at essentially room temperature, they individual atoms that are being fused have a lot of energy injected into them and are therefor 'hot'. In actual cold fusion experiments the atoms don't have a large amount of energy and are therefore 'cold'.\n\nThe probability of two cold atoms fusing is close enough to zero that the whole idea of cold fusion is laughed at (though recent research is showing that something is going on that we don't quite understand yet, it almost definitely isn't fusion). The probability of two 'hot' atoms confined by an electric field will fuse is low (too low for net power generation), but not impossibly so. Devices very similar to what this guy built are used as neutron sources for a lot of experiments, there are even companies that specialize in making them for scientific purposes.\n\nquote: cold fusion will never generate any more energy than a glass-filled 'dunking bird' novelty toy.\n\nLol, neither will a nuclear reactor, technically. I think fusion as a power source may actually be viable pretty soon, but from the efforts of people working on magnetic/inertial confinement techniques rather than commendable enthusiasts like this guy.\n\nI rmember those days with fond nostalgia. We also used to laugh at creationism, er intelligent design, umm...whatever they're calling it now. Even in the most belty of Bible belt states evolution was taught as sound scientific theory with not a whiff of mystical creation ideas."}
{"text": "8.26.2008 5:55 AM\n\nGreen Election Issues 101: Nuclear Power\n\nClean Domestic Electricity or a Radioactive Accident Waiting to Happen?\n\nThe first nuclear power plant in the United States was built in Pennsylvania in 1957. The last began construction in 1977, before the Three Mile Island accident, also in Pennsylvania, in 1979 and the devastating Chernobyl meltdown, in the Ukraine, in 1986. Nuclear power plants produce nearly 20% of the nation's electricity at 104 plants, and for the first time in a generation, the industry is trying to build new nuclear reactors \u2014 as many as 19 projects in 15 states.\n\nOpposition to nuclear energy, which has traditionally included environmentalists, focuses on the potential for accidents or terrorist attacks at nuclear reactors, on atomic fission's wartime uses and on the long-lived radioactive waste. Nuclear waste remains dangerous for thousands of years, and there's no attractive way to store or recycle it. Economics is also in play: A new nuclear power plant costs as much as $8 billion to build, roughly four times as much as a coal-fired plant.\n\nProponents, who now include some prominent green thinkers, say that nuclear power's benefits outweigh its costs in an era of global warming. Unlike coal-fired power plants, which produce nearly half of all electricity in the U.S., nuclear power plants operate without producing significant amounts of carbon dioxide or other air pollutants. Supporters answer concerns about safety by pointing to France, which for 50 years has generated more than three-quarters of its electricity from nuclear power with neither serious accidents nor public opposition.\n\nFood for thought: While the greatest untapped energy source in the United States is conservation and efficiency, the nation will need more electricity not only to serve a growing population but also, potentially, to power a new generation of electric cars. Is nuclear part of the answer?\n\nWhat's a President to Do?\n\nThe federal government sets ground rules for the free market. It can make them more or less favorable to nuclear power, it can make subsidies more or less generous and the president can spend political capital developing a national radioactive waste dump, or not.\n\nSen. John McCain's Position on Nuclear Power\n\nMcCain has made expanding nuclear power a central part of his energy platform by calling for the construction of 45 new plants by 2030. Accomplishing that goal would require aggressive government subsidies or policies, perhaps including a global warming cap-and-trade regulation that would increase the cost of coal.\n\nSen. Barack Obama's Position on Nuclear Power\n\nObama always acknowledges the opposition arguments against nuclear power, particularly safety and radioactive waste, but he doesn't oppose the use of nuclear power. When it comes to electricity, however, his energy plan focuses on redistributing cash from the oil and coal industries to renewable, rather than nuclear, energy."}

{"text": "Part 9 \u2013 Fusion Power\n\nThe \"ultimate\" nuclear energy source may well be that from Fusion reactors. I shall assume anyone reading this is at least vaguely familiar with the process of fusion power, so I won't dwell on it too long. If you're not familiar, follow these links to wikipedia here , here and here\n\nThe ITER experimental fusion reactor, with a scientists to scale!\n\n9.1 Benefits of Fusion power\n\nThe key benefits of fusion are that the nuclear waste products from such reactions produce a higher yield of energy per kg of fuel and substantially less nuclear waste, which generally has a relatively short half life. The primary fusion fuels, Deuterium, Tritium (which can be obtained from Lithium subjected to neutron bombardment, easily done in a Fusion reactor core) or hydrogen are all relatively abundant substances, at least compared to the world's limited stockpiles of Uranium or Thorium. In theory nuclear safety should be vastly simplified and the proliferation risks are fairly low (there maybe a slight problem with some countries diverting Tritium or Deuterium into thermo-nuclear bombs, but without the fission primary it will be useless).\n\n9.2 The Deuterium \u2013 Tritium path to Fusion, present progress\n\nAn illustration of the favoured D-T reaction\n\nThe preferred D-T reaction works out like this: D + T \u2192He (3.5 MeV) + 1n (14.1 MeV). Assuming that the Tritium initially came from Lithium, then this yields an energy output of 7.5m kWhth per kg of lithium (Ongena and Van Oost, 2006). By comparison a PWR gets 8,000 kWhe from 30 g's of enriched Uranium fuel, or about 0.8m kWhth per kg of Uranium, i.e. Fusion power yields over 9 times the energy output per kg of fuel.\n\nThere has been considerable progress in fusion research over the last few decades using the Inertial confinement method. JET (Joint European Torus) , using D-T reactions, produced a net positive energy output for some seconds, a major step forward. The current plan now is to take this forward using the ITER magnetic confinement fusion experiment, which is sceduled to come online in 2020. ITER will be capable of sustaining Fusion energy pulses for periods of up to 1,000 seconds, a significant technical step forward it should be said, but still some way from a system capable of running 24/7, and of course doing so commercially. The purpose of ITER is to essentially prove the concept as well as acting as a research tool, which will allow several of the outstanding technical barriers towards a commercial fusion reactor to be overcome. These experiments are expected to continue running until 2035-2040. \n\nThe IFMIF experimental setup, neutrons being supplied by a particle accelerator\n\nIndeed ITER is in fact two projects rolled into one. ITER in France will work on the reactor, while IFMIF in Japan will focus on the issue of materials research. One of the problems that results from the D-T fusion method is the high neutron flux generated. You will recall the diagram above, showing the D-T reaction. You will note, not only that neutron shooting out but the very high kinetic energy attached to it. The result is that any D-T reactor will have a neutron flux at least 100 times that of a similar sized LWR (at around 1\u00d71018 n/m2-s) or about 14-25 times more than a Fast neutron reactor generates (4 \u2013 7 x1018 n/m2-s) . The goal of IFMIF is to develop some new material capable of withstanding these high neutron fluxes, as well as the high radiant heat loads and yet still give a reasonable service life. The smart money is currently on either Tungsten or Molybdenum (both expensive, brittle and difficult to form) or in all likelihood an alloy of either (or both) and possibly Graphite (fire risk).\n\nOf course the critics already have a name for this new material, Unobtainium! As was discussed in the materials section, the sort of material needed to construct a working Fusion reactor, at least one with a decent service life and that's cheap and easy to put together, simply may not exist. We could, I suspect compromise, use a graphite blanket around the core to reduce neutron fluxes with the rest of the reactor built out of a mix of Tungsten alloys, and where possible, ceramics. However, such a reactor would have a number of draw backs. Some exposed parts that can't be shielded (it is integral to the design that they be exposed to the core) and would need to be regularly replaced, eating into capacity factors and making for an expensive operation. Alternatively we could simply build our Fusion plants with a short operating life, say 20 years rather than the current 50 years standard at present for the nuclear industry. Unfortunately, this would obviously depreciate the economics of Fusion power. And as it is, building a complex machine out of the materials I've suggested isn't going to be cheap.\n\nWorse still, all of that material, particularly the graphite, will now be mildly radioactive and need to be put into ILW storage, with some parts likely requiring HLW storage. So such a plan would mean our Fusion power program producing some quantities of radioactive nuclear wastes, a fraction of what we currently generate yes, but certainly not zero.\n\nAnother cause for concern is the lengthy timetable towards fusion power. ITER is scheduled to finish operations in 2038 (or more likely the 2040\u2032s at the current pace). As noted, ITER's goal is merely to prove the concept, not provide a 24/7 operating reactor, never mind a commercially viable one generating electricity. The ITER groups own figures has the design and construction of the follow on DEMO reactor taking place from around 2035-2045. This will be, as the name implies, a demonstration Fusion Reactor unit. While it will run for extended periods it certainly won't be running on anything like a commercial basis, that will require waiting for PROTO (the first commercial prototype reactor) coming about 10-20 years later. Assuming no hold-ups, either technical or political, to stop or slow down this process (worth noting that the ITER program was held up for 5 years while everyone argued over where ITER was to be built, and indeed its already behind schedule), this puts the first generation of commercial Fusion Reactors as being built around the 2050's at the earliest and more than likely the 2060's or even 2070's if we're realistic. Indeed its likely even the timetable I've outlined above might slip as ITER is now not expected to acheive fully operational status until 2026.\n\nITER (next set as the PC language above refers to it as) and the preceding phases of fusion development\n\nBut we cannot wave a magic wand and the world will start sprouting fusion reactors like daisies. Assuming a well supported government campaign of building (which will be dependent on the costs being reasonable, if they are higher the build rate will be slower) then we should hopefully be able to match the maximum ever Fission reactor build rate of 30 GW/yr (or 235 Billion kWh/yr) after a 15-20 year lead time (i.e. time to train everybody, tool factories, built new ones, sort out planning issues, etc.) Unfortunately if you do you're sums this would have Fusion power just about succeeding in replacing our existing nuclear capacity of around 5% of global energy use sometime around the 2100's, quite some time away, with a lot of potential showstoppers in between.\n\nWhen presented with the above, Fusion power supporters usually react with indignation and accuse one of \"manipulating the figures\". They seem to believe that, cometh the hour, they'll be given an unlimited budget and unlimited resources to complete roll out of nuclear power at an unrealistically fast schedule \u2013 many think the first commercial reactors will be built by the 2050's. While that is still possible, assuming no hold ups (and as discussed there's already been a few!), one or two fusion reactors (or even one each in every nation that's a member of ITER) aren't going to make a huge difference to the global energy picture, we'd need hundreds or thousands of GWe scale units to achieve that, and it would take a considerable time to build those (decades), especially if they are made out of exotic materials where there is only a very limited manufacturing capacity.\n\nAnd of course, if the economics of nuclear energy don't work out as well as hoped (remember these are the same people who told us Fission reactors would be \"too cheap to meter\") then they'll be getting very little government or private industry support, possibly none! And of course there is the possibility that ITER and IFMIF might fail. The whole point of ITER is to prove once and for all if the Tokamak magnetic confinement approach is actually viable\u2026.or not. If it's no, then it's back to the drawing board for the scientists and we have an even longer wait.\n\nAnother problem is the fact that Fusion energy using the D-T approach is limited by the global stockpiles of Lithium. The (pro-nuclear) author Dr D. Mc Kay gives a figure for 10 kWh/person/day from current known stocks of Lithium (he also gives an unrealistically high figure from unconventional sources from sea water which would not be economic to extract). By comparison he gives similar figures of 0.55 kWh/p/day for Uranium and 4 kWh/p/day for Thorium (again he also gives a range of highly unrealistic figures for unconventional resources of both that essentially ignores economics and practical factors, see here). Mc Kay also gives a UK energy consumption rate of energy of around 125 kWh/p/day, thought there are some who say he got his sums wrong, implying a figure of 52 kWh/p/day would be more accurate. This would imply that D-T fusion can only supply 8% (if we use Mc Kay's figures) or possibly 20% of global energy (using his critic's figures). Where does the other 92-80% of our energy come from?\n\nBut are there any other options to the D-T fusion in a Tokamak reactor? The answer is yes. Are they viable? Hard to say! I'll attempt a brief summary.\n\n9.6 Alternatives Reactor designs to the Tokamak\n\nFirstly, to tackle the question of reactor design, there is the idea of using lasers to drive the fusion process. Such experiments are taking place with the American NIF as we speak. I would note that the primary goal of the NIF is weapons research, with Fusion energy research merely piggybacked onto it (the critics say, purely for the purposes of PR than any real intent to generate Fusion power). Also, there is the matter of that big laser. Have a look at the official website (here) and tell me how commercially viable it would be to build a massive laser like that next to every commercial nuclear power station!\n\nAnother possibility is the Fusor proposed by the scientists  and  or the similar Polywell proposed by Bussard. These have all shown promising results, the Polywell in particular. However, the project has been starved of funding, and the recent death of Bussard, hasn't helped matters. Also, the scientists involved have had difficulty proving the concept. Currently any Fusor/polywell devices have consumed considerably more energy to create Fusion pulses that they subsequently generated (i.e a net energy sink). The supporters claim that if scaled up sufficiently, this would turn into a net positive, and indeed that such devices would be much more efficient than any Tokamak reactor.\n\nWhether they are correct or not is difficult to say. Much like the LFTR, the Fusor has something of a cult following online and this makes any meaningful assessment of its potential difficult to access. Suffice to say the smart money is on them being wrong and ITER and the Tokamak design being right. Of course, if ITER fails in its objectives, expect a sudden change of course towards the Fusor sometime in the 2030's!\n\nA nice picture of a Fusor experiment glowing away nicely, more on this here\n\n9.7 Alternative fuel cycles\n\nThere are a range of different fuel cycles to the D-T method currently proposed. Firstly, there is the option of D-D fusion. This produces substantially less high energy neutrons (only 18% of the energy output v's 81% for D-T, at least according to wikipedia!). The global stockpiles of Deuterium are much larger, practically limitless indeed if it could be successfully extracted from seawater. Either way, fuel supply issues will not really be an issue with the D-D reaction.\n\nHowever, the downside with the D-D reaction is that the energy confinement must be much better (30 times according to wikipedia) and the energy density will be much less (68 times less according to wikipedia). This means D-D fusion is much harder to do at present and would require much larger reactors for a similar power output as a D-T reaction.\n\nThe D-D fusion process, the resulting Tritium particles will typically then fuse with Deuterium (producing a free neutron), as will the He-3 (producing a free proton as shown below)\n\nAnother option is so-called Aneutronic Fusion, which is essentially any fusion process that carries no more than 1% of its generated energy away in the form of neutrons. A lower neutron flux solves a lot of the material issues mentioned earlier. Better still, there is the option of using the charged particles generated by many of these fusion processes produce (those would be the p and e things in the charts below you see flying around) to generate electricity directly, without needing to muck around with turbogenerators. This last option is very useful. You'll note I've largely glossed over the whole issue above of turbo-generator plant for Fusion power stations, largely because the answer entirely depends on what the state-of-the art will be when Fusion power becomes available (i.e in 40-100 years time!). With present technology it would be \"challenging\", so obviously if these Aneutronic processes could save us the need to build a big expensive turbine set, then that would be a huge advantage.\n\nSeveral proposed Aneutronic fusion processes\n\nHowever, Aneutronic fusion comes with a number of significant drawbacks. The temperatures required by the reactor are much higher (10 times higher) and the power densities may well work out as much lower. In short, its harder to do.\n\nThere is also an issue with fuel supplies. Boron (one of the favoured fuels) is not nearly as abundant as Deuterium or even Lithium. Another favoured fuel choice is He-3. This is an extremely rare substance. There may be substantial reserves of it on the moon (deposited by the solar wind), but the density of such fuel is extremely low, well below what would currently be consider in anyway practical or economic to extract with presently available mining technology\u2026..on Earth! Obviously mining the moon for it with currently available mining, and space launch technology is simply a non-starter, thought in the distant future that might of course change\u2026\u2026but this isn't the distant future!\n\nA rough but unfortunately accurate summary of He-3 fusion proposals, see more here\n\n9.8 Summary\n\nIn summary, Fusion power does offer some intriguing possibilities. However, it is also clear that we cannot set any particular timetable for the arrival of commercial fusion power, indeed we need to contemplate the possibility that it simply never arrives! This is important as the way some nuclear advocates talk you'd swear it was already a given! The truth is we're making progress yes, but it's a case of slow and steady progress, and we're still a long way still from achieving the necessary breakthroughs. Let's not start counting our chickens before they've hatched!\n\nTo build any nation's energy strategy on the blind assumption that fusion power will arrive within a certain time window, and at a reasonable cost, makes about as much sense as selling your house and all your worldly goods because some Preacher told you the rapture was coming on the 21st of May 2011.\n\nEven if and when we do develop fusion power, it's inevitable that the build rate of reactors will initially be slow and the capital costs will be high (as is always the case for any new technology). While these conditions may both improve over time, it certainly won't take place overnight and ultimately there may well be a limit to how much energy we can ever hope to get from Fusion power. We will still need something else to plug this future energy gap."}
{"text": "(NaturalNews) My, you look glowing today! Cancer patients who receive radiation of their thyroid glands by being given radioactive iodine are highly radioactive for up to a week following their release from the hospital -- and they end up irradiating not just hospital rooms but also other patients, friends and family members. Radiation levels are so high in these people that they have set off radiation alarms designed to detect terrorist threats, says a congressional report.\n\nPregnant women, elderly patients and cancer patients of all ages are right now being exposed to harmful levels of ionizing radiation from these \"walking dirty bombs\" known as thyroid cancer patients. A part of their \"cancer treatment,\" they are instructed by doctors to drink a radioactive liquid containing iodine-131 (a radioisotope of iodine) which travels to their thyroid gland and burns it out with radiation. Believe it or not, this is called \"scientific medicine.\" Really.\n\nIt might as well just be called a Weapon of Mass Destruction given how it indiscriminately harms anyone who happens to be standing nearby. Iodine-131, by the way, is why the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster in the former Soviet Union was so deadly: it's a product of uranium fission and is extremely potent at causing cell mutation and death ( It has a half-life of 8 days, meaning that the amount of radiation it gives off drops by half every 8 days.\n\nActual terrorists, by the way, have no doubt figured out that if they want to sneak a dirty bomb into any U.S. city, all they need is a note from their doctor saying they've undergone radioactive thyroid treatment. Oh, that's why there's so much radiation coming from you! You're from the cancer clinic!\n\nBut if radioactive cancer patients -- also known as \"medical dirty bomb carriers\" -- are so dangerous to the people around them, why are doctors sending them out into the world immediately following their radioactive treatments? It all has to do with the loosey-goosey rules of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which says it's fine for highly radioactive patients to be released from the hospital. So now, about 40,000 walking \"dirty bomb\" patients are released onto the streets each year. And the damage they can cause around them will astound you:\n\nAccording to the congressional report put together by Congressman Ed Markey (Massachusetts), one radioactive patient boarded a bus in New York, setting off radiation detectors in the Lincoln Tunnel. State police halted the bus to look for terrorists but only found a thyroid cancer patient, who apparently ignored advice to avoid public transportation. (Should it be a crime to irradiate other passengers on a public bus? If terrorists did it, they'd be rotting away in a secret offshore prison somewhere... so why are doctors allowed to cause this?)\n\nThis report also found that about 7 percent of radioactive patients go directly to hotels after being treated. There, they irradiate bed linens and towels which get washed together with other linens and towels, turning the entire hotel into a radioactive dirty bomb. How do investigators know this? Because in one instance, nuclear plant workers just happened to be staying at just such a hotel, and they absorbed enough radiation to actually set off radiation alarms as they reported to work the next day!\n\nYet another way the cancer industry threatens the health of Americans\n\nThe upshot of all this is that making cancer patients drink radioactive liquids is truly a questionable way to \"treat\" anybody. It's not only disastrously bad for the patient; it also harms the public by exposing countless others to ionizing radiation. This exposure, of course, promotes more cancer and therefore more repeat business for cancer clinics. So the more people the cancer industry treats with radiation and unleashes onto the streets, the more new business they'll have walking through their doors.\n\nIt's sort of the cancer industry's version of viral marketing. Except it doesn't involve a virus. Instead, it uses radioactive nuclear materials.\n\nWhat's really interesting here is that the cancer industry has accomplished what terrorists could not -- unleashing dirty bomb radiation into major U.S. cities and irradiating the public. And it's all being done in the name of \"medicine,\" of course. Just like mass fluoridation, chemotherapy, mammography, seasonal flu vaccination and all the other toxic, poisonous procedures being forced upon the American people in the name of \"modern medical science.\"\n\nBut much of modern medical science isn't modern, nor scientific. It's actually quite barbaric when you consider how much harm it causes people. Any system of health care that asks patients to drink highly radioactive poison (iodine-131) is, without a doubt, operating from a dangerously diminished understanding of what medicine is supposed to be about.\n\nDon't take any of this as meaning I lack compassion for those who suffer from thyroid cancer. My heart goes out to anyone battling this condition. In fact, I'd like to help teach them how to prevent and reverse their cancer without using dangerous radiation! Many cases of thyroid cancer can be avoided (or even reversed) with the help of the trace minerals selenium and iodine (from seaweed, not from nuclear materials) and other supportive nutrients such as vitamin D. And it turns out that thyroid cancer is massively over-diagnosed and over-treated, since most people survive so-called \"thyroid cancer\" on their own with no treatment at all! (\n\nThyroid cancer patients need nutrition and holistic medicine, not radiation that poses a threat to themselves and others. But they are being tricked into drinking radioactive poison by cancer doctors who tell them they have to burn out their thyroid glands to stay alive. Incredible!\n\nMany cancer docs are too quick to reach a thyroid cancer diagnosis and urge patients to drink radioactive poison. And believe it or not, people actually swallow it! Seriously. Some people will do the most incredible things when a doctor tells them to, it seems. Here, inject yourself with DNA fragments from diseased animals. Here, swallow mind-altering psychotropic drugs for the rest of your life. Here, drink radioactive poison!\n\nAre these people serious? Do they really believe they're practicing medicine at all?\n\nWhile the medical industry may be able to fool the people, they can't bend the laws of physics. And the laws of physics say that high-level ionizing radiation is harmful to human biology. So maybe, just maybe, we shouldn't be sending dirty bombs out into the streets after they've swallowed radioactive iodine isotopes handed to them by cancer clinic quacks.\n\nPresident Bush spent hundreds of billions of dollars looking for WMDs in Iraq and never could quite find them. No wonder! It turns out they were in the cancer clinics the whole time. The quacks, it seems, now have the WMDs and they're using them on thyroid cancer patients who would be much better served with natural medicine that heals tissues instead of destroying them.\n\nSyndication of this article is okay!

{"text": "All I know is I've about grown tired of the leeches who are already jumping on this as a reason to why we should ban nuclear power.\n\nThe reality is that the reactor is older than Chernobyl, held up against an earthquake it wasn't designed to hold up against, held up against the many aftershocks, AND a tsunami yet still isn't into a meltdown. If anything this should be a testament to how safe the reactors are or at least how far we've come in handling them.\n\nMeanwhile the news isn't mentioning the oil refineries over there that are going up in completely uncontrollable columns of fire.\n\nCan someone explain why we should have power plants and stuff like this in the first placeit's not like having a ton of natural gas or oil would be any safer as Sentios said, unless you go pure solar or wind perhaps (which is still very impractical for large-scale needs). Due to the constant media frenzy over anything nuclear, modern nuclear reactors are incredibly safe. You can't really say the same for oil. An accident almost happens in Japan, due to events completely out of its control that it somehow still withstood, and everyone says that's why we shouldn't use it. BP has a well blow up for basically it's own fault (the disaster being outside the influence of nature) and the resulting oil screws up millions of things (without even catching on fire) and the ban on offshore drilling is lifted in less than a year. I think that's pretty telling about how ingrained the automatic suspicion of nuclear is. It could be warranted in the right perspective, but then that perspective should also view other sources of energy with equal suspicion otherwise you simply aren't being consistent.\n\npeople can't see radiation and nuclear power has a sort of odd fear set in people. It can be scary but honestly it's our best power source available with the ultra compact breeder designs. If japan had used that the cores would have fused solid after the quake. On the flip side when they rebuild thei reactors they will prolly use the new designRadiation is scary because you can't see it but it kills you. That and we invested a lot of our ideas into nuclear power during the Nuclear Age(strange coincidence eh?!), and that was just shattered with Chernobyl which killed thousands, and 3 Mile Island, which injured... 0. :|\n\nRugged. .1 on the richter scale is pretty large when the energy released is looked at since it's a logarithmic scale each point up is increasingly worth more. Like an 8.7 is 168 megatons but a 9.0 is 474 megatons. 9.0 being 10x stronger than an 8.0 so it'd be about 10% stronger I think if it was just moved up a pointSo then 8.9 is 900% stronger than 8.0 but only has 90% of the energy of a 9.0.\n\nAt least that's what I would think and that's purely on the Richter scale... however according to wikipedia there is a newer scale out there which is more accurate for these large quakes. I'm not sure how that effects the scaling.  am just seeing oh good god come out of the mouth of your pony avatarOh well. I'm waiting to get screwed myself. Every area on the Ring of Fire has been hit except my area..New Zealand, Chile, Japan.. all within the last year have had major earthquakes. My area shouldn't be that bad.. but no one really knows much about earthquakes (as in predicting them to any degree of reliable accuracy at all).\n\nI know (well not the technical terms but that it wouldn't be the same magnitude). Still, infrastructure is very poor in the U.S. The earthquake would also likely be centered near directly by Los Angeles which increases the destruction that much. Like what happened in Haiti for instance. A lot of places could withstand that magnitude but because of how close it was (and their excessively poor 3rd world infrastructure) they were devastated. It'd still be pretty bad here even though the magnitude will be less.\n\nIt's probably using the modern moment magnitude scale, which is where Mw is the number and Mo is the energy. So 8.9 to 9.0 ideally represents about a 41% increase in energy, but in this case it's probably the other way around, where the energy estimate was revised upward such that 9.0 is a closer approximation than 8.9, with the difference in the estimates not necessarily corresponding to the ideal case.\n\nThe earthquake happened the first night we (USS Abraham Lincoln) were in Hawaii. For a moment there we thought we would have to do disaster relief, if the tsunami had caused damage in Hawaii that is. All in all, the only thing that happened was the zoo not opening for business, I think they had to move the animals to higher ground or something.\n\n_________________ \"An honest man is one who knows that he can't consume more than he has produced\" Ayn Rand -Atlas Shrugged-"}

{"text": "Of all the things with a 'big promise,' energy derived from controlled atomic fusion is the biggest. It's been promised for, oh, twenty or thirty years, at least. Atomic fusion is what drives our Sun. All we need is an ever-so-small piece of that fusion energy to electrify the world, forever, more or less. Much easier said than done. At the moment, there are two major scientific initiatives underway to find a path to commercially viable fusion energy. One, called ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor), located in Cadarache (France), uses a dense containment field of magnetism in a device called a tokamak to (eventually, it is hoped) create the atomic implosion that starts a fusion reaction. The other project, at the National Ignition Facility in California (USA), is attempting to start fusion with the force of 192 super-X-ray lasers. Those lasers have just been fired for the first time.\n\nThey were fired successfully, although short of generating enough pressure to begin a fusion reaction. That was intentional; this was just a step in the direction of final testing \u2013 a warm-up, so to speak. Warm as in 6 million degrees Fahrenheit (about 3 million degrees Centigrade), which is about 200 million degrees short of the fusion reactions that can be found in the Sun.\n\nThe extreme temperature and pressure created by the focused lasers, forces atomic structures to collapse. When they do, they release tremendous amounts of energy. That energy needs to be absorbed (instead of exploding, literally), which is the biggest technological hurdle to any kind of controlled nuclear reaction. In the NIF project, that is the job of the 'hohlraum' (German, 'whole space', pronounced hole rah-um), the space in which the reaction is contained. Some scientists have predicted that the reaction plasma (super-hot atomic material) would block the fusion energy from being absorbed. In the event, it didn't. The hohlraum held and, in fact, managed to absorb 95% of the energy.\n\nThis was a very critical step for the NIF, demonstrating both the functionality of the laser equipment and the theoretical properties involved at this level of pressure and heat. Having passed this test, it's on to higher levels of energy until, hopefully, one day relatively soon the lasers will be cranked up enough to begin a true fusion reaction. At that point, the project can be assessed for the feasibility (doesn't cost too much) of using similar techniques for commercial production of fusion energy."}
{"text": "Hiroshima and Nagasaki: Part 5\nThe Effects of Radiation on Cellular Processes\n\nOf the four types of radiation emitted by the nuclear bombs deployed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki,\ngamma and neutron rays were the only types strong enough to reach ground and hurt people (see Part 2).\nThe penetration of ionizing radiation into living human cells can result in cell alteration or death (Bertell, 1985).\nFigure 1 is a diagram depicting the process of ionization.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (2006), high doses of radiation tend to kill cells.\nIf enough cells are killed, tissues and organs will suffer immediate damage.\nIn Nagasaki and Hiroshima this phenomenon became known as Acute Radiation Syndrome\n(U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission) and resulted in thousands of fatalities.\n\nThe rapid invasion of energy into a human cell may also result in the loss of the cell's ability to reproduce itself\nor may cause the cell to produce an altered hormone or enzyme from what it would normally produce. These altered or mutated cells\nwill replicate themselves, eventually resulting in the production of millions of such altered cells. This is known as biological\nmagnification and causes many chronic diseases normally only associated with the elderly and aging (Bertell, 1985).\nAn example of one such mutation is the destruction of the cell's ability to rest following cell division. A cell unable to rest will\nchaotically and rapidly produce an astronomical number of cells in one location, resulting in a tumor (either benign or malignant)\n(Bertell, 1985). Another cellular process affected by ionizing radiation is blood cell production. The rapid production of too many\nwhite blood cells (leukocytes) can cause leukemia, while a rapid proliferation of red blood cells (erythrocytes) often causes\npolycythemia vera. For more information on leukemia, access the National Cancer Institute's Leukemia Home Page at\n\nTo learn about polycythemia vera, contact the Leukemia and Lymphoma\nSociety at this link:\n\nlymphoma.org/all_mat_toc.adp?item_id=9955.\n\nSurvivors under shelter at the time of the blasts received less radiation exposure\nthan those out in the open. A medical study conducted on Nagasaki/Hiroshima survivors\nwho reported being in their homes at the time of the bombings indicated a direct\ncorrelation between dosage received and chromosomal abnormalities. Figure 2 shows\nthis correlation (Radiation Effects Research Foundation, 2006).\n\nAccording to Bertell, if radiation penetration affects germ cells (sperm or ovum),\ndefective offspring may result. Chromosomal diseases resulting from germ cell radiation\ninclude Down's Syndrome, which is caused by failure of chromosomal separation\n(nondisjunction). In nondisjunction, one of the daughter cells resulting from cell\ndivision lacks a chromosome and the other daughter cell has an extra chromosome. In the\ncase of Down's Syndrome, the extra chromosome is at location number 21 (trisomy 21).\nAn individual with Down's Syndrome is generally moderately to severely retarded\n(Schull, 1995).

{"text": "Crossroads\n\nIn late October 1945, members of the United States Navy's emerging Atomic Bomb Group (William Parsons, Frederick Ashworth, and Horatio Rivero) discussed the possibility of conducting nuclear tests to determine the effects of atomic detonations on naval ships. Four types of tests were put forward in what became known as Operation Crossroads: detonation of a device suspended by a blimp, a deep-water detonation, a shallow-water burst, and a high-altitude delivery by a B-29 bomber. The blimp test was quickly eliminated, while planning proceeded on the remaining three proposals. President Truman authorized the Crossroads Tests on January 10, 1946.\n\nThe Navy selected the remote atoll of Bikini in the Marshall Islands as the test site. Bikini had enough land area to support the operation as well as a large lagoon. The lagoon was of critical importance, since the Navy planned to assemble a vast array of captured German, Japanese, and obsolete American warships as targets for the weapons tests. The Bikini Islanders agreed to vacate the atoll for an unspecified period of time (they have yet to return) and allow the United States Government unrestricted use of the islands and lagoon.\n\nLos Alamos Participation\n\nLos Alamos scientists played the key role in Crossroads: \"Arrangements for setting up the bomb, including assembly and transportation of components must be made through the organization which furnishes the bomb, namely the Manhattan Project and the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. Since the phenomena accompanying the release of energy of an atomic bomb are known to and have been successfully observed by the parties of the Los Alamos Laboratory, it would be unsafe, unworkable and infinitely confusing to have any other organization attempt to dominate the observations.\"\n\nShots Able and Baker\n\nThe first test, codenamed Able, was a high altitude drop of a Fat Man device on June 30, 1946. The bomb missed the aiming point by about a half mile and, as a result, sunk only five ships. Shot Baker, the second test, was a dramatic shallow-water burst sinking eight ships. More significantly, the sea water irradiated by Baker washed over the target fleet, rendering all ships uninhabitable. Because of the extensive damage and contamination caused by shot Baker and the very small stockpile of nuclear weapons, the planned deep-water test was cancelled.\n\nAs effects tests, Able and Baker demonstrated that atomic bombs could be used as tactical weapons and used against small targets."}
{"text": "Document Actions\n\nNew book: A Very Short Introduction to Radioactivity\n\nClaudio Tuniz, former assistant director of ICTP, has published a book on the many and varied uses of radioactivity in scientific research.\n\nIn the decades since its discovery, radioactivity has transformed in the minds of the public from a inscrutable force to a frightening potential weapon. But, as discussed by Claudio Tuniz, former assistant director and currently consultant at ICTP, radioactivity is also an important scientific tool and its uses extend across many fields, from palaeontology to power generation to public health.\n\nFor example, radioactivity is used to track the history of fossils and other ancient objects, locate massive sources of groundwater, and create genetic mutations for accelerating the development of new crop varieties. It has even been explored as a possible solution to the malaria epidemic - female mosquitoes can only breed once in their lifetimes, so if many male mosquitoes are rendered sterile by radioactivity and then released into the wild, numerous female mosquitoes would lose their only chance to reproduce. Radioactive dating can even track the time living cells were generated. A given cell's radiocarbon level correlates with the how much radioactivity was in the Earth's atmosphere at the time the cell was created. This atmospheric radioactivity differs dramatically from decade to decade over the last 60 years depending on how much the United States and Soviet Union were testing nuclear bombs in the atmosphere.\n\nBut radioactivity remains a major source of anxiety for many, and the book also covers the public's complicated relationship with it. But, while it is dangerous at high doses, the fact is that we are constantly showered by radioactivity at levels that aren't dangerous"}

{"text": "Could you use controlled reactions in a thermonuclear core to produce electricity? Would it be worth the possible meltdown consequences?\n\nThink of a hydrogen bomb. Many people know that intense gamma and x rays from a fission bomb inside the device compresses and heats a fission/fusion explosive. What if you could take a thermonuclear core and control its fission/fusion reactions to still produce large amounts of heat to create steam and drive a turbine without causing a nuclear explosion. Would having thin layers of lead between the layers of the core control the reactions, acting as a sort of control rod but still allowing a lot of heat to be produced without melting the reactor vessel? If this were to work, it could provide a lot of energy that didn't produce nearly as much waste as a normal fission reactor and it would run longer. Would it be worth the risk?\n\nI think that it's very much worth pursuing fusion reactors, but I don't think they will work the way that you've described.\n\nThe big difference between the fission reactors (which are widely used) and fusion reactors is the environment needed to create the reaction. Fission is accomplished anytime enough of the correct material (meaning uranium, plutonium or a few other elements) is piled together. Nothing else is needed to start the fission process. In fact that's part of the problem. The reaction can continue even if the reactor and it's control systems are damaged, as happened at Chernobyl, Three mile Island, and Fukashima.\n\nFusion reactions require astonishing high temperatures and pressures. The Uranium and Plutonium used as a match to trigger a fusion reaction in an H-Bomb are as you mention, a full blown atomic explosion. It's the only known source that's powerful enough to do it. Needless to say, there is no such thing as a control process, or even anything resembling a solid reactor that could hold it.\n\nCurrent research on fusion power reactors has not yet been able to get any kind of sustained reaction. We have not yet been able to generate or sustain those temperatures for more than a few milliseconds. Doing that, and containing the energy released if we do, are daunting technical challenges. I doubt that we'll need special controls to shut off the reaction. All one has to do is stop supporting it. That's the exact opposite of a fission reactor.\n\nJul 3 2012:\nWell, my idea may be to difficult and just outright outrageous, but a magnetic pinch fusion reactor would actually be pretty easy to operate. You simply heat the deuterium/tritium gas to a plasma, then you zap it with high voltage to create a magnetic field that essentially crushes the plasma into a denser state. Eventually, it would get denser and denser and hotter and hotter until it sustains a fusion chain reaction. All by continuously zapping a plasma. Then all you have to do is contain the plasma with an electromagnetic field."}

Brown coal now supplies 25% of Germany's electricity, up from 23% a year ago.\n\nPreviously a net exporter of electricity, Germany now imports as much electricity as it sells abroad.

(And, Then Again, They Don't...)\n\nSixty-six years ago today, the United States dropped the first of only two atomic weapons ever used \"in anger,\" i.e. for real, in battle, as weapons.\n\n80,000 people died instantly in Hiroshima, with another 60,000 to die days, weeks, months, and even years later from the effects of the radiation burns they suffered that day. In total, it is estimated that 140,000 to 160,000 people died as a direct result of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.\n\nAnother 90,000 would die 3 days later, when the second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki.\n\nThe United States War Department estimated that an invasion of the Japanese home islands would result in 500,000 to 1,000,000 American casualties, and at least twice that many Japanese casualties. Ending the war quickly saved 1.5 to 3 million lives, so, in that sense, the atom bombs saved many more lives than they ended.\n\nBut, then again, almost everybody who would have died in the invasion of Japan is now dead. Within the next 10 or so years, the entire WWII generation will have passed away. To paraphrase C. S. Lewis, wars do not increase death, since 100% of us will die. All war does is concentrate death into a smaller space and time. But children were born who would not have been, if their parents had died in that invasion, so their lives, too, were, in a sense, spared by the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nSo, in the light of history and the harsh math that a military planner must use, the atomic bombing of Japan saved a great many lives. But, also, in the harsh reality that, in a post-Genesis-3 world, everyone is under a sentence of death, the end of another war did nothing to stop the death toll that sin exacts.\n\nThe fact that all are sinners and that the just punishment for sin is death is the Bad News that makes the Good News so very, very good!\n\n4 comments:\n\nYou said well what I have always thought about the A-bombs and WWII. Along with this, the explanation of the seond bomb was that the US wanted to give the impression that there would be one a week of these until the war was over--and while this was not possible immediately, this was the \"long term\" plan.\n\nOf course, it was also a test of both bomb designs. There are always a multitude of reasons for doing anything. We almost always err in attributing motivation to a single cause.\n\nI have often thought about what would have happened to my dad, who was in the Army in the Philippines at the time, in the case of a land invasion of Japan...a very high probability of death. Instead, he raised a family of 3 children and lived until 2006, just shy of his 82nd birthday"}

{"text": "Butterfly Mutations post-Fukushima\n\nWhen Hiroshima and Nagasaki exploded, the research on their effects was on human misery and human effects. Today, we have another Japanese disaster, Fukushima, which allows the more scientific investigation of the effects of nuclear particles such as iodine on the genotype of a species.\n\nHuman results I'm sure will be produced, but a short life cycle like the annual butterfly can give us results now that will affect future generations.\n\nThis study, published in Nature, is admirable in its depth and findings on the genetic change in generations we can expect from radiation. Two months after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, 144 specimens of the pale grass blue were collected from the 10 localities shown on the map below.\n\nThey appeared normal but with 12.4% of minor abnormalities. If you look at (e) in the figure, the dented eyes, the deformed left eye, the deformed right palp and the deformed wing shape were the only visible abnormalities found.\n\nThe pale grass blue butterfly, Zizeeria maha is now, as a species in the Fukushima region, deteriorating both genetically and physiologically. The radionuclides held responsible caused abnormalities in the first generation (F1).\n\nThese were inherited in the F2 generation and subsequent descendants, meaning that the genome was drastically interfered with later too. More telling, with the use of these radionuclides artificially, it was possible to reproduce the effects found in nature. Some people could say that was unnecessary but look closely at the conclusions to find how significant this could be to other animals and humans.\n\nAbove: Rearing system of the pale grass blue butterfly in the laboratory, where the insects were tested artificially to copy the radionuclide effects (a) Cages for rearing.

{"text": "What are the advantages and disadvantages to...?\n\nNuclear power?\n\n10 pts for best\n\nAsked By: Ilovetoask - 6/15/2008\n\nBest Answer - Chosen by Asker\n\nAdvantages are no greenhouse gases and 0 emissions. disadvantages are no place to safely store all the spent fuel rods.\nhere is my term paper on the subject. i hope it helps\nJoseph McCudden\nJune 2, 2008\nIDS 125: Environmental Collapse\nTerm Paper\n\nBenefits of Nuclear Power Plants\n\nThe United States of America needs to start building nuclear power plants to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. \"Without nuclear power the United States will have difficulty in \u2026 providing electricity to manufacturing industries,\" (American ceramic society bulletin p 20). The United States has not built a new nuclear power plant in nearly three decades. In the United States nuclear power only accounts for approximately twenty percent of our total power production but varies state to state. Currently thirty one states have nuclear reactors and Illinois leads the United States by producing 11,379 Mega Watts (MW). In order for the United States to keep up with their energy demands we need to invest in nuclear power. By creating these power plants we can reduce our dependence on foreign oil which could also help lower the rising gas prices.\nNuclear power has always been a viable solution to our energy needs but because of two famous nuclear accidents the public has shunned this technology. The first being the Chernobyl incident where reactor four exploded due to a stream buildup releasing large amounts of radiation over hundreds of kilometers. The second famous nuclear accident happened in the United States at Three Mile Island where there was a partial melt down and a small amount of radioactive gas was released in to the air. The amount of radiation released was less than a person is exposed to on average from cosmic rays. The reactors that the untied states have built have far more security and redundant safety systems to prevent any Chernobyl-like accident. Although Three Mile Island and Chernobyl are not the single cause for the stop of new nuclear power plants they did not help the cause. \"Construction delays, cost overruns, high interest rates, systemic safety issues, a whole lot of no-nuke protesters, and a surprising dropoff (sp) in electricity demand, all of which predate 1979. Three Mile Island didn't kill the nuclear dream. It was just another nail in the coffin\" (Whitford, David).\nSince Three Mile Island every American nuclear power plant now has a minimum of two inspectors from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission at all times. Inside the control room they have a no dangling rule. This means nothing can be hanging off your shirt and nothing on your head that could fall off and hit a button that is better left untouched. On December 2, 1942 Enrico Fermi is said to have coined the acronym SCRAM. SCRAM stands for Safety Control Rod Ax Man. This was a very important job that a colleague of Fermi, Norman Hillberry. Hillberry stood next to the rope that raised and lowered the control rods, if needed Hillberry could cut the rope with and ax lowering the control rods and stop the reaction in seconds. The control room has a SCRAM button although the control rods are now lowered mechanically and there is no one with an ax to lower the rods. Every person who works in the control room spends a week in training and testing every few months in a custom simulator that is exactly the same as the control room they work in back at their plant. Spent fuel rods are currently stored on site in forty feet.\nThere are main types of nuclear reactors which are either thermal reactors or fast reactors. A thermal reactor is one where the neutrons that are created by fission before starting more fission reactions. Fission is the splitting of atoms in which large amounts of energy are released along with neutrons. This process can happen naturally or artificially by firing neutrons at atoms. Most of the thermal reactors use the isotope uranium-235 and the most common thermal reactor is the Light Water Reactors (LWRs). There are two types of LWRs, the boiling water reactor and the pressurized water reactor. The maximum operating temperature for water is about 300 degrees Celsius and operates at about 32?fficiency. There are two ways to increase the efficiency. They are either to raise the temperature of the water in the reactor or lower the temperature of the return water to something cooler than it is now. Although it is ideal to lower the cooling temperature it is easier to increase the temperature of the water in the reactor so alternatives to water are currently being researched.\nThe other type of nuclear reactor, the fast reactor, the neutrons are produced the same way as in a thermal reactor but the neutrons in the fast reactor are not slowed down before creating more fission reactions. These reactors have the versatility to use many different types of fuels besides uranium-235; they can also use transuranic metatarsals. Transuranic materials are elements that have a higher atomic number than uranium and all of them are created artificially.\nEconomically speaking new nuclear power plants would save billions of dollars a year on oil. One uranium fuel pellet, which is about the size of the end of your pinky, has the equivalent to 1780 pounds of coal, 149 gallons of oil, or 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas. Not only will the untied states save money on oil but the individual customers will save any where from .8 cents to 7.9 cents per kilowatt hour depending what one's power plant is currently using for fuel. Currently we get most of our nuclear fuel from Russia but, there is an enriching plant in Eunice, New Mexico. This plant will hopefully bring economic stability to an area that is very unstable. That stability can only happen if the United States starts to build more nuclear power plants. Not only will new nuclear power plants help with our growing electricity and oil needs but also have benefits in making hydrogen for hydrogen powered cars, extracting oil from sand and shale, and purifying water. Nuclear power plants help nature out to because most humans do not want to be around one but animals do not care. Nuclear plants do not make a lot of noise, they do not poison the air with smoke like coal burning plants, and they do not kill birds like wind turbines occasionally do.\nNuclear power plants are looking to the future with two new designs that have never been used in the United States before. One design is by Westinghouse that is projected to produce 1.1 gigawatts power from two steam generators. The two steam generators are connected to a main reactor and have a number of safety systems that do not need electricity or cooling water to work. It also requires half the valves and about one sixth of the piping that a similar power plant with the same power output would have. This means that there are less moving parts so a less chance of a valve failing or having pipes corrode and burst. The other design is by General Electric and it is called the Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor. This is a big step forward because the recirculation pumps and safety system pumps have been replaced by gravity-driven water circulation and passive safety systems. These simple systems are said to cut construction and operation costs and reduce the chance for mechanical failure.\nAs great as nuclear power sounds it does also have its drawbacks. When thinking about solving some of the problems, one would look to France because of their extensive history with nuclear power. For most problems this works but currently France has the same problem as the United States as to where to dispose of the spent fuel rods safely. France tries to solve this problem by reprocessing the spent fuels rods. This process involves soaking the rods in acid to extract plutonium and enriched uranium. Unfortunately reprocessing releases massive amounts of radioactive gases and liquids which can harm the environment more than the spent fuel rods alone. Another problem is that during droughts reactors have to slow down or shut down because of the lack of water that is needed for cooling. In a 2003 heat wave, in France, shutdown seventeen reactors because the temperature of the river rose to high and endangered the aquatic life.\nThese reactors produce 549 billion kWh and France only consumes 482 billion kWh and exports 60-70 billion kWh each year.\nNuclear power is a great short term fix for our current global warming situation. Right now nuclear power is the best because it is cheaper and more efficient than using wind or solar power. Unfortunately with nuclear power comes the task of disposing of the spent fuel rods. Currently in the United States there is no central location to store these fuel rods, but they are trying to store it in Yucca Mountain in Nevada. No spent fuel rods have been put there yet because of safety concerns. This is the main concern about nuclear power and this is why it is only a short term fix. Money needs to invested in both wind and solar to make them more efficient. There are less environmental concerns with using solar or wind power because like nuclear power there are no greenhouse gases but unlike nuclear power wind and solar do not have a radioactive component. There are some environmental issues with solar and wind power but nothing in comparison to the potential hazards of radioactive material leaking out. Another reason that reactors are only a short term solution is because as temperatures rise and heat wave frequencies increase water availability will decrease making it harder and harder to cool the reactors and eventually price nuclear energy out of business. That is why nuclear power will be a short term fix while we improve solar and wind technologies to make those technologies more cost effective and efficient.\nNuclear power is a good solution to help reduce greenhouse gases which will help slow global warming.

{"text": "Saturday, August 13, 2011\n... /////\n\nUpdate: Anthony is telling me that a story about the Tucker cars at the end of his blog entry shows that he reposted the report about the thorium cars as a kind of satire, and I kind of believe him after some e-mail exchanges, even though I am sure that he understands that it was very likely for me (and others) to miss this \"detail\". ;-)\n\nAnthony Watts' blog has become the world's most progressive website that promotes alternative, carbon-free energy sources of the future. And when I say \"alternative\", I mean really, really alternative! :-)\n\nFord Nucleon, a 1958 prototype, an inspiration for the project discussed below\n\nI really don't understand how a person with some basic knowledge of physics could buy the content of the article.\n\nThorium is arguably a nuclear fuel of the future - and China may actually be a leader in this promising technology that may cover the mankind's energy needs for thousands of years once it works. But thorium is still a heavy, radioactive element: a nuclear fuel. It produces all kinds of instantly deadly radioactive stuff. The idea that you would be \"recharging\" your thorium motor in the garage is just preposterous. It's like having a bath in the Fukushima (or any other) reactor.\n\nEven in the far future when small thorium reactors are technologically possible, no sane countries would allow random people to manipulate with radioactive fuel at home. The thorium cycle produces a smaller - but still large - amount of radioactive products than the uranium cycle; on the other hand, it produces lots of hard gamma rays. You surely need to surround such a reactor by tens of tons of lead or a similar metal to achieve your basic protection.\n\nEqually preposterous is the idea that the thorium could produce heat just because of \"pressure\" applied upon its atoms. I could repeat the explanation from the cold fusion article: the state of the atoms is totally irrelevant because it only changes the energy by electronvots while nuclear processes require either megaelectronvolts to overcome the Coulomb barrier between charged nuclei (including protons) during fusion, or they need a supercritical production of neutrons that can cause fission of heavy nuclei. Fusion needs huge tempratures; fission needs a constant inflow of neutrons.\n\nIn any thorium nuclear reactor, you first need neutrons to be absorbed by \"fertile\" thorium-232 nuclei (which are not \"fissile\") for them to become uranium-233 (which is \"fissile\"). The neutrons can't be replaced by gasoline or pressure or prayers. Atomic physics, chemistry, the writers' self-evident inability to distinguish thorium oxide from metallic thorium, or pressure of any ordinary magnitude are just totally irrelevant for the question whether fission will take place.\n\nSo this machine won't work and it couldn't possibly be safe for individuals: I am not talking about safety against the production of nuclear weapons, I am talking about ordinary public health and public hazard safety. But there are many other totally absurd statements in the Wards Auto article that must make every scientifically literate person instantly sure that the article is nonsense.\n\nFor example, the article promises a 227-kilogram unit that may be incorporated into your car. It should produce 250 MW - megawatts - of energy. That's not bad at all. Why?\n\nThis is our Temel\u00edn nuclear power plant and it has two blocks with 1,000 MW each - in total, it produces 2,000 MW of energy when both blocks are running.\n\nSo the whole power plant above is equivalent to 8 of the miraculous thorium cars - about one 2-ton gadget. ;-) Temel\u00edn with its 2,000 MW gives us about 14% of the energy needs of the Czech Republic - which has 10 million people. You see that the 14 GW capacity corresponds to 10 million people, so 0.25 GW corresponds to 56 times fewer, about 180,000 people.\n\nIt follows that one of those miraculous thorium cars is exactly enough to feed the city of Pilsen with energy. ;-) Maybe such a car will have a little bit too much power to accompany your family on the road...\n\nOr just think how you could extract the energy/heat from your motor. The vaporization heat of water is 2.23 MJ per kilogram. So 250 MW will evaporate about 110 liters of water every second. Where will your car get this much water? (Note that it's a hard task for the same reason as discussed above: what you have isn't a real car, it's 1/8 of the Temel\u00edn power plant.)\n\nI must happily admit that this time, the WUWT readers weren't naive. The rating is just 4 stars, and not 5 stars, and most of the comments are skeptical. By the way, just like I predicted, Anthony Watts' promotion of cold fusion wasn't criticized or humiliated by a single alarmist blog. It's because despite some embarrassing flaws at Anthony Watts' blog, he's still orders of magnitude more realistic and educated about possible energy sources than the typical alarmists - who are complete nuts."}
{"text": "Bridging 2 Kinds of Reactors\n\nIn the 1990s, Seth Grae set out to sell a reactor fueled with thorium, which is more plentiful than uranium yet unattractive to countries that want reactors that can make bombs. His idea has not caught on, at least not yet. But along the way, his company, now called Lightbridge, also designed a component for the thorium reactor that it says would be useful in conventional uranium reactors as well.\n\nLightbridge's component relies on a different method for turning raw uranium into reactor fuel, and the result is more heat produced in a small space, a change that could allow existing reactors to make more electricity.\n\nAnd when the fuel is used up, it will be somewhat easier to dispose of because it will have a smaller amount of the extremely long-lived elements than conventional reactor fuel does, the company says.\n\nLightbridge's concept takes advantage of a rather odd characteristic of nuclear reactors: they make more fuel as they consume it. The standard American design uses uranium 235, a form of uranium that splits easily, giving off neutrons that go on to split yet other atoms of uranium 235 in a chain reaction. But some of the neutrons do not hit uranium 235 atoms; they hit a different form of uranium present in the reactor, uranium 238. The uranium 238 then captures the neutron and is transformed into a new element, plutonium 239, which is also fuel.\n\nThere are two problems with this: some believe that the world is within decades of running low on uranium, and plutonium can be recovered from the reactor and used for bombs. The United States used reactors to convert uranium 238 into plutonium 239 when it made the bomb it dropped on Nagasaki in 1945; that is also how North Korea built its bomb in recent years.\n\nEnter Mr. Grae's company, which favors thorium. Thorium, like uranium 238, does not split but can absorb stray neutrons. When it does, it is transmuted into uranium 233, which is hard to use as bomb fuel because it is difficult to separate from the other components of the reactor fuel.\n\nThe concept is well understood by physicists but has not enjoyed commercial success. Nonetheless, Mr. Grae's company announced Wednesday morning that it has designed and tested a component of its thorium reactor that could be useful running in existing uranium-powered reactors.\n\nThe component is called a seed. The Lightbridge design needs a flow of neutrons to be captured by the thorium and to create uranium 233. Those neutrons come from uranium fuel, like the fuel in current reactors.\n\nYet in current reactors, the uranium is formed into ceramic pellets about the size of pencil erasers that are loaded into metal fuel rods that look like oversize drinking straws. The shape is fine for sustaining a chain reaction but not particularly good for letting heat flow to the cooling water. That heat is used to make steam, which can be turned into electricity.\n\nSo Lightbridge redesigned the fuel. It blended the uranium metal directly into the metal used in fuel rods, and twisted it into a different shape, texturing it \"like licorice,'' as Mr. Grae put it. It transfers its heat better in that shape because it has a larger surface area per pound of fuel. It can run at lower temperatures, moving more easily to the cooling water. It has more uranium 235 than standard reactor fuel, which splits easily and can thus throw off a large shower of neutrons.\n\nBut to make more electricity, reactors need more than a more powerful core; they need bigger steam turbines, bigger electrical generators and bigger heat exchangers. Some reactors have these and could use the new fuel; reactors being built today could be designed for the more powerful core and produce 30 percent more energy with only a small additional capital cost, Lightbridge says. First, though, someone would have to invest tens of millions of dollars in design work and licensing fees.\n\nBut if Lightbridge's idea for a metal uranium fuel works in conventional reactors, it could be a big contribution to the nuclear industry, given that the thorium reactor is an idea that won't go away but doesn't seem to be coming to fruition, either \u2014 at least not in the next few years ."}

{"text": "Blog Stats\n\nAt some stage the land underneath West Cumbria will be used as a dump for spent nuclear material produced as a by product of nuclear electricity generating power stations.\n\nWest Cumbria, the geologists believe, was formed by rocks laid down at various times between 500 million years ago and 200 million years ago. Since then the landscape has been formed by great climatic changes in the last two million years which have meant the land has been covered by sea, desert and ice at various times. In the past decade Cumbria has suffered from unprecedented levels of flooding, which was both unusual and unexpected. Its geology apparently leads it to be a favourable site to store nuclear waste.\n\nNow to store nuclear waste safely is rather difficult. We simply do not know enough about the future to be able to predict accurately what will happen in hundreds of years to uranium stored today.\n\nThe cunning plan that humanity has devised is to find a piece of land where either none of the inhabitants object to uranium being stored or a piece of land when the inhabitants can be rewarded for agreeing to have uranium stored. Having got the land the humans plan to dig a very deep hole (the precise depth and dimensions are not yet known, and then dump the waste uranium suitably stored in containers then encased with cement and concrete. Having done this the hole will be covered and no doubt some kind of guard placed over the hole to prevent others from digging it up.\n\nThe geology of the land is very important. You cannot dump uranium in places where there are fault lines, known earthquakes, volcanic activity and geological stress. The uranium may be thrown up to the surface at some time in the future or the containers may be cracked causing uranium to leach into the deep water table. Stability is important and most of West Cumbria has this stability.\n\nI expect in ten or twelve thousand years the inhabitants of the land where the hole was dug will have probably forgotten that a uranium dump was ever below the land. This, you might think, is no matter because ten thousand years is longer than recorded history on this planet. However uranium has been around much longer than humanity and spent uranium takes quite a long time until it has decayed and no longer presents a threat to life. The two key types of uranium produced as a by product of nuclear energy are uranium 235 and uranium 238. Both types are used in nuclear power stations but only uranium 235 can sustain a chain reaction and usually the uranium is enriched so that there is more uranium 235 compared with uranium 238 in the reactor so longer chain reactions can be sustained.\n\nUranium 238 takes 4,500 million years to decay to half its potency. That is rather a long time by you may be relieved to know that uranium 235 takes rather less time; only 713 million years, which is more time than it took to lay down the rocks of West Cumbria. Uranium is radioactive and as it decays it emits alpha and beta particles. I do not suggest that the uranium buried will remain dangerous for millions of years; it certainly will remain very dangerous for ten thousand years to eighty thousand years.\n\nThe geology might be right for storage of radioactive material but what about flooding?\n\nPerhaps in future the poets of the Lake District will sigh:-\n\nI wandered in a radioactive cloudWith isotopes dancing in hillsWhen all at once I saw a crowdA host of alpha particles"}

Seconds before, all that separated the young scientist from a lethal dose of radiation was a thin screwdriver.\n\nThe screwdriver supported a reflective covering that encased a sphere of plutonium, and if the reflector fell into place, a nuclear chain reaction would commence. When Slotin's hand slipped, a lethal burst of radiation hit him, and he died nine days later.\n\nOne year later, the U.S. military detonated this plutonium \"demon\ncore\" at the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. But the legacy of the\ndemon core \u2014 and its victims \u2014 has endured.\nSlotin was not the demon core's first victim before it was detonated\nin the Pacific. Harry K.

By itself, the sphere did not have enough mass to start a\nnuclear chain reaction. With some help from a reflective material,\nhowever, the plutonium could start such a chain reaction.\n\nDuring a chain reaction, the nuclei of radioactive atoms split,\nreleasing neutrons.

{"text": "Like the people cheering at about :25 into this video, I'm a sucker for dramatic explosions. This one comes from Texas, where the transportation department blew up an old bridge in the city of Marble Falls on March 17th. Also, apparently, it's warm enough in Texas that multiple gentlemen could watch a bridge explode from the comfort of their jet skis.\n\nBackup generators exist anonymously. They are metal boxes, squirreled away on a roof or near a loading dock. You are meant to not see them. The point is that they are there when you need them and, the rest of the time, they do their best to be unobtrusive.\n\nThe problem is that this very job description makes it more likely that your emergency generator won't work in an emergency.\n\nOn Monday, New York University's Langone Medical Center lost power during Hurricane Sandy, and ended up having to evacuate 215 patients when the generator that was supposed to keep its charges alive and its critical systems running failed to turn on. Across the United States there are about 12 million backup generators. Most only operate during blackouts \u2014 times when a hospital, or a laboratory, or a bank, needs electricity and can't get it from the larger electric grid.\n\nBut backup generators aren't 100% reliable. In fact, they won't work something like 20%-to-30% of the time, said Arshad Mansoor, Senior Vice President for Research & Development with the Electric Power Research Institute. The bad news is that there's only so much you can do to improve on that failure rate. The good news: There are solutions that could help keep a hospital up and running in an emergency, even if the emergency power system doesn't work.\n\nRemember back during the Fukushima crisis, when you heard a lot of talk about why the people trying to save the plant didn't want to use sea water to cool the reactors? There were a number of reasons for that (check out this interview Scientific American's Larry Greeenemeier did with a nuclear engineer), but one factor was the fact that salt water corrodes the heck out of metal. Pump it into a metal reactor unit and that unit won't be usable again.\n\nNow, the corrosive power of salt water is in the news again \u2014 and this time it's ripping through New York City's underground network of subways and utility infrastructure. I like the short piece that Gizmodo's Patrick DiJusto put together, explaining why salt water in your subway is even worse than plain, old regular water:\n\nWhen two different types of metal (or metal with two different components) are placed in water, they become a battery: the metal that is more reactive corrodes first, losing electrons and forming positive ions, which then go into water, while the less reactive metal becomes a cathode, absorbing those ions. This process happens much more vigorously when the water is electrically conductive, and salt water contains enough sodium and chloride ions to be 40 times more conductive than fresh water. (The chloride ion also easily penetrates the surface films of most metals, speeding corrosion even further.) Other dissolved metals in sea water, like magnesium or potassium, can cause spots of concentrated local corrosion.\n\nSixty milliseconds is fast. But sometimes, it's not fast enough. That's the gist of a great explainer by Cassie Rodenberg at Popular Mechanics, which answers the question, \"Why do transformers explode?\"\n\nBefore I link you over there, I want to add a quick reminder of what transformers actually are.\n\nAlthough giant robots that turn into trucks do also explode from time to time, in this case we are talking about those cylindrical boxes that you see attached to electric poles. (Pesco posted a video of one exploding last night.) To understand what they do, you have to know the basics of the electric grid.\n\nI find that it's easiest to picture the grid like a lazy river at a water park. That's because we aren't just talking about a bunch of wires, here. The grid is a circuit, just like the lazy river. Electricity has to flow along it from the power plant, to the customers, and back around to the power plant again. And, like a lazy river, the grid has to operate within certain limits. The electricity has to move at a constant speed (analogous to what engineers call frequency) and at a constant depth (analogous to voltage). This is where transformers come in\n\nI just posted the first part of a two-part feature about America's electric grid and the risk of blackouts. If this is something you're interested in, though, there's a New York Times piece from last week that you should really read.\n\nWhen we lose our access to electricity, there's usually more than one thing that went wrong. But, one of the common things that does go wrong, especially in recent years, is extreme weather. The way the grid was built, and the way we manage it, was set up with predictable weather and climate norms in mind. When those things start to drastically shift\u2014as we've seen over the last 10 years\u2014the grid becomes vulnerable.\n\nAnd electricity isn't the only infrastructure affected.\n\nOn a single day this monthThis story, by Matthew L. Wald and John Schwartz, will give you a great overview of the risks we're facing\u2014and the high prices we're paying\u2014as \"the norm\" becomes an old-fashioned concept.\n\nThe other day, someone asked me what the most surprising thing was that I learned while writing Before the Lights Go Out, my book about America's electric infrastructure and the future of energy. That's easy. The most surprising thing was definitely my realization of just how precarious our all-important grid system actually is.\n\nThere are two key things here. First, the grid doesn't have any storage. (At least, none to speak of.) Second, the grid has to operate within a very narrow window of technical specifications. At any given moment, there must be almost exactly as much electricity being produced as there is being consumed. If that balance is thrown off, by even a fraction of a percent, you start heading toward blackouts. There are people working 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week, making sure that balance is maintained on a minute-by-minute basis.\n\nThat's a long way of explaining why I find Blackout Tracker so fascinating. Put together by Eaton, a company that makes products that help utilities manage different parts of the electric grid, this little web app shows you where the electric grid has recently failed, and why. The Blackout Tracker doesn't claim to include all blackouts, but it gives you an idea of the number of blackouts that happen, and the wide range of causes blackouts can have. For instance, in the picture above, you can see that Wichita, Kansas, had a blackout earlier this week that was related to a heatwave\u2014hot weather meant more people turned on their air conditioners in the middle of the day, and, for whatever reason, there wasn't enough electrical supply available to meet that demand. The result: Blackout.\n\nOne major flaw: Most of the time Blackout Tracker can't tell you how long a blackout lasted. But that's probably got more to do with what information the utility companies are willing to release than anything. Still, I think this program is a nice primer for people who aren't aware of all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes to make sure electricity remains flowing, nice and steady.\n\nWhere did our electric grid come from? It's a complicated question to answer. That's because the grid we have today didn't come from any single place. Instead, its origins are scattered, distributed geographically, technologically, and philosophically.\n\nDifferent people built different parts of the grid in different ways and for different reasons. For many years\u2014up until the 1970s in some places\u2014individual towns and cities were independent grids that weren't connected to anything else around them. They functioned as little islands, incapable of reaching out for help when things went wrong.\n\nMore importantly, the grid wasn't designed. It evolved. Nobody ever really sat down and thought about how to build the best grid possible. The grid as we know it was assembled from bits and pieces, from mini-grids that were often built to be cheap and to go up quickly. Quality wasn't always priority number one.\n\nI think the story of the electric grid in Appleton, Wisconsin\u2014the second centralized electric grid in the world and the first hydroelectric power plant in the world\u2014is a great example of all of this history in action.\n\nLast month, I got to talk about Appleton at a Barnes and Noble in the Bay Area. The video of that talk went up on CSPAN Book TV yesterday. It's not available for embedding, unfortunately, but I encourage you to give it a watch. The talk covers not only history, but also the importance of writing about science online, rather than in print. You guys, as commenters at BoingBoing, have made my writing better\u2014and for that you get a shout-out. (Plus: At the 5 minute mark, you can see a little cameo of Dean and Pesco in the audience.)\n\nWhen we talk about energy, we often talk about it in very disconnected ways. By that, I mean we talk about new renewable generation projects, we talk about cleaning up dirty old power plants, and we talk about personal decisions you and I can make to use less energy, or get more benefits from the same amount.\n\nWhat we fail to talk about is how all those ideas fit together into a coherent whole. And that matters, because our energy problems (and our energy solutions) are about more than just swapping sources of power or making individual choices. We have to fix the systems, not just the symptoms.\n\nBack in April, I got to go on Minnesota Public Radio's \"Bright Ideas\" to talk about my book, Before the Lights Go Out. Now MPR has the entire hour-long interview up on video. You can watch the whole thing if you want. But, if you're short on time, I'd recommend the stretch from about minute 8:30 to 10:50. That's where I explain in more detail why systems\u2014infrastructures\u2014are so important and why we can't solve our energy problems without focusing on how choices and sources fit into those larger issues.\n\nWatch that clip, then read this Minneapolis Star-Tribune article about how investments in transportation-oriented bicycle infrastructure have changed the way Minneapolites think about biking and dramatically increased the number of people who choose to bike. I think you'll see some thematic connections."}
{"text": "Today many nations are considering an expanded role for nuclear power in their energy portfolios. This expansion is driven by concerns about global warming, growth in energy demand, and relative costs of alternative energy sources. In 2008, 435 nuclear reactors in 30 countries provided 16% of the world's electricity. In January 2009, 43 reactors were under construction in 11 countries, with several hundred more projected to come on line globally by 2030.\n\nA Nuclear Power Plant\n\nCourtesy of R2 Controls\n\nNuclear reactors produce energy through a controlled fission chain reaction (see The First Chain Reaction). While most reactors generate electric power, some can also produce plutonium for weapons and reactor fuel. Power reactors use the heat from fission to produce steam, which turns turbines to generate electricity. In this respect they are similar to plants fueled by coal and natural gas. The components common to all nuclear reactors include a fuel assembly, control rods, a coolant, a pressure vessel, a containment structure, and an external cooling facility.\n\nThe speed of the neutrons in the chain reaction determines the reactor type (Figure 1). Thermal reactors use slow neutrons to maintain the reaction. These reactors require a moderator to reduce the speed of neutrons produced by fission. Fast neutron reactors, also known as fast breeder reactors (FBR), use high speed, unmoderated neutrons to sustain the chain reaction.\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Types of Nuclear Reactors\n\nThermal reactors operate on the principle that uranium-235 undergoes fission more readily with slow neutrons than with fast ones. Light water (H2O), heavy water (D2O), and carbon in the form of graphite are the most common moderators. Since slow neutron reactors are highly efficient in producing fission in uranium-235, they use fuel assemblies containing either natural uranium (0.7% U-235) or slightly enriched uranium (0.9 to 2.0% U-235) fuel. Rods composed of neutron-absorbing material such as cadmium or boron are inserted into the fuel assembly. The position of these control rods in the reactor core determines the rate of the fission chain reaction. The coolant is a liquid or gas that removes the heat from the core and produces steam to drive the turbines. In reactors using either light water or heavy water, the coolant also serves as the moderator. Reactors employing gaseous coolants (CO2 or He) use graphite as the moderator. The pressure vessel, made of heavy-duty steel, holds the reactor core containing the fuel assembly, control rods, moderator, and coolant. The containment structure, composed of thick concrete and steel, inhibits the release of radiation in case of an accident and also secures components of the reactor from potential intruders. Finally, the most obvious components of many nuclear power plants are the cooling towers, the external components, which provide cool water for condensing the steam to water for recycling into the containment structure. Cooling towers are also employed with coal and natural gas plants.\n\nReactor Fundamentals\n\nIt is important to realize that while the U-235 in the fuel assembly of a thermal reactor is undergoing fission, some of the fertile U-238 present in the assembly is also absorbing neutrons to produce fissile Pu-239. Approximately one third of the energy produced by a thermal power reactor comes from fission of this plutonium. Power reactors and those used to produce plutonium for weapons operate in different ways to achieve their goals. Production reactors produce less energy and thus consume less fuel than power reactors. The removal of fuel assemblies from a production reactor is timed to maximize the amount of plutonium in the spent fuel (Figure 2). Fuel rods are removed from production reactors after only several months in order to recover the maximum amount of plutonium-239. The fuel assemblies remain in the core of a power reactors for up to three years to maximize the energy produced. However it is possible to recover some plutonium from the spent fuel assemblies of a power reactor.\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 The Fate of Plutonium in a Thermal Reactor\n\nThe power output or capacity of a reactor used to generate electricity is measured in megawatts of electricity, MW(e). However, due to the inefficiency of converting heat into electricity, this represents only about one third of the total thermal energy, MW(t), produced by the reactor. Plutonium production is related to MW(t). A production reactor operating at 100 MW(t) can produce 100 grams of plutonium per day or enough for one weapon every two months.\n\nAnother important property of a reactor is its capacity factor. This is the ratio of its actual output of electricity for a period of time to its output if it had been operated at its full capacity. The capacity factor is affected by the time required for maintenance and repair and for the removal and replacement of fuel assemblies. The average capacity factor for U.S. reactors has increased from 50% in the early 1970s to over 90% today. This increase in production from existing reactors has kept electricity affordable.\n\nThermal Reactors\n\nCurrently the majority of nuclear power plants in the world are water-moderated, thermal reactors. They are categorized as either light water or heavy water reactors. Light water reactors use purified natural water (H2O) as the coolant/moderator, while heavy water reactors employ heavy water, deuterium oxide (D2O). In light water reactors, the water is either pressured to keep it in superheated form (in a pressurized water reactor, PWR) or allowed to vaporize, forming a mixture of water and steam (in a boiling water reactor, BWR). In a PWR (Figure 3), superheated water flowing through tubes in the reactor core transfers the heat generated by fission to a heat exchanger, which produces steam in a secondary loop to generate electricity. None of the water flowing through the reactor core leaves the containment structure. In a BWR (Figure 4), the water flowing through the core is converted to directly to steam and leaves the containment structure to drive the turbines. Light water reactors use low enriched uranium as fuel. Enriched fuel is required because natural water absorbs some of the neutrons, reducing the number of nuclear fissions. All of the 103 nuclear power plants in the United States are light water reactors; 69 are PWRs and 34 are BWRs.\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Pressurized Water Reactor\n\nCourtesy of the Uranium Information Centre\n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Boiling Water Reactor\n\n(1) the core inside the reactor vessel creates heat, (2) a steam-water mixture is produced when very pure water (reactor coolant) moves upward through the core, absorbing heat, (3) the steam-water mixture leaves the top of the core and enters the two stages of moisture separation where water droplets are removed before the steam is allowed to enter the steam line, and (4) the steam line directs the steam to the main turbine, causing it to turn the turbine generator, which produces electricity.\n\nCourtesy of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission\n\nHeavy water reactors use D2O as the coolant/moderator, allowing natural, unenriched uranium to be used as the fuel. This is possible because D2O absorbs fewer neutrons than H2O. The heat transfer system is similar to that of the PWR, with the steam generator located within the containment structure. The heavy water reactor shown in Figure 5, known as CANDU, was developed in Canada and sold globally. The cost advantage in fuel is offset by the expense of producing D2O by a chemical exchange process or electrolysis. The individual fuel assemblies of a heavy water reactor can be replaced without shutting down the reactor, thus eliminating the down time involved with refueling a light water reactor. However, spent fuel produced by a heavy water reactor contains more plutonium and tritium than that from light water reactors. This, coupled with the difficulty in monitoring a continuously fueled reactor, causes concerns about the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Thus, heavy water is classified as a \"sensitive material\" because a nation possessing it can produce plutonium directly from natural uranium, eliminating the need for uranium enrichment.\n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Heavy Water Reactor\n\nCourtesy of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited\n\nAnother type of thermal reactor is graphite moderated and gas cooled. Twenty-six Magnox reactors (Figure 6), employing pressurized carbon dioxide as the coolant, were built in the United Kingdom but are currently being phased out of service. These gas cooled reactors have the same advantages as the heavy water reactors in that they can use natural uranium fuel and be fueled continuously.\n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Gas Cooled Reactor\n\n(Courtesy Osterreichisches \u00d6kologie-Institut)\n\nThe pebble bed represents a new design for a gas cooled reactor (Figure 7). It uses helium as the coolant and a fuel consisting of low enriched uranium dioxide coated with silicon carbide and pyrolitic carbon encased in small graphite spheres. The graphite serves as the moderator. Fresh fuel is added at the top of the reactor and the spent fuel removed from the bottom, allowing continuous operation. The helium coolant is maintained at high temperatures and pressures, which increases the efficiency of heat transfer and power production. South Africa is leading the effort to develop this reactor technology.\n\nFigure 7 \u2013 Pebble Bed Reactor\n\nCourtesy of the European Nuclear Society\n\nFast Neutron Reactors\n\nIn contrast to thermal reactors, the neutrons in a fast neutron reactor (or fast breeder reactor, FBR) are not slowed by the presence of a moderator (Figure 8). The coolant, usually a liquid sodium or lead, is a substance that does not slow or absorb neutrons. It also has excellent heat transfer properties, which allow the reactor to be operated at lower pressures and higher temperatures than thermal reactors.\n\nFigure 8 \u2013 Fast Neutron Breeder Reactor\n\nCourtesy of Nationmaster\n\nAn FBR is configured and operated to produce more fuel than it consumes. Fast neutrons are readily absorbed by fertile uranium-238, which then can undergo successive beta emissions to become fissile Pu-239. Thorium-232 is another fertile isotope that can absorb neutrons and produce fissile uranium-233 by beta emissions. These fissile isotopes can be reprocessed for nuclear reactor fuel or weapons. Because fast neutrons are not as efficient in producing fission as slow ones, FBRs require uranium oxide containing 20% U-235, plutonium oxide, or a mixture of these oxides, known as MOX, as fuel.\n\nOriginally FBRs were thought to be a means of extending global uranium resources by producing fissile Pu-239 or U-233 as reactor fuel. However, problems with reactor operations and material components combined with the discovery of new uranium deposits mean that FRBs are not economically competitive with existing thermal reactors. FBR research has produced technical advances but the limiting factor continues to be the price of FBR-produced reactor fuel versus the cost of uranium fuel. FBRs are more complex than other types of reactors and also raise concerns about the proliferation of plutonium for use in nuclear weapons.\n\nSummary of Reactor Types\n\nTable 1 summarizes the characteristics of the reactors discussed above.\n\nReactor Safety Concerns\nReactor safety has been called into question by two major accidents, one in 1979 at the Three Mile Island (TMI) nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania and the other in 1986 at Chernobyl RBMK (Reactor Bolshoy Moshchnosty Kanalnyin) in the former Soviet Union (Figure 9). The latter was the worst reactor accident in history, with 31 people dying of direct radiation poisoning and thousands more exposed to high doses of radiation over a period of nearly 20 years. Disputes still fester regarding total damage of the Chernobyl disaster, although an extensive study reported by a UN sponsored group of scientists indicates that the damage was somewhat less than earlier feared. The Chernobyl reactor used a graphite moderator and water coolant without a containment structure. Although some of the design flaws were corrected after this accident, RMBKs are considered to be the most dangerous reactors.\n\nFigure 9 - Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Following the 1986 Accident\n\nCourtesy of the U.S. Department of Energy\n\nAlthough the TMI accident was much smaller in scope and resulted in no deaths, it had a profound psychological impact on the public's view of commercial nuclear power. The TMI plant was a pressurized light-water reactor, whereas Chernobyl had a reactor design similar to the one used for the reactors at Hanford, Washington, which produced plutonium for the United States nuclear weapons. Both accidents involved human error overriding safety features built into the reactor systems. Features of the new generations of reactors including passive safety systems and fewer pipes and valves are designed to minimize the potential for accidents and to limit the damaging effects should such an accident occur.\n\nA Brief History of Nuclear Power Reactors\n\nThe first nuclear reactors were used to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. These water-cooled, graphite reactors operated in the United States from 1944 to 1982 and were also used in the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Nuclear reactors were first used to power a submarine, the USS Nautilus, in 1954. That same year the Obninsk 5 megawatt nuclear power plant in the Soviet Union became the first reactor to be linked to an electrical grid. The first commercial nuclear power plants went online at Calder Hall in the United Kingdom in 1956 and Shippingport, Pennsylvania in 1957. The number of nuclear power reactors grew at a rapid rate before leveling off in the late 1980s.\n\nIn addition to the reactors for generating electricity mentioned above, there are also 220 reactors powering ships and submarines. Another 284 reactors operating in 56 nations are used for research in a variety of areas. Approximately 20% of the electricity used in the United States is generated by 103 nuclear reactors, although no new reactors have been placed in operation since the 1970s. France leads the world in the generation of electricity with more than 70% coming from nuclear sources. France, Japan, Russia, and Great Britain reprocess spent reactor fuel from commercial reactors.\n\nInterest in nuclear power has increased driven in large part by concerns over energy supplies and climate charge. Reactor designs have evolved from the first generation of reactors cited above to the generation II systems that included the PWR, BWR, and Magnox reactors of the 1970s and 1980s (Figure 10). Table 2 includes some of the designs for generation III and III+ reactors. These systems are touted to be more economical to build and operate, as well as containing improved passive safety features. Figures 11 and 12 show some of the advances in reactor design for the European Pressured Water Reactor and the Westinghouse AP1000 PWR.\n\nFigure 10 \u2013 Evolution of Nuclear Reactors\n\nTable 2 \u2013Designs for Generation II and III+ Reactors\n\nDesign\n\nManufacturer\n\nApproximate Capacity (MWe)\n\nReactor type\n\nStatus (2008)\n\nAP 600\n\nWestinghouse\n\n650\n\nPWR\n\nCertified\n\nAP1000\n\nWestinghouse\n\n1117\n\nPWR\n\nCertified\n\nABWR\n\nGE and Tosuiba\n\n1371\n\nBWR\n\nCertified\n\nSystem 80+\n\nWestinghouse\n\n1300\n\nPWR\n\nCertified\n\nESBWR\n\nGE\n\n1550\n\nBWR\n\nUndergoing Certification\n\nEPR\n\nAREVA NP\n\n1600\n\nPWR\n\nPre-certification\n\nPebble Bed Modular\n\nWestinghouse, Eskom\n\n180\n\nHigh Temperature Graphite\n\nPre-certification\n\nCourtesy of the U.S. Energy Information Administration\n\nFigure 11 \u2013 European Pressured Water Reactor\n\nCourtesy of Areva\n\nFigure 12 \u2013 Design Features of the Westinghouse AP1000\n\nCourtesy of Westinghouse\n\nFinally, designs for Generation IV reactors are being developed for deployment by 2030.
