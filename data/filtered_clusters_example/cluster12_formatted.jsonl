At first when the pigs discover the whiskey, they consume it and many things are heard from the farmhouse. Napoleon is declared almost dead in the morning, but by the afternoon that next day things seem to be feeling much better for him. In the long term, this finding helped alter yet another commandment of animalism and it drove the pigs to an addiction. In my opinion, part of what caused Napoleon to need to go to great lengths to gain money was his desire to consume alcohol. This meant the animals worked harder and had to risk some of their own."}

What I'm trying to say is that your quiz does not include all answers that the title implies.\n\nYou aren't consistent with last names. You misspelled dally and sherri is called cherri. You also missed other greasers and put less important socials. Like Tim Shepard, he isn't very important, neither is Marcia. You also missed Greasers like Jerry and Buck. You also gave us to much time! Better luck next time!!!!!!!"}

So it is with our families and our lives. What we see as brokenness, failures, and hopelessness, God uses to refine us.

He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so that we can do the good things he planned for us long ago\" (Ephesians 2:10).\n\nMay the following discussion guide help you see the scarlet thread God is weaving into your life to make you fit for eternity.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPeggy Lynch\n\n1.

Across the book, each member of the Kim family changes. How does the new culture they have to navigate accelerate their transformations? Who changes the most? The Kims take on American attributes, but don't leave their Korean culture behind entirely. Which changes does the author portray as losses, and which as gains?\n\nAll comedy is observational. Part of the fun of Everything Asian is how bizarre the Kims find their new world, New Jersey, and how they attempt to make sense of it. Where and how does the author take advantage of these opportunities for satire?\n\nThe structure of Everything Asian is unusual. David is our narrator, yet in between his first-person chapters we get third-person tales of not just his family members but also their fellow merchants at Peddlers Town.

How does the author use David's first-person narrative to play up the way the two generations approach America?\n\nEarly on, David sees his father as a loser.

{"text": "At First Sight\n\nBuy the Book\n\nThis novel picks up a few weeks after True Believer left off, where we learn that Jeremy and Lexie are engaged. By this point, Jeremy and Lexie have known each other less than a month. How did Lexie and Jeremy know so quickly? What role, if any, did her pregnancy play into the decision? Do you know any couples personally who got engaged so quickly? How long did it take you to realize that you wanted to marry your spouse? In his biography, Nicholas says that he told Cathy that they would get married one day, within 24 hours of meeting her. She laughed, but they've been married since 1989.\nDid this factor into the author's decision to open the novel in this manner?\n\nAlvin thinks Jeremy is making a mistake and feels free to tell him so. If you were Jeremy's friend, what would you have said? Lexie is nervous about meeting Jeremy's family, and though they were referenced quite a bit in both True Believer and At First Sight, they are minor characters, in that the reader never even learns the names of Jeremy's parents. Why did the author do this? Should the characters have been developed further? Why or why not?\n\nThe story largely takes place during the forty week period while Lexie is pregnant, which always changes a relationship. Yet, during this time, Jeremy and Lexie are still getting to know each other. How does the pregnancy affect the development of the relationship? Are the developments more positive or negative? At the same time, Jeremy and Lexie are remodeling a house, and Jeremy struggles with writer's block. It seems, to Jeremy anyway, that when it rains it pours. Describe how these challenges affect Jeremy? How do they affect Lexie?\n\nMayor Gherkin plays a lesser role in this novel than in True Believer. The town, too, plays a lesser role. Doris, Jed, Rachel and Alvin, on the other hand, play more prominent roles in At First Sight. Who was the most important of the minor characters? Who was the least important? Why did the author choose to \"switch\" the prominence of the characters in the sequel?\n\nDescribe the symbolism of the mysterious lights in the cemetery. In what ways does this symbolism portrayed in the relationship between Lexie and Jeremy?\n\nWorking late one night, Jeremy receives an e-mail that calls into question whether the child is actually his. At first he dismisses it; later, however, he begins to wonder how well he really knows Lexie. Should Jeremy have told Lexie about the e-mail right away? Would he have believed her? How might the relationship have played out differently had Jeremy been less secretive? In what ways was Lexie secretive? Who was more at fault when the problems in their relationship began to arise?\n\nAfter Jeremy and Lexie are married, Jeremy takes a walk on the beach, where he spies some wild horses grazing on the dunes. This paragraph is one of the author's favorite passages in the novel. Were there any passages that you found particularly insightful, well-written or interesting?\n\nDoris tells Lexie that a happy marriage means meeting your spouse's needs, while they do the same for you. If your spouse could meet only one of your needs, what would it be? What would your spouse's be? (The Ten Needs, from the book, His Needs, Her Needs, are: Communication, Affection, Honesty, Family commitment, Financial Support, Sex, Recreational companionship, domestic support, physical attractiveness, and admiration)\n\nToward the end of the novel, just as Lexie and Jeremy are settling into life as a married couple, new tension is suddenly added to the relationship. How would you react had this happened in your marriage?\n\nThis is the first of Nicholas's novels in which life after the characters fell in love is described in detail. It's also the first novel in which the characters were in love when the book began. In what other ways was this novel different than the author's previous work? Can this novel still be described as a love story? Why or why not?"}

For Wednesday, come to class prepared to lead a discussion on the question you have chosen and also bring the beginning of a rough draft. The final essay will be on the order of two pages in length (1.5 spacing, 10 font.)\n\nThe British Hunter, Robert Wilson, respects neither one of the Macombers, whom he is guiding on safari. Summarize his attitude toward each of them. Does he have more contempt for one or the other? Do you agree with Wilson's assessment of them? If so, why? What, on the other hand, is your assessment of Wilson, both for the attitude he has toward them and the way he treats them?\n\nIn your reading of \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\", is Robert Wilson a teacher or tyrant, a hero or bully \u2013 or is he a bit of each?

How do they end for Margot?\n\nWe've noted the themes of manliness and nature in Hemingway's stories. The first theme involves a code of behavior emphasizing stoicism, courage and, in his famous phrase, \"grace under pressure.\" The second stresses the curative, purifying, redemptive powers of the natural world as opposed to the lack of honor, moral shallowness and corruption of so-called civilization. How do these themes play out in \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber?\n\nWhy is the life of the story's title character described both as \"short\" and \"happy?\" What is \"happy\" about the life that ends on the last page? What philosophy about the meaning of life does Hemingway mean to convey by the situation he describes in this story? Are the values he ascribes to Robert Wilson meant to be taken by the reader as admirable? What are the moral issues Hemingway raises in this story?"}

{"text": "The Secret Garden\n\nChapter I\n\nSummary\n\nThe omniscient narrator of The Secret Garden begins by enumerating the many defects of Mary Lennox, the ten-year-old girl who is the novel's protagonist. Mary is ugly, with skin made yellow by constant illness. At the outset of the novel, she is living in India with her parents, who have neither time nor affection for her. Her mother, who had never wanted a child at all, has entrusted Mary to the care of a number of Indian servants, whose only instructions are to keep the unloved child out of her mother's sight. Mrs. Lennox is described as a famously beautiful, elegant woman, who does nothing but attend fashionable parties. Though everyone is acquainted with and admires Mrs. Lennox, nearly no one knows that she has a little girl, so totally is the embarrassingly ugly child kept from public view. As the servants are obliged to give Mary whatever she wants (lest her parents be disturbed by her crying), Mary becomes terribly spoiled, selfish, and dictatorial. She loves no one, and no one cares at all for her.\n\nThis already unhappy state of affairs is made worse when a cholera epidemic breaks out in the Indian village where the Lennoxes are living. The family does not manage to flee in time to escape the epidemic because Mary's mother, in the spirit of thoughtless egotism that is typical of her, has insisted upon staying to attend a dinner party. On the morning that the cholera finally strikes the Lennox bungalow, Mary's Ayah (the Indian woman who serves as her nanny) does not come to tend to her. Left utterly unsupervised, Mary wanders into the garden and begins to play by herself beneath a tree. There, she overhears a conversation between her mother and a British officer, after which the events of the morning are explained to her. The fact that her Ayah has died of the cholera does not bother Mary at all, as she did not love her nanny or anyone else.\n\nThe household is seized by terror and confusion, and in the ensuing chaos Mary is completely forgotten. She shuts herself in her room, and does nothing but cry and sleep for more than a day. When she finally ventures out, the house seems eerily deserted, as though it has been abandoned. Mary drinks a glass of wine left standing on the dining-room table. The wine causes her to fall into a deep sleep that lasts many hours. When she awakes, a small green snake with glittering eyes is the only living creature besides Mary herself left in the bungalow\u2014everyone else, including her parents, has died or fled. A party of British soldiers finds her there and takes the newly-orphaned child away with them.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe first chapter of The Secret Garden goes to great lengths to establish Mary Lennox as a \"tyrannical and selfish little pig,\" who is as ugly as she is hateful: she beats her servants, calls them appalling names, and does not mourn her nanny's death. However, the chapter also lays the blame for Mary's flaws at the feet of her parents, particularly her mother. It thereby introduces one of the novel's central themes: the notion that children must be loved if they are to be capable of loving, and given examples of virtue if they are to be virtuous.\n\nThe first chapter also presents Mary as a sickly child. Though the source of her sickness is not entirely clear, the novel subtly attributes it to her childhood in India: \"Her face was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another.\" India, clearly, is no place for an English child, though the novel suggests that India is at fault, rather than the British invasion of the country.\n\nThe relation between health and location and the relation between well-being and beauty are important motifs throughout The Secret Garden. India is presented as a place which breeds illness and ugliness, as both Mary and her father take ill during their time there; though her mother is beautiful, her beauty conceals a moral illness, or an illness of the soul. Illness and its ostensible causes are pivotal to the novel as a whole.\n\nMary is not loved, for she is an unwanted child whose ugliness is a source of great embarrassment to her mother. Mary is thus positioned as the first of the many secrets which animate the novel: she is herself secreted away from view, and her parents' friends have no idea that they have a child at all. The soldiers who discover her at chapter's end are shocked to find her, and refer to her as \"the child no one ever saw.\" Furthermore, no one takes care of her except the native servants, who do so only because they are commanded to, not because they have affection for her: they forget her entirely when they flee the bungalow.\n\nThe relationship between the servants and the Lennox family is left largely unexplored by the novel, but implies a great deal about British colonialism in India. The servants must obey Mary's every wish, and even must withstand her beatings, because they depend upon her parents for their survival - their disobedience may carry with it the threat of death. This is made painfully clear by the fact that the servants remain with the family, even though they recognize the threat the cholera presents; many of them die because they did not flee earlier.\n\nWhat befalls Mary after the onset of the epidemic has a certain fairy-tale character. The empty dining room with its abandoned meal conjures the tale of \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\"; Mary's drinking of the glass of sweet wine recalls Alice in Wonderland, while the oblivious sleep it causes is reminiscent of \"Sleeping Beauty.\" As in a fairy story, Mary awakens from her sleep to find that her world has entirely changed. The motif of sleep recurs as a state in which one \"knows nothing more for a long time\"\u2014that is, as a state of oblivion to be contrasted with the desirable state of wakefulness, which is associated with liveliness and curiosity. The empty house, the tiny snake \"with eyes like jewels\" who serves as her only companion, and Mary's orphaned state itself also seem borrowed from fairy-tales. Fairy-tales and their promises will also recur later in the novel, though they are left implicit here."}

{"text": "I Am the Cheese\n\nTAPE OZK012\n\nSummary\n\nAdam tells Brint that he went down to the cellar and waited for his father, even ignoring the phone call from Amy.\n\nA third-person narrator describes how Adam remembers sitting in darkness until his father finds him in the cellar. His father asks him several times if he is all right. Finally, Adam asks him about Grey and Martha. His father sighs with sadness and asks how much he knows. Adam's father has dreaded the day when Adam asked questions about the family's past.\n\nIn a dialogue with Brint, Adam says that his father told him that his real name was Paul Delmonte, and that there was no Adam Farmer. He says his father told him almost everything about their history. They were, indeed, running away that night on the bus. The Delmonte/Farmer family fled that day in the woods, as well, because his father thought he had seen one of \"them.\" Adam is unsure who \"they\" are now.\n\nIn a third person narrative, Adam remembers back to his conversation in the cellar. His father revealed that his own real name was Anthony Delmonte, and he had been a reporter in the small town of Blount, New York, for the Blount Telegrapher. He was quickly promoted to political reporter, even covering the state capital in Albany. He won a prestigious national award for a series of articles detailing small government corruption in Blount. Anthony Delmonte then married Louise Nolan and they had a son, Paul.\n\nBack in a dialogue with Brint, Adam questions Brint's motives. Brint tells Adam that his motives do not matter and he presses him about the bus ride.\n\nAdam remembers his father telling him he had uncovered important documents at the State House in Albany. Adam tells Brint that the documents linked the corrupt state and federal government to organized crime. His father testified in Washington, D.C. before a closed Senate committee. In return for giving evidence to the investigators, he would be protected and his identity kept secret. For a year, he hid in hotel rooms and visited his guarded house only occasionally while Louise took care of the infant Adam.\n\nAdam says his father did not reveal everything so that Adam would be \"protected against betrayal\" if he were questioned. Brint asks him what he means by betrayal, but Adam is again unsure. Brint believes Adam is withholding knowledge. Adam tells him that his father finally returned to his job in Blount\u2014his editor had given him a leave of absence, thinking he was researching a book. Based on his father's testimony, there were hushed arrests and resignations in Washington. Adam's father was just happy to be back with his family.\n\nA narrator describes how Adam remembers when there was a bomb planted in his father's car. A local policeman had seen two strangers lurking near the Delmonte house, and a phone call warned Adam's father to stay in the house. The police discovered the bomb and a bomb squad defused it. A few days later, Anthony was working late at the newspaper. As he left, the police officer assigned to guard the building pulled a gun on Anthony. Mr. Grey shot the phony guard before the guard shot Anthony. That was the night Mr. Grey became a fixture in the Delmonte's lives.\n\nAdam tells Brint that Grey was one of the first men behind a new government program, the U.S. Department of Re-Identification, and had been attached to Anthony's case from the start.\n\nA third-person narrator describes how Adam remembers talking to his father incessantly once he learned about the Farmer's situation. Adam and his father spoke in a variety of locations\u2014his father explained that the cellar room was cleared for hidden bugs, and that otherwise they should talk in public places or while they are on the move. Adam explains that Grey's department was developed to protect witnesses who testified against powerful organizations, such as the Mafia. Many of these witnesses lived new lives under assumed names. Grey had told his father that his men had foiled the two murder attempts, but that eventually they would get him if he did not join the department. When Louise received a threatening phone call one night, Adam explains that Anthony reluctantly agreed to join.\n\nAdam tells Brint that, because this was in the early days of the protection program, it was not a completely efficient process. The second birth certificate was a mistake, for instance, but Anthony kept it in case they needed it. They were given the name Farmer\u2014which Anthony hated, since it changed their background to Protestant\u2014and the family relocated to Monument. Grey kept them in the Northeast so that they would not stand out, but there was little chance of anyone's tracing them back to Blount.\n\nA third-person narrator describes why there was little chance of the criminal organization tracing the Delmontes. Adam's father showed him a newspaper clipping in the cellar one night. The headline reported that the family had been killed in a car crash.\n\nAdam and Brint end the session.\n\nAnalysis\n\nMany of the previous plot mysteries are explained here, such as why the Rawlings editor did not know the Farmers. Adam's discussions with his father also explain why the emotional world of the Farmers, especially for Adam's mother, has been so dark. Adam's real name, \"Paul,\" could be a reference to \"pall,\" a covering for a coffin. Adam's family has covered the coffins of their former lives, as has Adam in his memory. In the beginning of the novel, Adam also talks about his fear of being confined in small places, like an \"upright coffin.\" Cormier skillfully deploys this information through Adam's direct conversation with Brint and through his memories, so that the reader understands Adam's horrified reaction to first learning about his past, and his fear of re-remembering what he had learned.\n\nJust as Anthony opposed an organization that had more power than he did, so does Adam, it seems, with Brint. Brint manipulates Adam like a puppet with medication and commands him to remember certain pieces of information. Adam begins to suspect openly for the first time that Brint, a somewhat cold figure all along, is trying to squeeze Adam for information that should be irrelevant, an accusation that Brint denies.\n\nInterestingly, the major revelations do not come at end of the book, as in a typical mystery novel, but only two-thirds of the way through the story. Cormier withholds other plot mysteries, such as whom the Delmontes ran away from and how Adam ended up in the institution. More important, Cormier holds back the emotional mystery, such as what will happen on Adam's journey to his father and through his conversations with Brint, and whether he will be able to handle the newfound information about his identity. The main purpose of this mystery, then, is not detective-story conventions about a criminal's identity, but Adam's emotional struggle with his own identity and his discovery of who he really is. The identity realization does not unfold as a typical coming-of-age story, in which the protagonist discovers who he is through experiences of maturation. Instead, Adam learns about his identity in systematic fragments, where the discovery of his identity is not necessarily a good thing."}

What are they? Later, in chapter 4, when Hildie and Trip argue about Hildie's going back to work, Trip says, \"A little girl shouldn't be alone so much. Things could happen.\" Discuss the irony in that statement. What is it about their family dynamics that makes Carolyn vulnerable to a predator like Dock?\n\n2. Do you think Hildie's character changes from book 1 to 2? If so, how does she change and why? Did you like her more or less in this book?\n\n3. Carolyn runs away\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014after getting the news of her brother's tragic death. Is that a realistic response? Why or why not? Have you ever wished you could run away from a painful reality? How did you deal with it? Have you ever been in the place of Carolyn's parents and grandmother\u2014not knowing the whereabouts of someone you love? What was that like? What advice would you give someone who is facing such a situation?\n\n4. When Carolyn meets Mary in Golden Gate Park, Mary says she felt an impulse to make extra sandwiches that morning, even though she had no idea why. Have you ever felt God nudging you to do something you didn't understand? Did you follow through on that impulse? Why or why not?\n\n5. After Carolyn comes home following her two-year disappearance, neither Hildie nor Trip presses her for details about what happened. Do you think that is wise? How does this both help and hurt Carolyn? In your own life, how can you balance being nosy with being concerned for those you love?\n\n6. When Carolyn graduates from college and pays off her debt to her parents, Trip and Hildie give the money back to her. Were you surprised by Trip and Hildie's action? Why or why not? Why is it hard for Carolyn to accept their gift? Have you ever given or received an unexpected, extravagant gift? What was the motivation behind it? What was the response?\n\n7. For many years, Carolyn finds more appealing fellowship and support in AA than she does in the church. Why is that? What does that say about AA? about the church? What finally changes Carolyn's view of Christians? Do you know anyone who has a negative view of the church? What could you say or do to encourage them to give the church another chance? What other influences does God bring into Carolyn's life to show her the truth of His love for her?\n\n8. Near the end of the story, Hildie reflects that God sent Mitch to rescue her, just as he had rescued Carolyn years earlier. In what ways does Mitch \"rescue\" Carolyn? How might her life have been different if she had never married? if she had married someone less understanding and supportive?\n\n9. Marta's choice not to move to Jenner by the Sea with Hildie and Trip seems to finally make the gap between mother and daughter so wide it can't be crossed. Why does Hildie think Marta doesn't want to move in with them? What does Marta really want? Why are they unable to discuss it rationally?\n\n10. In chapter 30, when Dawn and Carolyn go to visit Marta for a week, Marta says that \"making things easier on your children is sometimes the worst thing you can do.\" Do you agree or disagree? How do you see this illustrated in the story? in your own life?\n\n11. How does Marta change over the course of the two books? What changes her the most? In what ways is she still the same?\n\n12. When Dawn confesses to her mother that she slept with Jason, Carolyn's response is gracious and nonjudgmental. How do Carolyn's own experiences play into her response to Dawn? How would you respond to such a confession from your son or daughter? How would you like to respond?\n\n13. How does Dawn's experience of the church after she sleeps with Jason differ from Carolyn's experience after returning from Haight-Ashbury? Why is it different? How does Paster Daniel's gracious response affect Dawn's future and her walk with Christ? Have you ever been in a position to counsel someone who has made a mistake they think cannot be forgiven? What did (or would) you say?\n\n14. Near the end of the story, Dawn makes an important decision that affects the life of her unborn child. How might her struggle with miscarriage and infertility have affected her decision? What would you have done in Dawn's place? Discuss her choice not to talk about it with either her husband or her family. Was that the right way to handle it? Why or why not? How do you think Jason felt when he learned what had happened?\n\n15. In chapter 55, Dawn reads this excerpt from Marta's journal: \"We try to do a little better than the previous generation and find out in the end we've made the same mistakes without intending.\" How do you see this illustrated in the story? How have you seen negative behaviors easily turn into a habit in your own life, as Hildie mentions in chapter 56?\n\n16. When the three generations (Hildemara, Carolyn, and May Flower Dawn) finally sit down to talk, they discuss many of their \"family secrets.\" Discuss the revelations and the effect of finally getting them out into the open. Are you satisfied with what they talk about and how it goes? In what way do you wish it had been handled differently? Are the responses realistic and/or what you expected?\n\n17. At one point, Marta tells Dawn that people either weigh you down or give you wings. How do some of the characters in this saga give people wings? What can you do in your own relationships to give those you love wings instead of weighing them down?\n\n18. While Scripture makes it clear that children are not held responsible for their parents' sins (see Ezekiel 18:20), it's also true that destructive patterns tend to continue in families and have a negative impact on successive generations (see Exodus 20:5). Over the span of these two novels, what relationship patterns are repeated between mothers and daughters? between grandmothers and granddaughters? In what ways are the patterns finally broken? Is the resolution realistic? What relationship patterns\u2014either negative or positive\u2014have occurred in your family? If the patterns are negative, what have you done or what could you do to break them?\n\n19. Are there secrets in your family\u2014either from generations past or from the present? To whom would you like to talk about these secrets? What kind of response do you think you would get? What response would you hope for?\n\n20. This novel contains many relationships, conversations, rifts, and moments of reconciliation.

These reading comprehension worksheet answers are affiliated with the article, so they won't really make much sense by themselves!\n\nReading Comprehension Worksheet 2 Answers\n\n1. Sainte- P\u00e9lagie, Jean Francois' place of imprisonment, used to be a\n\n(C) fencing school\n\nWhy? In line 32, at the end of paragraph five, the reader learns that Jean Francois is imprisoned at Sainte-P\u00e9lagie. Paragraph six begins to describe the living conditions there and in line 40, a room is described, which is filled with all the \"all the old apparatus of a fencing school,\u2014broken masks, rusty foils, leather jackets and gloves with the stuffing half out. It was there that the political prisoners had dinner together\u2026\" So we see that the room, and hence, most likely, the prison, had once been a fencing school.\n\nWhy? The answer lies in paragraph two, when Jean Francois describes where the police found him - in \"ruined houses\" after his mother dies (lines 6 \u2013 7). We can infer that he was living in those ruined houses, working with the brush seller and catgut scraper, and that when the police found him, he was arrested for being homeless, a crime at the time.\n\n3. The sentence on line 20: \"He talked this way openly, cynically, like a man.\" primarily serves to\n\n(D) demonstrate the effect the protagonist's misfortune has had on his young life.\n\nWhy? Here, with a question that may seem to have a few correct answers, it may be useful to get rid of obviously wrong answers, first. Choice A, \"present new information about the protagonist so his actions are better understood,\" is incorrect because there is no new information about him presented \u2013 just previous info expounded upon. Choice B is incorrect because he never argued against reform school. Choice C is wrong because at that point, he didn't show any signs of cunning, and Choice E is incorrect because although there was definite back-story in paragraph two, there is no back-story presented in the sentence itself, and the question relates only to this one line. Hence, choice D must be correct.\n\n4. You could infer that the group Jean Francois joins after his second arrest would most desire to\n\n(E) overthrow the government\n\nWhy? The key to this answer lies in the words \"most desire to.\" What would \"political prisoners\" (line 41) who meet in the leader's room, have violent disputes, welcome a newcomer with the name \"citizen\" and plot governmental offices (as the hunchback does in the last two lines) most want to achieve? Political stature, which can only happen by an overthrow. Choice E.\n\n5. The following are all incidents prior to Jean Francois' initial arrest EXCEPT\n\n(B) Jean Francois commits petty theft\n\nWhy? Jean Francois commits petty theft in line 31, which is his second arrest. Paragraph two contains all of the other choices, which happens before he's arrested for vagabondage, his first run-in with the law."}

{"text": "The correct answer is D. Because the husband is speaking, and the wife has refused his request to turn around, we can assume that he believes she's deliberately provoking him or infuriating him enough to cause action. Choice E, threaten is obviously too harsh. More than likely, she wouldn't threaten anyone. Choices A and C are not close to the meaning; to coerce means to force someone to do something, and to intimidate means to get someone to do something by fear. He intimidates and coerces her, not vice versa. The only choice that's close is Choice B, hassle. However, because the word tends to have a more light-hearted connotation, Choice D is the better answer.\n\n2. Which of the following is NOT a likely inference based on the information in the passage?\n\nA. Patty from down the road is the wife's best friend.\nB. The husband seems to be truly sorry for what he's done at the end.\nC. The wife sees no way out of the relationship but suicide.\nD. The husband values his job more than his wife.\nE. The housekeeper found the wife in the bathtub.\n\nThe correct answer is A. Here, we're looking for the one phrase that we could NOT infer from the passage. Choice B IS a likely inference; he cries at the end. Choice C IS a likely inference since the wife commits suicide in the story (or the evidence points to that). Choice D IS a likely inference, since the husband ignores the wife's obvious turmoil and goes to his meeting in Chicago instead of staying with her. Plus he assaults her regularly. Choice E IS a likely inference, because the housekeeper reported that the wife had an empty Valium bottle in her hand. Choice A IS NOT a likely inference because a best friend wouldn't be referred to as \"Patty from down the road\". Plus, it seems likely that the wife probably didn't have a best friend at all if suicide seems like the only way out for her.\n\n3. The author most likely includes the information in lines 10 \u2013 14 in order to:\n\nA. compare what happened to the wife recently to the abuse that happened in her childhood.\nB. explain that the husband had a pattern of abuse and probably wouldn't stop any time soon.\nC. demonstrate the wife's weakness.\nD. intensify the scene by describing the wife's injuries in full detail.\nE. critique the wife's willingness to let her husband get away with physical abuse.\n\nThe correct answer is B. Here, we need to look closely at the lines indicated by the question and ask, \"Why did the author write these lines specifically?\" Choice B is the best answer because the lines show how his open hand, his fist and a belt have all administered abuse. If it happened in the past, it will probably continue to happen. Choice A is not correct because although a comparison is made (at least it's not with the belt), it's not comparing any kind of abuse other than domestic violence. Choice C is incorrect because although the wife does appear weak throughout the story, during those lines, she's ironic, offering an almost positive outlook on her abuse. Choices D and E are inaccurate because the wife's injuries aren't described in much detail and no critique of her behavior is made.\n\nA. Her husband takes a flight to Chicago.\nB. Her husband walks into the house.\nC. Her husband runs through the rain.\nD. Her husband slams his fist into the wall.\nE. Her husband purchases roses.\n\nThe correct answer is E. This is simply a matter of remembering the chronology of the story and reading accurately. Which events come after the beginning of the story when the wife is looking out the window? Well, the only thing that could have happened before the wife looks out the window, which is an easier way to tackle the question, is the husband purchasing roses because he walks in with them while she's standing at the window. Hence, everything else must come after.\n\n5. The passage provides information that answers which of the following questions?\n\nI. Does the husband hold a powerful position at work?\nII. What kind of personality traits does the wife display?\nIII. Does the wife's relationships with others in the neighborhood affect her married life?\n\nA. I only\nB. I and II only\nC. I and III only\nD. II and III only\nE. I, II, and III\n\nThe correct answer is B. This is a funny question in that you don't have to actually answer the questions behind the Roman Numerals. Your only goal is to determine whether or not you could answer the questions based on the information given in the text if you needed to. Question I is answerable (he has to fly to Chicago; he has purchased a Mercedes; they employ a housekeeper, etc.). We can reasonably assume that he has a powerful position, so we can answer that question. Question II is answerable (she is meek, forgiving, weak, a sucker for punishment, etc.) We could name a bunch of different personality traits of the wife. Question III, however, is unanswerable because we don't know about any relationships she has with anyone in the neighborhood besides Patty. And that one seems very cursory at best. Therefore, the correct answer is Choice B. The passage provides info to answer questions I and II only."}

Does he appear to help Rhonda?\n\n3. Certain chapters of the book are called \"Tell Me\" or \"Tell Me More\". They consist of conversations between Rhonda and Dr. Angel-Hair in a mental hospital.

Why does Jake agree to go back in time? At this stage in your own life, would you be willing to travel back to the past? What conditions would you require to do so?\n\n2. What does Jake's first stop in Derry, Maryland, have to do with Dallas, Texas? Why does King inject this subplot into the main plot? What is the point he wants to make regarding the events in Derry? Is Derry necessary to the plot\u2014or does it drag down the novel's pace?\n\n3. Describe the kind of world that Jake of 2011 finds himself in when he arrives in 1958? What changes have 50 years made in our culture? What has not changed? Do you...would you...prefer to live in one era over the other? If you were alive during the 50s and 60s, what do you recall of your life and world events? Are you ever nostalgic?\n\n4. Once in Texas, what does Jake, now George Amberson, come to learn about Lee Harvey Oswald as a human being? What kind of character is Oswald? How would you describe him?\n\n5. When Oswald arrives on the scene, why doesn't Amberson just take him out? Why does he delay?\n\n6. Follow-up to Question 5: Who is de Mohrenschildt and what is his connection to Oswald?\n\n7. Follow-up to Questions 5 & 6: What makes George (and the author) conclude that Oswald acted alone? What do you think? Have you done any prior reading that would make you agree or disagree that Oswald as the lone gunman?\n\n8. Amberson has come to believe that life is not random:\n\nCoincidences happen, but I've come to believe they are actually quite rare. Something is at work, O.K.? Somewhere in the universe (or behind it), a great machine is ticking and turning its fabulous gears.\n\nWhat does Amberson mean and what makes him believe this? Many believe in an over-arching fate or in God who oversees\u2014and intervenes in\u2014our lives. People often say, \"things happen for a reason.\" Do they? Are coincidences truly rare\u2014is chance a major force in the universe? Or is there a something greater at work? What do you think?\n\n9. Follow-up to Question 8: Discuss this passage from the novel below. What does it mean? Do you agree with the vision of the world it presents, particularly the last sentence?\n\n.... A universe of horror and loss surrounding a single lighted stage where mortals dance in defiance of the dark.\n\n10. Follow-up to Questions 8, 9 & even 2: Talk about harmonics, echoes, and the butterfly effect. What are they? How do they play out in this book? What do they suggest about the danger of tampering with the past?\n\n11. Do the events in the novel\u2014transporting Jake from 2011 to 1958, moving him from Maine to Texas, and putting him near the Oswalds\u2014seem at all plausible? Is King able to construct his plot in such a way that it makes sense? Or is the entire construct too preposterous to be enjoyable or taken seriously as literature?\n\n12. How does King handle the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis? Do you find his treatment of it suspenseful? Or because you know the outcome, is recapping the event dull and uneventful?\n\n13. King paints a dire portrait of the world at large in the 50s and 60s\u2014the geopolitics and existential dread of nuclear war. He's a horror writer, after all. Yet in many ways, the centerpiece of the novel is George's relationship with Sadie\u2014the detail of their small, beautiful romance. Why would King choose to juxtapose the grand scale with the quotidian of everyday life\u2014and an intimate love story at that?\n\n14. Why does Sadie sense that there's something odd about George? What are some of the ways that George's knowledge of the future betray him?\n\n15. Follow-up to Question 14: Why doesn't George tell Sadie who he is? How would you handle such information if you were told that the person you loved came from the future?\n\n16. What about George's sports betting? Is it a fair way to make a living? It's certainly not honest, but then again...why not? Has Jake's moral compass shifted somehow, now that he's George Amberson?\n\n17. Discuss the Yellow Card Man. What is the symbolic significance?\n\n18. How would you classify this book\u2014Historical fiction? Science fiction? Alternate history? Romance? Thriller? Is it a suspenseful read\u2014did you find yourself rushing to turn the page? Were you expecting George to succeed\u2014or fail\u2014in his mission?\n\n19. Talk about George's decision to return to 2011. Do you wish he had made a different choice? What about Sadie?\n\n20. When Jake returns to the present, in what way are things different? Is the world a better place? What does the novel suggest about the ability to change events...and thus change the course of history\u2014a good thing or dangerous thing?\n\n21. If you've read other Stephen King books, or seen the movies, how does this book compare with his others? Has he jumped his usual genre...or expanded it? Does that fact that King's normal genre is fantasy-horror make him especially equipped as an author to write a book like 11/22/63?\n\n(Questions issued by LitLovers.

{"text": "Some Initial Questions:\n\n1. At least since medieval times, Europeans and then Americans have associated\ncertain vices with particular colors. It remains common, for example, to\nspeak of someone \"turning green with envy\" or \"black with\nrage.\" Yellow was associated with jealousy. Jealousy is frequently\nused as a synonym for envy, but envy is rarely used as a synomyn for jealousy.\nThis is because the first meaning of jealousy involves suspiciousness about\nthe feelings or fidelity of another. Minny is not jealous in this primary\nsense. Instead she is covetous; she envies the possessions of others. So\nthe author had a choice. Minny did not have to turn yellow. She could have\nturned green. Why might the author have chosen yellow as Minny's punishment?\nWho else in the United States in the late 1870s was considered \"yellow\"?\n\n2. It is the parrot who gets to pronounce Minny's fate. Why not her wronged\nsister? or her mother who had warned her this could happen?"}

{"text": "Leaning against the mantlepieceWritten by Delories (10/26/2006 3:29 a.m.)in consequence of the missive, Willoughby's attitude?, penned by Ann2\n\nAs far as I know, the way people of Elinor & Willoughby's class held themselves, the posture of their bodies, I mean, was much straighter than the way most of us do now. They bowed and curtsied to one another; shaking hands was still quite \"modern\". Although clothes had loosened up a bit in the previous decade or so, women did wear corsets, and the sort of \"stocks\" and collars men wore under theri chins did the same thing: people kept their backs straight, their heads up, didn't lean against the backs of their chairs, etc.\n\nSo for W. to just settle back against the mantlepiece as if for a longer chat is a sign of being extremely relaxed, as if, in our day, someone sat down on the sofa and put their feet up, as it were. That's why the gesture strikes me as so extraordinary; and remember, he does it _as soon as_ he got what he came for, what his vanity demands: Elinor's \"forgiveness\"."}

{"text": "\"It is so very uncomfortable, not having a carriage of one's own. Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove took me, and we were so crowded! They are both so very large, and take up so much room; and Mr. Musgrove always sits forward. So there was I crowded into the back seat with Henrietta and Louisa; and I think it very likely that my illness to-day may be owing to it.\"\n\nAt first I took this to mean that Mr. Musgrove always sits *facing* forward, (and IMO as far as motion sickness is concerned, it's always more comfortable to sit facing the direction your vehicle is travelling in) but then why does Mary add that *she* was sitting in the back seat?\n\nAm I picturing this wrong, or is Mr. Musgrove actually in the habit of taking the *less* comfortable seat, and Mary is just grumbling because she wants a carriage of her own?\n\nOne thing I noticed this time around is that although Mary complains about how much room both her parents-in-law take up, in fact she wasn't sitting next to them at all, but on the other seat beside her sisters-in-law. So, it wouldn't really matter *how* fat or skinny the senior Musgroves were - if there were 5 people in the carriage, Mary's chances of being squashed would still have depended on whether she was sitting next to one other person or two other people (unless there was little leg room as well)!"}
{"text": "1. What ultimately caused Debra to find her \"clout\" and helped her to change her life?\n\n2. How did Debra's mother, and even grandmothers, help and hurt Debra's chances for a successful life? In what ways is Debra like and unlike them? What learned or inherited mothering skills\u2014good and bad\u2014helped make Debra into the mother she became?\n\n3. How did Debra's father influence her choices in male partners? She says, with regard to self-esteem: \"just because you know you don't have enough doesn't mean you get some.\" It seems clear that she knows all along that she should avoid unstable men but doesn't. Why? In the end, when she makes a better choice for a life partner, why has her judgment improved?\n\n4. How did Debra come to terms with the \"race\" issue she and Marie constantly faced in small town Texas? She says she never saw her motherhood as political, \"but it has its political moments, and I can't back down.\" Should she have been more activist? Why or why not?\n\n5. Strangers comment on the fact that Debra has no extended family. Who plays the role of extended family for Debra? Also, Debra regrets chances not taken to mend her relationship with her own mother and, at the end, worries if she's repeating this mistake with her father. What determines how much contact we have with our family of origin?\n\n6. Debra seems to see this adoption as her last great chance to enter the ranks of the \"normal.\" Is she na\u00efve about this? Does she ignore the possibility that the way she sets out to make a home and family, and where, will increase her isolation? How does the ending speak to her sense of identity? Has she made peace with this longing for normalcy?\n\n7. How do Debra's travails with Marie's hair teach her about an unfamiliar culture and, consequently, about herself? Why does Marie's hair care seem so symbolic to Debra?\n\n8. Debra continually finds herself as the solo female in groups of men: the workers on her house, the workers on her yard and fence, and her graduate school friends. How did her interactions with each group help or hinder her growth toward greater strength and stability?\n\n9. Debra is both a single mother and a mother in an interracial family. Which circumstance seems most challenging?\n\n10. How much does the sense of place inform this book? If she'd bought a house in the college town where she teaches, or one of the neighboring cities, in what ways would the story change?\n\n11. The book uses a quote from Iris Murdoch as an epigraph: \"Emotions really exist at the bottom of the personality or at the top. In the middle they are acted.\" This quote suggests that we make compromises as we try to be true to ourselves and yet also belong to a community. To be true to ourselves can feel right but isolating. Living in communities can feel cozy, but it requires white lies and self-effacement, too. What does the book say about finding the balance between living alone and living with others? How do we find this balance?\n\n12. Debra's aunt says at the end of the first chapter, \"The meaning of life is children and old people. And death.\" Has Debra discovered this meaning for herself by the end of the book? Do you agree with the aunt's statement?\n\n13. Debra writes: \"The sprawling mess of life is why we need stories, a fleeting sense of order so we return to life with the unproven but irresistible conviction our mistakes and emergencies matter, so life might make sense too.\" Do you see your own life as a story that makes sense? How do specific emergencies in the book create a greater meaning and in the end seem to impart a message? What message"}

As he\ndid so he saw for the first time the two passengers\non top, and as he gazed at them a gleam of fire shot\ninto his eyes and his hands nervously griped at his\nweapon.\n\n\"Alexander Filmore, you here!\" he ejaculated,\nhis voice betraying his surprise.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the elder Filmore, coldly\u2014\u00ad\"here\nto shoot you, you dastardly dog,\" and quickly\nraising a pistol, he took rapid and deadly aim, and\nfired.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote B: A fact.]\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nNOT YET!\n\nWith a groan Deadwood Dick fell to the ground, blood\nspurting from a wound in his breast.

{"text": "Some of the books I've read!\n\nWhat is the major conflict in your book? Ronnie hasn't talked to her father in three years because her parents got a divorce and he left. Since her and her father used to play the piano together, she refuses to play it. Now she has to spend an entire summer with him, away from her friends and her New York. It also doesn't help that she has gotten caught shoplifting twice.\n\nWhat causes the conflict to occur? What are some of the obstacles that lead to the conflict? Ronnie's dad gets put in the hospital, and she finds out he has cancer and didn't have much time left.\n\nWhat is the most exciting part of the plot? Is this when the conflict is resolved? As the summer progresses, Ronnie meets Will, a volleyball player who happens to be very rich and falls in love with him. She also becomes closer with her father, telling him things she would never think of telling her mom.\n\nHow is the conflict resolved? Is this what you expected? Explain. Ronnie's dad has been trying to write a song but just couldn't seem to get it right. When he gets out of the hospital, he isn't strong enough to work on it, so Ronnie starts to work on it. When she finishes it she plays it for him. By the end of the book, Ronnie matured so much. Instead of thinking that her father constantly played the piano so that she would play again, she realized that her father always played because that was what he loved to do.\n\nDescribe the setting in the book. What visual images do you see in your head? Give examples in the book that lead you to these images.\n\nUse the sensory images: visual, taste, smell, movement, etc. As I read the book, I could visualize the ocean's waves crashing into the tide, the smell of the salt water, and the cool summer breeze. The setting reminded me of the lazy, laid back feeling of summer.\n\nDescribe an important symbol in the book. What is the symbol? Ronnie finds a turtle nest on her 3rd night at her dad's house, and sleeps out by them when a raccoon almost destroyed it. The turtles are an important symbol in the book because it shows that Ronnie isn't as bad as she looks. Also as the turtles get closer and closer to hatching, Ronnie gets more and more mature.\n\nWhat effect do the events in plot have on the characters?\n\nHow do the characters change throughout the book? Ronnie went from being rebellious and hating her dad to getting along with him.\n\nDescribe a questionable action by one of the characters. Do you think they were right or wrong? Why? When her dad hides the piano because Ronnie doesn't want to see it. I think he shouldn't have done that and should have explained why he likes to play the piano, but that wouldn't have made a good book.\n\nCompare and contrast two characters in your book. Blaze and Ronnie's parents are both divorced and they're rebellious. Blaze is more of a push over and does whatever Marcus tells her to, but Ronnie sees right through him.\n\nDescribe an important passage in the book. Why is it important? \"Her mind flashed on a dozen different images: Suddenly she knew why her dad wanted her and Jonah to come to North Carolina. And she understood that her mom had known the truth all along. With so little time left together, he had no desire to argue with her. And his ceaseless work on the window now made perfect sense. She recalled his coughing fit in the church and the times he'd winced in pain. In hindsight, the pieces all fit together. Yet everything was falling apart.\" (321) this is important because it was a big turning point in the book and she finally realized that it really wasn't all about her.\n\nWhat other books or stories could you compare this book to? How are they similar? How are they different? The Last Song is like Dear John and all the other Nickolas Sparks books. They pretty much all have to do with love and loss. The only thing that's different is the characters and the problems they face.\n\nWhere there any words that you did not know the definition? Did you look the word up in the dictionary? If you didn't, how did you determine what the word meant? I don't really remember struggling on any words, but when I do come across a word I don't know, I usually read on to see if I can just figure out the meaning.\n\nWas there a moment in the book when you were surprised, angered, upset, excited or happy? Describe the scene and what evoked this emotion. I was sad when Ronnie and Will found Jonah in the shed trying to finish the stained glass window because he believed that if he finished it his dad would get better.\n\nAre there any parts of the story that are confusing? Why? There really wasn't any part of the story that was confusing to me.\n\nIf you could ask the author one question, what would it be and why?\n\nWould you recommend this book to someone else? Why or why not? Use specific examples from the book to answer this question. Yes because it's a typical coming of age and it's a good to read if you are just in the crying mood. It shows how death makes people grow up faster than they usually would."}

{"text": "Reading Guide Questions\n\nThese discussion questions are designed to enhance your group's conversation about Wrecker, a heartfelt novel about a group of misfits who form an unusual family amid the trees and valleys of California's Lost Coast.\n\nAbout this book Wrecker is three years old and alone in the world. His mother, Lisa Fay, has high hopes for her son, but the temptations of San Francisco in the 1960s land her in prison. Lisa Fay's sister, Meg, gets custody of Wrecker, but a botched root canal has left Meg brain damaged and fully dependent on her devoted husband, Len. It falls to Len to adopt Wrecker, a skittish but fearless child, but Len quickly realizes that he can't manage both Meg and Wrecker at the same time.\n\nLen's neighbors, the tiny commune at Bow Farm, agree to take Wrecker in. Melody, the youngest, bonds with Wrecker instantly and dreads the day she might lose him to his birth mother. Ruth, the eldest, shares an impish sense of humor with the unruly boy. Johnny Appleseed teaches Wrecker respect for nature and suspicion of the law. And Willow, who walked away from her own family, finds herself fighting two overwhelming urges: her maternal feelings for Wrecker and her growing attraction to Len. As two milestones approach - Wrecker's eighteenth birthday and the end of Lisa Fay's prison sentence - this slapdash family quickly bonds around Wrecker's mysterious history, and the hopeful possibilities of his future.\n\nFor discussion\n\nCompare the three settings of Wrecker: hippie San Francisco, the women's prison at Chino, and the secluded Mattole Valley. How does each of these settings look and feel in the novel? What does Lisa Fay miss most about San Francisco? Why does the Mattole Valley feel like home to Melody?\n\nDiscuss the circumstances of Meg's illness. What was Meg like before she got sick? What toll does Meg's condition take upon her marriage, and how does Len express his devotion and his doubts?\n\nWhat are Len's first impressions of three-year-old Wrecker? What reservations does Len have about taking Wrecker in? Are his worst fears justified? Why or why not?\n\nEach resident of Bow Farm\u2014Melody, Willow, Ruth, Johnny Appleseed, and Wrecker\u2014has survived a difficult past. How do we learn about their histories? What are they running away from, and how do they reconcile a painful past with a hopeful present?\n\nYoung Wrecker's early days at Bow Farm are full of \"love in overalls, love with a spade in its hand.\" (28) Why is taking care of Wrecker such hard work? What does each of his caretakers contribute, and how do they make this unusual family work?\n\nCompare Melody and Willow, the two founders of Bow Farm. How do their personalities, homes, and parenting styles differ? What are the sources of tension between these two friends, and how do they eventually resolve their differences?\n\nLisa Fay puts off naming her son until he says to her, \"I a wrecker.\" (63) What is the meaning of this unusual name? What are some of Wrecker's destructive tendencies, and how does he fight the urge to \"wreck\" the things and people around him?\n\nLove doesn't come easily in this novel: Arlyn leaves Lisa Fay, Melody and DF Al don't stay together, Len misses the old Meg, and Ruth mourns the death of Elizabeth. What does this theme of difficult romance add to the novel? How do these stories of lost love compare to Len and Willow's romance?\n\nTrace the journey of the photo that Belle snapped on Wrecker's third birthday. How does the photo get passed along, and what does it mean to each person who has it? How does it eventually land in Wrecker's hands?\n\nConsider Lisa Fay's fifteen years in prison. How does she cope with her circumstances, and what memories and emotions threaten her sanity during these long years?\n\nWhen Melody tells Wrecker about his mother, she finally understands that \"her omission could be as gravely harmful as an outright lie.\" (239) Why does Melody keep Wrecker's history from him for so long? What are the consequences of her silence? Was her \"omission\" a mistake? Why or why not?\n\nWhile Wrecker is at his first school dance, Len and Willow finally admit their feelings for each other. Discuss how these two scenes fit together: Wrecker meeting girls and Len and Willow getting closer in a bar. What discoveries do these characters make during this trip to town?\n\nWhy does Willow share her own story as a mother in her good-bye letter to Wrecker? Discuss how Willow's family history leads her to give Wrecker the following advice: \"Listen to me. Don't choose. Melody is your mother. Lisa Fay is your mother, too.\" (259). How does Wrecker respond to Willow's advice?\n\nWrecker spans twenty years, from the boy's birth to his young adulthood. When does time seem to pass slowly in the novel? When does it pass quickly? Which important events mark these years of Wrecker's life? How does Bow Farm and the Mattole Valley change over these two decades?\n\nDiscuss the last scene of the novel, when Wrecker, Ruth, Len, Willow, Melody, and Lisa Fay sit down to dinner together at Bow Farm. How does this dinner make them into a family? Why do you think it is told from Ruth's perspective? How would this scene be different from the point of view of another character?\n\nUnless otherwise stated, this discussion guide is reprinted with the permission of Bloomsbury"}

What aspects of her life are captured by the various \"guides\" encountered on the trip?\n\n12. Do you agree with the airport anthropologist's theory that the death of a loved one can restore other relationships in our lives? How have your friends, family, and community traditionally responded to grief? Why does the traveling funeral resonate with so many strangers near the end of their journey?\n\n13. Discuss Balinda's presence. What is the role of spontaneity and improvisation in the traveling funeral? How do Balinda's plans for her mother convey the new perspective rippling throughout the travelers?\n\n14. In Chapter Twenty-eight, Annie's friends express their anger--toward her, toward her death, and over the end of their beautiful time together. What healing comes from this anger?\n\n15. If you were to plan your own traveling funeral, who would your \"pallbearers\" be? What places would you want them to visit together?

{"text": "Beaufort Book Club\n\nTuesday, May 14, 2013\n\nDiscussion Questions\n1. Does this book have\na central theme? What is it?\n\n2. Why does Mary Anne always read a book's\nending first? How does this reflect her character?\n\n3. Early in the book,\nWill writes, \"I wanted to learn more about my mother's life and the choices\nshe'd made, so I often steered the conversation there. She had an agenda of her\nown, as she almost always did. It took me some time, and some help, to figure it\nout.\" (page 6) What was Mary Anne's agenda?\n\n4. Mary Anne underlined a\npassage in Seventy Verses on Emptiness, which resonated with Will:\n\"Permanent is not; impermanent is not; a self is not; not a self [is not]; clean\nis not; not clean is not; happy is not; suffering is not.\" Why did this strike\nboth of them as significant? What do you think it means?\n\n5. Throughout\nthe book, Will talks about books as symbols and sources of hope. How has reading\nbooks served a similar function for you?\n\n6. While reading A Thousand\nSplendid Suns, Will and Mary Anne discuss three kinds of fateful choices:\n\"the ones characters make knowing that they can never be undone; the ones they\nmake thinking they can but learn they can't; and the ones they make thinking\nthey can't and only later come to understand, when it's too late, when 'nothing\ncan be undone,' that they could have.\" (page 41) What kind of choices did Mary\nAnne make during her cancer treatment? Did she or Will make any of the third\ntype?\n\n7. Mary Anne especially liked a passage from Gilead by\nMarilynne Robinson: \"When you encounter another person, when you have dealings\nwith anyone at all, it is as if a question is being put to you. So you must\nthink, What is the Lord asking of me in this moment, in this situation?\" (page\n96) Why do you think this moved her so much? What did it mean to Will?\n\n8.\nHow does religious belief help Mary Anne? How do you think it might have helped\nWill?\n\n9. Mary Anne doesn't believe her travels to war-torn countries were\nbrave: \"I wanted to go to all those places, so how could that be brave? The\npeople I'm talking about, they did things they didn't want to do because they\nfelt they had to, or because they thought it was the right thing to do.\" (page\n167) In what ways is Mary Anne brave during her cancer treatments? Does she ever\ncome to think of herself as brave?\n\n10. Will is amazed by his mother's\nability to continue her efforts to fund the library in Afghanistan even while\nfacing a death sentence, until he realizes that \"she used her emotions to\nmotivate her and help her concentrate. The emphasis for her was always on doing\nwhat needed to be done. I had to learn this lesson while she was still there to\nteach me.\" (page 194) Did Will learn? What makes you think so?\n\n11. Why\ndid Mary Anne become so intent on certain things happening: Obama's election,\nDavid Rohde's safe return? Will talks about his own \"magical thinking\" several\ntimes in the book\u2014what form do you think Mary Anne's took?\n\n12. \"We're all\nin the end-of-our-life book club, whether we acknowledge it or not; each book we\nread may well be the last, each conversation the final one.\" (page 281) How did\nthis realization affect Will's final days with his mom?\n\n13. After she\ndies, Will looks at Mary Anne's copy of Daily Strength for Daily Needs,\nnext to the bed. He believes this quote from John Ruskin was the last thing his\nmother ever read: \"If you do not wish for His kingdom, don't pray for it. But if\nyou do, you must do more than pray for it; you must work for it.\" (page 321) How\ndid Mary Anne work for it throughout her life? Do you think Will found solace in\nthis passage?\n\n14. Several times in the book, Will talks about eBooks\nversus their physical counterparts. Why does he prefer one to the other? Does\nMary Anne agree? If you read this book on an eReader, how do you think it\naffected your experience?\n\n15. Which of the books discussed by Will and\nMary Anne have you read? Which do you most want to read?\n(Questions issued by publisher.)\n\nMonday, February 18, 2013\n\n1.

One of the opening scenes in A Grown-Up Kind of Pretty depicts Tyler Baines chopping down the Slocumb willow tree. What does this tree symbolize for Big? For Liza? For Mosey?\n2. On page 70, Mosey realizes she isn't who she thought she was. At first, she feels liberated. Then she feels confused and lost. How is she like Liza and Big? What makes her different? Do you think a child takes on traits like compassion, humor, and good sense from her biological parents, or do you think that she learns these from the people who raise her?\n3. Several men in this novel cheat on their spouses (Coach, Lawrence), but the women cheat on one another in a different way. What kind of emotional betrayals show up in their friendships, and in their families? Who do you think is the most loyal person in this story?\n4. Though Liza and Melissa were inseparable when they were young, Big believes that Noveen was a better friend to Liza than Melissa ever was. Patti turns out to be a wonderful friend to Mosey. What have the Duckins women given to Liza and Mosey? How was Melissa different?\n5. One theme in A Grown-Up Kind of Pretty is belonging. On page 224, Big says, \"Bogo wasn't the only stray that Mosey had adopted for us all recently.\" Who do you think are the \"strays\" in this story? When do they find a home?\n6. When Mosey enters Liza's tree house and sees her old Moomin books covered in Magic Marker, she says, \"If I had doubted for a second this place was Liza's, I didn't doubt it now\" (p. 245). Have you ever found a secret place or a secret box that belonged to someone you love? What part of this person did you find there?\n7. Was Big smart to keep the details of her family crisis from Lawrence? If she had shared more with him, do you think he could have helped her, or protected Mosey?\n8. Did Liza do the right thing by taking Mosey from her mother when she was small? Would you still feel that way if Mosey had been a Duckins or a Richardson instead? Why?\n9. Big and Liza are determined to keep Mosey from getting too close to boys. Do you think they're overreacting? What would you do to keep your daughter from making the same mistakes you made?\n10. When something bad happens, Big, Liza, and Mosey often respond with action\u2014though sometimes their approaches aren't quite ethical. Does Liza break Lawrence's ex-wife's plates on purpose, or was it an accident? Did you enjoy it a little, since Sandy cheated on Lawrence and lashed out at Big? Do you think Claire Richardson was at all justified in her attacks on Liza? On Big? Do you blame her less because she lost both her daughters? Though it was wrong of Big to throw bricks at the church's windows, do you think it was justified, given how she was treated by the church community? How does knowing the pain each character has been through change the way you respond to her actions?\nQuestions from litlovers.com\n\nWednesday, August 15, 2012\n\n1. Kamila studied to become a teacher and even earned a prestigious teaching certificate. Before she could complete her training, the Taliban took over Kabul and banned women from nearly all public places, including schools. How did Kamila adapt the skills she learned as a teacher and put them to use starting her dressmaking business, and later in her U.N. work?\n\n2. At many crucial junctures, Kamila turns to her faith for guidance. What role does faith play in her personal journey?\n\n3. Under the Taliban, Afghan women were confined to their homes and saw their lives transformed virtually overnight. Many women like Kamila still needed to support their families, though, and so found creative ways to work within and around these new restrictions. What would you have done under similar circumstances? Would you have dared to go against the Taliban's rules at the risk of your own safety?\n\n4. Malekheh plays an instrumental role in teaching Kamila how to sew and in get ting her dressmaking business off the ground. Kamila often seeks out the advice of her eldest sister, even though she doesn't always take it. How would you characterize the relationship between these two sisters? What role do you think this relationship played in Kamila's business success?\n\n5. Lemmon paints a colorful, yet nuanced portrait of modern day Afghanistan. The story of Kamila and her family presents an alternative to the conventional image of women as victims of war. Did Lemmon's portrayal change the way you think about Afghanistan? Or about women and war?\n\n6. Within a year, Kamila was able to transform a living room operation into a thriving dressmaking business --- selling finely embroidered dresses to tailors throughout Kabul and providing meaningful work for an entire community of women. What do you think about Kamila's business practices? Why do you think she and her sisters were so successful? What lessons about entrepreneurship can be taken from their story?\n\n7. In chapter 7, Kamila and her sisters work around the clock to make 6 dresses for a wedding party, only to discover that the bride is marrying a Talib. How does this episode impact or cause you to revisit your view of the Taliban? If Taliban soldiers knew about the Sidiqi sisters' tailoring business, why didn't they shut it down? What did you think when you saw that there were Taliban who sent their daughters to work with Kamila?\n\n8. How does Lemmon portray men throughout the book? Think of Rahim, Mr. Sidiqi, Ali and his brothers, and the Talibs Kamila encounters. Do these characters reshape or reinforce your impressions of men in Afghanistan?\n\n9. Despite being faced with the daily perils of war and economic hardships, the Sidiqi family never completely abandoned their home in Khair Khana. What does that say about their commitment to their community? To their country?\n\n10. How does Kamila's story affect the way you see the future of Afghanistan and America's presence in this war-scarred country?\n\nMonday, June 04, 2012\n\nDiscussion Questions for Still Alice by Lisa Genova\n1. When Alice becomes disoriented in Harvard Square, a place she's visited daily for twenty-five years, why doesn't she tell John? Is she too afraid to face a possible illness, worried about his possible reaction, or some other reason?\n2. After first learning she has Alzheimer's disease, \"the sound of her name penetrated her every cell and seemed to scatter her molecules beyond the boundaries of her own skin. She watched herself from the far corner of the room\" (pg. 70). What do you think of Alice's reaction to the diagnosis? Why does she disassociate herself to the extent that she feels she's having an out-of-body experience?\n3. Do you find irony in the fact that Alice, a Harvard professor and researcher, suffers from a disease that causes her brain to atrophy? Why do you think the author, Lisa Genova, chose this profession? How does her past academic success affect Alice's ability, and her family's, to cope with Alzheimer's?\n4. \"He refused to watch her take her medication. He could be mid-sentence, mid-conversation, but if she got out her plastic, days-of-the-week pill container, he left the room\" (pg. 89). Is John's reaction understandable? What might be the significance of him frequently fiddling with his wedding ring when Alice's health is discussed?\n5. When Alice's three children, Anna, Tom and Lydia, find out they can be tested for the genetic mutation that causes Alzheimer's, only Lydia decides she doesn't want to know. Why does she decline? Would you want to know if you had the gene?\n6. Why is her mother's butterfly necklace so important to Alice? Is it only because she misses her mother? Does Alice feel a connection to butterflies beyond the necklace?\n7. Alice decides she wants to spend her remaining time with her family and her books. Considering her devotion and passion for her work, why doesn't her research make the list of priorities? Does Alice most identify herself as a mother, wife, or scholar?\n8. Were you surprised at Alice's plan to overdose on sleeping pills once her disease progressed to an advanced stage? Is this decision in character? Why does she make this difficult choice? If they found out, would her family approve?\n9. As the symptoms worsen, Alice begins to feel like she's living in one of Lydia's plays: \"(Interior of Doctor's Office. The neurologist left the room. The husband spun his ring. The woman hoped for a cure.)\" (pg. 141). Is this thought process a sign of the disease, or does pretending it's not happening to her make it easier for Alice to deal with reality?\n10. Do Alice's relationships with her children differ? Why does she read Lydia's diary? And does Lydia decide to attend college only to honor her mother?\n11. Alice's mother and sister died when she was only a freshman in college, and yet Alice has to keep reminding herself they're not about to walk through the door. As the symptoms worsen, why does Alice think more about her mother and sister? Is it because her older memories are more accessible, is she thinking of happier times, or is she worried about her own mortality?\n12. Alice and the members of her support group, Mary, Cathy, and Dan, all discuss how their reputations suffered prior to their diagnoses because people thought they were being difficult or possibly had substance abuse problems. Is preserving their legacies one of the biggest obstacles to people suffering from Alzheimer's disease? What examples are there of people still respecting Alice's wishes, and at what times is she ignored?\n13. \"One last sabbatical year together. She wouldn't trade that in for anything. Apparently, he would\" (pg. 223). Why does John decide to keep working? Is it fair for him to seek the job in New York considering Alice probably won't know her whereabouts by the time they move? Is he correct when he tells the children she would not want him to sacrifice his work?\n14. Why does Lisa Genova choose to end the novel with John reading that Amylix, the medicine that Alice was taking, failed to stabilize Alzheimer's patients? Why does this news cause John to cry?\n15. Alice's doctor tells her, \"You may not be the most reliable source of what's been going on\" (pg. 54). Yet, Lisa Genova chose to tell the story from Alice's point of view. As Alice's disease worsens, her perceptions indeed get less reliable. Why would the author choose to stay in Alice's perspective? What do we gain, and what do we lose?\n\nWednesday, May 09, 20122. How do Nicky Eck's crimes against Molly affect the rest of her life?4. Why does Mariah Snow take an immediate dislike to Molly? Is this a clue to what happened in Mariah's past? Do you believe people like or dislike other people because they possess similar qualities (either positive or negative)?6. What do you make of the author's choice to write a majority of the novel in journal entries and letters? How would the novel be different if she had chosen to tell the story using straight prose?9. What do you think happened to Mary White?11. When Simon Black visits Molly in the mountains in February (page 241), Molly doesn't discuss with Agnes what transpired between them. What do you suppose was said?13. Who do you believe killed Jacky (with the first shot in the stomach, not the second shot in his neck)? Why do you suppose BJ helped Molly cover up what really happened to Jacky?15. What are the reasons behind Molly's decision to go back to Agate Hill in the end? How does this illustrate the change in Molly from the beginning of her life to the end of it?\n16.

{"text": "In a suburban Atlanta neighborhood where divorce is as rampant as kudzu, Mary Bliss McGowan doesn't notice that her own marriage is in trouble until the summer night she finds a note from her husband, telling her he's gone -- and taken the family fortune with him.\n\nStunned and humiliated, a desperate Mary Bliss, left behind with her seventeen-year-old daughter, Erin, and a mountain of debt, decides to salvage what's left of her life by telling one little bitty lie.\n\nAt first, Mary Bliss simply tells friends and family that Parker is out of town on a consulting job. Then the lies start to snowball, until Parker turns up dead. Or does he?\n\nMary Bliss's formerly staid existence careens into overdrive as she copes with an oversexed teenager, a mother-in-law with Ethel Merman delusions, and the sudden but delicious shock of finding herself pursued by two men: -- and the perfect recipe for chicken salad.\n\n1. Mary Bliss and Katherine have been friends for more than a decade, and the saying \"opposites attract\" seems to describe their friendship. Are Katharine and Mary Bliss really as different as they seem? What makes their friendship so strong? What do they have in common?\n\n2. Mary Bliss encourages Katherine to reconcile with Charlie, who cheated on Katharine and was living with another woman. In one instance Mary Bliss says to her, \"Honestly, sweetie, he's too good a man to just throw away like this.\" Why does she think Katharine should take Charlie back when she makes it very clear that she will not give Parker a second chance?\n\n3. Mary Bliss thinks her life is perfect, or at least perfectly well ordered, until Parker leaves. Do you think she was happy in her marriage? Did she miss any signs that her marriage was not as perfect as she thought? When Mary Bliss finally has the chance to confront Parker, he puts the blame on her for his leaving. What do you think about this?\n\n4. Parker's leaving is the catalyst Mary Bliss needs to make changes in her life -- and to change herself. \"Maybe there was a smidgen of rebel beaten down inside her. Maybe Parker's leaving had unlocked this side of her.\" Describe Mary Bliss as she appears at the beginning of the novel. How has she changed by the end of the story?\n\n5. Mary Bliss visits Eula regularly at the nursing home, cooks her favorite foods, and brings her flowers. Even after Parker leaves, Mary Bliss continues to visit Eula. Why is Eula so hostile to Mary Bliss? Why does Mary Bliss feel such a sense of responsibility for Eula? Did Eula's decision about her estate surprise you?\n\n6. There are references throughout the story to Mary Bliss's childhood. \"Her own daddy, James Clewitt, had abandoned his family. Had told her mama he was going to Florida to look for work.. Drove away in a 1968 green Ford Falcon. And that was that. Never to return.\" How have the circumstances of Mary Bliss's childhood affected her as an adult? She sees Parker's behavior as worse than her father's because \"Parker had not only abandoned them, he'd stolen their future.\" Do you agree with Mary Bliss on this?\n\n7. Discuss the relationships Mary Bliss has with the women in her life -- Katharine, Erin, Eula -- and how each one is important to her.\n\n8. Katharine plays an integral role in the plan to fake Parker's death. Why does she do this? Is it merely because she's Mary Bliss's best friend, or are there other reasons?\n\n9. Mary Bliss and Matt Hayslip meet under unusual circumstances, and she does not particularly like him at their first meeting. What changes her mind about him? Mary Bliss and Matt's relationship is clouded by lies and deception. In one instance he says to her, \"What about you? Are you capable of telling the truth?.\" As she says about their relationship, \"they had done everything backward.\" Why, ultimately, does their relationship work?\n\n10. The title of the book, Little Bitty Lies, is an understatement. What do you think of the lies that abound in the book? Is there any character who does not resort to lies and deception? During a conversation with Charlie, Mary Bliss feels bad for deceiving him but has \"already made an uneasy peace with her conscience, telling herself the ends justified the means.\" In Mary Bliss's case, do you think the ends justified the means?"}

{"text": "IRP Reading Response Prompts\n\nTerm 1-Making Inferences\n\n#29 Dialogue Detective\n\nRead aloud a section of dialogue that taught you a lot about the characters who are conversing. Explain how you interpreted their words, inner thoughts and author's comments to infer personality, feelings and motivation.\n\n#30 Be the Character!\n\nRead aloud a favorite scene or section of dialogue. Now imagine you are that character, and suddenly, a fairy godmother appears and kindly asks you to express everything you are thinking and feeling and why. Free-associate as though you are the character.\n\n#31 Action Speaks Louder\n\nIt is fair to say that what you do shows others what kind of person you are. From a book's character's actions, we decide if he or she is courageous, sneaky, hot headed, and so on. Choose a character, and pick three or four of his or her actions. Discuss what they may reveal about the character's personality.\n\n#32 Be an Actor\n\nReady to show what you know about characters' motivations? Select a section of your book that's rich in dialogue. Read it aloud, adjusting your voice for different character's personalities and emotions. Describe why you chose to read the parts the way you did.\n\nTerm Two-Setting\n\n#13 Past, Present, and Future\n\nIn this book, are the characters living in the past, the future, or do they remain in the present time?

{"text": "This week we begin our study of Winesburg, Ohio, by Sherwood Anderson.\n\nMonday \u2013 Introduction to the book \u2013 is it a novel, a collections of short stories, a collectiuon of sket ches ior a novel \u2013 or something else? What was happening in America during the time period in which the book takes place?\n\nAssignment: Read \"Mother,\" pp. 39 \u2013 48.\n\nWednesday \u2013 Assignment: read the following stories for Thursday. On Thursday we will discuss the first story, \"Hands,\" together. Next Monday and Wednesday students will lead the discussion of one of the remaining stories.\n\n\"Hands,\" pp. 27-34\n\n\"A Man of Ideas,\" pp. 102 \u2013 111\n\n\"Adventure,\" pp. 112 \u2013 120\n\n\"The Thinker,\" pp. 128 \u2013 142\n\n\"Queer,\" pp. 190 \u2013 201\n\nWeek V April 25 \u2013 29, 2011\n\nQuestions on \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\"\n\nOn Monday finish reading \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\" in class and then reflect upon (and jot down some ideas about) the story from the perspective of the following four questions. You are going to write an extended essay on one of these questions. By the end of class, please be prepared to email me which question you have chosen to write about. For Wednesday, come to class prepared to lead a discussion on the question you have chosen and also bring the beginning of a rough draft. The final essay will be on the order of two pages in length (1.5 spacing, 10 font.)\n\nThe British Hunter, Robert Wilson, respects neither one of the Macombers, whom he is guiding on safari. Summarize his attitude toward each of them. Does he have more contempt for one or the other? Do you agree with Wilson's assessment of them? If so, why? What, on the other hand, is your assessment of Wilson, both for the attitude he has toward them and the way he treats them?\n\nIn your reading of \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\", is Robert Wilson a teacher or tyrant, a hero or bully \u2013 or is he a bit of each? Does he take advantage of a weaker man? Or is his cruelty calculated to redeem Macomber' life in some way? We know how things end for Francis. How do they end for Margot?\n\nWe've noted the themes of manliness and nature in Hemingway's stories. The first theme involves a code of behavior emphasizing stoicism, courage and, in his famous phrase, \"grace under pressure.\" The second stresses the curative, purifying, redemptive powers of the natural world as opposed to the lack of honor, moral shallowness and corruption of so-called civilization. How do these themes play out in \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber?\n\nWhy is the life of the story's title character described both as \"short\" and \"happy?\" What is \"happy\" about the life that ends on the last page? What philosophy about the meaning of life does Hemingway mean to convey by the situation he describes in this story? Are the values he ascribes to Robert Wilson meant to be taken by the reader as admirable? What are the moral issues Hemingway raises in this story?\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Review the images of Gilded Age New York in the pages of Illustrated History of New York - and categorize them according whether they illustrate \"Sunshine\" or \"Shadow\" during the Gilded Age. If you're not sure what the image represents explain why.\n\n2. Choose one person, place, thing or event from the identifications below and do some preliminary research on the internet - site your source(s) \u2013 and write a brief analysis of the item's historic significance for understanding the history of New York City during the Gilded Age.\n\nWeek XI November 22-24, 2010\n\nSunshine and Shadow, New York \u2013 1860 \u2013 1898\n\nDiscussion: The end of the Civil War brought with it reunion between the North and South, and reunion brought with it new opportunities for New York to grow into the national metropolis - and one of world's largest and most powerful cities by the end of the nineteenth century. New York was the national metropolis by the end of the Civil War with a population of between 800,000 to one million people. This number would have been unimaginable just a couple of generations earlier. Imagine, then, that by the year 1900 the city would more than triple in size reaching a population of fully 3,000,000 people. By the end of World War I, just twenty years later, New York would become the world's largest city and truly the capital of the world. In this chapter we continue to observe this dizzying 19th ascent and the challenges brought about by ever bigger bigness. Commerce, immigration, population growth and geographical expansion, continue to be major themes of the story. But now the problems associated with rampant capitalism and poverty produced a wider and wider gap between the privileged and the poor. Add to this the massive \"new Immigration\" between the years 1886 and 1924 and one begins to understand the meaning of the metaphor that is the title of the chapter. New York was, indeed, two worlds, one \"Sunshine,\" the other \"Shadow,\" one a world of the rich and privileged, the other a world of unimaginable hardship, deprivation, horrible working and living conditions and despair. It was also a time of extraordinary achievement, aspiration, invention and productivity. This troubled, varied and often fabulous New York is our subject.\n\nMajor themes\n\nReunion and reconstruction: New York as the national metropolis\n\nThe Gilded Age: Boom and Bust, Bulls and Bears\n\nDemocratic aspirations: Central Park\n\nThe \"New Immigration\" \u2013 1886 \u2013 1924 (13.5 million people enter through New York)\n\nThe new urban political machine\"- the case of William M. \"Boss\" Tweed and Tammany Hall\n\n1. Give three examples of racism in New York City during the decades before the Civil War, taking into account the social, economic, and political conditions in which the African American population found itself.\n\n2. What is the issue that the author discusses in Chords of Caste?\n\nWeek VI \u2013 May 16-20\n\nOrder and Disorder \u2013 New York, 1825-60\n\nThis week we study of the transformative events of the period 1825-1860.\n\n1. Transportation has been a continuing factor in the evolution of New York since the Half Moon sailed up what would be named the Hudson River in 1609. Discuss five different episodes in the history of transportation that transformed the history of this city during the first half of the 19th century.\n\n2. New York City is, and has always been, a \"city of immigrants,\" starting with the diverse population that arrived during the Dutch period, right up until the present day, when almost 40% of the City's population is foreign born. Describe this pattern in the early 19th century. What immigrant groups arrived here? What was their impact? Were there tensions and conflicts between those who had called New York home for generations and those newly arrived? What were these tensions? How did they affect the politics and the culture of the City in the years prior to the Civil War? Have immigrant groups been welcomed with open arms to New York? Give examples. How have various groups struggled and risen through the \"social geography\" of the city?\n\n3. The period from 1825 to 1860 was a time of truly unprecedented growth, change and challenge to every New Yorker:\n\n1. The population grew from around 200,000 to nearly one million people.\n\n2. Increasing diversity made this growth even more disorienting.\n\n3. Economic and technological changes created upheavals in the social and cultural lives of every New Yorker, in the ways they lived and worked, in the way they communicated, and in the ways they related to each other. Crime, poverty, racial and ethnic conflict disease, mand much more plagued a city seemingly unequipped to handle its sudden transition into the modern world, a city\n\nYour author refers to the sum total and impact of these changes as producing a period of \"disorder\" \u2013 not a very optimistic assessment. Give examples of some of the economic, social and cultural challenges and problems that descended upon the little city that became a metropolis in just a few decades. If you lived in New York during this time, what do you think the impact of these dramatic change and growth would have been on your life?\n\n4. Along with the \"disorder\" created by the rapid changes in New York City during this period, as it developed into a new kind of city \u2013 a metropolis, which by the Civil War was already bursting with nearly one million people. Historians have also focused on the attempts at improving life, making it more modern and efficient, attempting to establish some kind of pattern for the future and stabilize daily life. Give examples of these efforts to impose \"order\" on the obvious disorder of the teaming city.\n\n\"Discussion of Major themes\n\nThe period 1825 to 1860 was a time of truly unprecedented growth, change and challenges to every New Yorker. Imagine that you maintain an organized bedroom, in an organized home, in an unchanging neighborhood. You rely on this organization and predictability in your life. Then, while you're overnight at a friend's, a windows are left open, there's a storm, and gusts of wind and rain damage and disorganize everything you rely on for normal life. When you return, nothing is the way you left it. You would be disoriented, to say the least. You would face disorder in every in every part of your life. You would begin, with the help of others, to try to restore some order in your life. Something like this is what happened to New York as it was transformed by the \"storm\" of history from a small, intimate town into a metropolis in a couple of generations. Not only did the population increase from 90,000 at the beginning of the century to 750,000 by the time the Civil war began. Different kinds of people from those who had settled and lived here for two hundred years. These \"Knickerbockers\" had dominated social, civic and economic life of the city. Now, as Germans and Irish immigrants poured into New York, their privileged position was threatened. We will observe the City's unprecedented growth (both in population and geographic expansion) and transformation (in terms of industrialzation, transportation, commerce, class and race, demography, media and communications, policing, public health, and much more. These developments ended the intimacy of the old \"walking city\" and ushered in new relationships characteristic of the modern metropolis? Would you have liked to live in \"gaslight New York\"?\n\nThemes of the period:\n\nI New York City expands more rapidly than any city in history. From the small town of a few thousand people in the 1780 it becomes to the metropolis of 1865, with a population of three quarters of a million.\n\nII The impact of the \"Transportation Revolution\" on New York City\n\n1. Robert Fulton's development of the steamboat, 1807\n\n2. The development in 1811 of New York City's grid plan, New York's familiar grid of streets and avenues, one of the most recognizable aspects.\n\n3. The Age of Sail reaches its peak even as new forms of transportation develop. Americans build the sleekest, fastest sailing vessels in the world that voyage to every continent and open up world trade centered on New York. The famed Yankee Clippers were the fastest ships on the world. In 1817 ,scheduled packet service \u2013 the first being The Black Ball Line in 1817, replaces individual contracting of merchants with ship captains, making the system of booking passage predictable and rational.\n\n4. The Erie Canal, completed in 1825, seals New York's position, predicted since Hudson's voyage in 1609, as the preeminent hub of Atlantic \u2013 and eventually, global \u2013 trade.\n\n5. The railroad era, beginning in the late 1820\u2032s, put an end to the construction of canals. The career of Cornelius Vanderbilt, a pioneer of transportation on both water and by rail, is symbolic of the passing of an age and the beginning of a new one. Travel by sea was for thousands of years the only alternative to walking or being drawn by animals on land. Now the \"iron horse,\" powered by the steam locomotive ushered in a new technology that shrunk time and space. Vanderbilt became the nation's premier shipping magnate, and then in the 1840s, switched to rail, becoming the most powerful railroad owner in the world.\n\nII The first great wave of immigration into New York City during the 1840s, primarily German and Irish.\n\nIII A Sense of History: Reacting to rapid population growth and immigration of different ethnicities, a new sense of history develops in New York City during the period prior to the Civil War. The role of Washington Irving, who was New York's first internationally known author, is very important in this development. His book, The Knickerbockers History of New York gave rise to the term \"Knickerbockers\" referring to native born New Yorkers of Dutch or English descent during a period of increasing anxiety about the influx of foreigners into New York.\n\nIV Geographical expansion of New York. John Jacob Astor buys up real estate all over the City and sells it to contractors as New York expands northward. One such block was Charlton Street, and one such building was our new school building at 42 Charlton Street!!\n\nV The Industrial Revolution in New York City: the rise of the factory system and the decline of traditional economic and social relationships. By the 1840s New York is the nation's largest industrial center. The east river on both the Manhattan and Brooklyn sides was the industrial hub of the city, with smokestacks rising, hundreds of employees working in manufacturing, and as much as 15% of the nation's wealth centered in the area from Greenpoint to Brooklyn Heights and 23rd street to the Battery.\n\nVI The New Politics and the Rise of Tammany Hall\n\nVII Class and Race in antebellum New York\n\n1. \"Slavery by another name\" \u2013 the case of the St. Augustine's Church slave galleries.\n\n2. The rise of the workingman's movement in New York City\n\n3. Class markers in consumption and recreation: the case of Central Park\n\nWeek V \u2013 May 8-14\n\nThis week we will be reading about and discussing the emergence of New York City briefly as the nation's political capital, and then, permanently, as the nation's financial and commercial capital. Be prepared for each day's class having read the following pages and answered the accompanying questions.\n\nReading \u2013 Burns, pp. 21-27 Slavery and racism in colonial New York\n\n1. Describe the nature of slavery as it existed in New York City during the English colonial period. Describe the reactions of enslaved African Americans to their plight. How did the Revolutionary War affect the City's slave population?\n\nReading, Burns, pp. 28-37 The Capital of a New Nation;pp. 51-55 America's City\n\nQuestions:\n\n1.

Describe the development of New York City's economy during the years after the War for Independence concluded in 1783. How did advances in transportation propel New York City to the forefront of the nation during the first decades of the nation's existence.\n\nReading, Burns, pp. 56-67 America's City\n\nWhat was the significance and the impact of the construction of the grid system of streets and avenues in 1811?\n\nIs it fair to describe the construction of the Erie Canal as in some way the fulfillment of the dream of Henry Hudson?\n\nWeek IV \u2013 V April 25-29; May 2-5\n\nWe reach the end of the Adriaen Van der Donck saga. In doing so we understand the question we began with: Why did the Dutch colony fail; or as we often phrased it, Why don't we speak Dutch?\n\nReadings: In order to answer the following questions on Chapters 11-14, read my summaries and check the references to specific pages or passages in the book itself , cited in the summaries, for further clarification.Your answers are due Monday, May 8th.\n\nWritten Questions:\n\nChapter 11 \u2013 \"An American in Europe\" \u2013 When did Van der Donck return to the Netherlands?

The glacier began to recede some 15,000 years ago leaving behind an \"archipelago\" of island \u2013 of today's five boroughs only the Bronx is part of the mainland United States \u2013 some 70 miles of shoreline and hundred of islands.\n\nTo understand the force and impact of the glacier \u2013 called the Wisconsin Glacier - imagine a huge steam shovel, digging huge trenches or troughs as the land froze and the ice sheet advanced down from the arctic circle. Except the steam shovel is actually the southern-most edge of the ice, and as it proceeds, it mixes everything in its path in with the ice.It dug huge troughs like the Hudson Valley and shallower flatlands all over what is now New York City. There was so much sea water frozen into he glacier, by the way, that the actual shoreline of the Atlantic Ocean off New York, New England and much of New Jersey was up to 150 miles east of where it is now.\n\nThis all started 75,000 years ago. Then about 15,000 years ago, the glacier started to melt. It receded northat different speeds, depending on how cold it was for a given stretch of hundreds of years. And as it melted over a particular spot in the geography, it deposited the mud and rock it had dug and mixed with ice on the way down . So if the glacier took a long time to melt over a particular spot, it deposited more mud \u2013 eventually dry land \u2013 over that spot. Today those locations form higher points in the terrain of the City. Often their names remind of of this fact, for example Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, or Murray Hill Manhattan. Other spots indicate the glacier was melting fast when it receded over that spot. Hence, Flatbush, Brooklyn, or the Harlem Valley in Manhattan at around 100-110 streets on the west side. At first, with all this water being deposited, most of Manhattan was flooded, leaving the island, especially the lower half, a perpetual swamp or actually underwater. (This is what could happen with increased global warming today.) Another reason is that the melted ice water had nowhere to drain in to ocean. Why? Because the channel now spanned by the Verazzano Bridge was a barrier reef, like a cork in the bottle of water formed by New York Bay. Eventually that cork popped, and the result about 10,000 years ago was the geography we recognize today.\n\nAt this point about 8,000 years ago, the native inhabitants that Henry Hudson would later encounter, entered the scene. These natives were the Lenape Indians, part of the great Algonquian peoples that stretched across the northeast and even north-central United States. Another name for them is The Delaware Indians. Europeans first made contact in the early 17thcentury with the arrival of Henry Hudson, an English navigator sailing for the Dutch West India Company. Hudson's voyage was part of a \"Great Age of Exploration\" that included all the great European powers facing the Atlantic Ocean. (Classical Civilization - Greek and Roman civilization \u2013 was basically a Mediterranean culture.) Other transformative forces providing the context of the Dutch exploration and settlement of North America included the Protestant Reformation, the Commercial Revolution, the Scientific Revolution, and the first stirrings of the rise of democratic thought and values, one important manifestation of which was the establishment of a republican form of government in The Netherlands, which for all intents and purposes gained it's independence in 1579, although the formal recognition of the fact of it's independence didn't come until 1648. A formal truce between the years 1609 and 1620 gave the now powerful rebellious province of Spain to enter the race for colonies in North America. This, of course, was the year Henry Hudson sailed the Half Moon under the Dutch Flag and joined the race to find the fabled \"northwest passage.\"\n\nPowerful Atlantic powers were scrambling to find the northwest passage because it was supposedly a water route through the North American continent to the Pacific Ocean, thus providing renewed access to the Orient. The search was made necessary by grand historical developments that began almost a thousand years earlier \u2013 the great battle between Christianity and Islam, which culminated in 1554 in the capture of Constantinople , thus interrupting the overland trading route to the Orient which had been traveled by Europeans since at least the time of Marco Polo (13th century) and spurred the search for new routes by sea.\n\nThe first Atlantic nation to do so was Portugal, which first circumnavigated Africa, sailed the Indian Ocean, colonized to the subcontinent (India) and continued on to Cathay (China) and the South Asia Sea. This led to the voyages of Columbus, the first to dare the uncharted waters of the Atlantic itself, sailing west to find the east, and famously succeeding in 1492. Soon, all the major western and northern European nation states participated: Spain, England, Scotland Portugal, France, Sweden and others. A cold \u2013 and often hot \u2013 war ensued: a great centuries-long rivalry involving colonization across the globe, submission of native groups who objected, organized privateering (piracy) and often outright armed conflict. These ambitious and powerful states motivated by rivalries for colonies and resources spawned a new financial and commercial class (the bourgeoisie) and then tapped their wealth by chartering joint stock trading companies and establishing colonies. The English dominated the east coast of North America \u2013 Jamestown Virginia, 1607, and New England \u2013 Plymouth 1620, and Massachusetts Bay, 1629. The Spanish dominated South America, the French, Canada and the interior of North America, and all of them took a part of the Caribbean Sea. Even Sweden established a colony in North America, on the Delaware River, which the Dutch squashed in 1655.\n\nBut it was the upstart United Provinces of the Netherlands that with Hudson's voyage grabbed, perhaps the most valuable piece of the international colonial puzzle: the section of the eastern coast of what is now the United States of America. It included what is now New York, New Jersey and part of Connecticut. This colony would be named New Netherland by the Dutch West India Company, the trading Company the Dutch established in 1621 to run things. In 1609, it signed up an English navigator named Henry Hudson to search for the Northwest Passage. After two failed attempts, he tried a third route, and on September 12, 1609, sailed through the Verrazano Narrows and entered the Upper Bay of New York harbor, inaugurating the Dutch colony in the New World. It would last until 1664 when the British captured it.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nHow was the geography of New York City formed by the Wisconsin glacier? How long did this process take?\n\nWho were the native inhabitants of the area when Europeans made contact during the early 16th century?\n\nDescribe the rise of the Dutch nation \u2013 The United Provinces of the Netherlands \u2013 during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In what areas did this new nation become one of the leaders of Europe? What accounts for this so-called \"Golden Age of the Dutch?\" Name some of the individuals who we associate with this period.\n\nWhen did the Dutch rule New Netherland?\n\nWas the colony simply a trading post, a purely business proposition? Or was it a colony, with a government, laws and settlers? Why is this question important?\n\nName the company chartered by the Dutch government in 1621 to manager the colony. What was the title given to the executive director of the company in North America? Who would you say were the most important men to fill this position during the Dutch period?\n\nWho was Adriaen Van der Donck? What was his relationship with three older men who were prominent in the history of New Netherland: Killiaen Van Renssalaer, Willem Kieft and Peter Stuyvesant?\n\nWhat were Van der Donck's goals for the colony? Why did this put him in direct conflict with Peter Stuyvesant. Where did Van der Donck make his case during the period 1650-1653? What happened in the States General \u2013 the government of the United Provinces of the Netherlands\n\n1. If geography is destiny, explain why New York City was destined to become one of the most economically powerful cities on earth. How did the Wisconsin Glacier create the geography and topography of New York City and its environs beginning 15,000 years ago?\n\n2. Who was Henry Hudson? Why did he sail for the Dutch? What kind of man was he? What happened to him? What was the name of his ship? Describe the adventures he had on his voyages to what became New York?\n\n3. The Dutch were the most powerful nation in 17th century Europe. What was the source of their economic power? What advantage s did they bring to the \"cold war\" (and often hot wars) of the 16th and 17th centuries? Why did they seek a colony on the Atlantic coast of North America?What made the late 16th and 17th centuries the Dutch Golden Age? pp. 16-17; search for the Northwest Passage\n\n4. Who were the native inhabitants of New Netherland? How did their culture compare to that of the Europeans who arrived in the early 17th century? What was the impact of globalization on the native peoples they encountered?What were core characteristics of the culture and society of the Lenape? How did this culture adapt to the introduction of European culture during the Contact Period? \"The Dutch Buy Manhattan,\" pp. 48-49\n\n5. What was the main economic activity of the Dutch settlers? What was the relationship of settlers to the company? Ultimately, was New Amsterdam in particular, and New Netherland in general, a colony or a company, a civil community or a trading post? Why is this important?\n\n6. How did the Dutch settlers and the natives get along? Who was Willem Kieft and what fierce conflict broke out during the 1840\u2032s?\n\nOn the basis of the reading be able to define and discuss the following Key Terms. Have this sheet available at all times during class discussions, when we will amplify these terms' meaning and relevance for the history of the Dutch period \u2013 1609-1624."}
{"text": "\u2013in\u2013\nBut Sigrid is not the only one with secrets.\nA high ranking SS officer and his family move down the hall and Sigrid finds herself pulled into their orbit. A young woman doing her duty\u2013year is out of excuses before Sigrid can even ask her any questions. And then there's the blind man selling pencils on the corner, whose eyes Sigrid can feel following her from behind the darkness of his goggles.\nSoon\nIn this page\u2013turning novel, David Gillham explores what happens to ordinary people thrust into extraordinary times, and how the choices they make can be the difference between life and death.\n\nDISCUSSION QUESTIONS\n\nWhy do you think Sigrid helps Ericha at the cinema in the opening of the book? If you had been in Sigrid's situation, would you have helped Ericha? Would you have become as involved as Sigrid does? With the advantage of hindsight, our perspective is no doubt skewed; since we know the truth behind what was happening in Nazi Germany, how do our answers compare with Sigrid's bold decisions?\n\nAs the story progresses, Sigrid grows more and more involved and takes more and more risks. How does her reasoning for doing so later differ from the reasoning behind her first risky decision in the cinema? What is her motivation for making these increasingly dangerous choices? Desire? Excitement? Conscience?\n\nDiscuss the theme of betrayal in City of Women. Many of the characters are guilty of double\u2013crossing and treachery. In what ways do they deceive one another? What about Egon? Is his betrayal portrayed differently from that of others, such as Renate or Ericha?\n\nSigrid's relationships are numerous and varied\u2014with her mother\u2013in\u2013law, her neighbors, her coworkers, her husband, her lovers, the so\u2013called U\u2013boats. How does each of them define who Sigrid is? How is she reflected in the various relationships? How have these bonds been altered by the extraordinary circumstances of war?\n\nWere you surprised by the depiction of Berlin during World War II? Before reading the novel, had you thought about what life was like on the German home front as the tide turned and defeat loomed on the horizon?\n\nCountless times throughout the novel, characters risk their lives to help others\u2014to protect the value of human life, spurred on by their own integrity. Conversely, there is the scene on the bus where no one does anything as a Jewish woman is arrested and brutalized. Which do you think is typical of human behavior? Are people more inclined to avert their eyes and try to stay out of trouble, or risk their own safety and get involved? Why?\n\nIf one simply observes the facts at surface value, Sigrid would probably not be considered a righteously moral individual. Nonetheless, she manages to be a very sympathetic character. How does the author accomplish this?\n\nSigrid's coworker Renate seems to have a sensibility similar to hers. Yet when Renate discovers that Sigrid's lover may be Jewish, her response shocks Sigrid. Was it naive of Sigrid to expect anything different? Were you surprised by how deep\u2013seated Renate's anti\u2013Semitism was?\n\nOften in the novel, people are not actually who they appear to be. Consider Frau Obersturmf\u00fchrer Junger, the SS officer's pregnant wife who moves in down the hall: were you shocked to find out her secret? Do you feel that everyone in the book is hiding something?\n\nHow would you characterize Sigrid's relationship with Ericha Kohl? Antagonistic? Trusting? Maternal? What do you think Sigrid gets from her relationship with Ericha? What does Ericha get from Sigrid?\n\nWhat did you think about Kaspar? Egon? Wolfram? All are on the wrong side of history. Did you find any of them appealing? Are they very different from one another?\n\nAt one point Sigrid flirts with the idea of turning in Anna Weiss and her two daughters so that she can have Egon to herself. Do you feel she seriously considers this?\n\nHow important is amorous passion in the novel? Is that the driving force that motivates Sigrid? Is it emblematic of something else?"}

{"text": "Reading Group Guide\n\n1. For readers who come to Motherless Brooklyn with little knowledge of Brooklyn, what devices, beyond straightforward descriptions, does Lethem use to capture its distinctive atmosphere?\n\n2. Lionel's wordplay includes variations on his own name?Liable Guesscog, Final Escrow, Ironic Pissclaim, for example. How does this particular quirk serve to establish Lionel's sense of himself and his place in the world? Is there an internal logic about the variations or are they simply haphazard?\n\n3. The Minna Men are all orphans, first introduced as teenagers. Discuss how each of them carves out an identity for himself and why this is important to them. How do the initial descriptions Lionel provides of Tony [p. 39], Gil [p. 40], and Danny [p. 42-43] foreshadow the relationships among the four as adults? Do their characters change in the course of the novel?\n\n4. Does Minna see himself as more than a boss to the young men? Does he make a conscious effort to turn the group into a family or does the family feeling develop from the needs of the young men themselves? What evidence, if any, is there that Minna's interest in them is emotional as well as practical? In what ways does Minna's relationship with his own mother and older brother influence the way he treats the Minna Men?\n\n5. Why does Lionel say \"it was Minna who brought me the language, Minna and Court Street that let me speak\" [p.37]? What parts do Tony, Gil, and Danny play in helping Lionel accept his Tourette's Syndrome? How do their individual ways of dealing with Lionel differ? Which man's support is the most significant to Lionel both as a teenager and as an adult?\n\n6. In describing Gil's explanation of Minna's kidnapping and murder, Lionel says \"English might have been his fourth or fifth language from the sound of it\" [p. 94]. Why does Lethem include this observation and other examples of mangled language throughout the book? How do they put Lionel's own \"language difficulties\" in perspective?\n\n7. In addition to Lionel's wonderful, often poetic riffs, what other specific language patterns does Lethem employ to bring the various characters to life? For example, how do Lionel's conversation with the homicide detective [pp. 109-111], his initial encounter with Kimmery [p. 135] and his interview with Matricardi and Rockaforte [pp. 176-177] create impressions of these particular people that are independent of Lionel's own perceptions?\n\n8. What role does Julia play in the novel? In what ways is she the stereotypical \"dame\" of other hard-boiled detective novels and films and how is she different? Do you think Julia is right when she says \"No woman would ever want you, Lionel....That's not really true. They might want you....But they'll never be fair to you\" [p. 297]?\n\n9. Is Kimmery also a stock figure in this tradition? How does Kimmery's reaction to Lionel's Tourettic behavior differ from the reactions of the other characters? Does the brief, romantic interlude between Lionel and Kimmery advance the plot and if so, in what ways? How does it affect your understanding of Lionel? Is Kimmery \"fair\" to Lionel?\n\n10. The Zen Buddhist communities in New York and Maine are not at all what they seem. Are the characters who participate in the Buddhist Zendo?Lionel's brother, Gerald, Julia, and Kimmery?influenced by Buddhist teachings? Do the principles of Zen Buddhism (either as expressed in the book by Kimmery or from your knowledge) illuminate some of the themes Lethem explores?\n\n11. Does Lionel in fact become a \"real detective\"? Do his techniques fit your definition of detective work? Kimmery, for example, is skeptical about both his intentions and his working style [p. 255]. Do you think her evaluation is accurate? In other detective books you may have read, are the heroes completely removed from the personal aspects of the cases they investigate? Is the solution to Minna's murder fully satisfying in light of the evidence presented in the rest of the book?\n\n12. At several points in the book, Lethem makes direct reference to the genres that inform Motherless Brooklyn \u2014 both the classic detective novel and \"wiseguy\" novels and movies. For example, Minna teases Gil for saying \"piece,\" rather than \"gun\" [p. 8]; and Lionel asks \"Have you ever felt, in the course of reading a detective novel, a guilty thrill of relief at having a character murdered before he can step on to the page and burden you with his actual existence?\" [p. 119]. In another passage, Lionel compares himself to the standard set in detective literature: \"So many detectives have been knocked out and fallen into such strange, swirling darknesses...and yet I have nothing to contribute to this painful tradition\" [p. 205]. Why does Lethem include these references? Are they simply there for \"comic relief\" or do they serve another purpose?\n\n13. By using Lionel as narrator, Lethem is following a long tradition in detective fiction. In what ways would the impact on the reader be different if a third-person voice told the story? Why do you think he chose to use a narrator with Tourette's Syndrome? Is this purely a literary device, giving him the opportunity to play with language as an author? Do the classic detective heroes \u2014 for example, Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade and Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe \u2014 have quirks comparable to Lionel's?\n\n14. Does the title of the book refer only to the four orphans who make up the Minna Men? In what ways is Brooklyn itself \"motherless\"?\n\n15. The Voice Literary Supplement wrote \"Lethem loves to cross-wire popular genres and watch the sparks fly.\" In addition to the conventions of the hard-boiled detective novel, what other genre does Lethem draw on in Motherless Brooklyn?\n\nManek, November 27, 2010 (view all comments by Manek)\nHoly living f*ck this is a great book! (Can I use the F word, Powell's, if I don't spell it out? A fleeting expletive is not legally obscene-- can't be, b/c of the First Amendment. Of course, you, Powell's, are entitled to your own policies. In this case, though, consider an exception. B/c- once again- F*CK!). Finished it around 4 am last night. Jonathan L. is a genius. Which makes the MacArthur grant make sense. It's top notch literary noir with Tourrette's Syndrome. Eat Me! While I'm at it, let me also recommend the audioversion of Lethem's Chronic City. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of his work. (Have to say, though, I didn't love Gun, With Occasional Music, which might be a kind of precursor to Motherless Brooklyn). Plot and characters are both fully developed and satisfying. Go buy it, now! Maybe get it for your friend who likes trashy crime fiction-- the one you wish would read something a little more literary. Telling you- this might be the book. Seriously. Your lowbrow friend will thank you.\n\nWas this comment helpful? | Yes | No (1 of 3 readers found this comment helpful)\n\nThe narrator, Lionel Essrog, known as The Human Freakshow, suffers with Tourette's syndrome and though you might not want to know him in real life, he's got to be one of the most brilliant characters ever created. His quirky rants put me off at first, but I found myself being drawn closer to him with each page, and by the end of the book, I had gained a whole new appreciation for Lionel Essrog. He's trying to find the murderer of the only man who gave him anything resembling fatherly care. Lionel's search takes on rather desperate proportions, but therein lies much of this book's beauty. There's nothing to compare it to a true original.\n\nby Fidel\n\n\"Review\"\nby Time,\n\"Finding out whodunit is interesting enough, but it's more fun watching Lethem unravel the mysteries of his Tourettic creation.
