You wouldn't expect a shark to take a stroll through the desert, and penguins in a rainforest would be equally weird!\n\nWe humans can learn a great deal about our own ability to survive by studying the way that different animals are adapted to their own environments. Some adaptations like fins and gills make it possible to live in specialized environments, while others like hibernation help certain species to survive a long cold winter without food. To help you and your class explore the wonderful world of animal adaptations, check out these Web sites from around the world!\n\nDirtmeister's Science Reporters: Animal Adaptations  What better place to start than right here on Scholastic.com! On the Dirtmeister's Science Reporters page, kids from all over the place come up with different animals from around their homes and areas \u2014 and then publish their reports on how these animals are suited to fit their particular environment. The students' reports are published in the Science Observer. As always, an informative background section explains the different ways that animals can adapt and a Teacher's Guide makes lesson-planning a breeze!\n\nBank Street School: Environmental Science  If you're looking for some cooperative learning experiences tied to animal adaptations that your class can do with a local nature center or zoo, check out what the Bank Street School is doing with the Central Park Wildlife Center in New York City.

{"text": "The science curriculum & elementary science lesson plan\n\nBetter science for kids\n\nImportant Scientific Concepts and the Science Curriculum\nin elementary science lesson plans\n\nMost everyone agrees that our school science curriculum needs to be improved and teachers need help developing good elementary science lesson plans. Scientific education and literacy are becoming increasing important, and but national tests show a disturbing lack of scientific understanding in school age children.\n\nAccording to The National Center for Improving Science Education, there are nine scientific concepts that elementary school children should learn and understand. These should certainly be incorporated into the school science curriculum, but parents can, and must, also play an important role in helping their kids learn science.\n\nThese nine concepts are:\n\n1. Organization. Science is the study of the natural world. To help them understand how things work, scientists organize and classify the objects and events they observe. For example, a hierarchy is a series which ranks each part according to some characteristic: an atom, molecule, stone, mountain, planet. Or they can be grouped based on shared characteristics: mammals, birds, reptiles, insects, etc. Elementary school children can learn the concept of organization by collecting and sorting things according to their characteristics, for example objects like rocks, leaves or flowers.\n\n2. Cause and effect. Science seeks to explain and understand the natural world. Things happen for a reason: there is a cause for every effect. Try to point these things out to your children during everyday activities. For example, plant growth. The grass grows because there is water and light. Without those things, the grass would die.\n\n3. Systems. A system is a group of related, interacting parts that together form an interdependent whole. In science, there are two kinds of systems. One kind is the a physical system involving matter and energy, and the way they move and react with the world and each other. The other is the system that we use to study the world, called The Scientific Method. Children can learn about systems by observing the changes in the various parts of the whole, using familiar things in their lives. For example, they can learn about equilibrium and balance by observing how an aquarium works.\n\n4. Models. A model is something that is used to represent another thing. A model can be physical object, or a description of a thing or system. This may be hard at first for young children to understand. But you can start by drawing a picture or diagram, and comparing it to the actual object. For example, draw a picture or make a clay model of a tree, including roots, trunk, branches and leaves, and show your child how it relates to a real tree.\n\n5. Scale. This refers to size and quantity. Playing with rulers and scales let children see that objects vary in quantity. Objects that are similar to each other can be larger or smaller, weigh more or less. For example, weigh and measure the heights of people, your family and friends. These differences will be obvious to children. There are other differences that are not obvious, but still exist and can be measured. For example, use a thermometer to measure temperature of warm and cold water, explaining that the temperature measures difference in the energy of the water."}

Erosion is the gradual change or destruction of land caused by water, wind, ice, and the pull of gravity. Erosion is a natural process, but can be worsened by human activities that remove soil stabilizing elements, such as plant roots. By exposing the soil, humans make it easier for erosion to occur. Erosion can have negative effects on aquatic environments, because it introduces a large number of soil particles into bodies of water, making the water cloudy, or turbid. Increasing the turbidity of waterways can make it difficult for fish and other aquatic life forms to survive. In this lesson, students will explore erosion of sand by water; in this case, the water causes the sand to erode very quickly. You may also wish to give students other examples of forces that cause erosion, like high winds and the movement of soil materials down a slope."}

They begin to\nidentify parts of an object and recognize how these parts interact with the whole. In\nGrade 2, students use numbers for computing, estimating, naming, measuring, and\ncommunicating specific information. They use evidence to explain how or why\nsomething happens. Students begin to understand plant and animal interactions and\nprocesses as well as the changes on Earth. The students, as scientists, should have\nhands\u2013on, active experiences throughout the instruction of the science curriculum.\nTeaching Strategies\nLearning is an active process resulting from hands and minds on explorations in\nwhich learners construct their own knowledge. It is mainly in Science that every\nindividual student has the biggest opportunity to learn at their own pace and in their\nown unique ways of learning and exploring things around them.\nTeachers find out what students know, and use literature, photographs, real\nobjects, a demonstration or a \u2015hands-on\u2016 activity to introduce a concept, and to set up\na problem to be explored. All facets of learning will be built and reinforced upon the\nexperiences provided by the activity.\nAt the end, students will apply their new understanding to real-world examples\nas teachers help students see science as part of technology, society, personal\nexperience and life in general. Receiving a case or real-life problem, students in the\nPBL environment were provided with more opportunity to think, to explore, and to\ndevelop needed skills in analyzing problems and identifying various learning\nresources.\nPositive Reinforcement applied in the classroom is an essential aspect of\nmanaging young learner classrooms, and has related implications for encouraging\nprogress.\nLearning how to work in a team environment is beneficial to students for\nproblem solving, working under the pressure of a time limit, and learning how to\nwork with others.\nStudent Activities\nDifferent kinds of activities, especially hands-on activities, allow for differences\namong students and learning styles. If the first exposure material is moved out of class,\nthe class activity can then change to group work, role paying, games, and group or\nclass discussion that can concentrate on particular problems or arising from the first\nexposure material or further depth of the content.\nAssessment\nStudents will be assessed with class participation, observation, homework, class\nwork, objective quizzes/tests, oral responses, and quarterly exams. The student's final\ngrade will be computed mainly based on three parts: performance tasks (homework\nand class work), quizzes and quarterly exams. Each part is weighted at one third of\nthe total course grade.\nQuizzes will relate to current and previous topics. A quiz may be given at any\ntime during any class period\u2014immediately after a lecture, at the beginning or end of a\nclass, etc. Students absent from class for a test or a quiz must make arrangements to\ntake the quiz or test some other time.\nIt is very important that you complete the assigned worksheets. Worksheets and\ntest papers will be checked for completeness and returned. The scores will be given.\nYou may keep your worksheets and test papers until the quarterly exam for reviewing.\nMaterials\nExcept the things needed for the experiments, we sometimes need color papers\nor any materials which could be used to make something, crayons/markers, scissors,\nglue, tape and double-sided tape. Pictures, wall posters, video tapes, VCD, DVD, and\nclips or any other media might be used.\nFirst Quarter Objectives\nExplore and classify living and non-living things.\nIdentify the needs of living

Roll over each type for examples.\n\nNote- this example is here is purely for showing how flickr can be used to create \"hotspot\" learning objects.... my geology knowledge is extremely rusty!\n\nWant to create a simple \"learning object\" (whatever you believe that means...)? Flickr offers a slick, little known means to add \"hotspots\" to images, so you can create labeled diagrams, or document a process where parts of the image can be labeled by notes that pop up.\n\nI saw this recently in something Brian shared that shows a flickr image that through this method, demonstrates the process for making a pie.\n\nAt first I missed the significance, as I thought it was just the pictures... but when you follow Brian's link to the flickr image you get more than the image- it is annotated with hotspots of descriptive text when you roll the mouse over a region of the image.\n\nI just rolled this quick example together, using an image I had created for our Writing HTML tutorial, dusting off the geology cobwebs, it is a graph used in introductory geology to help classify volcanos. When you roll overthe image in flickr, you get short explanation or detail related to the region of the diagram.\n\nThis is done easily in flickr when you edit a photo, and click the small icon for Add Note. A region is added to your image which you can drag to resize and reposition over a part of an image, and then compose the note associated with that image.\n\nHotspot type diagrams have many uses in learning- e.g. identifying parts of the nervous system for an anatomy and physiology class, diagraming a sentence structure for English, clarifying composition for music theory, illustrating the location of engine parts for an engiineering class... on and on"}

{"text": "Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students research endangered animal species that have 'beaten the odds' as they continue to survive longer than scientists had expected. Students write individual pages for a class book about endangered species.\n\nAuthor(s):\nEric Miller, The New York Times Learning Network\n\nSuggested Time Allowance: 1 hour\n\nObjectives: Students will: 1. Brainstorm facts about endangered species. 2. Probe the phenomena of endangered species that continue to survive beyond expectations by reading and discussing, \"Extinction Turns Out to Be a Slow, Slow Process.\" 3. Research a selected endangered animal species and create an informational poster board. 4. Present their poster boards to the class. 5. Synthesize their notes into a written report following a standardized format for inclusion in a class book on endangered species.\n\nActivities / Procedures: 1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Students respond to the following in their journals (written on the board prior to class): \"What are some of the factors that result in animal species becoming endangered or extinct? If possible, give specific examples of animals and environments.\" After five to ten minutes, students share their responses. Record student responses on the board in two columns (extinct animal species, endangered animal species). You may need a third column for animals that were previously endangered, but are no longer considered endangered.\n\n2. As a class, read and discuss \"Extinction Turns Out to Be a Slow, Slow Process,\" focusing on the following questions: a. In what ways have near-extinct species surprised scientists? b. Why have predictions of species extinction become an embarrassment to scientists? c. What is meant by the quote, \"To a species, a human lifetime is a little flicker.\"? How does this quote relate to the topic of the article? d. What are some of the primary causes of species extinction? e. What is the difficulty of using scientific data from previously extinct species to help with future predictions? f. What tools do scientists currently use to predict extinction rates? g. Why are biologists and paleontologists described as being at odds with each other? h. What does the article describe as the central challenge to scientists who are investigating endangered species? What are the proposals to help with this challenge? i. How can the perception that endangered species are always exotic be dangerous?\n\n3. Working individually or in pairs, students select an endangered animal species (or formerly endangered species) to research in greater depth. Students may choose from the following: Javan rhinoceros or Hawaiian po'ouli (both currently living near extinction), Puerto Rican parrot or North American gray wolf (both formerly in danger of extinction). Internet resources for these four species are provided below. Teachers may permit students to choose alternative species (from the class list brainstormed during WARM-UP activity, or from another list of endangered species). Using available resources students probe for answers to the following questions: \u2013What is the common habitat of this species? Where was this species located prior to endangerment? How has the habitat or location of the species changed since it became endangered? If this population has recovered, how has the habitat or location changed since recovery? \u2013What are some distinguishing characteristics or adaptations of this species? \u2013What are the known causes of reductions in the population of this species? If the species has recovered, what known factors have contributed to the recovery? \u2013What roles have humans and human developments played in the reduction of this population? \u2013What roles have humans played in attempting to save this species from extinction?\n\nStudents use their research notes to guide the creation of informational poster boards about endangered species. Students may include illustrations, maps, or charts to enhance their posters.\n\n4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Students present their poster boards to the class. For homework, students write out their notes into full paragraphs (at least one full page in length). Students use a standardized organizational format (agreed upon in class) as they write up their research notes. These written reports will be combined to create a class book about endangered species.\n\nFurther Questions for Discussion: \u2013What plant or animal species are endangered in your local area? \u2013What responsibility do you think humans have for the extinction of plant and animal species? \u2013Is it possible for a species to become extinct \"quickly\" yet take a few hundred years to become extinct?

{"text": "FREE Lesson Plan - 1st of 3 Free Items\n\nEstimating Turtle Size and Age\n\nGrade Levels: 5 - 12\n\nThis activity is very similar to the Long-Lived Turtles lesson except that it adds the concepts of sampling error and variability in scientific data. It is appropriate for more advanced students who are learning about research and ways to analyze data.\n\nObjective\n\nStudents will learn how to estimate age and size of turtles, and understand variability in scientific data.\n\nMaterials\n\nLive turtle or turtle shell\n\nFlexible transparent ruler with millimeter scale\n\nCopies of two diagrams: Measuring Turtle Length and Estimating Turtle Age from Scutes\n\nProcedure\n\nIdentify the parts of the shell including carapace (back), plastron (underside), and scutes (scales).\n\nRefer to the diagram to show students how to measure the length of the turtle's plastron along the midline from one end to the other. Then demonstrate how to measure the carapace length using first the straight-line method and then the curved-line method.\n\nHave students measure the length of each turtle shell and record their measurements.\n\nPoint out the lines on the scutes of either the carapace or plastron. Use the diagram to demonstrate how to count the lines on one scute. The number of lines on each scute represents an estimate of the age of the turtle.\n\nHave each student independently measure the turtle's carapace length and record the measurement on a piece of paper. Be sure that everyone uses the same method, either straight-line or curved. Also have each student count the number of lines on a scute and record the estimate of the turtle's age.\n\nAssign two people the job of reading the measurements off the slips of paper and recording them in tables on the board. Did everyone use the same units of measure? If not, convert the values to the same units. Calculate the average of the measurements for the length and age of the turtle.\n\nIdentify the maximum and minimum values reported for length and age of the\nturtle. These values will give the students an idea of the variability involved in measuring. Have the students talk about exactly how each person measured the\nshell and compare techniques. The variability in how they measured the shell is a type of sampling error. It always occurs in sampling and can be a problem for\nscientists trying to gather exact information. Some of the sampling error is due to mistakes, whereas some is due to differences in researcher technique. Discuss with the students how they might reduce this sort of variability. For example, teachers might provide clearer directions for taking measurements, or researchers might practice on a model or separate animal first.\n\nAsk the students to identify other kinds of variability that might affect the accuracy of their results. For example, turtles may not add exactly one growth line per year, so counting the lines may not give an accurate measure of age. Also, as turtles get older, their shells often get so worn that some or all of the growth lines may be obliterated.\n\nHave the students take the entire range of sizes recorded and divide it into five equal intervals. Draw a graph with the size intervals on the x-axis and numbers on the y-axis ranging from zero to the total number of students. Have the students plot the total number of measurements that were recorded by them within each of the size intervals. This is a graph of the distribution of the variability of the measurements. If all the measurements were the same, there would be only one point on the graph. Usually, however, you will see a bell-shaped curve, with the most measurements occurring at the average size and a few measurements near the minimum and maximum sizes. This is the famous bell curve of a normal distribution. In general, the more measurements you have, the\nsmoother the curve.\n\nFinish by talking about why there might be more measurements near the average size. Much of the statistical analysis that researchers perform begins by examining the information in the same way that the students have just done"}

As well as rivers, lakes and creeks, the catchment includes the land contained within its physical boundaries. Everything in a catchment is linked. What happens in one part of a catchment will have an effect downstream. A catchment also includes the stormwater drains and pipes that carry water that runs off roofs, driveways, roads and other impervious surfaces.\n\nNSW River Catchments\n\nThe headwaters of most NSW rivers are in the Great Dividing Range, from which they flow east to the Pacific Ocean or west to the Murray-Darling system. The east-flowing streams generally have higher, more reliable flows than those in the west, because of higher precipitation on the eastern slopes. NSW coastal rivers discharge almost three times the amount of water than do rivers flowing inland. Average coastal river discharge is 28 million megalitres per year. Average inland river discharge is 10.5 million megalitres per year.\n\nRiver Systems\n\nRivers may be large or small, but they all follow the same rules of drainage. Rivers may begin from underground water coming to the surface (springs), from rainfall, from snowmelt or drainage from a wetland or a lake. Some creeks dry up during periods of low rainfall. These are called intermittent streams.\n\nAs creeks increase in flow and join with other creeks, a branching network is established. This network from headwater streams to the river mouth is called a river system. A catchment is made up of smaller sub-catchments that feed into the river system.\n\nImpact of Urbanisation\n\nUrbanisation increases the area of impervious surfaces (such as roads and roofs) in a catchment. This causes rainfall that previously infiltrated into soil or flowed off catchments at a slow rate, to flow off the catchment quickly and in greater volumes.\n\nIn urban areas, many small creeks have been replaced with piped and lined drainage systems. This accelerates the rate at which stormwater is carried and increases flooding and erosion problems. The concentration of pollutants such as oil, grease, sediment and organic matter running off urban surfaces causes deterioration in the water quality downstream."}

{"text": "Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students reflect on the uses of superconductors and their properties and develop an understanding of the B.C.S. theory of superconductivity uses of electricity and the impacts of electrical resistance. 2. Learn about two key properties of superconductivity by viewing video clips that demonstrate them. 3. Learn about the history and concepts of superconductivity by reading and discussing the article \"When Superconductivity Became Clear (to Some).\" 4. Create a two-page spread about superconductivity for a high school physics text book.\n\nActivities / Procedures: Note to teachers: Due to the difficulty of the article and the concepts involved in superconductivity, this lesson is suitable for a high school or higher-level physics audience. Prior to this lesson, students should have knowledge and understanding of electrical conductivity and resistivity, atomic structure and the forces of attraction and repulsion. Computer accessibility to allow the class to view the suggested video clips is also highly recommended.\n1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Upon entering class, students respond to the following prompt in their journals (written on the board prior to class): \"What are the uses of electricity in our society? What is electrical resistance and how does it affect the transportation of electricity from a source to places of use? Why would people want to reduce electrical resistance to zero?\"\nAfter a few minutes, have students share their answers with the class. Record students' responses on the board. Explain that as electricity moves through wires, some of the energy is lost as heat due to electrical resistance. This is similar to the concept of friction. Decreasing electrical resistance results in less energy being lost and a more efficient system. How would this be valuable in today's energy conscious society?\nTell students that zero electrical resistance is possible at extremely low temperatures. Do you know what this is called? Introduce students to concept of superconductivity, defined as the flow of electricity without resistance. Invite students to share what they may already know about superconductivity and its applications.\n2. Tell students that, prior to reading a New York Times article about superconductivity, they will be previewing some of the difficult concepts explained in the article. Explain that students will be watching and discussing two video clips that illustrate the properties of superconductors and explain the B.C.S. theory. Prior to class, prepare each video clip for viewing.\nVIDEO CLIP 1: Property of Perfect Diamagnetism\nThe first video clip will demonstrate that superconductors expel a magnetic field. Explain that students will be watching a short video clip of a strong magnet being placed on top of a superconductor. Have students predict what will happen in their journals.\nInvite students to share their predictions. Then show a video clip demonstrating the Meissner Effect, such as the one on the University of Oslo Department of Physics Web site ( or on YouTube ( As students watch the video clip, have them jot down answers to the following questions in their journals: -What do you see happening? -Why do you think the magnet is floating above the superconductor? -What do you think the liquid and gas shown in the clip are? What is the purpose of this liquid?\nInvite students to share their ideas about the video clip. Explain that the Meissner Effect demonstrates the property of superconductors called perfect diamagnetism. This means that superconductors are not affected by magnetic fields. The magnetic field of a superconductor is actually zero. When a strong magnet is placed above a superconductor, the magnet acts as if the superconductor is reflecting the same force back at it, causing a repulsive force that makes the magnet levitate. The liquid in the video is liquid nitrogen. Liquid nitrogen cools the ceramic disc until it acts as a superconductor.\nDiscuss the applications of this property of superconductors. How do you think the Meissner effect might be used in society? Why is it a problem that superconductors need to be kept at very low temperatures? Explain that this effect is important to the technology behind a Maglev train and MRI machines.\nVIDEO CLIP 2: Property of Zero Resistivity\nExplain that a second property of superconductors is that they have zero electrical resistance. Tell students that three scientists (Dr. John Bardeen, Dr. Leon Cooper and Dr. J. Robert Schrieffer) developed a theory, known as the B.C.S. theory, to explain why superconductors have zero resistance.\nHave students watch the video explanation of the B.C.S. theory found on the Australian Multimedia for Physics Students Web site ( Instruct students to take notes on how the B.C.S. theory works. Provide the following questions for students to answer as they watch: -What causes resistivity in a regular conductor? -How do cold temperatures affect the atomic motion in the conductor? -How do electrons move through super conductors without resistance? How is this different from regular conductivity? -How do Cooper pairs form, and how are they facilitating zero resistivity?\nAfter watching this video clip, discuss B.C.S. theory with students. Also, provide students with the New York Times graphic on Low-Temperature Superconductivity ( Discuss the graphic to reinforce the concepts highlighted in the video. As necessary, provide simple analogies to help students understand these concepts, such as those found online at  or \n3. As a class, read and discuss the article \"When Superconductivity Became Clear (to Some)\" ( focusing on the following questions: a. What experiment led to the discovery of superconductivity? b. Why is superconductivity compared to a \"real-world perpetual motion machine\"? c. How was the B.C.S. theory received by the scientific community? d. How does the simile \"like balls in a diminutive pinball machine\" help you visualize electrical resistance? e. How do the electrons in superconductors behave differently than they do in a typical conductor? f. How did the Meissner Effect provide a clue about the nature of superconductivity? g. What contribution to the B.C.S. theory was discovered by Dr. Bardeen and Dr. Pines? h. How did Dr. Cooper's realization further the understanding of Superconductivity? i. How does Dr. Schrieffer's analogy about \"a line of ice skaters\" help you understand this final piece of the B.C.S. theory?\n4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students will use the class activities, videos and article to create a spread on superconductors and superconductivity designed for inclusion in a high school physics textbook. Science concepts and ideas to be highlighted in the text book spread should include: -a definition of superconductivity -an explanation of the properties of superconductors (diamagnetism and zero resistivity) -an explanation of B.C.S. theory -key scientists in superconductivity research -uses of superconductors -future applications of superconductors \u2013explanation of why a superconductor at room temperature would be an extremely useful, revolutionary invention\nEncourage students to include the use of graphics, diagrams, text boxes, photographs and analogies to make the information visually appealing and interesting to read.\n\nFurther Questions for Discussion: -Where is the future of superconductivity heading? -What are the applications of superconductors? -What are the latest theories about high-temperature superconductors?\n\nEvaluation / Assessment: Students will be evaluated based on participation in the initial exercise, thoughtful participation and discussion of the article, responses to video clips and creation a text book spread for homework.\n\nExtension Activities: 1. Research one of the physicists mentioned in the article. How did their research impact the study of physics? Write a short biography telling about the scientist and his work.\n2. Make a timeline showing the history of superconductivity. What were the events that led to our current knowledge of superconductors? How will physicists continue to build on these discoveries in the future?\n3. Make a glossary of terms related to superconductivity, including superconductors, electricity, electrical resistance, magnetic field, diamagnetism, absolute zero, quantum mechanics, current, electrons, atoms, energy, attract, repel, Cooper pairs, low-temperature superconductors and high-temperature superconductors.\n4. Compare and contrast Type I and Type II superconductors. Make a Venn diagram showing the differences and similarities between them, including the uses and drawbacks of each. Then write a response to the following questions: Why is the discovery of Type II superconductors seen as a stepping stone to discovering superconductors that work at room temperature? Why would room temperature superconductors be an incredible innovation?\n5. Conduct research to learn about the applications of superconductors, such as in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines, NMR imaging, Maglev Trains, or SQUID magnetometers. Make a How-It-Works poster illustrating and explaining one of these uses of superconductors.\n\nInterdisciplinary Connections: Language Arts \u2013 Write and illustrate a children's book explaining superconductivity and its applications to a younger audience.\nMathematics \u2013 Look at a graph showing the effects of temperature on conductivity, such as the one found at  What happens to the resistance of superconductors at the critical temperature? Write a paragraph explaining the graph.\nTeaching with The Times \u2013 Read the Science Times section every week for two months, clipping articles that explain scientifically advanced or complex concepts, like superconductivity, to the Times readership. Note some of the ways the reporters make the concepts understandable, such as the use of metaphor and simile, as well as simple language and sentence structure. Then choose a topic you have learned about in science this year (or find out about science projects executed by fellow students) and, using the techniques you have learned from the Times articles, write an article for your school newspaper. To order The New York Times for your classroom, click here.\nTechnology \u2013 Research the use of superconductors to make Josephson devices. What are Josephson devices? What is their potential impact on the future of electronics and computer technologies? Make a presentation telling about these devices and how you think they will affect the future.\n\nAcademic Content Standards:\nGrades 9-12 Science Standard 10 \u2013 Understands forces and motion.

A short history of the evolving interest in examining interactions between different \"brands\" of science within the natural Earth system is provided. Special problems of investigating the richly interactive Earth system in the context of an \"open scientific system\" - as opposed to a controlled experiment in the laboratory - are introduced. The special role of humans in Earth system science is also introduced.\n\nSystemic Thinking\n\nThis topic focuses on the rules of logic in investigating natural systems that we cannot control; and a most important aspect of examining the interactions between different cause-effect processes that operate within an open Earth system. Cause-effect processes in the biosphere may have significant interactions with cause-effect processes in the atmosphere, or hydrosphere. The science of the geosphere has important implications for climate and climate change. Weather and climate changes feed back into the behavior of the hydrosphere, and various biological systems living within. Teaching about the simplistic causeeffect relationships within a specific discipline is a perfect beginning for 21st Century Earth System Science Education, but is not the perfect ending. Teaching interactions, feedbacks, and implications are fundamental to Earth System Science Education (ESSE).\n\nEarth System Science Educational Strategies\n\nA brief introduction to strategies of initiating ESSE at colleges and universities is also provided in this section. Decisions about breadth and depth of a curricular track are the most fundamental aspect of curriculum design.

Did you know that when you eat peas or beans you are actually eating seeds? Those seeds have other uses. Let's see what these are.\n\nINSTRUCTION:\n\nWho can tell me what you see in these pictures. (Show pictures of different types of plants, trees and flowers.) Can you name some plant parts? (These responses can be listed on the board.) Plants are grown, not only for beauty, but also for many other purposes. Some of the foods we eat come from plants. Can you name some foods that come from plants? (Again - list the student responses on the board. Hold up a lettuce leaf.) What part of the plant is this? Yes, it is a leaf. Can you think of other leaves we eat? (Spinach, cabbage) We are going to talk about plants and find out how we use each part of the plant.\n\nWhere do the plant's roots grow? (pause) On top of or under the soil? (Have a picture of a plant with each part labeled.) Who can show me where the roots are? (Have children point tot he roots.) What do roots do? Yes, roots help to hold plants in place. What do you think would happen if plants did not have roots? (Have children discuss the roots of plants and what they do for the plant.) Roots also take food and water from the soil to feed the plants. We are going to watch some plants grow. Then you will know what they do.\n\nSUPERVISED PRACTICE:\n\n(Stick three toothpicks into the middle of a sweet potato. Balance the toothpicks on top of a glass jar filled with water so that one-half of the sweet potato is below water. Place it in an area where all the children can observe the changes.) Wait a few days and ask the children what changes they observed. (Sweet potato grew small roots)\n\nMONITOR AND ADJUST:\n\nWhat do roots do for the plant? (Take in food and water and holds plant firmly in place)\n\nINSTRUCTION:\n\nStems are also parts of plants. Someone come and show the class where the stem is on this plant. (Hold up picture of the plant with the parts labeled.) What does the stem do for the plant? (Hold up the plant.) The trunk of a tree is a stem. What do people use tree stems for? (Lumber that can be used to make furniture, build houses, many other things) Can you name some stems that we eat? (Celery, potatoes, broccoli, asparagus) Flowers have soft, thin stems. The trunk of a tree is a stem. (Have pictures of flowers and trees that show the stems of flowers and the trunks of trees.) How are the stems of these plants different? (response) How are they the same? (response) How do stems help plants? (response) Let's find out.\n\nSUPERVISED PRACTICE:\n\n(While the students watch, fill a glass with water. Add a few drops of food coloring. Place a stalk of celery in the colored water.) What do you think will happen to the stem and the water? (response) We are going to check the stalk of celery in about two hours. (The colored water will travel up the stem to the leaves.) What do you think would happen if the water did not travel up to the leaves and flowers of a plant that was still growing? (The parts would wither, dry up, and die)\n\nMONITOR AND ADJUST:\n\nTurn to your neighbor and tell him/her where the roots and stems are on a plant and what each does for the plant.\n\nINSTRUCTION:\n\nA leaf is also a part of a plant. The leaf grows on the stem. A while ago, we talked about leaves that we eat. Can you remember what we saw? (Lettuce leaf) Can you name some other leaves that we eat? (Cabbage, collards, mustard, kale, spinach) What do leaves do for the plant? (response) Yes, the leaves make food for the plant. Leaves use air, water and sunlight.\n\nSUPERVISED PRACTICE:\n\nWe are going to watch the leaves on this plant. (Hold up a small plant.) We are going to place the plant near a window or door. What do you think is going to happen? (Write down the predictions to use later.) We are going to watch the plant for several days.\n\nINSTRUCTION:\n\nWhat is the prettiest part of a plant? (response) Yes, the flower. How do you think the flowers help the plant? (response) Yes, they produce the seeds that will grow into new plants. Someone point to the flower on this plant. (Hold up picture of plant with parts labeled.) Can you name some flowers that we eat? (Broccoli, cauliflower) Some plants make a cover for their seeds. The cover is called a fruit. Some fruits have many seeds inside, and some have only one seed. What fruits do you like to eat? (Have children name the fruits they eat.) What happens if you plant a seed? (New plant grows) What kind of fruit will grow if we plant an apple seed? (response) What about a plum seed? (response) Yes, a seed can only grow into a new plant that is the same kind as the plant in which it grew.\n\nSUPERVISED PRACTICE:\n\nWe are going to find the seeds in this orange, apple, peach and plum. (Have children help to find the seeds.)\n\nCLOSURE:\n\nWho can tell me what we have learned today? (pause) As I point to each part of the plant, please say that part with me. The parts of the plant are - starting from the bottom - roots, stems, leaves, flowers. Some flowers make covers called fruits. Inside the fruits are seeds.\n\nAny root, stem, leaf, seed, or fruit that is edible, pictures of animals which show plant parts being eaten, pictures of food prepared from plant parts\n\nSET:\n\nPlants help us in many ways. Raise your hand if you had cereal for breakfast. (response) Who had Rice Krispies? (response) Oatmeal? (response) Corn Flakes? (response) Then you had a part of a plant. Did you know that animals also eat parts of plants? (response) Today we will find out what parts of plants people and animals eat.\n\nINSTRUCTION:\n\nDid you know that humans can eat roots of some plants? (response) Raise you hand if you have ever eaten carrots or turnips. (response) Then you have eaten roots! Did you ever eat spinach or lettuce? (response) Then you have eaten leaves. If you have celery or asparagus, what part of the plant have you eaten? (Stem) Name some fruits we eat from plants. (Apples, oranges) The seeds we eat are oats, barley, rice, wheat, nuts.\n\nACTIVE PARTICIPATION:\n\n(Section off a bulletin board with a section for each plant part. Give a magazine to each pair of students.) Now that we've learned the plant parts we can eat, I want you to look through these magazines and, when you find a picture that will go on one of our bulletin board sections, cut it out and put it on the bulletin board.\n\nINSTRUCTION:\n\nSome animals eat seeds. Can you name some animals that eat seeds? (Birds, squirrels, cows, etc.) Some animals even eat leaves. Can you name some animals that eat leaves? (Worms and caterpillars, cows, deer, rabbits, chickens, etc.) We like to eat different kinds of fruit and so do some of the animals. Name some animals for me that eat fruit. (Monkeys, insects, birds, etc.)\n\nCLOSURE:\n\nPlants give us some of the food we need. We get food from stems, roots, leaves, roots and seeds of some plants. Tell your neighbor something you eat that comes from a plant and what part of the plant it is. Then name an animal for your neighbor that eats the same plant part that you eat.

{"text": "Exploring Creation with Biology is a 9th grade high school biology curriculum written from a Christian and creationist perspective. This almost 600 page hefty hardbound text has 16 Modules:\n\nBiology: The Study of Life\n\nKingdom Monera\n\nKingdom Protista\n\nKingdom Fungi\n\nThe Chemistry of Life\n\nThe Cell\n\nCellular Reproduction and DNA\n\nMendelian Genetics\n\nEvolution: Part Scientific Theory, Part Unconfirmed Hypothesis\n\nEcology\n\nThe Invertebrates of Kingdom Animalia\n\nPhylum Arthropoda\n\nPhylum Chordata\n\nKingdom Plantae: Anatomy and Classification\n\nKingdom Plantae: Physiology and Reproduction\n\nReptiles, Birds, and Mammals\n\nAcknowledging that most homeschool parents aren't comfortable teaching biology, the authors explain why Exploring Creation with Biology is \"ideal for such parents.\" The text is written in an easy-to-understand style, and most of the experiments can be carried out with household or easily attainable materials. The authors are dedicated to helping parents and students use their materials. Help is available via phone, email, or regular mail or on their website.\n\nEach module is roughly 30 pages long and takes about 45-60 minutes a day for two weeks to complete (except for module six, which takes three weeks). However, there is no exact breakdown of what should be done in a day or a week's time. This is intentional, as the curriculum is meant to be flexible (in tune with homeschooling in general). If one wants more direction in figuring out how much to do each day, the website has some guidelines.\n\nHere is what a module looks like. The conversational text addresses the student and is interspersed with excellent quality photos and graphics. Vocabulary, including pronunciation, appears in bold print. About 15 to 20 \"On Your Own\" questions, highlighted in yellow, are also scattered throughout. These are to be answered by the student as he reads, and the answer (printed at the end of the module) is to be checked immediately. I would suggest putting a sticky-tab bookmark on the answer page for ease in flipping to this page while reading.\n\nThere are also several experiments in the module to be done as the student encounters them. It is recommended that the student keep an experiment notebook to aid in the learning process and also as a record to show evidence of having taken this class to prospective college admission boards.\n\nSpecialized lab equipment is available for purchase, including a microscope, a slide set, and a dissection kit with specimens. Although the experiments requiring these items are optional, they are beneficial to the student.\n\nEach module ends with a \"study guide\" or quiz. It functions as a review, and students may use the text in answering the questions. Answers are found in the corresponding Solutions and Tests book (sold separately).\n\nThe textbook concludes with a glossary and three appendices. The first one is \"A Simple Biological Key,\" which is a duplication of a table that appears on pages 21-23 of the text. It is a flow-chart of sorts for determining the biological classification of a particular lifeform. Appendix B contains summaries of all the modules. These are fill-in-the-blank sentences that the student is to write out completely rather than just fill in. Answers to these are in the Solutions and Tests book. The last appendix is a complete list of lab supplies, organized by module and type of experiment. Lastly, you will find what every good textbook should have--an index.\n\nThe Solutions and Tests book contains teacher's notes, solutions to the study guides, answers for selected experiments, answers to the module summaries in Appendix B, module tests and answers, and quarterly tests and answers. The teacher's notes explain the teaching philosophy of the course, the student assignments and experiments, and the recommended grading procedure.\n\nA style note on the text: the module breaks are not easily found by flipping through the book. Indeed, it seems to flow from module to module, except for a bolded \"MODULE #8\" at the top of the page. I think a colorful graphic at the top of the page or in the margin extending to the edge of the page would be helpful to students.\n\nExploring Creation with Biology is a complete, beautiful, God-glorifying biology curriculum highly worthy of consideration for your high school student.\n\nProduct review by Kathy Gelzer, The Old Schoolhouse\u00ae Magazine, LLC, August 2008"}

{"text": "Activity - Ecological Interactions: The Food Cobweb\n\nE&E IPM Standard: 4A, 4C, 7B, 10 A, 12 A\n\nSkills: Ordering, inferring, predicting, critical thinking\n\nIntroduction:\nPlants and animals live in interacting, intertwined communities. There\nis a characteristic set of species in different environments. For\nexample, certain species of trees, shrubs, ground cover, arthropods,\nreptiles, mammals, birds etc. live in a temperate forest environment. A\ncompletely different set of creatures live in a marsh, or a grassland\nor an agroecosystem. However, the relationships between these groups\ncan be defined by the ecological role they play, the flow of energy\nbetween them and the cycling of nutrients between them. This is a fancy\nway of saying \"everything is connected\"! And if you change one part of\nthe system, something else changes. In an ecosystem management\ndecision, you hope you know what those consequences of your actions\nare!) This is important in managing agroecosystems as well.\n\nMany organisms eat just about anything, plant or animal. These are\nomnivores, like my friend Bob. Organisms that feed primarily on\ndecaying organic matter are scavengers or detritivores. Each organism\nhas a certain way of making a living it its environment, that is it has\nits niche.\n\nA simple food chain, in which chemical energy and nutrients are passed along might be:\n1. GRASS \u2014> COW \u2014>YOU! (So thank the grass next time you eat a burger!)\nOR\n2. CORN PLANT\u2014> INSECT \u2014> BIRD \u2014> HAWK\n\nHow many other examples can you give?\n\nHowever, most transactions are more complex than these examples. Can\nyou make even these simple ones more complex? Once all the organisms\nthat rely on another are mapped out, the relationship looks more like a\nfood web than a straight-line chain.\n\nLet's see how organisms rely on each other within a system.\n\nLearning Objectives: 1. See in what ways living things are connected.\n2. Understand that systems are more or less complex in their connections.\n3. Learn what happens if certain living components of the system are removed.\n4. Construct a simple food web that might be found in an agroecosystem\n5. Consider the pest management implications of food webs\n\nMaterials Needed: o Pre-made cards showing the ecosystem, name of organism, classification, and food.\no Pre-made cards that have an arrow, stating \"Energy Flow\"\no Big pieces of paper for students to draw out their own food webs\no (You can also do this exercise with balls of yarn, see below.)\n\nProcedure: If using card layout\n1. Give students all the cards representing marsh ecosystem connections\n2. Lay out the species joined with \"Energy Flow\" arrow cards to each of their stated foods.\n3. Diagram the food web thus created.\n4. Pull out a species, thus erasing the connections it has to other species. What happens?\n\nIf doing the ball of yarn technique 1. Give the students the marsh ecosystem playing cards with the individual's role listed\n2. Each student has a card (Make as many cards as you have students.)\n3. Each student then identifies who they need to be connected to to live and takes a piece of yard\nthat they both hold onto. Repeat with as many different food types as they eat.\n4. Teacher reaches in and removes one species from the group.\n5. Students note what happens to them and everyone around them.\n\nIPM Application 1. Have the students create & explain their own food web in an agricultural or garden setting.\n2. Include species that are pests of the plants or animals; or weeds with their herbivores.\n3. Include predators upon these species\n4. Have students discuss how they would manage these pests without disrupting the environment.\n\nTimeline: Full class period for intro to food webs, A second period for IPM application.\n\nAnalysis: What happened when one of the organisms is removed from the food web?\nIs there the same amount of disruption for every species removed?\nWhat situations in the real world might impact members of the food web?\nWhat other factors can affect the system as a whole (not just individual species)?\n\nDiscussion:\nDiscuss the effect of biodiversity in a food web.\nCompare the agricultural ecosystem with the marsh ecosystem.\nAre some species more in danger of being knocked out of a system than others?\nWhy or why not?\nAre some ecosystems more fragile than others?\nWhat might determine this?\nWhat might the effect of an invasive species (plant, animal or disease) be on an ecosystem?\nWhat considerations might you take into account when choosing IPM\ntactics for management of pests in various ecosystems?"}

They explore how it would change the look of sand or clay over time.\n\nFifth graders practice using the Internet for research. In this technology lesson, 5th graders navigate the Internet to find information on the surface of the Earth and how it is changing. They complete a worksheet.\n\nStudents depict the various layers of the Earth through an interactive art project. In this Earth's layers lesson, students listen to the book How to Dig a Hole to the other Side of the World and make speculations of why the center of the earth is made up of iron and nickel. Students use colored sand to create an art project showing the various layers of Earth.\n\nStudents research plate tectonics and the impact of changes to the Earth's surface. In this Earth science instructional activity, students visit the given websites to learn about plate tectonics. Students write a journal entry for the sites and then study a PowerPoint for the topic. Students complete a worksheet for the topic.\n\nFourth graders construct a concept map about Plate Tectonics. They include types of movement, names and effects of boundaries. They research plate tectonics, describe and name 3 types. They analyze the effect on the earth's surface of plate activity.\n\nStudents investigate how the earth's surface changes. In this geology lesson plan, students watch a simulation of how the earth changes by using sand and baby powder with a fan turned on high. Students note the changes and then conduct an experiment using sand in a baking pan with water. Students observe the changes as the water is poured into the pan.

{"text": "gather evidence to understand that\norganisms in an ecosystem are tied together by their need\nfor energy. In Part I, students read an interactive story\nthat explains how the Sun's energy is captured by producers\nand passed along to other consumers in the food chain. Then\nthey watch a video on decomposers, organisms that get their\nenergy by feeding on dead organisms and the wastes of living\nthings. They learn that decomposers break down dead organisms\nand wastes and release the nutrients they contain into the\nsoil, where they are again available to the roots of plants\n(producers). In this way, decomposers play an important role\nin recycling nutrients and getting rid of waste.\n\nIn Part II, students explore an ocean ecosystem and construct\na food chain to show how energy flows through this environment.\n\nObjectives\n\nIdentify the producers, consumers, and decomposers\nin an ecosystem\n\nDraw a food chain to illustrate how energy flows\nthrough an ecosystem\n\nDescribe how energy derived from the Sun is used\nby plants to produce sugars and is transferred within a food\nchain from producers to consumers\n\nRecognize that events that affect one species in\nan ecosystem will have either positive or negative effects on\nthe other organisms in its food chain.\n\nMultimedia Resources\n\nMaterials\n\nBefore the Lesson\n\nMake copies of the handouts for each student.\n\nThe Lesson\n\nPart I: Where Do Plants and Animals Get Their Energy?\n\n1.\nAsk students what they had for lunch. List their responses\non the board. Write the words plant and animal on the board.\nAsk students to sort the food items into these two categories.\nFor example, a lunch consisting of a cheeseburger, fries, and\nmilk would be sorted this way:\n\nplant\n\nanimal\n\nbun\n\ncheese\n\nlettuce\n\nhamburger\n\ntomato\n\nmilk\n\nketchup\n\nFrench fries\n\n2.\nAsk students:\n\nWhy do we need to eat?\n\nWhere do cows get the energy they need to\nbuild muscle and produce milk?\n\nWhere do plants get the energy they need\nto make leaves, like the lettuce we eat?\n\nListen to their ideas, and then explain that they are going\nto explore an Energy Flow\nWeb activity that will answer these questions.\n\n4.\nAssess students' understanding of the\nEnergy Flow\nWeb activity by reviewing their answers to the questions\non the handout:\n\nWhere do plants get the energy they need to grow?\n\nWhat do plants use the sun's energy to manufacture?\n\nWhat do plants use most of their energy for?\n\nHow much of the energy that the plant captures through\nphotosynthesis ends up stored as starch in the kernel?\n\nFor what does the cow use the energy from the corn?\n\nHow much of the energy stored in the corn gets passed on\nto you in burgers?\n\nFor what do you use the energy in the burgers?\n\nHow would eating more plants help us better feed\nthe many people in the world?\n\nWhat else besides energy do we get from plants and\nanimals? When we eat them? (Answers: vitamins, minerals, and\nother nutrients needed to build body parts and keep the body\nrunning smoothly)\n\n5.\nStudents may have difficulty grasping the idea that only a\nsmall part (10%) of the energy captured or eaten at one step\nin the food chain is available to organisms at the next step\nin the food chain. To reinforce this idea, do the following\ndemonstration:\n\n6.\nHold up a slice a bread and tell students that one slice of bread\ncontains approximately 100 calories of energy. If they eat the bread,\nthey will get all 100 calories of energy to use for moving,\ngrowing, and making heat.\n\nNow cut the bread into 10 pieces. Explain that if a cow eats the\nbread instead, and students then eat a burger made from that\ncow's meat, they would get only 10 percent of the energy from\nthat slice of bread. (Hold up one of the bread pieces.) That's\nbecause the cow uses 90 calories or 9/10 (90%) of the energy in\nthe bread to move, grow, and make heat. Only 10 calories or 1/10\n(10%) of the energy from the bread gets stored in the cow's\nmeat and is available to students when they eat the hamburger.\n\n7.\nAsk students:\n\nWhat happens to all the trash you throw away at lunch?\nWhere does it go? What happens to it there?\n\nWhat happens to the energy stored in uneaten food\nand in dead plants and animals?\n\n13.\nHave students draw pictures of the living things mentioned in the\nvideo. On a bulletin board construct a huge food chain, using\nthese organisms and others that might be found in the ocean,\nto show how energy flows through this ecosystem.\n\n14. Ask students what effect might it have on the system if one of the producers, consumers, or decomposers disappeared? Discuss as a class.\n\nTeachers' Domain is proud to be a Pathways portal to the National Science Digital Library.\n\nMajor funding for Teachers' Domain was provided by the National Science Foundation."}

In this grasslands instructional activity, students examine paintings and discuss the different types of animals that live in the grasslands. Students examine the grassy areas around them and compare them to the paintings of the grasslands they see.\n\nLearners explore animal habitats in this collaborative lesson. First, they read Who Lives Here? by Dot and Sy Barlowe. Next, they get into groups to do research on one of three habitats, ponds, grasslands, or deserts. Finally, they create a visual presentation of what they learned, and share it with the class.\n\nHigh schoolers view a video clip about grasslands. They identify threats to grasslands and describe cultures which have adapted to grassland conditions. They discuss possible solutions to preserve grasslands as well.\n\nStudents explore Africa. In this grassland animal lesson, students get into groups and play different roles of being in a safari tour. Students make masks of the different animals and watch the movie The Lion King.\n\nFrom the depths of the oceans to the peaks of the mountains, your class will see the world with new eyes after this lesson. In a discussion about different ecosystems such as the jungle, the tundra, and the grasslands, they will describe which plants and animals might exist in those regions. After the discussion, have them draw a picture of the area in which they were born. If you don't like the scripted format, you could easily take the ideas to craft your own lesson."}

{"text": "Cell Zone\u00ae, LLC was founded in 2010 by Dawn Tamarkin, Ph.D., a biology professor at Springfield Technical Community College in Springfield, MA. The products we sell were primarily developed through National Science Foundation support; to disseminate the products to a larger audience requires selling them so that we can make more. It is for this reason that we chose to start a company. We have many more ideas for products and hope to expand our product list in the future as our company grows. Meanwhile, Dr. Tamarkin continues to teach at a community college and test out her ideas on her own classes.\n\nCell Zone\u00ae, LLC was\nformed with a mission to make Universal Design for Learning (UDL) biology products\navailable to more classrooms so that more students can learn about\nbiology. All of our products have been classroom tested and work with a\nvery wide range of students-- from 5th graders or middle schoolers\nthrough college science majors. Because our products reach students with diverse learning styles regardless of ability/disability, they are ideal for any classroom. In addition, students get to interact and participate in a student-centered approach when they use Cell Zone products, so they have more fun learning about biology.\n\nIt was our decision to form a company and sell directly to schools in order to keep the pricing of our products as low as possible. For example, one kit of our Dynamic Cell Models enable a class to model at least two unique eukaryotic cells at a time; meanwhile, a standard, quality, static model of a single eukaryotic cell typically costs more than our entire kit. With the Dynamic Cell Models, though, the students can continually change the cells that they are creating for endless variety and applicability. So although $399 may seem like a significant sum of money for many schools, this is relatively inexpensive for models. It is important to keep in mind that because the development of the Dynamic Cell Models was funded by the National Science Foundation, the costs of initial development and production did not have to get added into the cost to the teacher. We also received help from colleagues in creating our CAD designs, so that cost does not have to get passed to the teachers, either.\n\nAt\nCell Zone\u00ae, LLC, our goal is for science to be accessible to all students, not just the \"science-types.\" As well, students should be learning and experiencing science rather than just memorizing information. It is for this reason that we incorporate a UDL approach in all of our products."}

From showing off a shell collection to studying deep-diving robots, to exploring the many forms of literature about the sea, the options are amazing.\n\nMathematics is everywhere from the area of sail on a racing boat to subsurface mapping, pressure gradients at various depths, data on ships and shipping. Weather data alone offers many practical math opportunities. Compare the weather on land to the data from automated buoys anchored at sea. Track storms as they move across oceans.\n\nThe science and math learning that can be found in any study of oceans can also help us to look at human history and at many cultures. When the \"land bridge\" existed, connecting modern Siberia to Alaska, many humans migrated across it to North and South America. Why were ocean levels so low at that time, permitting a crossing? Where was all that H2O?\n\nWhat were the navigation skills used by Pacific islanders to travel vast distances to other islands? What do we know about the amazing Chinese exploring fleets whose ships were far bigger than European boats of the time?\n\nThe Egyptians, Greeks and others were skilled at sailing the Mediterranean both for trade and for war. They fished extensively as have almost all cultures with access to the sea. What did they trade for? What fish did they catch? How did they preserve those fish and other foods?\n\nCenturies later, as trade grew to global proportions, people imagined digging vast canals and eventually completed them: the Erie and others that moved products to a seaport, then the Suez and Panama to connect seas. In studying canals alone, the science, math and technology opportunities are huge, as are the historical elements. In the age of European empires, ocean-going ships were the main means of transport to and from colonies. How did canals between oceans change these empires? What is the value of the same canals today?\n\nThese topics and questions are only hints and any one of them can be approached on a simple level or with greater complexity. Ask your students for their ideas about oceans. Your studies could take you in any direction!"}

{"text": "Below: Complete Learning Outcome Progression\n\nAbstract\n\n(to paper)\n\nTo say Earth systems are complex, is not the same as saying they are a complex system. A complex system, in the technical sense, is a group of \"agents\" (individual interacting units, like birds in a flock, sand grains in a ripple, or individual units of friction along a fault zone), existing far from equilibrium, interacting through positive and negative feedbacks, forming interdependent, dynamic, evolutionary networks, that possess universality properties common to all complex systems (bifurcations, sensitive dependence, fractal organization, and avalanche behaviour that follows power-law distributions.)\n\nChaos/complex systems theory behaviors are explicit, with their own assumptions, approaches, cognitive tools, and models that must be taught as deliberately and systematically as the equilibrium principles normally taught to students. We present a learning progression of concept building from chaos theory, through a variety of complex systems, and ending with how such systems result in increases in complexity, diversity, order, and/or interconnectedness with time\u2014that is, evolve. Quantitative and qualitative course-end assessment data indicate that students who have gone through the rubrics are receptive to the ideas, and willing to continue to learn about, apply, and be influenced by them. The reliability/validity is strongly supported by open, written student comments.\n\nIntroduction to this Site:\n\nThe rubrics presented in the paper are a sequential series of models (some computer based, some qualitative) or graphic presentations that are designed to represent a specific concept in support of specific learning outcomes. There are 12 models leading to 19 learning outcomes. We do not use all the models in all the classes, but pick and choose what works best for the time available and the goals of the class.\n\nEach Model begins with a Description of the model, why we use it, why it is important, how it relates to other areas of knowledge. This is followed by a Presentation; how we develop the model in class. Finally are listed the Learning Outcomes for each model.\n\nA pdf table of the rubric sequence is available. Below we list the steps in the learning progression in the order we present them along with the learning outcomes; each of these link to a page where the Description, Representation, and Learning Outcomes are explained, with links to any computer models or figures used during teaching.\n\nTHE COMPLETE LEARNING PROGESSION\n\nModel: Logistic System (Xnext): Time Series - Part One (of 2 parts)\n\nAnticipated Learning Outcome:\n\n1. Computational viewpoint: the idea that in a dynamic system the only way to know the outcome of an algorithm is to actually calculate it; there is no shorter route to knowing its behavior. This is not true at values below about 3.0, but becomes true at higher values. That this is not intuitively obvious is clear to the students because at higher 'r' values they are unable to predict the changing behavior of the system based on past behavior.\n\n2. Positive/negative feedback: one central feature of all complex systems is that their behavior stems from the interplay of positive and negative feedbacks. This is a concept that students, when thrown into a natural complex system with many feedbacks operating, may have trouble grasping. The logistic system being so simple makes the influence of positive and negative feedback transparent.\n\n3. 'r' values: 'r' can be translated as rate of growth, although we use 'r' from this point on to talk about whether the 'r' value of any system is high (dissipating lots of energy and/or information), or low (settling toward an equilibrium state).\n\n4. Deterministic does not equal predictable: this is a very deep concept, especially if we explore its philosophical or theological roots (which in some classes we do). But, in classical science deterministic equals predictable, and predictable means it is deterministic. The logistic system is undeniably deterministic, but at higher 'r' values all semblance of predictability breaks down. For understanding complex systems this is the most important concept gained from exploration of the logistic system.\n\n5. Bifurcations are a change in the behavior of the system and the entire range of behaviors can be summarized in one diagram. Eric Newman, at his MyPhysicsLab web site has an applet of a chaotic pendulum. In just a couple of minutes we can demonstrate that bifurcations to complexity occur in a system that, going back to Galileo, is often taken as one of the best examples of a classical system.\n\n6. Instability increases with 'r'. The harder a system is pushed, the higher the 'r' value, the more unstable and unpredictable its behavior becomes,\n\n7. Self-similarity is patterns, within patterns, within patterns, so that you see complex detail at all scales of observation, all generated by an iterative process. We show examples of river drainage systems, plant branching patterns, zoom in on the Dow Jones on the stock market index, look at Earth temperature patterns during the past ice age, sea level curves, cladograms, and examples of fractally generated landscapes.\n\nModel: Fractal Geometry (more depth on self similarity)\n\nAnticipated Learning Outcome:\n\n8. There is no typical or average size of events or objects; they come nested inside each other, patterns within patterns, within patterns. Peripheral to these discussions, but crucial when dealing with statistics, is that normal statistical analysis cannot be used on fractally organized data sets; there is no mean or standard deviation for fractal objects.\n\n9. Unlike the geometry we are usually taught, most natural objects have non-whole number dimensions.\n\n10. All complex systems accelerate their rate of change\u2014bifurcations\u2014at the same rate. This is a universality property; if this rate of change in behavior of a system is detected, the system is a complex system.\n\nModel: Power Law Relationships\n\nAnticipated Learning Outcome:\n\n13. Small\u2014low energy\u2014events are very common, but do very little work. Large\u2014high energy\u2014events are very rare, but do most of the work in a system. In a complex system at high 'r' values a difference as little as one part in a million can result in different histories for the system.\n\nModel: Cellular Automata\n\nAnticipated Learning Outcome:\n\n(Same as last.) 17. All natural open systems dissipating sufficient energy evolve\u2014self-organize\u2014to critical, sensitive dependent states which lead to avalanches of change that follow a power law distribution.\n\nModel: Bak-Sneppen Ecosystem\n\n18. In a complex system everything is connected with everything else. Nothing exists in isolation from the rest, sitting in a protected niche, independent and self-sufficient.\n\n19. In a complex system no one can be completely safe, with complete control over their fate. Everyone has the potential to be an innocent victim since there is no way one can fully protect oneself from external actions."}

Note latitude and longitude are given along the sides and a grid across the map will make it easier to plot locations.\n\nK12\n\nFollow the track of the hurricane each day. There are several web sites you can use to do so. For this activity, you only need the lat/long of the hurricane. You may also wish students to see the size of the hurricane so they realize it extends quite a long ways beyond that one point (and its affects extend out quite a ways as well). The lat/long given should represent the center of the eye.\n\nYou can also check the forecast. Plot the forecast positions on the day you start. As you plot the progress of the hurricane see how the track compares with that original forecast. To find the forecast positions, see the \"Discussion\" from:\n\nHow does the uncertainty in hurricane forecasts affect people who have to decide whether to order an evacuation? people who live on the coast?\n\nAsk the students a couple days before landfall, what they would do if they lived along the coast and why. Obviously if a forced evacuation was ordered, they would not have a choice. However, if they could make their own decision would they risk staying or take the safe choice and leave? Do they think that the local government should be able to force people to evacuate or should it be each family's choice?\n\nThis is a good activity to accompany the Weather Eye Hurricanes lesson in which students role play different members of the community each of whom has input into the decision of whether to evacuate or not.

{"text": "Teaching Tools\n\nLesson Plans: Exploring Geologic Time and The Burgess Shale Fossils\n\nOverview:\n\nStudents gain an understanding of Geologic Time in this hands-on activity, by building a physical model of the Geologic Time Scale. Some important developments in the evolution of life on Earth are illustrated and highlighted on the timeline, including the famous Burgess Shale fossil site, an UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Yoho National Park of Canada. Some mathematical calculations are required.\n\nLearning Expectations:\n\nto make a correct scale model of the Geologic Time Scale, showing its basic divisions of time\n\nto summarize, and place in order some of the major developments in the history of life on Earth\n\nto appreciate the great age of the Burgess Shale fossils, and why they are designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\nDuration of the lesson:\n\nApproximately one hour to actually build and label the timeline, assuming that all materials are previously collected. In and out of class research time (ranging from 1-3 hours), if desired.\n\nRequired Materials/Preparation:\n\n4 different colours of thick yarn (you will need about 4 metres of one colour, and small amounts of the other colours)\n\nmetric ruler or measuring tape\n\nscissors\n\ncolour markers\n\nmasking tape or flagging tape, copies of Tables 1 & 2 (included here)\n\ncalculator\n\n*computer, with Internet access (optional)\n\n*construction paper and pictures corresponding to the major events, string (optional)\n\nTeacher Background:\n\nStudents should know how to use a mathematical ratio to create a scale model, as well as be able to do basic metric conversions.\n\nThe Background Information section gives more details about each of the events listed in Table 2. Answers to the Discussion Questions are located within the text of the Background Information section.\n\nSmall groups may work together to build their own version of the timeline, then present theirs to the rest of the class. Illustrations representing each of the events (in random order) could be handed out to another group, and they could be asked to arrange the events on the timeline. The teacher can facilitate this exercise by encouraging participants to think about what had to happen first, in order for higher life forms to evolve (e.g. plants had to be present on land as a food source, before animals could move to land).\n\nAnswers to Tables 1 and 2, and to the Discussion Questions are included.\n\nProcedure:\n\nRefer to Table 1: Major Divisions of Geologic Time. Complete the table, using a calculator, to calculate the length of yarn that should be used to represent each major division of the geologic time scale (use the scale 1 cm = 10 million years).\n\nUse a different colour of yarn to represent each of the 4 divisions of time, and cut the lengths of yarn according to your calculations in Table 1. (You may need to add an extra 10 cm or so to each piece, to allow you to tie the pieces of yarn together.) Now you will have a colourful representation of the geologic time scale! (Make sure that when your lengths of yarn are tied together, the time periods remain approximately the correct length according to your calculations.)\n\nPlace a large knot at the beginning of Precambrian time on your timeline to represent the Formation of the Earth, 4.5 billion years ago.

However, it wasn't until the dawn of the Palaeozoic era (start of the Cambrian period) when life on Earth suddenly became abundant. Complex life has only existed on Earth for about the last 12% of Earth's long history!\n\nThe main divisions of geologic time are defined by major events in the Earth's history that are recorded in the fossil and/or rock record.\n\nSome Significant Events in the History of the Earth:\n\nFormation of the Earth\n\nThe estimated age of the Earth is 4.5 billion years old. At this time, Earth was a nasty place with a poisonous atmosphere and no signs of life anywhere. Gradually, an atmosphere of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, methane and water vapour built up from volcanic eruptions and meteors crashing into Earth. From this primitive beginning, the first life developed, and the atmosphere gradually changed to contain more and more oxygen, capable of supporting higher life forms.\n\nSimple Cellular Life\n\nA billion years after the planet formed, the first lifeforms, bacteria and cyanobacteria, were present. They formed mats in shallow tidal environments, and these mats trapped small particles of sand and other sediment to build structures called stromatolites. They had the ability to photosynthesise, i.e. use sunlight and CO 2 to make food, and in the process they gave off oxygen. As a result of their life processes, oxygen gradually built up in the Earth's atmosphere and in the oceans.\n\nCambrian Explosion\n\nIt was the Big Bang of evolution! In a very short time period, an abundance of fossils suddenly appeared in the fossil record showing that a large diversity of complex, multicellular animals were living in Earth's oceans at this time. This important event marks the beginning of the Palaeozoic eon. For the first time, many different animals acquired the ability to produce hard shells for protection. Trilobites, ancient marine arthropods, were present in great numbers in the Cambrian oceans, and were the first animals to develop eyes and the ability to see.\n\nBurgess Shale fossils\n\nThese world-famous fossils are found in Yoho National Park in British Columbia. They were first discovered by Charles Walcott in 1909. They represent a tremendous variety of plants and animals that lived in a warm, tropical, shallow sea. Some of these animals are ancient ancestors of animals alive today, but others are long extinct, and are nothing like creatures alive today! They lived a short time after the Cambrian Explosion, and are important to science because they are so old and so well preserved (even the soft tissues and membranes of the animals are preserved 505 million years after they died)! Today, the fossils rest in what is known as Walcott's quarry, high up on a mountain ridge near the village of Field.\n\nFirst Land Plants\n\nThe earliest known fossil land plants are from the Devonian period, and have been found mainly in Australia. These plants were quite small, and are called Cooksonia. Their stems were usually only a few centimetres high, and they lacked leaves and true roots. They were the first lifeforms to colonise the land!\n\nInsects\n\nHundreds of fossil insect species date back to the Pennsylvanian Period, 320 million years ago. Early insects were wingless, and related to living silverfish. When wings finally evolved, they initially projected out to both sides, but later, could be folded back along the body. Certain advanced groups such as those that interact with flowering plants (like bees, wasps, flies, and ants) do not appear in the fossil record until flowering plants evolved.\n\nAge of the Dinosaurs\n\nThe Jurassic period (208 \u2013 146 million years ago) was the age of the dinosaurs! The two main groups of dinosaurs were the Saurishians and the Ornithischians. The first group evolved from early reptiles, and had a pelvis like that of many other reptiles. The second group evolved from the Saurishians. This group had a birdlike pelvis. Dinosaurs would rule the land for over one hundred million years! At the time that dinosaurs were roaming the coastal plains of Alberta, the Rocky Mountains began to rise to the west.\n\nFlowering Plants\n\nFlowering plants appeared on land during the Mesozoic, about 40 million years ago. Much of their evolution was based on the symbiotic relationship that developed between insects and plants.\n\nCretaceous Extinction\n\nA major environmental crisis occurred within a short period of time, at the close of the Cretaceous period at the end of the Mesozoic era. Dinosaurs, large clams, ammonites, and other animal groups vanished in less than a million years. A large asteroid struck the Earth just offshore of the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico at this time, creating a tremendous explosion and firestorms that sent huge amounts of dust and debris up into the Earth's atmosphere that blocked out the sun. Evidence for such an impact is found in unusually high concentrations of the rare element iridium, found in clay layers in many places around the world dating from this time period. The iridium is believed to come from the asteroid. Convincing evidence of this theory was provided when an oil company discovered the asteroid's crater beneath the bottom of the sea. However, there is evidence that an environmental crisis was already in progress and was causing extinctions before the asteroid impact, but the asteroid was the final blow to the dinosaurs. There were at least 4 other periods of mass extinctions on Earth prior to this one.\n\nEarly Humans\n\nThe first early humans (hominids), from the family Hominidae, appeared on Earth about 4 million years ago. The hominids were characterised by upright posture, and their forelimbs were not used for locomotion and so were usually shorter and not as strong as the hind limbs. In addition, the teeth were small and were about the same size, in contrast to the larger teeth of apes and monkeys.\n\nAnswers :\n\nTable 1: Major Divisions of Geologic Time\n\nTime range (millions of years)\n\nLength of period (millions of years)\n\nLength in cm (1 cm = 10 million years) *round to the nearest cm\n\nPrecambrian Eon\n\n4,500 \u2013 543\n\n3,957\n\n396\n\nPalaeozoic Era (\"ancient life\")\n\n543 - 248\n\n295\n\n30\n\nMesozoic Era (\"middle life\")\n\n248 - 65\n\n183\n\n18\n\nCenozoic Era (\"recent life\")\n\n65 \u2013 0 (present day)\n\n65\n\n7\n\nTable 2: Some major events in Earth's history\n\nKnot\n\nEvent\n\nMillions of years ago\n\nDistance from previous knot (cm)\n\n1\n\nFormation of the Earth (Datum)\n\n4,500\n\n0\n\n2\n\nSimple Cellular Life appears\n\n3,500\n\n100\n\n3\n\nCambrian Explosion (abundant fossils)\n\n543\n\n296\n\n4\n\nBurgess Shale fossils\n\n505\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFirst Plants on Land (Cooksonia)\n\n410\n\n9.5\n\n6\n\nInsects appear\n\n320\n\n9\n\n7\n\nAge of the Dinosaurs\n\n175\n\n14.5\n\n8\n\nFlowering plants appear\n\n140\n\n3.5\n\n9\n\nCretaceous Extinction\n\n65\n\n7.5\n\n10\n\nEarly humans appear\n\n4\n\n6\n\nAnswers to Discussion Questions:\n\nFor most of Earth's history (the Precambrian), only the simplest lifeforms existed. Life became complex and much more diverse after the Cambrian Explosion.\n\nAbout 88% of Earth's history is represented by Precambrian time ((4500-543)/4500 x 100%). Complex life has existed on Earth for only about 12% of the total time.\n\nOxygen gradually built-up from the process of photosynthesis by cyanobacteria.\n\nThe Cambrian Explosion. The Cambrian Explosion represents the sudden appearance of a great diversity of complex life in the fossil record.\n\nAmerican Charles Walcott first discovered the Burgess Shale fossils in Yoho National Park in 1909. This site, known today as Walcott's Quarry, remains the richest site, although there are other Burgess Shale sites found elsewhere in the world. The Burgess Shale animals lived shortly after the Cambrian Explosion, so are some of the oldest ancestors of modern animals. They are extremely well preserved, with even soft tissues and internal organs visible.\n\nThe Rocky Mountains began to form, about 175 million years ago.\n\nCretaceous mass extinction, when the last of the dinosaurs perished.\n\nNot very significant at all, less than 0.1% in terms of geologic time!"}

Kids choreograph a dance phrase and then measure the distance and speed of the phrase using a timer and a meter stick. They collect the data on a table which they use to determine an average. A series of observation and critical-thinking questions makes this an amazing integrated activity incorporating the arts.\n\nCircular motion can make you loopy! On this physics worksheet, learners practice solving problems regarding centripetal force, rotational period, speed, acceleration, and more. A flying aerobat and a couple of amusement park rides make the problems interesting, if not fun, to solve! This will be a challenging choice for homework.\n\nIn this science worksheet, students create a race track and mark each distance as stated. Then they perform each task and record the time it takes them for each. Students also record their data from the experiment into the chart illustrated and use the information to calculate the speed for each task and distance.\n\nClearly intended for the first unit your physics class at the beginning of the school year, this six page document serves as a review. It covers foundational concepts such as the scientific method, precision and accuracy, significant figures, and scientific theory. It asks fledgling physicists to define vectors, speed, velocity, acceleration, and a host of other introductory physics vocabulary terms. Problems to solve are interspersed throughout, making this a well-rounded unit review. Assign it to help your class prepare for their first exam.\n\nYour class will love this outdoor lesson plan! Learners participate in activities to calculate speed and motion using bicycles and skateboards. They determine the average speed among class members for the distance traveled and share their results.\n\nUsing tuning forks and graduated cylinders, your physical science class can determine the speed of sound. The procedure explained in this resource allows lab groups to explore the speed of sound by identifying resonance within varying lengths of tubes. It is sequentially sound and clearly explained. It would be a stimulating inquiry activity for your junior physical scientists.\n\nDuring this experiment, physics class members study how resonance helps determine the speed of sound. A materials list is missing, but the background, procedure, and analysis questions are useful. Materials include tuning forks, resonance tubes, graduated cylinders, thermometers, and water. Note that the data table is cut off on the right side of the page, so you should replace it before assigning this lab activity.\n\nTeaching young mathematicians to use consistent units in their expressions as well as numbers, Sal demonstrates several ways to translate speed units in pre-algebra. He encourages viewers to memorize common speed units, such as the amount of feet in a mile, in order to facilitate problem-solving."}

The measurement of slope is a\ncommon practice with engineers, surveyors, foresters, housing contractors, architects, and\nnumerous other professionals. It is also found in laws and established standards for road\nconstruction, building access ramps, mining, and many environmental factors.\n\nIn this exercise students will construct a simple slope measuring device (clinometer) and measure\na series of slopes within their own school's area. Professionals may measure slope in a number of\ndifferent units. Two units are used in this activity and will be compared later in the exercise.\n\nMATERIALS\n\nEach group of three students will need the following - a soda straw, a piece of stiff cardboard,\nsome string, paper and white glue, masking tape, a small weight (quarter-ounce lead barrel\nsinkers work well), copies of clinometers (see attached sheet), and scissors. Each student will\nalso need pens and their notebook.\n\nPROCEDURES\n\nHave students glue model A or B from Figure 2 to the piece of cardboard and cut out around the\noutside margin. Using the tape, attach approximately 12 inches of string to point X on the\nclinometer you have selected to work with. Attach the small weight to the end of the string; the\nstring must swing freely from point X. Using two or three pieces of tape, attach a soda straw\nalong the straight edge of the scale. This will be your sight. See Figure 1 for steps 2, 3, and 4.\n\nHave students select three slopes around the school grounds. One of the group will act as a\ntarget; this person stands at the top of the slope. Another student sights through the clinometer at\nthe nose of the target student (see Figure 1). The third partner reads and records the position of\nthe string as it crosses the scale. Students should swap jobs so all have a turn using the\nclinometer. See data table on student pages.\n\nSPECIAL SAFETY PRECAUTIONS\n\nNone.\n\nFOLLOW-UP\n\nHave the students describe some of the variables that will affect the accuracy of their\nmeasurements (e.g., a four-foot student viewer using a six-foot student target).\n\nDetermine and discuss how slope is applied to:\n\nThe crown of a road\n\nSwitchbacks on steep mountain roads\n\nA flight of stairs\n\nMudslides in California\n\nRain runoff on your lawn\n\nThe entry ramp at the grocery store\n\nErosion in a plowed farm field\n\nBuilding a railroad\n\nHave students locate a copy of your town or city building codes for house lots or roads and\ndetermine if there is any reference to slope in the standards. If there are references, have students\ndiscuss why they are there.\n\nSlope may be measured in degrees, but engineers use percent slope for their unit of measurement.\nIf students used different units to measure slopes, have them compare these measurements and\ntry to mathematically relate % slope to slope in degrees.\n\nSOURCE\n\nActivity developed by James H. Barden, in conjunction with the 1991 CREST intern program.\n\nStudent Sheet\n\nActivity #40: The Scoop on Slope (y=mx+b)\n\nPURPOSE\n\nTo construct a device to measure slope and use this device to find out the slope of structures in\nyour immediate school environment.\n\nMATERIALS\n\nFor this activity you will work in groups of three. Each group will need the following: a soda\nstraw, a piece of stiff cardboard, a piece of string about 1 foot long, paper, white glue, masking\ntape, a small weight, a paper copy of the clinometers (Figure 2), a diagram of the finished\nproduct (Figure 3), and scissors. Each student will need their pens and notebook.\n\nPROCEDURE\n\nA device which measures a slope is called a clinometer. The following steps apply to the\nconstruction of the clinometers you will use in this exercise.\n\n1. Glue EITHER model A or B from Figure 2 onto a piece of stiff cardboard and cut out around\nthe outside margin.\n\n2. Using tape, attach approximately 12 inches of string to point X on the clinometer model you\nhave chosen to work with.\n\n3. Attach the small weight to the end of the string; the weight and string must swing freely from\npoint X.\n\n4. Using two or three pieces of tape, attach the soda straw carefully along the straight edge of\nyour scale. This will be your sight. See Figure 3 for steps 2, 3, and 4.\n\nThe next steps apply to using your clinometer to take slope readings.\n\n5. With your partners, select three sloped areas around the school ground to measure.\n\n6. With one of the partners as a target at the top of the slope, a second partner sights through the\nstraw at the NOSE of the target partner (see Figure 1). The sighting partner needs to hold the\nclinometer very steady.\n\n7. The third partner reads and records the position of the string as it crosses the scale.\n\n8. Partners switch positions and allow all members of the group to measure the same object.\n\n9. Complete the attached data table; fill in the name/location of each slope.\n\nDATA TABLE\n\nOBSERVER\n\nSLOPE #1\n\nSLOPE #2\n\nSLOPE #3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nAverage Slope\n\nAnswer any of the following or perform any of these activities as directed by your teacher.\n\nQUESTIONS\n\n1. List and explain some of the factors that will affect the accuracy of your clinometer. Be\nspecific."}

Highly interactive games will bring adventures to life as children are whisked off to migrate with purple martins, play hide and seek with camouflaging animals, create their own flower, and even transform the weather with a little help from Thing 1 and Thing 2. Each interactive game is supported with the activities, videos, and other resources on this PBS Teachers site.\n\nMigration Adventure: Autumn is here, so it's time to fly south for the winter. In this game, the player steers the Cat in the Hat's Thingamajigger to follow a flock of birds on their journey toward warmer weather and more plentiful food. But players will learn that, just like birds, they can't make the whole trip in one stretch. They'll have to keep a sharp eye out for appropriate landing spots along the way, where they can rest, eat, and drink before they run out of energy.\n\nNow You See Me, Now You Don't: Can you find the animals hiding in these scenes? In this game, kids learn how various animals use camouflage as they play hide-and-seek with geckos, fish, and butterflies.\n\nWeather Transformer: In this activity, kids can create their own backyard scene with the Cat in the Hat, Thing One, and Thing Two. But the fun really begins when kids change the weather and turn a sunny summer day into a wintry blizzard, or a windy day into a sudden cloudburst! As they play, kids learn about cause and effect, states of water, and the impact of weather.\n\nCopyright 1957, 1985 Dr. Seuss Enterprises, L.P.

{"text": "Search form\n\nMain menu\n\nYou are here\n\nDo you see what I see?\n\nLight, sight, and natural selection\n\nWith the driving question \"Do you see what I see?\" this unit encourages students to think about how our perception of color depends on both the environment and our brain. Focusing on science research conducted in Dr. Becky Fuller's lab, the unit addresses key science standards connected to animal behavior, natural selection, and systems biology. The curriculum is accompanied by web-based resources including virtual activities such as a virtual eye dissection and an \"Ask a Scientist\" interview with Becky Fuller.\n\nLesson 1: What do you see?\n\nThis introductory lesson serves to motivate the unit, \"Do you see what I see?\" by targeting individual differences in visual perception. Here, students begin to examine the driving question by probing the basics of visual perception. The lesson activities are used to foster interest in learning more about what and why students see what they do. Activities include a color sorting activity, discussions of optical illusions, eye dissections and a traditional colorblind test. These activities introduce information about how humans perceive contrast and color as well as the anatomy of the visual system. Students return to these ideas throughout the unit as they develop a response to the unit driving question.\n\nLesson 2: What color do you see?\n\nIn Lesson 2, students test how environmental conditions influence color perception with the simple task of sorting colored candies such as M&Ms. During this activity, students test how lighting and background color can change the speed and accuracy of M&M sorting. Students attempt to remove all the M&Ms of a certain color under varying conditions. This activity is an opportunity for teachers to address key concepts of how the eye works, how we perceive color, and how we differ in these perceptions. This lesson builds on ideas introduced in Lesson 1.\n\nLesson 3: Is seeing believing?\n\nBy using spectrophotometers and prisms to investigate the absorption, transmission, emission and reflection of light, students explore differences between their visual perceptions and the physical properties that contribute to these differences. This lesson builds on ideas introduced in Lesson 2 and allows students to build on physiological basis of vision introduced in Lesson 1 and extend understanding to the basic optical principles that underlie vision.\n\nLesson 4: Data Collection, Analysis and Experimental Design\n\nStudents have learned how their own experiences (Lesson One) and environment (Lesson Two and Three) influence their perception of color, and in this lesson, they will discuss whether the same principles apply to fish color preference. Students have already begun to think about color perception as a complicated neurological process. Part 1 of Lesson 4 begins to provide evidence for students to use to explain why this is the case.\n\nLesson 4 Part 1: Do fish have a favorite color?\n\nLesson 4 uses a \"penny-pecking\" experiment as an engaging central activity to examine why guppies might be used as a model for color preference. In Part 1 of Lesson 4, students examine color preferences of guppies in an experiment and discussion data to build on knowledge about human color perception gained from prior lessons. This initial experiment prepares students for discussions about the interactions between color and the environment in Part II of the lesson. Discussions of data collection and interpretation are fundamental to this lesson. Students come to a consensus about experimental design before working in groups to run the experiment. Students work to interpret compiled class data during a whole class discussion focused on making meaning from all of the experiments.\n\nLesson 4 Part 2: What color do fish see?\n\nUsing the penny-pecking protocols established in Part I of Lesson 4, students examine in Part II how the environment impacts color prefererencesif fish not unlike the influence of environment in Lesson 2. Using findings from Part I of this lesson, students devise an experiment to test how the environment can change pecking behaviors in guppies. In addition to building connections between humans and other organisms, the activity encourages students to draw on what they learned about optics and sensory physiology in Lesson 3. Moreover, students investigate how variations in optical properties of the external environment can lead to variations in an animal's visual perceptions and, consequently, its mating and food preferences. In addition, the concept of variability within biological populations is addressed. Part II of this lesson emphasizes the development, testing, evaluation and revision of a hypothesis based on prior knowledge and intuition developed from related experiments.\n\nLesson 5: Why do guppies have favorite colors? Why do they care?\n\nNatural and sexual selection of color preferences are the focus of Lesson 5. Students play a game that uses principles of selection to explain why guppies are attracted to certain colors. Students analyze different sensory and coloration biases that help fish to survive such as being able to find different colors of food or being camouflaged to avoid lurking predators. Students also explore how these biases can influence sexual competition; for example, brightly colored fish or those that have body coloration similar to preferred foods might be more attractive to mates. By playing the \"guppy game\", students observe adaptation to different environments and the evolution of sex differences and make hypotheses about the habitats that will favor certain traits. By simulating different populations of guppies under different circumstances students can observe genetic drift in populations over time. One key element of Lesson 5 is the generation of whole classroom data sets that will be analyzed as a class and individually, exposing students to various approaches for data interpretation and expression.\n\nLesson 6: Why can't I see what you see?\n\nIn this culminating lesson, students use the knowledge they learned in the previous lessons to make inferences about the significance of color perception in many species. Students discuss the biological advantage of color vision for humans during the synthesizing Do you see what I see? activity and make connections to other organisms and different visual systems in Find Your Niche! activity. Students learn about the evolution of color vision and how \"evolution is devolution\" to understand that animals evolve to have the most efficient visual system but not necessarily the most complex visual system to see what they need to see."}
{"text": "Ohio's Academic Content Standards in Science\n\nBy the end of grade 12\n\nStudents demonstrate an understanding about how Earth systems and processes interact in the geosphere resulting in the habitability of Earth. This includes demonstrating an understanding of the composition of the Universe, the Solar System and Earth. In addition, it includes understanding the properties and the interconnected nature of Earth's systems, processes that shape Earth and Earth's history. Students also demonstrate an understanding of how the concepts and principles of energy, matter, motion and forces explain Earth systems, the Solar System, and the Universe. Finally, they grasp an understanding of the historical perspectives, scientific approaches and emerging scientific issues associated with Earth and space sciences.\n\nIndicators for grade 12\n\n1.\n\nExplain how scientists obtain information about the universe by using technology to detect electromagnetic radiation that is emitted, reflected or absorbed by stars and other objects. (ORC Resources)\n\n2.\n\nExplain how the large-scale motion of objects in the universe is governed by gravitational forces and detected by observing electromagnetic radiation. (ORC Resources)\n\n3.\n\nExplain how information about the universe is inferred by understanding that stars and other objects in space emit, reflect or absorb electromagnetic radiation, which we then detect. (ORC Resources)\n\n4.\n\nExplain how astronomers infer that the whole universe is expanding by understanding how light seen from distant galaxies has longer apparent wavelengths than comparable light sources close to Earth. (ORC Resources)\n\nDescribe how scientists estimate how much of a given resource is available on Earth. (ORC Resources)\n\nLife Sciences\n\nStudents demonstrate an understanding of how living systems function and how they interact with the physical environment. This includes an understanding of the cycling of matter and flow of energy in living systems. An understanding of the characteristics, structure, and function of cells, of organisms and of living systems are developed as well as a deeper understanding of the principles of heredity, biological evolution, and the diversity and interdependence of life. Students also demonstrate an understanding of different historical perspectives, scientific approaches and emerging scientific issues associated with the life sciences.\n\nIndicators for grade 12\n\n1.\n\nRecognize that information stored in DNA provides the instructions for assembling protein molecules used by the cells that determine the characteristics of the organism. (ORC Resources)\n\nExplain that the Sun is essentially the primary source of energy for life. Plants capture energy by absorbing light and using it to form strong (covalent) chemical bonds between the atoms of carbon-containing (organic) molecules. (ORC Resources)\n\n4.\n\nExplain that carbon-containing molecules can be used to assemble larger molecules with biological activity (including proteins, DNA, sugars and fats). In addition, the energy stored in bonds between the atoms (chemical energy) can be used as sources of energy for life processes. (ORC Resources)\n\n5.\n\nExamine the inheritance of traits through one or more genes and how a single gene can influence more than one trait. (ORC Resources)\n\n6.\n\nExplain how developmental differentiation is regulated through the expression of different genes. (ORC Resources)\n\n7.\n\nRelate diversity and adaptation to structures and functions of living organisms at various levels of organization. (ORC Resources)\n\n8.\n\nBased on the structure and stability of ecosystems and their nonliving components, predict the biotic and abiotic changes in such systems when disturbed (e.g. introduction of non-native species, climatic change, etc.). (ORC Resources)\n\n9.\n\nExplain why and how living systems require a continuous input of energy to maintain their chemical and physical organization. Explain that with death and the cessation of energy input, living systems rapidly disintegrate toward more disorganized states. (ORC Resources)\n\nTrace the historical development of a biological theory or idea (e.g., genetics, cytology and germ theory). (ORC Resources)\n\n12.\n\nDescribe advances in life sciences that have important, long-lasting effects on science and society (e.g., biotechnology). (ORC Resources)\n\nPhysical Sciences\n\nStudents demonstrate an understanding of the composition of physical systems and the concepts and principles that describe and predict physical interactions and events in the natural world. This includes demonstrating an understanding of the structure and properties of matter, the properties of materials and objects, chemical reactions and the conservation of matter. In addition, it includes understanding the nature, transfer and conservation of energy, as well as motion and the forces affecting motion, the nature of waves and interactions of matter and energy. Students also demonstrate an understanding of the historical perspectives, scientific approaches and emerging scientific issues associated with the physical sciences.\n\nIndicators for grade 12\n\n1.\n\nExplain how atoms join with one another in various combinations in distinct molecules or in repeating crystal patterns. (ORC Resources)\n\n2.\n\nDescribe how a physical, chemical or ecological system in equilibrium may return to the same state of equilibrium if the disturbances it experiences are small. Large disturbances may cause it to escape that equilibrium and eventually settle into some other state of equilibrium. (ORC Resources)\n\n3.\n\nExplain how all matter tends toward more disorganized states and describe real world examples (e.g., erosion of rocks, expansion of the universe). (ORC Resources)\n\n4.\n\nRecognize that at low temperatures some materials become superconducting and offer little or no resistance to the flow of electrons. (ORC Resources)\n\n5.\n\nUse and apply the laws of motion to analyze, describe and predict the effects of forces on the motions of objects mathematically. (ORC Resources)\n\n6.\n\nRecognize that the nuclear forces that hold the nucleus of an atom together, at nuclear distances, are stronger than the electric forces that would make it fly apart. (ORC Resources)\n\n7.\n\nRecognize that nuclear forces are much stronger than electromagnetic forces, and electromagnetic forces are vastly stronger than gravitational forces. The strength of the nuclear forces explains why greater amounts of energy are released from nuclear reactions (e.g., from atomic and hydrogen bombs and in the Sun and other stars). (ORC Resources)\n\n8.\n\nDescribe how the observed wavelength of a wave depends upon the relative motion of the source and the observer (Doppler effect). If either is moving towards the other, the observed wavelength is shorter; if either is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (e.g., weather radar, bat echoes, police radar). (ORC Resources)\n\n9.\n\nDescribe how gravitational forces act between all masses and always create a force of attraction. Recognize that the strength of the force is proportional to the masses and weakens rapidly with increasing distance between them. (ORC Resources)\n\n10.\n\nExplain the characteristics of isotopes. The nucleus of radioactive isotopes is unstable and spontaneously decays emitting particles and/or wavelike radiation. It cannot be predicted exactly when, if ever, an unstable nucleus will decay, but a large group of identical nuclei decay at a predictable rate. (ORC Resources)\n\n11.\n\nUse the predictability of decay rates and the concept of half-life to explain how radioactive substances can be used in estimating the age of materials. (ORC Resources)\n\n12.\n\nDescribe how different atomic energy levels are associated with the electron configurations of atoms and electron configurations (and/or conformations) of molecules. (ORC Resources)\n\n13.\n\nExplain how atoms and molecules can gain or lose energy in particular discrete amounts (quanta or packets); therefore they can only absorb or emit light at the wavelengths corresponding to these amounts. (ORC Resources)\n\n14.\n\nUse historical examples to explain how new ideas are limited by the context in which they are conceived; are often initially rejected by the scientific establishment; sometimes spring from unexpected findings; and usually grow slowly through contributions from many different investigators (e.g., nuclear energy, quantum theory, theory of relativity). (ORC Resources)\n\n15.\n\nDescribe concepts/ideas in physical sciences that have important, long-lasting effects on science and society (e.g., quantum theory, theory of relativity, age of the universe). (ORC Resources)\n\nScience and Technology\n\nStudents should recognize that science and technology are interconnected and that using technology involves assessment of the benefits, risks, and costs. Students should build scientific and technological knowledge, as well as the skill required to design and construct devices. In addition, they should develop the processes to solve problems and to understand that problems may be solved in several ways.\n\nIndicators for grade 12\n\n1.\n\nExplain how science often advances with the introduction of new technologies and how solving technological problems often results in new scientific knowledge. (ORC Resources)\n\n2.\n\nDescribe how new technologies often extend the current levels of scientific understanding and introduce new areas of research. (ORC Resources)\n\n3.\n\nResearch how scientific inquiry is driven by the desire to understand the natural world and how technological design is driven by the need to meet human needs and solve human problems. (ORC Resources)\n\n4.\n\nExplain why basic concepts and principles of science and technology should be a part of active debate about the economics, policies, politics and ethics of various science-related and technology-related challenges. (ORC Resources)\n\nScientific Inquiry\n\nStudentsDerive simple mathematical relationships that have predictive power from experimental data (e.g., derive an equation from a graph and vice versa, determine whether a linear or exponential relationship exists among the data in a table). (ORC Resources)\n\nStudents realize that the current body of scientific knowledge must be based on evidence, be predictive, logical, subject to modification, and limited to the natural world. This includes demonstrating an understanding that scientific knowledge grows and advances as new evidence is discovered to support or modify existing theories, as well as to encourage the development of new theories. Students are able to reflect on ethical scientific practices and demonstrate an understanding of how the current body of scientific knowledge reflects the historical and cultural contributions of women and men who provide us with a more reliable and comprehensive understanding of the natural world.\n\nIndicators for grade 12\n\n1.\n\nGive examples that show how science is a social endeavor in which scientists share their knowledge with the expectation that it will be challenged continuously by the scientific community and others. (ORC Resources)\n\n2.\n\nEvaluate scientific investigations by reviewing current scientific knowledge and the experimental procedures used, examining the evidence, identifying faulty reasoning, pointing out statements that go beyond the evidence and suggesting alternative explanations for the same observations. (ORC Resources)\n\n3.\n\nSelect a scientific model, concept or theory and explain how it has been revised over time based on new knowledge, perceptions or technology. (ORC Resources)\n\n4.\n\nAnalyze a set of data to derive a principle and then apply that principle to a similar phenomenon (e.g., predator-prey relationships, properties of semiconductors). (ORC Resources)\n\n5.\n\nDescribe how individuals and teams contribute to science and engineering at different levels of complexity (e.g., an individual may conduct basic field studies, hundreds of people may work together on major scientific questions or technical problem). (ORC Resources)\n\n6.\n\nExplain that scientists may develop and apply ethical tests to evaluate the consequences of their research when appropriate. (ORC Resources)\n\n7.\n\nDescribe the current and historical contributions of diverse peoples and cultures to science and technology and the scarcity and inaccessibility of information on some of these contributions. (ORC Resources)\n\n8.\n\nRecognize that individuals and society must decide on proposals involving new research and the introduction of new technologies into society. Decisions involve assessment of alternatives, risks, costs and benefits and consideration of who benefits and who suffers, who pays and gains, and what the risks are and who bears them. (ORC Resources)\n\n9.\n\nRecognize the appropriateness and value of basic questions \"What can happen?\" \"What are the odds?\" and \"How do scientists and engineers know what will happen?\" (ORC Resources)\n\n10.\n\nRecognize that social issues and challenges can affect progress in science and technology. (e.g., Funding priorities for specific health problems serve as examples of ways that social issues influence science and technology.) (ORC Resources)\n\n11.\n\nResearch how advances in scientific knowledge have impacted society on a local, national or global level. (ORC Resources)"}

{"text": "Standards Central Fordham's Reviews from the U.S. and Abroad\n\nGeorgia\n\nOverview\n\nThe extraordinary unevenness of the Georgia standards reflects the disorganization of the parts. Some areas are strong and some adequate, while others lag badly. Although the end product is mediocre, better editing and a bit more attention to detail could significantly improve the standards.\n\nOrganization of the Standards\n\nGeorgia presents its science learning expectations by grade for K-8 and by course for high school. Content standards and \"characteristics\" (or inquiry) standards are presented for each grade and course. Grades K-5 each cover earth, life, and physical sciences. Sixth grade focuses exclusively on earth science, seventh grade on life science, and eighth grade on physical science.\n\nAt the high school level, the Georgia standards offer a bewilderingly large number of courses. In addition to the traditional biology, chemistry, and physics courses, there are astronomy, botany, earth systems, ecology, entomology, environmental science, epidemiology, forensic science, geology, human anatomy and physiology, meteorology, microbiology, oceanography, physical science, and zoology. As these courses fall outside the conventional, much broader core science curriculum\u2014and as we have no idea when and how these myriad specialized courses are worked into students' learning plans\u2014we have focused this review solely on the four core subjects.\n\nThe Peach State also presents a series of framework documents, one for each grade, K-8, and for physics, chemistry, biology, and physical science in high school. Within each of these documents is a strange mixture of classroom activities, lesson plans, common misconceptions, and key questions. The presentation within these documents is so sketchy, and the organization so chaotic, that a full evaluation is impossible, if not inappropriate. We therefore limit our discussion to the standards documents.\n\nContent & Rigor\n\nGeorgia has produced a frustratingly spotty set of standards that range from excellent (life science) to pretty bad (physics and chemistry). When good, the material is well written, concrete, and thorough, with ambitious but not unreasonable expectations for what students ought to know, in both the lower and upper grades. Unfortunately, such moments are not the norm. In too many instances, the material is sloppily presented, unfocused, or poorly supported.\n\nScientific Inquiry and Methodology\n\nThe Georgia standards contain good, clear statements on process. For example, in fifth grade: \"Similar scientific investigations seldom produce exactly the same results, which may differ due to unexpected differences in what is being investigated, unrecognized differences in the methods or circumstances of the investigation, or observational uncertainties.\" Well put.\n\nPhysical Science\n\nThe physical science standards are decidedly mixed. Some content is covered with depth and rigor. For example, the first-grade handling of light, sound, and magnetism is quite good. The standards take note of the fact that magnetic force is not blocked by paper, for example. Second grade introduces energy, but never deals with the question (tricky at this level) of what energy is. In third grade, heat is introduced nicely, and magnetism (introduced two grades earlier) is expanded. The introduction in fourth grade of optics\u2014including mirrors, lenses, and prisms\u2014is excellent.\n\nTwo specific examples will suffice to show how very good the standards can be. In eighth grade:\n\nStudents will have the computation and estimation skills necessary for analyzing data and following scientific explanations.\n\nAnalyze scientific data by using, interpreting, and comparing numbers in several equivalent forms, such as integers, fractions, decimals, and percents.\n\nFind the mean, median, and mode and use them to analyze a set of scientific data.\n\nApply the metric system to scientific investigations that include metric to metric conversions (i.e., centimeters to meters).\n\nDecide what degree of precision is adequate, and round off appropriately.\n\nAddress the relationship between accuracy and precision.\n\nUse ratios and proportions, including constant rates, in appropriate problems. (grade 8)\n\nAnd at the high school level:\n\nStudents will explore the nature of matter, its classifications, and its system for naming types of matter.\n\nCalculate density when given a means to determine a substance's mass and volume.\n\nPredict formulas for stable binary ionic compounds based on balance of charges.\n\nUse IUPAC nomenclature for transition between chemical names and chemical formulas of\n\nApply the Law of Conservation of Matter by balancing the following types of chemical equations:\n\nSynthesis\n\nDecomposition\n\nSingle Replacement\n\nDouble Replacement. (high school physical science)\n\nSadly, as often as they are this good, the standards fail to outline sufficiently the content that students need to learn. For instance, gravitation is introduced in Kindergarten, but in a way that is likely to confuse more than clarify. Specifically, students are asked to \"observe and communicate effects of gravity on objects,\" and to:\n\nRecognize that some things, such as airplanes and birds, are in the sky, but return to earth.\n\nRecognize that the sun, moon, and stars are in the sky, but don't come down.\n\nExplain why a book does not fall down if it is placed on a table, but will fall down if it is dropped. (Kindergarten)\n\nIs the Kindergartner to conclude that gravity affects books always, airplanes sometimes, but stars never? In the child's first encounter with a phenomenon, it is best to present the simple and obvious first, and then move on to the complications.\n\nThen in fifth grade, students are presented with this statement: \"In simple terms, a chemical change cannot be reversed and a physical change can.\" Clearly, however, neither part of this statement is true. The melting of butter is an irreversible physical change, while the chemical reaction 2Hg + O2 \u2194 2HgO is readily reversible.\n\nAnd here is the sum total of the eighth-grade coverage of mechanics:\n\nStudents will investigate relationship between force, mass, and the motion of objects.\n\nDetermine the relationship between velocity and acceleration.\n\nDemonstrate the effect of balanced and unbalanced forces on an object in terms of gravity, inertia, and friction.\n\nHigh School Physics\n\nThe high school physics course is divided into five major concepts/skills: kinematics, energy and its transformations, electricity, magnetism, and wave properties. To the physicist's eye, this is a very strange\u2014and illogical\u2014division. Kinematics without dynamics is pointless; electricity and magnetism belong together (as indeed they are in Georgia's standards for the lower grades); and heat and thermodynamics are missing, as are optics and pretty much all of modern physics.\n\nGetting down to detail, Newtonian dynamics is telescoped into a few words; nuclear fission and fusion are introduced without preparation, under an \"energy\" standard that precedes the standard containing the basics of the work-energy theorem, energy conservation, and the mere mention of potential energy. The rest is mere chaos, ending with a section devoted to relativity.\n\nHigh School Chemistry\n\nOnly about a page and a half of the standards are dedicated to actual chemistry content; predictably, much essential content is missing. For instance, there is nothing on the important topic of gases. Nor is there anything about Lewis dot structures or how they can help predict the shape and polarity of molecules. The topic of chemical bonding is reduced to \"compare and contrast types of chemical bonds (i.e., ionic, covalent).\" Hydrogen bonding and metallic bonding are completely missing. Also missing is any mention of oxidation/reduction. The important topic of chemical equilibrium (and Le Ch\u00e2telier's principle) is reduced to a meaningless standard asking students to \"explain the role of Equilibrium in chemical reactions.\" There is no mention of carbon (organic) chemistry, and the periodic table section is inadequate. If basic topics like groups (chemical families), periods, metallic, nonmetallic, and metalloid regions, and so forth, are not taught in primary and middle school grades, then they need to be addressed in high school chemistry. (High school physical science contains some topics, like specific heat and conductivity of solutions, that should have been included in chemistry.)\n\nEarth and Space Science\n\nThe earth and space standards taken alone (that is, ignoring the framework documents) are well written, reasonably ambitious, and complete. The standards for Kindergarten through eighth grade have some weaknesses in rocks and minerals and details of plate tectonics. The high school material is contained in a large collection of high school courses. Though none of the courses related to earth and space material addressed all our suggested content, each was well written and could lead to an interesting and serious semester course. It is not clear, however, which or how many students would take those courses.\n\nGeorgia offers some particularly nicely written entries, for instance:\n\nStudents will model the position and motion of the earth in the solar system and will explain the role of relative position and motion in determining sequence of the phases of the moon. (grade 4)\n\nDemonstrate the relative size and order from the sun of the planets in the solar system. (grade 4)\n\nCompare and contrast the Earth's crust, mantle, and core including temperature, density, and composition. (grade 6)\n\nRelate the Nature of Science to the progression of basic historical scientific models (geocentric, heliocentric) as they describe our solar system, and the Big Bang as it describes the formation of the universe. (grade 6)\n\nEach of these examples displays good knowledge of the subject and how students might demonstrate deep understanding. The entry on the layers of the solid earth calls out the specific properties of each layer that sixth graders should be able to understand. Modeling the geometry of moon phases is a great way to demonstrate an understanding of motions in the solar system. Relating the progression of historical ideas about important models is a sophisticated way to address the science behind current understandings.\n\nLife Science\n\nUnlike the other disciplines, the presentation of life science material is quite good, typified by the systematic treatment of evolution in middle school. It begins with a fine general statement in the benchmarks covering sixth through eighth grades:\n\nDuring middle school, several lines of evidence are further developed. The fossil evidence can be expanded beyond extinctions and survivals to the notion of biological history. Sedimentation of rock can be brought in to show relative age. However, actual age, which requires an understanding of isotopic dating techniques, should wait until high school, when students learn about the structure of atoms. Breeding experiments can illustrate the heritability of traits and the effects of selection. (grades 6-8)\n\nFurther, Georgia's standards are one of the few to discuss Darwin prior to the high school level:\n\nExplain that physical characteristics of organisms have changed over successive generations (e.g., Darwin's finches and peppered moths of Manchester).\n\nDescribe ways in which species on earth have evolved due to natural selection.\n\nTrace evidence that the fossil record found in sedimentary rock provides evidence for the long history of changing life forms. (grade 7)\n\nHigh school biology coverage is sound and generally complete, tackling organelles, mitosis and meiosis, Mendel's Law, and photosynthesis well (to name a few subjects). The standards' focus on the cell and molecular-level content offers thoughtful overviews and good specific examples. Unfortunately, the strong seventh-grade coverage of evolution is not carried along to high school, where coverage of evolution is missing such key concepts as DNA or the sequences of amino acids\u2014though it does include coverage of molecular and anatomical evidence.\n\nClarity & Specificity\n\nAs is the case with the content and rigor of Georgia's standards, much inconsistency of quality is seen in terms of clarity and specificity. When they are good, the Georgia standards offer information accurately and in simple prose. We have cited several examples of this fine work above. But when they are bad, they produce brief and vapid expressions, as in: \"Explain the role of equilibrium in chemical reactions\" (high school chemistry). More detail is ardently desired, yet none is forthcoming.\n\nIn some places, the standards' brevity leaves the reader confused, as in the following example:\n\nMeasure and calculate the magnitude of frictional forces and Newton's three Laws of Motion. (high school physics)\n\nThis is both an illogical combination and a mighty tall order to compress all of Newton's laws (e.g., all of dynamics) into half of a fourteen-word statement.

Speculate about why two recent Periodic Tables differ. 2. Learn about the retraction of Element 118 from the Periodic Table by reading and discussing \"Sometimes, the March of Science Goes Backward.\" 3. Research certain elements and their potential bonds with other elements in a \"dating game\" of the elements. 4. Synthesize their understanding of chemical bonding by drawing compounds of combined elements or by describing different potential compounds for certain elements.\n\nResources / Materials: -copies of WebElements.com's Periodic Table (one per small group) [to be downloaded and printed from WebElements.com's Web site ( -copies of ChemicalElements.com's Periodic Table (one per small group) [to be downloaded and printed from ChemicalElements.com's Web site (  -pens/pencils -paper -classroom blackboard -copies of \"Sometimes, the March of Science Goes Backward\" (one per student) -resources for researching the elements (science and chemistry textbooks; encyclopedias; books on the elements; computers with Internet access)\n\nActivities / Procedures: 1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Prior to class, arrange desks into small groupings, and place copies of each of the two Periodic Tables in each group. Write the following prompt on the board (for small groups to respond to upon entering class): \"What do you have in front of you? Which symbols on these tables do you recognize? How do these two tables of differ? Considering that they are both recent examples, why do you think they differ?\" After each of the small groups has answered the discussion questions, have each group report its answers to the class. Is it possible that the Periodic Table featuring fewer elements is the more recent table? If so, how could this be possible?\n2. As a class, read and discuss \"Sometimes, the March of Science Goes Backward,\" focusing on the following questions: a. According to the article, why was ununoctium's half-life described as \"disappointingly brief\"? b. How was the element ununoctium's existence called into question? c. How did the term \"transfermiums\" originate? d. Why is it difficult to determine whether transfermiums are \"created\" or \"discovered\"? e. How did the addition of No.118 change the appearance of the periodic chart? f. What is the role of Iupac in deciding an element's name? g. Why was Iupac reluctant to name an element after Dr. Seaborg? h. According to the article, what is the \"ultimate message\" behind the Periodic Table's design? i. How did Dr. Seaborg justify his use of the word \"creation\" in relation to the synthesization of an element?\n3. Explain to students that today they will be acting as \"dating game\" matchmakers between the elements. In other words, they will be researching certain elements and their potential bonds with other elements. Divide students into partnerships and assign each twosome an element. (The elements assigned should provide potential opportunities for creating a variety of chemical compounds.) Using all available resources, each partnership should create a written \"dating profile\" for their element that includes the following information (written on the board for easier student access): \u2013a drawing of an atom of your element indicating the nucleus, orbitals, protons, neutrons, electrons \u2013the physical properties of the element (description of what the element looks like, density, melting point, state of matter, metal, non-metal, metalloid, crystalline structure, hardness, etc.) \u2013the chemical properties of the element (description of how the element reacts with other elements, such as whether an element is corrosive, combustible, or flammable)\nOnce the profiles of the elements have been completed, half of the partnerships should fold their profile papers so that no information about their element is exposed; they should then deposit the folded profiles in a bag. Next, the remaining partnerships will each choose a folded profile from the bag in order to determine their element's \"blind date\" for the class. Each pair of students who created a \"dating profile\" that was put in the bag should now join the pair of students who chose theirs out of the bag, thus forming groups of four. Each group of four will then analyze whether the date can produce a successful match (i.e. chemical compound). If a \"match\" is possible, the group will determine the potential bonding combinations for the two elements. If a \"match\" is not possible, the group needs to explain why the two elements could not bond in a compound.\n4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: For those groups that determined that their blind dates ended in successful matches between their elements, each student now draws a compound formed from a combination of the two elements. (For the matches that produced more than one potential bond, each group member could draw a different compound or molecule.)\nFor those groups that determined that their blind dates could not end in successful matches between their elements, each student now writes a \"personal ad\" in search of the perfect chemical bond for the original element he or she researched.\n\nFurther Questions for Discussion: \u2013How are the elements named? \u2013How has the Periodic Table changed over time? \u2013How are compounds and molecules formed between elements? \u2013What is the difference between covalent and ionic bonds? \u2013How were Seaborg and Fermi involved with the Manhattan Project? \u2013How have the discovery of certain elements made medical advances possible?\n\nEvaluation / Assessment: Students will be evaluated based on their thoughtful participation in group and class discussions, participation in their research of a specific element, and their final analyses of potential chemical bonds between elements.\n\nExtension Activities: 1. Create a memory game for your classmates to play that will require them to match the names of the elements with their symbols from the Periodic Table. On one set of index cards, write the full names of the elements. On the second set, write the symbols of the elements that are used in the Periodic Table. Shuffle the cards and place them face down in a random order spread out across a surface. Players will take turns turning over any two cards. If a correct match is not found, the cards are turned face down again and the next player takes a turn. The player with the greatest number of correct matches at the end of the game is declared the winning chemist.\n2. Write the discovery story of the element you researched in class. Who discovered the element? Where and when did the discovery take place? What are the current uses of the element?\n3. Research Dmitry I. Mendeleyev's invention of the Periodic Table. How has the table changed since its 19th century inception? Create an illustrated timeline of the table's changes.\n4. What's in a name? How did the elements of the Periodic Table get named? Learn the stories behind several of the elements' names and then choose a few that you find most interesting. Create a poster that displays these stories in a creative manner.\n5. What is the difference between a covalent and ionic bond? Create a \"How it Works\" poster that explains these two types of chemical bonds between the elements.\n\nInterdisciplinary Connections: American History- Research the roles of Enrico Fermi and Glenn Seaborg in the Manhattan Project for the development of nuclear energy and the atomic bomb.

Who would play Fermi? Seaborg? Write a dialogue between the two scientists' characters, or describe how you would shoot the scene depicting the reaction under Stagg Field.\nFine Arts- Create a \"knockoff\" of the Periodic Table in order to organize items in a field of your personal interest. For example, you could create a Periodic Table of music, cars, or horses. Include symbols for the included items (and a key for the symbols) and color-code the categories within your chart.\nHealth- Research Glenn Seaborg's discovery of radioisotopes. How are radioisotopes currently used to battle cancer cells?

However, whereas most entomology curricula are meant to be used as part of a one or two week insect \"unit,\" our curriculum is designed to enhance instruction on various biological themes that educators are required to teach anyway.

But there are fundamental steps in the scientific\nprocess that almost all scientists use, and those steps are what we highlight\nas \"the methodS of science.\" The integral components\nare: observing, wondering, did we say observing?, hypothesizing or predicting,\nexperimenting, analyzing, concluding, inferring, communicating, observing,\nwondering\u2026Unfortunately there is no explicit step in the method(s) for\n\"having an idea\" or \"creativity\" or \"imagination.\"\nBut basically science in the absence of imagination isn't science, as\ncreativity is a necessary component in every step of the process of \"doing\nscience.\"\n\nAll the activities we\nuse to teach students how to \"do science\" stress the following components\nof the Methods of Science:\n\nObservation of nature\n\nWondering why?\n\nForming hypotheses\n(in an \"If... Then...\" format) and making predictions\n\nBy using the scientific\nmethod repeatedly in a variety of hands-on science activities over the course\nof a school year we hope that students and their teachers will view \"doing\nscience\" as not only an enjoyable activity, but also a useful method\nto use to learn about nature and how things work.\n\n[1] In an underwater \"caged death match\" the shark will win.\n[2] Science for All Children, 1997, National Academy Press.\n[3] The Meaning of It All: Thoughts of a Citizen Scientist. 1998.\nMichelle and Carl Feynman.

{"text": "Natural History\n\nIt's the rare child (or adult) who isn't fascinated by dinosaurs. The ancient creatures capture the popular imagination in a way quite unlike anything else. Through the study of dinosaurs, students learn about what life on Earth was like long ago, and the many changes that have occurred in geography, geology, and climate since then.\n\nWith all of the news coverage of the recent tsunami and its aftermath in Japan, many teachers are looking for ways to explain the phenomenon to their students. Students are seeing videos and pictures of the devastation in Japan, and many of them don't completely understand the science behind this type of weather disaster. This lack of understanding can lead to fear in students (and teachers) of all ages. Joann has been collecting resources for The Gateway to help teach students about tsunamis. The resources she is featuring in her column and social media posts this week look at tsunamis from many different angles. She has found a really nice variety of resources, and I really like the way they integrate the study of tsunamis into subjects ranging from art to science.\n\nThere have been at least six well-documented mass extinctions on Earth over the past 500 million years, a phenomenon that has both puzzled and intrigued scientists for centuries. Various types of organisms on Earth become extinct fairly frequently, but mass extinctions are distinguished by the large numbers of species that become extinct over a relatively short period of time. The Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction, responsible for the demise of the dinosaurs some 65 million years ago, is perhaps the most famous mass extinction. It's forever branded into our brains from being the topic of feature films, artists' paintings, and numerous books."}
