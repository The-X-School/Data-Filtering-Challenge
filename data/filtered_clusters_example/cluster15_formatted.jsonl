{"text": "THE BEST OF YOUTH Directed by Marco Tullio Giordana\nIn Italian with English subtitles\nMiramax Films\nFilm Forum\n\nCourtesy: Miramax Films.\n\nAlessio Boni (l.) plays Matteo Carati, who serves in the military and then becomes a policeman, shown here with Luigi Lo Cascio as Nicola Carati, his free-spirited brother who becomes a successful psychiatrist.\n\n\"The Best of Youth\" is made in the spirit of its hero, a liberal psychiatrist who fights for the rights of the mentally ill and betrays his partner when she becomes a terrorist.\n\nModeration is generally a virtue in life, but it's rarely reflected in great art. There's nothing terribly wrong with \"The Best of Youth,\" but there's nothing particularly compelling about it either.\n\nPerhaps it's unfair to compare current Italian cinema with its ancestors, but \"The Best of Youth\" undeniably echoes Luchino Visconti's 1960 \"Rocco and His Brothers.\" The contrast isn't flattering. Director Marco Tullio Giordana's prosaic storytelling and flat images are no match for Visconti's combination of neo-realist grit and operatic brio.\n\nBeginning in 1966 and continuing through 2003, the year it was made, \"The Best of Youth\" follows the history of Italy through the lives of one family. Nicola (Luigi Lo Cascio) and Matteo Carati (Alessio Boni) are teenage brothers who share similar interests. Their paths diverge after they meet a mentally ill girl and help her escape from a hospital. Nicola temporarily drops out of school, travels around Norway and then becomes a psychiatrist. Matteo joins the army and enters the police force when discharged.\n\nThe youngest member of the family, Francesca (Valentina Carnelutti), marries Nicola's friend Carlo (Fabrizio Gifuni). Due to his position at the Bank of Italy, Carlo becomes a target for terrorists. Unbeknownst to him, he's very close to one. Nicola's girlfriend Giulia (Sonia Bergamasco) is a member of the Red Brigades, a violent, left-wing organization. As the narrative progresses, it incorporates real events\u2013\u2013a massive flood in Florence, anti-Mafia campaigns in Sicily, Italian soccer victories.\n\nMade as a mini-series for Italian TV, \"The Best of Youth\" became a film when it was rejected for broadcast by the RAI channel but accepted by Cannes in 2003. However, it may not have benefited from a transfer to the big screen.\n\nApparently unintentionally, the 16mm cinematography looks drab and ragged. Watching a six-hour film in the theater\u2014Film Forum is showing it in two parts, with separate admission\u2014places more demands on an audience than watching it on TV. HBO, for example, chose not to distribute Mike Nichols' lengthy \"Angels in America\" adaptation theatrically, unlike some of their other recent productions. For most people, a work this long would have to be a masterpiece to justify such concentration. \"The Best of Youth\" is not one.\n\nIt often feels like a soap opera, although Giordana was obviously aiming for an allegorical panorama akin to Salman Rushdie's novel \"Midnight's Children.\" The film manages to avoid baby-boomer narcissism and reducing the 1960s and 1970s to sex, drugs and rock-n-roll. Despite opening with a song by the Animals, it doesn't overload the sound track with golden oldies or define the era through music. Even the costume design, makeup and hairstyles are relatively subtle.\n\nDespite the length, \"The Best of Youth\" starts off well-paced. It has a few remarkable sequences\u2013\u2013the wedding that closes the first part and a lengthy section set on New Year's Eve, 1982, which cuts back and forth between a party and Matteo alone, caught up in depression.\n\nLo Cascio and Boni both give splendid performances. It's heartrending to see Matteo gradually become colder and angrier. Boni never pushes his actions into outright pathology, but the character loses self-control all the same. Seemingly defeated, he pours his heart into work, screaming at spectators who gaze at a dead body as if they were watching a film. His breakdown is all the more horrible because it doesn't seem to have any clear cause.\n\nNicola is a more likable character, but there's always something childlike about him. He really enjoys working with children and the mentally ill because he loves play. His idealism fades with age, but some traces remain with him until the end.\n\nAfter the New Year's Eve party, \"The Best of Youth\" descends into a digressive, aimless final quarter, which shows the younger members of the Carati clan growing up rapidly. The film peaks early. The original structure, in which it would be shown in four 90-minute sections, might work better than the current one, especially since the original break points are very obvious. The ending, which aims to link the family's grandchildren to Nicola's 1960s adventures, misfires by imposing a cyclical conclusion on a linear story.\n\n\"The Best of Youth\" comes with a long list of literary and cinematic precursors. In addition to \"Rocco and His Brothers,\" it's reminiscent of Edgar Reitz's 25-hour mini-series \"The Second Heimat,\" an exploration of youth in 1960s Germany. Like \"The Best of Youth,\" \"The Second Heimat\" shies away from received wisdom about the period. Unlike it, Reitz's film really does have enough length and depth to rival an epic novel.\n\nIt's surprising that Miramax picked up \"The Best of Youth.\" Their favorite European films tend to be middlebrow Oscar-bait like \"Amelie\" and \"Life Is Beautiful.\" It's less surprising that they owned the rights for 18 months before releasing it.\n\nIf this film represents the best contemporary Italian cinema, the nation has fallen a long way off since the debuts of Pier Paolo Pasolini, Marco Bellocchio and Bernardo Bertolucci in the early 1960s. While European TV has produced many fine films, \"The Best of Youth\" would have been better left for the small screen."}

Why you eat corpses of animals? Why you use pieces of paper entitling you to any value, without which you won't have nothing, not even food? Why you eat unhealthy food? Why you're sitting every evening watching a box showing people telling lies, & dirtying your mind? Why do you let yourself be led by fat selfish people caring only about themselves, their money & power, why don't we really listen to each other, talk to each other, why do we have these hierarchies, in which the most stupid, incapable ones rule, control & exploit the goodness & capable weaker ones? Why we go about doing wrong immoral things just because we're being told, why are we constantly mad, worried & frustrated with such small trivial things, like a scratch on the mirror of our cars, & never see, appreciate & thank the beautiful wonderful life, nature & world that surrounds & supports us? Why we ruin the world, poison ourselves, live in ugliness, support the rich selfish people exploiting us, selling us lies, tobbacco, weapons & arms, killing people with the money that we're forced to pay them as taxes?\n\nIf you haven't wondered on all this, its because you're like an ant, small cell in the super-organism, & can't see beyond your cell's vision. What you need is to be disconnected, shocked by artists such as Coline Serreau, that have a vision that you don't have, consciousness, different from that of the ants.

Here's a brief description (synopsis) of the movie: As part of an intergalactic coalition, a well-meaning space alien volunteers to bring a message of self-actualization and harmony with nature to the one planet rejected by all her peers as incorrigible--Earth.\n\nThis family-oriented French sci-fi comedy chronicles her adventures on the chaotic planet. Mila is 150 years old and has five children; encoded in her brain are two telepathic programs designed to restructure the thinking of destructive humans. The first is a fairly mild program designed to inspire the humans to rethink their world and begin asking some difficult questions. The other is far stronger and rapidly indoctrinates subjects with lofty utopian ideals and makes them deeply aware of themselves.\n\nMila lands in Paris and is unnoticed but for the sudden, inexplicable power surges and outages that occur whenever she sends a telepathic message to her alien cohorts. Instead of eating, Mila draws energy from holding newborn babies.\n\nIt is while holding an orphan infant in an obstetrics ward that her Earthly troubles begin. Feeling deeply for the baby's plight, she confronts the ward's head doctor and when logic fails, looses her programs upon him. Instantly the unsympathetic brute sees the light and begins helping her save the babe from wicked welfare workers."}
{"text": "Cast & Crew\n\nMargaret Atwood's highly regarded novel came to the screen in 1990 in an uneven yet still gripping production (newly released on DVD). Natasha Richardson makes perhaps the biggest impact in her career as Offred, the \"handmaid\" at the center of a dystopic future where ultra-right wing factions are in control of the government, martial law rules, and biological agents have rendered 99% of women sterile. Those women who are still fertile and have been convicted of some crime, however ridiculous, become handmaids, stripped from their lives and sentenced to service the remaining rich and powerful, whose wives can't conceive children.\n\nOffred finds herself at the mercy of a good-natured but subtly manipulative commander (Robert Duvall) and his faded-star wife Serena Joy (Faye Dunaway). And soon enough she slips her way into an underground aiming to overthrow the fascist regime.\n\nAtwood's tale is brilliant, but a little something is missing in its translation to the screen. The major flaw is with the direction by Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff (Palmetto, tons of German films you've never heard of), who isn't exactly the most renowned director on the planet and is considerably out of his element with this extremely challenging material. The movie ends up as a good one, but the nearly-farcical future-shock makes you inevitably compare it to Brazil, and that's a comparison that few films can stand up to. Never mind the directing talent, Schl\u00f6ndorff simply doesn't have the budget to pull off a realistic version of even the near-future. The movie is fairly solid up until Offred's wholesale recruitment into the resistence, whereupon the film starts to slip into oddity.\n\nThe ending comes suddenly, reminding us that two hours have passed and we haven't reached a resolution. And it doesn't entirely satisfy, either. The ending feels way too much like the \"happy ending\" tacked onto Brazil -- and which ultimately became a cinematic joke (see the Criterion release of that film for an in-depth look at this phenomenon). Still, it's a pretty good movie if for no other reason than its sheer guts at calling out the religious right while still maintaining a sense of sophistication. That's rare indeed."}
{"text": "32. If it was a better movie, the sex scene wouldn't matter. Unfortunately,\n\nit's not a very good movie, and the sex scene in the tent is about all it has going for it, besides the staggeringly beautiful mountain settings in which it is filmed. I found the story and the characters immensely boring, for the most part.\n\nBack in the 1930s, Hollywood and the U.S. went through similar Puritan stupidity, with what was called the Hayes Code, and edited out Jane Wyman's nude scene (swimming in a pond) in \"The Lost Horizon.\" But it's such a great movie that it didn't matter. The notion of the movie that Shangri La was a pristine refuge from a greedy, war-weary world was only slightly harmed by the editing out of this beautiful scene. It made the idea a little more intellectual, but it was still the pervasive idea of the film, expressed in a hundred different ways in the story, dialogue, characters and setting. The editing itself was comparable to throwing a blanket over, say, the Venus de Milo, or Michelangelo's David--just a stupid act of Puritan vandalism that could not really affect the overwhelming force of enlightened ideas that those statues, or movies like \"The Lost Horizon,\" represent.\n\nBrokeback Mountain, on the other hand, represents what? The idea that forbidden homosexual sex will get you killed, or ruin your life? That it's an obsession, a sickness, that is inherently destructive of family life? That it's grabby and violent and selfish? That there is nothing beautiful or sensual about it? That its depiction requires staggeringly beautiful mountain scenery to compensate for its gracelessness and lack of beauty? That those who commit it are almost completely inarticulate, uninteresting, unintelligent and unconscious persons, steeped in an ugly, repressive culture that they never question?\n\nSo, cutting the big sex scene out of THIS movie does it great harm. Because that's pretty much all it's about: furtive sex that gets punished.\n\nI thought there were a couple of good performances in it--but I often see actors rise above lousy scripts and the intentions of funders and producers. In this case, the actors cannot compensate for the poverty of ideas in this production, nor for the very poor quality of the script. And without the sex scene in the tent, even its meager notion of forbidden sex creating unhappiness and ruination in a repressive culture, cannot be fully grasped"}
{"text": "Brief: Muroga reclaims for Japan, what Clint and Sergio borrowed in the 1960's.\n\nIf the inspiration for this one wasn't clear, Goro Yasukawa's score will soon enlighten you: Sergio Leone. A character with a mysterious past and equally obscure agenda comes into a lawless town, and kicks ass. For The Man With No Name and his horse, read Saki (Yonekura) and her Harley. Given that Leone basically ripped off Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo in A Fistful of Dollars to begin with, the irony is satisfying. She has come to Tsuson - surely a nod to Tucson, less than two hours down the dusty Arizona I-10 from where I write this - to take on Tojo (Tsurumi), the local mob boss, who commits his crimes with impunity from the safety of an American Air Force base. She gets his attention when she interferes with his robbery of a wages truck, and takes the money herself. The two had met previously, though Tojo doesn't recognise Saki; you'll probably work out the basic circumstances long before the film reveals them, but it does add a couple of unexpectedly nasty twists of the knife.\n\nThe Okinawan setting is interesting, given tension between US forces there and the locals, dating back to a 1995 incident when three servicemen raped a 12-year old girl. Hence, the scene where Yuki demolishes two leering US soldiers has an additional level of resonance for local viewers, and the tolerance of the Americans to a brutal thug on their territory become somewhat more explicable. Yonekura is impressive in her role, and Muroga wisely doesn't bother to introduce any love interest; the film is barely an hour long, so there just wouldn't be room. The inevitability of the final Suki-Tojo faceoff is perhaps only exceeded by its ludicrousness - the heroine expands the definition of \"unarmed\" to include other limbs too. However, for an obviously low-budget work, it's busily energetic, and rarely slides much below entertaining."}

Then came American Splendor, about Cleveland autobiographical-comic writer Harvey Pekar.\n\nThe 2003 drama-documentary plays with comic-book frames and speech/thought balloons (and less showily than Ang Lee did the same year in Hulk). Breaking up stretches of narrative re-enacted by Paul Giamatti (as Pekar) and Hope Davis (as his wife Joyce), Pekar himself appears in white space, the panel of his little world becoming filled with props and people. The approach perfectly suits a man whose life and art were as entwined as a double-helix; American Splendor channels Pekar's vision of art and life as twinned struggles.\n\nHis personal lookin'-down-at-the-cracks-in-the-sidewalk bleeds into little-guy-on-main-street politics. In the '80s, he sees corporations co-opting salt-of-the-earth types so, while grappling with a cancer diagnosis, he gets fed up with Letterman using him as comic relief and protests GE's control of NBC during one of his guest appearances.\n\nOne of cinema's great first-date sequences is here: guy tells girl he's had a vasectomy; she throws up after their \"yuppie meal.\" They're surprised they like each other, since both are so resigned to disappointment. And Joyce had worried about which Harvey she'd meet, given his different images depending on his comic's illustrator.\n\nWe're splendidly shown how a lower-class nine-to-fiver has his own creative selves and richly expressive life. When Pekar's observing people at his file-clerk day job, catching the snippets of spoken poetry in others' prosaic routines, the film looks ahead to the best of today's blogs. Too bad most comic-book movies now aren't Pekar-esque at all but like the worst of the blogosphere: shouting, sniping and blasting-off without any recognizable human feeling or sense of life as \"pretty complex stuff"}

In the center of this admittedly dumb thriller is a performance so aloof and out of touch with reality that it ought to be singled out as one of the film's major flaws.\n\nGibson plays a Boston detective whose adult daughter is shot dead on his front porch with him standing beside her. At first, everyone presumes that the bullet was meant for the cop and not the daughter, but as clues unravel, it becomes increasingly clear that there's something illegal and dangerous going on by a private company in charge of maintaining the government's nuclear stockpile, and the cover-up leads back to a Massachusetts senator. The company isn't called Halliburton, but it might as well have been.\n\nTwo conflicts are at the center of the film. First is the mystery over who killed the daughter and the conspiracy that's connected. Second, and apparently more importantly, is Gibson's character's attempt to stay sane in order to complete the investigation. Supposedly, the entire time, he's about to be so overcome with rage that there's no telling what he will do, but he knows that he must suppress the darkness in order to bring justice to his daughter's killers.\n\nThis leads back to my initial desire to look at Gibson's real-life troubles. The tension between sanity and insanity that was intended to come across through Gibson's performance doesn't at all. There's a turning point in the film where, let's just say, Gibson's character isn't able to keep it together, and sadly, this blow-up feels right out of left field. Despite a few times where other characters tell him that he's going to crack, and despite a handful of hallucinations of his daughter which could very well be interpreted as memories and not psychosis, there's no indication that this cop is going to turn out the way he does. This flaw falls square on Gibson's shoulders. Perhaps he's so out of touch with reality himself that he's not able to inhabit a real character anymore. During the moments of histrionics when Gibson shouts or threatens, he's fun to watch, but during the moments of quiet introspection and suppressed grief, he almost doesn't register as having any humanity whatsoever. He's a shell of a character on screen, and perhaps one can point to Gibson's real-life psychological disconnects for answers.\n\nYet, even if Jimmy Stewart were alive and giving his career best performance in the lead role, Edge of Darkness would still be watchable garbage. There are so many plot details that are downright ludicrous that it ultimately becomes impossible to truly invest in the mystery on screen. First of all, the police department lets the cop lead the investigation over his daughter's murder, which is of course a defense attorney's dream scenario. Second, people keep getting killed, though the cop is the biggest threat to everyone. He's allowed to live and move around freely because otherwise there would be no movie. Third, the head of the company shares classified information with the cop which only makes things worse for his own cover-up. This same scene ends with that character asking the cop a truly asinine question for no other reason that to have Gibson point a gun in his face and then ask him the same question.\n\nRay Winstone has a lot of fun playing an unbelievable character with his own unbelievable issues, and the film is convoluted enough to force the viewer to exert a bit of mental energy to keep up, but not smart enough to be intellectually satisfying. Edge of Darkness is certainly compelling enough to pass the time, and the cop's ultimate unspooling does pack a punch. Yet, for all its adequacies, this is still a really dumb film with a lead performance by a man who's perhaps lost touch with humanity to such a degree that he simply ought not to act anymore."}

{"text": "Pages\n\nSaturday, July 28, 2012\n\nReview: \"The Unspeakable Act\"\n\nEarlier this year, I was asked to watch \"Mirror Mirror\". There was a scene in that movie where Armie Hammer's character is given a puppy love potion, which turns him into a devoted and even obsessive love slave for the queen. When separated from her, all he does is cry and demand to be near her again. Snow White is able to break the spell with a kiss, and all becomes well again.\n\nJackie Kimball's situation involves no potions, but she is certainly under a spell. In \"The Unspeakable Act\", we witness a very difficult period of time for her. See, she's in love with her brother Matthew. Now, he doesn't share her feelings, but remains close to her anyways. Most family members would probably be uncomfortable with this knowledge, but Matthew seems to understand that it's all rather harmless.\n\nShe meets his girlfriend with a smile and a friendly conversation, but dismisses her as soon as Matthew breaks the relationship off. She sometimes smokes, but when Matthew recommends they quit, she obeys immediately (though she does smoke a little pot later). She accepts answers and advice from him with little to no counter. She even picks his college as her first choice for higher education.\n\nNow, this dependence is a bit unhealthy, but is it really any different than most first love's for teenage girls? The belief that the first love is the only love, that you can't live without the other, etc. She even glows in certain scenes when with her brother. When her therapist asks Jackie is she shares similar feelings for her other brother, she dismisses that idea as disgusting. In her mind, Matthew is more of a lifelong friend than a sibling.\n\nThese therapy sessions may provide some answers as to why she acts the way she does, but the movie isn't really concerned with this, and neither am I; WHO is Jackie is more important than WHY is Jackie. She is a very powerful character with a personality that is both naive and wise; always analyzing herself and others, but still stubbornly holding on to her own hangup. She's my favorite teenage girl in a movie since the lead in \"Juno\".\n\nIn the end, this is no fairy tale; a kiss won't break the magic that possesses her. This case of puppy love may never quite be understood (even by her) or even something that she fully gets over - who forgets their first love? - but I have a feeling that she'll be ok. There are lots of fish in the sea, and lots of seas in the world; once she moves out, she'll understand."}

{"text": "FILMINK rates movies out of $20 - the score indicates the amount we believe a ticket to the movie to be worth\n\nA resonant, lyrical and beautifully realised cinematic experience.\n\nThis modest gem will probably be generally overlooked, which is unfortunate because it's a cinematic fable of considerable power and lyricism. It's also often exquisitely beautiful, thanks to the picturesque countryside in which the story unfolds. There's ambiguity about how much actual folkloric custom and myth is reflected here, and how much was simply written into the script, but either way it works sublimely.\n\nThe narrator is Aist (Igor Sergeyev), a laconic middle-aged man whose equally reticent best friend Miron (Yuri Tsurilo) has just lost his beloved wife, Tanya. Rather than have her buried in their West-Central Russian town, Miron resolves to follow the ways of his people - descendants of an ancient Finno-Ugric tribe called the Merjans - and take her body to the water. He asks Aist to accompany him on the drive. Since the coast happens to be thousands of miles away, what follows is quite an odyssey.\n\nAist is considerably more revealing in his voice-over recollections than he tends to be in conversation with Miron, and so we learn a fair bit about Tanya (Yuliya Aug) and her emotional history. Miron for his part briefly adheres to the Merjan tradition of a widower going into uncomfortably intimate detail about his married life. Aist takes his caged buntings along on the trip, and the little birds - like most other elements in the story - are symbolically significant. Still, the essential appeal of Silent Souls lies not in meaning - let alone plot - but in its strange abiding atmosphere: equal parts hyper-real and mystical. That said, the narrative arc is strong and satisfyingly dramatic.\n\nDon't be put off by the short running time, by the way. Silent Souls has more visual poetry, depth and resonance than most longer films."}

Yet, for all it's violence, \"Outrage Beyond\" is unmistakably a work of the master himself, feeling like a more contemporary chapter of the book Kitano's been writing for a long time, in a similar manner as Martin Scorsese tackling \"The Departed.\"\n\nThere's not a single moment of Dong-Hoo Choi's \"The Thieves\" that stays still. Endlessly busy despite a robust 136 minute runtime, Korea's highest grossing film in history should be more than familiar to western audiences. It's a heist picture, one with a wide ensemble of moving parts which compliment each other as each heist is carried out with point men, lookouts, and movie-world gizmos, and like even the thinnest of these pictures, \"The Thieves\" is less interested in the characters than it is the elaborate stunts and gimmicks."}
{"text": "17 August 2008\n\nIt's an embarrassing thing to say about one of the highest-regarded Soviet art films ever produced, but try though I might, as I watched Sergei Parajanov's Color of Pomegranates, I could never quite shake the ghost of Monty Python's parodies of inscrutable art films. You know what I'm talking about, if you've seen enough Flying Circus episodes: stern-faced people standing outdoors, not moving, and then the film stops and Terry Jones appears in the upper corner wearing a hobo costume, that sort of thing. Or, the Middle of the Film sketch in The Meaning of Life. The point being, if you have in your head an idea of \"pretentious European art film from the 1960s,\" I can virtually guarantee that The Color of Pomegranates looks pretty much exactly like what you're thinking of.\n\nAnd yet...oh, there's always an \"and yet\" with me. Though it may well be artsy to the point of absurdity, it's not quite \"pretentious\", I don't think. Of course, pretension is in the eye of the beholder, but I like to reserve the word for anything which seems positively smug about how hard it is to understand, and how terrifically clever the director had to be to make it, and just be a giant exercise in back-patting all around: we who made/like this film are SO MUCH BETTER than normal people. I just don't get that feeling from Parajanov's film, though I guess some people might disagree with me. Partially, I think it's because any filmmaker out to prove how damn smart he was in the Soviet Union probably didn't have much of a survival instinct, and partially it's because The Color of Pomegranates really isn't that hard - in fact, one of its defining characteristics is how tremendously easy it is to understand, for a film that does so much to violate all the normal rules of cinema.\n\nIn the loosest possible sense, the film is about the life of the 18th Century Armenian poet Sayat-Nova (the original Russian title was actually Sayat Nova, before the government came in, chopped a few minutes from the film, and renamed it Red Pomegranate). But as Parajanov warns us right in the first seconds of the movie, by means of an intertitle, this is no narrative biography; it is an attempt to convey by cinematic means the events in Sayat-Nova's life and the emotions surrounding those events. At the same time, The Color of Pomegranates is an attempt to express in film the meaning of the poet's writing.\n\nThis is exactly why I can't regard it as \"pretentious\". It didn't take an army of mirthless scholars to conclude that the film is an attempt to replicate poetry using visuals and sound; Parajanov tells us so, right at the start. And with that knowledge in mind, the apparent indulgences withing the film aren't indulgent at all - it's an extremely honest attempt to convey abstraction in an essentially non-abstract medium. By and large, it is successful in this attempt, though not in any way that is especially easy to describe rationally (which is, by all accounts, just how Parajanov wanted it). Here's my attempt to do so, anyway: I think the film's use of sound has a lot to do with its curious effect. Most of what we hear in the film was not apparently recorded along with the images, and it's certain that the extremely tiny amount of speech wasn't, except in one instance. So when you're watching water running down rock faces, or wind blowing the pages of books, et cetera, the sound of water and the sound of wind doesn't exactly match the image. It's close, but something is \"off\" with it; and that \"offness\" is the movie's poetry. You see the pages blowing, and it means something to you; you hear the pages blowing, and it means something else; and then the two of those things happen together, and the combination is what causes you to think about the Platonic \"Wind Blowing Through Pages\" that is the poetic, rather than the recorded image. I have literally no idea what this paragraph was supposed to mean.\n\nThat's the problem with trying to explain a work of art which is meant to be inexlicable; if you succeed, all you've really done is broken the movie. Which would be a tremendous sin against The Color of Pomegranates, which is really doing exactly what it says, putting us in the mind of a poet at all stages of his development. But how do you describe that? We don't think in complete sentences, after all, but in fragments, images, concepts. Certain shots in the film are tremendously beautiful in a purely abstract sense (the aforementioned wind/pages shot), some are interesting for what they show (a detailed, step-by-step document of how yarn is died), some simply put a human face up close to the lens and dare us to read something into the deliberately inscrutable, emotionless features on display. There isn't meant to be an \"answer\" to the film, because it doesn't raise any questions; its goal is to cause an emotional response in the viewer and this it does directly, rather than by creating a scenario for us to respond to. In this it may be one of the most purely cinematic works I have ever seen. But other than lamely suggesting that you go see it yourself, I can't really do much here on a blog.\n\nAfter The Color of Pomegranates, which was banned, the homosexual Parajanov was imprisoned for ten years for deviance, and for creating art that ran contrary to the dictates of social realism (he would complete only two more features before his death in 1990, both of them only marginally more representational). That the Soviet government wouldn't know what to do with a film like this isn't really surprising at all; it exists without reference to anything outside of itself, and the effect it tries to have on the viewer. It has a solipsistic purity that's easy to condemn and easy to praise, but either way its uniqueness guarantees it a position in the pantheon of great art movies."}

{"text": "Movie Trailers\n\nMovie Photos\n\nA Simple Plan, starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thorton (nominated for an Academy Award for this movie), Bridget Fonda, and Brent Brisco, is a thriller from director Sam Raimi. The movie's title describes the plot perfectly, but, of course, as in all these kinds of movies, things don't go as planned. What started out as a simple crime ends up as a web of deceit, murder, and paranoia, and A Simple Plan takes a slightly more unique approach.\n\nWhile a lot of these movies seem to entail characters that are deceitful from the beginning and purposely kill to get away with whatever they're stealing (usually money), A Simple Plan's characters are innocent, at least at the beginning. Paxton's character starts out reluctant but quickly - almost too quickly - changes to the deceiving side. He spends a whole scene telling his more simplistic pals, his brother Jacob (Thorton) and his friend Lou (Brisco), that they shouldn't tell anybody, including their wives. But almost instantly, Paxton reveals the money to his wife, and very shortly after, she joins in. She further complicates things by suggesting he do things to keep the money under wraps. Paxton willingly obeys and more problems ensue, like murder.\n\nThorton is the most respectable of the group. A little on the slow side, he wants to take the money just because he found it. There really was no greed behind him other than that he couldn't resist four million in cash (who could?). He ends up regretting his mistake but cannot break out of the conspiracy.\n\nThe acting is great in A Simple Plan but the characters are sort of stupid. Stupid as in a personality trait. Even Paxton, the smartest of the group, makes a lot of stupid mistakes. These guys are constantly letting things slip, constantly acting nervous, and constantly wrecking their possibility of making it by doing stupid things.\n\nA Simple Plan has a good story and good actors, but sometimes the mistakes that are made in the film are just a little too stupid. And the movie can lag in parts."}

The first portion of the flashback covers the time when they first met when they were very young; they both shared an enthusiasm for adventure. The second portion is an accelerated depiction of their courtship and married life, which is presented without dialogue. At the end of this segment, I was weeping. The movie had barely even started!

The main cast is excellent, especially Dana Andrews as a slick bastard who by comparison makes Don Draper look like a paragon of chivalrous virtue.

{"text": "The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n\nIt's 1920s Southern Ireland, and the dreaded Black and Tans are terrorising the country. Damien (Murphy) is all set to go to London to be a doctor when one of his best friends is murdered for not saying his name in English. His brother (Delaney) pleads with him to join the section of the IRA he runs, in retaliation for the killing. When Damien witnesses another unmovitated attack by the 'Tans, he takes his brother up on the offer. The Wind That Shakes The Barely is an undeniably powerful and challenging film, but it doesn't really resonate cinematically the way it could have. Ken Loach, a director whom the term 'realism' was pretty much invented for, uses extremely long takes and allows his actors to fluff their lines without cutting - evidently because that's what real. While it's worked to startling effect before, the period setting here damages his much-celebrated minimalist style. The acting is outstanding all 'round, Murphy and Delaney anchoring the film with two superb turns as the conflicting brothers who have little in common but patriotism; yet, unfortunately not one other character is used to purposeful effect. Liam Cunningham's Dan ostensibly serves as someone to merely support whatever Damien says; a shame, because Cunningham is tremendous and deserved more than such an under-written role. Having said all that, the actual history involved here is undeniably absorbing and it's a very brave film for a British director to make. The subject matter never ceases to be anything other than enthralling, but the plot unfolds so leisurely that you become almost bored with the characters; there appears to be a lack of immediacy about them, which is essential for characters involved with a subject matter such as this.

They shoot out in piercing shards of action and potent gutter or pulpit rhetoric. Some Mother's Son is about the fight to save the lives of the rebel group that became known as the Ten Men Dead. It may appear to be a forthright pro-Irish saga of unjust incarceration. But it's only superficially simple. You have to keep your wits about you to step-dance through its emotional terrain -- there's a welter of conflicting attitudes in the characters as well as in the filmmakers. The movie expresses what it's like to endure unending political catastrophes. The people in this film live on survival reflexes; they hope for emergency stopgaps that can't substitute for lasting resolution. As political art, Some Mother's Son is wanting. As a document of Irish confusion, it's indelible.\n\nAt the turning point of this fact-inspired chronicle of \"the Troubles,\" a college-age boy named Gerard Quigley (Aidan Gillen), having been thrown into Ulster's Maze prison for IRA activity, joins the hunger strike that resulted in the death of Bobby Sands and nine other young rebels from May to August of 1981. (In the early '70s, George spent three years in the same prison on an arms charge.) The core of the story is the relationship between Gerard's mother, Kathleen (Helen Mirren), an anti-IRA schoolteacher, and a working-class mother, Annie Higgins (Fionnula Flanagan), whose revulsion for the British is near total. As Annie's son, Frank (David O'Hara), and Kathleen's Gerard teeter toward martyrdom, the two women petition and beg the British government to respond to the prisoners' demands and end the strike.\n\nThe mothers' affectionate alliance is a marvelous example of the surprising valences in human chemistry. Kathleen is a smart, firm woman in a \"soft,\" equivocating position. Right up to his arrest, Gerard has been able to hide his politics from her. She's horrified at the cold-bloodedness of his self-styled soldiering, and mortified when he plants a farewell kiss on her mouth to pass a written message to the Sinn Fein. Annie, on the other hand, wholly supports Frank's actions. She's already lost one son to the struggle, and she's certain that blasting the British off her island will better her lot. Kathleen, educated and worldly, is better able to articulate their sons' plight to British officials, but Annie has the scrappiness and sorority needed for a war of emotional attrition. As the turbulence behind bars runs its terrifying course, the audience, like Kathleen, gets caught up in the fervor of Annie's firebrand solidarity.\n\nGeorge's stirring depiction of the prisoners' revolt and its riotous consequences obscures the film's key idea: that destruction or self-destruction inevitably cripples a movement. The IRA inmates protest because they want to be recognized as prisoners of war, not criminals. The most critical of their five demands is the most purely symbolic: the right to wear their own clothes. George means to question whether acquiring such a right -- and, at one point, the ability to call it a right and not a privilege -- is worth risking lives. But his re-enactments of the turmoil in Maze prison and the street processions that follow is so mind-grabbing and electric that a rift develops between what the movie states explicitly and what it dramatizes.\n\nGeorge has said that the film is about the anguish of people squeezed between two extremes: the institutional violence of the British and the mystical revolutionary violence of the IRA. It plays out, though, as a battle between a liberal -- Kathleen -- and the radicals and reactionaries around her. In art, as in politics, the liberal perspective is difficult to make dynamic and appealing. Seeing Kathleen look askance at the rebels' courtroom grandstanding isn't as gut-warming as watching Annie mouth off to every authority figure in sight, whether the security forces or a nun. Early on, there's a barbed critique of Irish manly charm in Gerard's deception and manipulation of his mother Kathleen. But George never rises to the full-blooded analysis of Irish machismo that informed In the Name of the Father (which he and Sheridan also co-wrote, with Sheridan directing).\n\nStill, Some Mother's Son has impact even when it zigs and zags. In the opening minutes, George intercuts the girls in Kathleen's school pounding their way through a step dance and Gerard and Frank targeting British military vehicles with a bazooka; the sequence culminates with classroom windows shattering and a jeep and truck exploding into flames. Of course, the cutting baldly points up the cruel disruption of the peaceful school by the guerrilla war beyond its gates. But George also gets at something more mysterious -- the percussive, fatalistic nationalism shared by almost every major character except Kathleen. In another suggestive bit of cutting, George moves from the mothers crooning American pop standards to the prisoners joining arms and voices and drumming on walls.\n\nAt these times, the film has an atavistic charge that's rooted in real events. When the prison guards won't pick up the inmates' slops unless they take off their makeshift blanket robes and put on their convict uniforms, the men smear their feces on the walls and keep up their regimen of exercise and Gaelic pride. This isn't hyperbole, it's history. If anything, George is downplaying their blend of lowdown grit and high-grade nationalism in order to sustain his dramatic credibility. In The Troubles, Tim Pat Coogan writes that during this episode, \"The Irish demonstrated both their defiant natures and their sense of identity in a manner which gave new meaning to the term 'back to basics.' For example, throughout the Dirty Protest, the prisoners continued to hold Irish classes. They tapped out a word on the central-heating pipes and then inscribed it onto the walls of their cells in their own excrement, sometimes using the crucifixes on their rosary beads as stylos.\" George's audience viscerally experiences the IRA men using patriotic and religious enthusiasm to jack themselves up into a transcendental state. When Gerard first lands in Bobby Sands's prison cell and tells him he looks like Jesus, it sounds like an air-clearing quip; when Sands lies dying of starvation, after just being elected to Parliament, it's no joke."}

Franz meets beautiful Odile (Karina) one day in an English class, and she mentions that her aunt, with whom she lives, keeps a large stash of cash hidden in the house. Arthur and Franz concoct a plan to steal the money, and convince Odile to help them.\n\nWhy I Love It:\n\nLike Godard's \"Breathless,\" the exhilarating \"Outsiders\" is one of the director's most accessible and enjoyable outings from the 1960s. Part buddy film, part crime-gone-wrong drama, it tells the story of three disaffected friends whose ill-advised adventure in armed robbery is really a way for Godard to capture their devil-may-care youthfulness. Tracking the trio's romp through the Louvre (to beat the nine-minute record of an American tourist!) or staging a cool, dazzling three-way dance (the Madison) next to a caf\u00e9 jukebox, Godard is at his most invigorating here. In all, \"Outsiders\" is atmospheric, free-spirited, and fun."}

Shots of the moving character that reminds you have someone on a conveyor belt. The only aspect that was missing was Spike himself.. He didn't appear in this film as one of the characters. Hmm.. I'm not certain if he's ever done that in previous films.\n\nBasically, the storyline was real simple. How would one who has been sentenced and convicted of a crime spend his last days as a free man? What sort of regrets would you harbor in your soul? Who can you trust? Would your woman be there for you once you did seven flat? Could you do the time?\n\nI've never caught a case, but I can tell you that I couldn't do a bid. I'd probably last only a few hours. Someone would probably send a soldier after me or I'd end up extended my stay for poor behaviour. I used to visit my brother on Riker's Isle, prison ain't nothing nice.\n\nThe film has a decent compliment of notable actors and actresses. Where does it rank amongst other epic Spike Lee films? I'd probably say that it's middle of the pack.\n\nHowever, its a pretty decent way to spend a Friday nite. You could do much worse..\nGrab the torrent or peep the storyline before the Netflix rental."}

{"text": "Ronan Doyle's review:\n\nA prime example of a film with enough earnest intention to overcome several storytelling issues, Kawa (as it's actually called, this alternate title makes no sense) might not be a particularly well made movie\u2014nor is it incompetent, make no mistake\u2014but its narrative means well enough to earn the problematic aspects of its execution forgiveness. Using the proud ancestry of a Maori family as its backdrop, it tells the story of a man whose inheritance of his retiring father's business coincides with his personal revelation that the life he has been leading as a husband and father of two is a lie. His reluctant coming out and the ensuing fallout is handled with an admirable tenderness, the material providing much of the warmth and sincerity the actors don't always successfully convey. Though it follows a predictable arc and never dares to stray from the safety of its three act structure, the ideas it tackles are moving enough to outweigh the distinctly uncinematic approach they're here given."}

The new film adaptation of the Thor story doesn't get into that, but you get to learn all about how Thor is an arrogant, impertinent, warrior prince. He's played by the Australian actor and blond beefcake Chris Hemsworth. This Thor hails from a celestial realm in which magic and science, as he explains, are one. His father Odin is the king there, and is played by Anthony Hopkins, who also does enough explaining to test a viewer's attention.\n\nIn Kenneth Branagh's Thor, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) gets banished from his kingdom via intergalactic wormhole and winds up in small town New Mexico.\n\nOdin's kingdom has an uneasy detente with the frost giants from just down the galaxy. Thor hates those jerks, and could go on fighting under-lit, incoherent, computer-generated battles with them all day. But his brother Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston, is more circumspect. Something might be up with Loki, something untrustworthy.\n\nPrior to assuming its throne, Thor gets banished from his kingdom\u2014too much arrogant warmongering\u2014via intergalactic wormhole and winds up in small town New Mexico. Although it obviously lacks the other realm's production-design budgets, it's not so bad. There's a beautiful, available love interest (Natalie Portman) who just happens to be studying intergalactic wormholes. She has a Scandinavian advisor (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd), who just happens to be familiar with Norse mythology. What are the odds?\n\nThor is directed by Kenneth Branagh, and penned by a veritable pantheon of writers \u2014none of whom seems to have made any particularly godly contributions. Branagh, known as a Shakesperean, always seems to strain himself when reaching down into the barrel of populism. Here he's so busy counterpointing celestial, vaguely Shakesperean intrafamily feuds with earthbound fish-out-of-water folly that both elements wind up undercooked. The net effect feels like directorial insecurity.\n\nEverywhere we look, it's a mixed bag: Kat Dennings is utterly superfluous as Portman's comic-relief sidekick, but Idris Elba is terrific as the stoic gatekeeper of the intergalactic wormholes. Thankfully Hemsworth, at least as plausible a Thor as Vincent D'Onofrio was in Adventures in Babysitting, eventually wins us over with his swaggering, just slightly campy Olde English pomposity.\n\nThor, the character, has been the property of Marvel Entertainment since the 1960s, when he became the cover boy for an odd but muscular combination of Norse mythology and comic books. So it makes sense that Thor is the epitome of commercial filmmaking: It's less a film than a commercial for its own sequel, for the Avengers movie next year and for the many multiplatform entertainment properties on offer from the Marvel machine.

And though it all makes sense by the film's end, the process can be slow going.\n\nA romantic mystery of sorts, Seven Pounds re-teams Will Smith and director Gabriele Muccino, who worked on 2006's The Pursuit of Happyness.\n\nNot much can be revealed about the movie without spoiling the surprises. But we can say that Ben, Smith's enigmatic character, begins by compiling a list of seven names. What each has in common is a critical need for help. Ben comes to their aid in extraordinary and dramatic ways.\n\nWhy he has chosen to help them is initially murky. The process of sussing out the source of his altruism could try some people's patience. Moments of confusion arise as the story ricochets between past and present and among the cast of characters. Still, it is an engrossing, if plodding, tale of redemption and sacrifice.\n\nThe film opens intriguingly with Ben calling 911 to report a suicide, his voice an odd blend of distress and matter-of-factness. The plot takes turns in various directions, building up to the crucial matter of the suicide.\n\nOne of the people Ben helps is Emily (Rosario Dawson), an easygoing, artsy woman with whom he slowly falls in love. Dawson and Smith have an appealing chemistry. None of the other story lines are as involving, particularly one involving Ezra (Woody Harrelson), a good-natured pianist. Ben initially derides the man, who has a day job in sales, as \"a blind vegan beef salesman.\" His chunk of the story could definitely have used some beefing up.\n\nSmith gives an understated performance. He's less the genial Everyman of his comic films and more of a brooding, lost soul. He may be driven mostly by guilt, rather than generosity.\n\nSeven Pounds is the kind of holiday film that seems perfectly suited to these economic times, with desperate people in dire need of cash, medical intervention and proper housing, and a conflicted hero who decides almost grimly to improve their circumstances. Concerned with how people overcome trauma and tragedy, the film focuses on universal themes of loss, forgiveness and redemption\n\nWhile it doesn't break any new ground or provide any revelations, Seven Pounds is unabashedly emotional and cautiously hopeful.

{"text": "Menu\n\nFIGHT CLUB\n\n\"You are not your job. You are not how much you have in the bank. You are not the car you drive. You are not the contents of your wallet. You are not your khakis. You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake. What happens first is you can't sleep. What happens then is there's a gun in your mouth. What happens next is you meet Tyler Durden. Let me tell you about Tyler. He had a plan. In Tyler we trusted. Tyler says the things you own, end up owning you. It's only after you've lost everything that you're free to do anything. Fight Club represents that kind of freedom...\"\n\nGeneration-Xers often feel alienated in our society. Performance and consumerism are supposed to motivate us, but what kind of value system is that? Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working at jobs we hate so we can afford shit we don't need. TV makes us believe that money and beauty and big cars will make us happy. Our generation, born and raised through the 70s and 80s, hasn't been given any religious, social or moral model. We are too young to have been in a great war, there was no major economical crisis. Our war is a spiritual war, the Great Depression is our lives. It used to be that men were providers for their families, and hopefully entities prompt to do the right thing. And now the only thing that matters in America is how much money you can make, and how close you can get to a movie star lifestyle. Urgh.\n\nReality check: TV's wrong. There's very little chance any of us will end up a millionaire, a movie god or a rock star. You're just gonna strive and do shit you have nothing but contempt for and just get some lousy, unfulfilling existence. Sure, you might be able to kinda convince yourself it's all good, you got the car and the lawn you mown on Sundays, and you look oh-so-cool in your khakis, just like those dancing kids in the ads, right? But deep down inside, we know there's gotta be something better to live for. This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time.\n\n\"Fight Club\" is an absolutely amazing movie, as subversive as it gets. It's a wonder it ever got made, especially by a major studio. This masterpiece is a picture that screams for people to wake up and revolt against the absurdity of modern life. Of course it's gathering controversy. It's anti-capitalism, borderline nihilistic and downright anarchist, for sure. Some might even say that it's anti-God, and not quite without evidence. But ain't that what movies are about? Art is supposed to make you think, to push you to react. It shouldn't leave you indifferent. These days everyone blames movies for violence in our society. Don't stop selling guns to kids (that's big money), but turn every movie into Disney sap to shut people up for a while. Maybe they'll keep ignoring that Nike is exploiting kids to pay Michael Jordan, that automobile moguls will recall cars only if it'll cost less than settling malfunction cases out of court, that you gotta kill half-extinct species of whales to make classy perfume... If we stop making movies with violence just in case some moron might screw up (which he would probably have done anyway), cinema will become a travesty of reality, and we'll be deprived of many potential masterpieces. If violence had never been in movies, there would have been no \"A Clockwork Orange\" or \"Taxi Driver\"; we're talking about some of the greatest movies ever made!\n\n\"Fight Club\" revolves around an unnamed Narrator, a disillusioned office worker who's so fed up with his routine life that he can't even sleep anymore. He's trying to find satisfaction in shopping, turning his crummy apartment into an Ikea catalog spread, but it's just so... Urgh. The only way he gets to connect with other people is by going to self-help groups for people with testicular cancer, brain parasites or whatever. It seems people really care about you only if they think you're gonna die. That's in one of these meetings that he meets Marla, a chain-smoking Goth mermaid who hangs in these sessions because it's cheaper than the movies and there's free coffee. Suddenly, our Narrator can't let go anymore by crying in the arms of other men, because the presence of another faker keeps reminding him he's one too. This ain't the last he'll see of Marla. She's about to influence drastically his life, but not nearly as much as Tyler Durden, an intriguing fellow who's everything he's not. Confident and charismatic, Tyler is an all-out anarchist who refuses to submit to the compromises of modern life. He splices frames of erected penises into family films when he works as a projectionist, pees in the soup when he's a waiter. And he makes soap, too.\n\nThe Narrator finds himself intensely driven to Tyler and his radical thinking. They find that the best way to feel alive might be by beating the living shit out of each other. Soon, other people join in. Lotsa people. Fight clubs multiply, all over the nation. Seems today's emasculated men are relieved to finally find a venue to unleash their frustration. They're so numbed by their lives that they're desperate to feel something, anything. Even if it means going at it in underground boxing clubs. Tyler takes it to the next phase by turning his fight clubs into units of Project Mayhem. And then it gets weird. Yeah, weirder than what you saw so far! I really can't tell you anymore about the plot (even though the trailer gives away a lot more, as do some critics). The first rule of fight club is: You don't talk about fight club. The second rule of fight club is: You don't talk about fight club.\n\nThe film's protagonist and narrator is played by Edward Norton, who goes beyond anything he's done. There is so much nuance and intelligence in his unpredictable, always compelling performance. Brad Pitt is another very interesting actor, and he truly gives everything he's got as Tyler Durden. Believe me, Tyler will crawl under your skin and stay there. I can hardly think of a more fascinating movie character. What's the most disturbing about Tyler and the film in general is how it seduces you with its nihilistic philosophy, how it makes you relate to, understand and admire Tyler Durden... And then before you know it, you realize that you would have done anything, no matter how immoral and depraved, just because you had so much faith in him.\n\nThe movie is a frightening look at how any \"normal\" person could turn into a member of an extremist group. It shows how seductive anarchy and marginality can be at first, but it's also responsible enough to also show how these things often get out of hand and go too far. This movie makes you understand why some turn into terrorists, why some take part in a death cult, why Germans followed blindly Hitler and committed some of the most atrocious acts in history. This is a movie that should be shown to everyone in schools to be discussed. This is a movie as powerful and thought provoking as \"Do the Right Thing\" or \"Schindler's List\". And it's a comedy, too. One of the first things people too shaken by the issues of the film might talk about to lighten the mood might be the casting of rock star Meatloaf as Big Bob, a former bodybuilder who took so much steroids that he grew huge breasts and was deprived of his balls (literally). Or how shocking to see Helena Bonham Carter acting without wearing a corset, turning herself into the trashy Marla. Kudos to Carter for achieving to make Marla somehow endearing.\n\nThe film was adapted by newcomer Jim Uhls from the novel by Chuck Palahniuk. The book is incredibly rich and inventive: it's almost scientific in its details. Can the movie live up to it? Astonishingly, yes. Director David Fincher found the way to communicate through images and sound the vibe Palahniuk sent through words. This ain't your middle of the road studio picture. The film might seem difficult to some, because it's so packed with ideas and doesn't dumb down or sugar coat them. It has the bleak look of decay and filth also found in Fincher's previous films, but it also has a refreshing playfulness. I saw \"Fight Club\" twice in a row on opening day, and I got to notice tons of nifty details each time. Like how there's subliminal images of Tyler in the first act, as well as a frame of a penis spliced into the ending, and a bunch of other subtle things.\n\nI also really like the film's non-linear structure, how it constantly jumps back and forth in time and space, like a novel actually. The editing is particularly audacious and inventive. Let's not forget the Dust Brothers: finally, a film score that sounds truly modern instead of sticking to the same tired faux-Wagner strings and brass. Their electronic, loop and sample woven, genre blending music makes the film even more electrifying. \"Fight Club\" is pure, unrestrained, riveting filmmaking. And if you think that \"The Sixth Sense\" had a fall-off-your-seat climactic twist, wait till you see what Palahniuk concocted. More than just a surprise, it's a revelation that puts everything else in perspective, and makes it even scarier. The sequence that follows is therefore even more thrilling, as... Well, you'll see. Oh, and you gotta love the final shot, a wonderfully ironic anti-happy end perfectly edited to the Pixies' Where is My Mind.\n\n\"Fight Club\" burns ideas in your brain, thrills you with its fights, makes you laugh and uses the art of filmmaking in a whole new way. This is one for the ages. In Fight Club we trust."}
{"text": "Welcome to 'Shudder' Island\n\nIt's pretty much impossible to give a movie like \"Shutter Island\" a grade without comparing it to the director's previous works.\n\nClick image to enlarge.\n\nAdd to that fact that the film's director is Martin Scorsese and things get even more difficult, leaving most people, including me, with the verdict: \"It was a pretty good movie, but not a great Scorsese movie.\"\n\nTeddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a Federal Marshall (or \"Fedah-ral Mah-shall\" as he puts it in his thick Bostonian accent) sent to a mental asylum located on an island off of Massachusetts Bay to investigate the disappearance of an escaped mental patient.\n\nThings quickly turn the usual conspiratorial \"things aren't exactly what they seem here\" way, leading Teddy deeper and deeper into the island's secrets, questioning both the safety of the island's patients as well as his own sanity.\n\nAs a thriller, \"Shutter Island\" works best in its disorienting, dream-like scenes, in which Teddy is investigating the island, not knowing if what he's seeing is real or all in his head, creating the same uneasy feeling in the audience you get when you first wake up from a nightmare, not knowing what you experienced was real or not.\n\nThe magnificent score, done by Robbie Robertson, heightens the tension, making each scene feel like a screw being twisted tighter and tighter, until the ultimate payoff at the film's conclusion. Even more effective are the scenes played with hardly any music accompaniment at all, adding to the feeling that the audience is right there with poor Leo wandering the dark and creepy halls of the asylum.\n\nThe ending that \"you'll never see coming\" is, well, not that surprising and can be seen coming from about a mile away. But even though the twist probabtly won't blow your mind. Its execution is a decent enough payoff (the twist's twist, if you will), so the audience doesn't feel totally cheated.\n\n\"Shutter Island\" is no \"Goodfellas\" (has to be said), but it's a new type of movie, even a new style, we haven't seen before from Scorsese. It doesn't break much new ground but proves Scorsese can exploit the thriller conventions just about as well as anyone else in the business, making \"Shutter Island\" still worthy of your 10 bucks."}
{"text": "A highly skilled bodyguard avenging his brother's untimely death uncovers a ring of corruption extending to the highest levels of society and government.\n\nLiquidator, The (2011) | Review\n\nA Kazakhstan Thriller\n\nJacob Sahms\n\nThis thriller, originally voiced by Russian actors, has a straightforward, TNT-movie feel to it. It could've starred a Bronson, Seagal, or Stallone, if it had been shot in the United States. Instead, it's a dubbed over film that finds Vinnie Jones headlining, but he's merely an assassin-for-hire in the third act. What we've got here is an above average film starring Aitzhanov Berik, who turns in a decent performance as the brooding bodyguard Arsen who is searching for his brother's killers.\n\nThe first thirty minutes almost lost me. Everything moved predictably, to the point of being paint-by-numbers. But Berik's material as Arsen and the bit about the \"judges\" who speak to him, pushing him toward vengeance, finally sucked me in. Berik tracks down his brother's killers, finds out that it's a conspiracy involving the journalist's investigation into the mob, and proceeds to attract a good amount of trouble. The fight scenes are entertaining, but the supporting actors, outside of Berik and a fellow reporter, aren't very good.\n\nUltimately, the \"twist\" is pretty ridiculous, but it reinforces the questions about vengeance that come to mind about a film like this. How much does seeking vengeance cost the seeker? What are we sacrificing in ourselves when we take the law into our own hands? If \"vengeance is mine, says the Lord\" is true, why would God not want us to take vengeance? In the outcome here for Arsen, we're pretty clear that it costs us everything, even our souls.\n\nIf revenge thrillers or mindless action flicks are your deal, then this is passable. Otherwise, you can probably steer clear."}

Like I still recite the poem \"Bright Star\" in my head at least a couple times a week. Sometimes more, even. I don't know why that's so deeply ingrained within me. I think when you invest that much into something, artistically or creatively, there's this connection to it that never goes away.\n\nI think we had discussions about it. To not judge Ashley, to let her be. It's not about popularity with her, it wasn't about how we show this woman in a way that's likeable. Not just that she's cranky, she messes up, and she's just not a very good person. That's who she is. It doesn't mean she's a bad person at the core of herself, she's just not connected to that core.

{"text": "Tag Archives: Super 8\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Back to the Future, Star Wars, and other like-minded pieces of Spielbergian entertainment, Super 8 is a film with a dirty little secret at its core- INCEST. But unlike those other films, in which the secret ain't so secret, Super 8 plays it subtle, choosing to shroud its aberrant sexuality in an air of mystery.\n\nAnd it's a better film for it. Long after the disappointment of the recycled Cloverfield monster is gone, you'll be all, \"Wait a minute\u2026\" and suddenly you're in love with Super 8 all over again. Forbidden love, that is, AKA the greatest love of all. (Take it away, Whitney!)\n\nEmbedding is disabled, but it's worth clicking the link. Trust me.\n\nLet me spell it out for the oblivious. When Louis Dainard crashes the funeral of Jackson Lamb's wife, it isn't solely because he feels responsible for her death- it's because HE LOVED HER. They were having an affair, and, as you can imagine, that shit burned Jackson's ass.\n\nNot only that, the lovely Alice Dainard, who is the object of young Joe Lamb's affection, is obviously a byproduct of their monkey-coupling. So you can see why Dad A and Dad B would want to keep those crazy kids as far away from each other as humanly possible. The two men hate each other as it is; neither of them wants to assume joint custody of an inbred retard baby and be forced to live out their lives like some sort of comically mismatched sitcom duo.\n\nNeed more proof? You know the scene where Alice cries while watching the filmstrip of Joe's dead mom? That's because IT'S HER MOTHER TOO. But she isn't crying tears of sadness. No, those are tears of frustration. Because in that moment she begins to understand that the world will never accept the unholy love she has for her brother.\n\nBut all is not lost, for this perverted tale ends on a glimmer of hope. During the final scene, in which Joe lets go of his mother's locket, he is really letting go of his shared lineage with Alice. They no longer have a mother, because her memory was needed to fuel a space alien's rocket ship. The two lovebirds are flanked by their fathers, who have come to terms with being a non-gay couple raising a pair of incestuous siblings. It signifies a new era of the American family, and is a great victory for love.\n\nAt least that's my interpretation, which is a hell of a lot more interesting than what actually happens in Man-eating E.T. Vs. The Goonies."}
{"text": "Why Do People Hate Gwyneth Paltrow So Much? Also Contagion is excellent.\n\nUnder no circumstance should you go to a screening of Contagion without some sort of anti-bacterial gel or spray. Don't do it. Halfway through the film you'll find yourself fidgeting due to the palpable threat of unseen germs and you'll want that anti-bacterial goop. Take some. Or maybe some wipes. Because when Kate Winslet mentions the number of times a person touches their face each day you'll want to touch your face all the time and if you don't use a wipe you'll have a breakout like a fifteen year old horfing down a load of fast food.\n\nSteven Soderbergh new film puts you right back in 1994 when it seemed like every week there was a new virus threatening to destroy the world with one errant sneeze. Germs are scary. But in a nod to the modern \"Trust Us\" era the government isn't behind the disease. They're the ones desperately trying to solve the problem. There's no shadowy organization of crazy army guys or a bevy of black oil aliens. No overarching mystery. Just people succumbing to a plague.\n\nThere's a cerebral quality to Soderbergh's plague film. In a more traditional Hollywood film two characters brought together by improbable circumstances would find love. There'd be a gun fight. The cure would be found in the blood of some simple guy just trying to make it through his day. The bad guy would get his just desserts. Soderbergh teases us with these familiar tropes. He guides on a path that seems inexplicably bound for them, and at the last moment, like a good director with a background in independent cinema, he shows restraint and dials things back.\n\nThis is the real world where true love isn't found on a bus going 55mph and the cure isn't magically born from the blood of the immune. In the real world death is constant and blind and justice is meted out quite inefficiently and cures are not easy.\n\nAnd all of that is best exemplified in Jude Law's blogger character. It's like a condemnation of lazy Hollywood films and the internet all wrapped up in one morally repugnant character. Any other film he'd be our hero. He's good-looking and he's got his finger on the pulse of the problem. But this blogger is a completely selfish bastard. There's none of the altruism necessary in a hero. As a blogger myself I felt a little stung. Scott Z. Burns' script clearly has special and strong and virulent feelings for bloggers. It's hardly subtle, but it's never so angry that is muddies the message Burns and Soderbergh are attempting to convey with the character.\n\nDo all bloggers have highly distracting teeth problems, or just the ones that look like Jude Law?\n\nBut what amazes me more than Law's wonderful little bastard is how egalitarian this film is. Anyone could play the various characters of Contagion. Gwyneth Paltrow, the outbreak monkey, could have just as easily been played by George Clooney, or her onscreen husband, Matt Damon. Gender, which seems to be present in every movie I ever watch just isn't an issue in this film. These characters have bigger fish to fry. They're dealing with a virus that's more deadly and communicable than the Spanish flu man. They don't have time to get hung up on what is and isn't appropriate for a lady or a man. It's like this film was cast in a post feminism world.\n\nMatt Damon plays a father and husband who finds himself struggling to protect his family in a world ravaged by a disease. It's inferred that he's a stay at home dad. No one ever comments on it. His masculinity is never called into question and no one marvels at the novelty of his existence. Thank fucking God. Kate Winslet and Marion Cotillard's bad ass disease doctors get the same matter of fact treatment. They're highly regarded and extensively educated professionals with a job to do. How they dress, how they look, and their sex has nothing to do with it.\n\nAs the film progresses we find ourselves spending more and more times with characters only hinted at in trailers. Yes Damon is a major part of this film, and arguably its emotional core. But Laurence Fishburne's conflicted CDC rep and Jennifer Ehle's virologist are just as crucial.\n\nJennifer whose-it you ask?\n\nYou know the lady romancing Colin Firth in Pride and Prejudice. She's been having a little bit of a comeback in the last few years in that she's actually appearing in films again. Here she's another CDC doctor out to cure the virus before we all go the way of Gwyneth.\n\nEhle isn't as familiar to audiences as the rest of the cast and there's an everywoman quality to her. If you HAVEN'T seen the 1995 Pride and Prejudice ad nauseam because in college your friends all had lady boners for Colin Firth and you aren't really into plays on the West End then she's just a side character that slowly becomes one of the primary characters. Her story is only really told in the latter half of the film but she gives her few scenes such weight and poignance that you find yourself remembering them much more fondly than the various abuses that Paltrow suffers.\n\nWhich brings me to a question. What is up with all the Gwyneth Paltrow hate? So the lady is a painfully out of touch Hollywood actress who won an Oscar for looking good in drag and making breast binding look whimsical. So what? Oh no she's organic! And she appears on Glee! And she made Country Strong! I'm over it. She's got a bit part here and people are comparing it to Janet Leigh in Psycho for obvious reasons, but she's solid and it never feels like a tease. Unless you're under a rock you know going in that she dies. It's less Janet Leigh in Psycho and more Steven Seagal in Executive Decision.\n\nAlso she's a Hollywood actress getting painfully close to forty and she appears sans makeup in this film. Props to her.\n\n\u2026\n\nAnd now I've turned this review into an essay on why it's brave for a Hollywood actress to appear sans makeup in a film. Someone sneeze on me. I don't want to liveI have never loved an actress more than I love Gywneth Paltrow. It's true. I am not even a little bit kidding.\n\nAnonymous\n\nI hate her, I'm afraid. It's visceral. She just seems really snotty.\n\nMsJack\n\nThe only reason I have for disliking Gwyneth is that she gave her daughter a horrible name. If your kid's name would sound stupid on a judge's placard (\"The Honorable Apple Blythe Martin\"), then you're doing it wrong, plus I have an intense dislike of our culture's tendency to assign women with frilly, non-serious-sounding names.\n\nShe also remarked on Oprah that the name is \"biblical,\" which made me roll my eyes. Yeah, okay, the word \"apple\" does appear in the Bible a few times, but only in passing mentions, mostly in poems or prophetic literature. It's never a significant theme, no more \"biblical\" than naming your kid Goat or Threshing Floor. Western culture has long associated apples with the tree in the Garden of Eden, but that isn't actually in the Bible. That's probably why she thought the name was \"biblical.\"\n\nI probably sound like I hate her, but I don't. That's the only thing she's done that I disliked. For the most part, I could take her or leave her.\n\nI did enjoy her cover of \"Forget You\" for Glee. Better than the original, IMO."}
{"text": "In Bruges\n\nIn Bruges is one of those films where you're not really sure if you want to recommend it to someone. My mom, her friend and I (and most of the theater) really enjoyed it. But we were at the Palm, and in San Luis Obispo, when you say it's a Palm movie, people instantly know what you're talking about. Not necessarily mainstream, a little off, and sometimes weird.\n\nIn short, In Bruges is about two hit men holed up in Bruges, Belgium, after a job went bad. Ken is excited at the chance to play tourist\u2026he thinks Bruges, in all it's medieval glory, is wonderful. Ray isn't so happy. Early in the movie he tells Ken, \"If I'd grown up on a farm and was retarded, Bruges might impress me, but I didn't, so it doesn't.\" When their boss, Harry, calls Ken and gives him an order things begin to get complicated. And the language gets even worse.\n\nColin Farrell is great as Ray, especially when he acts like a petulant little kid. In one scene Ken is playing tourist and trying to explain the significance of a church. Ray pouts on a pew, and makes noise by rattling chairs around. When Ken glares at him and tells him to stop, he slinks up to Ken, dragging his feet just like a little kid would.\n\nHere's another quote from Ray: \"Because, really hoped I wouldn't die. I really, really hoped I wouldn't die.\" Ray's hatred of Bruges is a recurring theme in the movie, and it's actually funny how much he loathes the town. Especially because they do a great job of showing Bruges' beauty. If you're a traveler, it'll make you want to plan to visit one day.\n\nThe movie has lots of blood, and lots of creative (and not so creative) swearing and politically incorrect language. Which probably says something about my maturity level. But in my defense, my mom liked it, too! So while I really enjoyed the movie, I have some reservations in telling anyone to go see it.

{"text": "Tuesday, July 1, 2008\n\nThe Man from Earth\n\nImagine if a man from the Stone Age was inexplicably gifted with immunity from aging, and just kept on living until the present. That's the premise of the The Man from Earth, which I watched last night on my laptop (with any feelings of guilt evaporated by the movie's producer, who has thanked people who've raised its profile by distributing it over the internet).\n\nThe movie tells the story of a man who was born 14,000 years ago and survives until the present day, currently living as a professor under the name John Oldman (note the clever pun!). He moves from place to place assuming various identities every 10 years or so, or whenever people start to notice that his appearance hasn't aged a day. When his colleagues throw an unexpected farewell party and pressure him to give an explanation for his sudden departure, he gives in and takes the risk of revealing his identity to the stunned group.\n\nA very clever premise! In fact, half of the appeal is in the concept, the idea of someone who's lived for thousands of years, an idea which they take and explore for 90 minutes. The entire movie takes place in a small house, and plays itself out through intelligent conversation among the group. Yes, they take that mind-blowing premise and milk it into a long conversation.\n\nPerhaps this would have been a very different movie if it had the proper budget of a major studio motion picture. But would it be better? Take, for instance, The Island, which took an awesome idea and buried it deep under thick layers of action and special effects. No, this movie isn't the slightest bit interested in the glitz and adrenaline. It just wants to take its idea and get you thinking about the possibilities. What if this guy was a disciple of Buddha? What if he was friends with Van Gogh? What if-- and this is the real bombshell-- what if he was Jesus? All this talk doesn't lead to anything significant, but it's fascinating with the way it tugs at the imagination in all sorts of directions.\n\nThe idea of taking an impossible concept and elucidating it to tickle the mind reminds me of The World Without Us, a \"speculative fiction\" book by Alan Weisman, exploring what would happen to the environment if the human race suddenly disappeared-- how houses would deteriorate, cities would crumble, and lifeforms would evolve on an Earth without people. Well, no I haven't actually read this book, but it's a very cool concept. Just think of it, and the conversation it could make."}

If there isn't already a cultural suspense genre, maybe this'll start it.\n\nDon Cheadle (\"Hotel Rwanda,\" \"Crash\") plays a Sudanese-born former U.S. Special Forces soldier named Samir Horn who has a talent for making things go boom. Caught making a deal with terrorists, he's thrown in a Yemeni prison where two things happen: He's interrogated by enlightened FBI agent Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce) and his old school smack-'em-around partner, Archer (Neal McDonough); and he becomes fast friends with a terrorist named Omar (Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui), who helps him escape. (Omar would be the Al Pacino in \"Mohammed Brasco.\")\n\nIf \"Traitor\" is like a \"Bourne\" movie in any respect at all, it's the globe-trotting, as the cat-and-mouse game between Horn and Clayton takes them to locations around the world. Gradually proving his way into the terrorist group through different bombings that all seem to have some kind of hitch in them, Horn is really working for a CIA contractor (Jeff Daniels) aiming for the terrorist bigwig before a major symbolic attack in the U.S. heartland.\n\nAs the first big American blockbuster movie I can think of with a devout Muslim hero, it may take an adjustment for some, but that's not what makes \"Traitor\" difficult. Filmmakers seem to err on the side of overcautiousness whenever it comes to depicting Middle Eastern bad guys \u2014 and hey, I remember covering a protest for 1998's \"The Seige\" by people who hadn't even seen it. \"Traitor\" is a much smarter, nervier and more complex movie, but it's still too by-the-numbers and didactic. For instance, Agent Clayton is a Middle East expert and clearly the only one out of all worldwide law enforcement who seems able to find his own backside with both hands. Just too stock, especially in his awkward dialogue with the more ignorant Archer.\n\nNot all Muslims are jihadist nutcases? Hey, thanks!\n\nSome of the people who don't like Americans might actually have valid reasons? Oh, stop, you!\n\nHaving said that, it's still the Southern-accented Clayton whom I'd rather see in a spinoff, like Tommy Lee Jones' character in \"The Fugitive,\" because the filmmakers barely give up enough about the tormented Horn to make you want to stick with him. It's not the character's ambiguity \u2014 the choices he makes to stay undercover, let alone a problematic final act that's supposed to be heroic. It's that he's too much of a ghost, and even a talent like Cheadle's can't bring out material that isn't there.\n\nFirst-time director Jeffrey Nachmanoff, known for \"The Day After Tomorrow\" script, wrote the screenplay. Of all people, Steve Martin came up with the idea. It is neither wild nor crazy."}

{"text": "127 Hours\n\nA young adventurer is navigating a crevice between two mountains of rock. He steps on the wrong thing, falls about 20 feet, and ends up with his right arm crushed underneath a boulder. He can't get out. No matter what he does, he is stuck. No one knows where he is, no one can hear him scream - there's probably not a soul around for many miles. All at once, his life expectancy is less than a week. He's going to run out of water and die.\n\nIn \"127 Hours,\" director Danny Boyle (\"Slumdog Millionaire\") tells the amazing true story of Aron Ralston, who didn't die but rather lived to write his memoirs ... with his left hand. How he got out is a matter of public record and is something virtually everyone will know going in, but knowing doesn't enhance the experience of the movie. It makes it even more excruciating. \"127 Hours,\" about an unimaginably unbearable experience, is pretty much an unbearable experience of its own. And yet, it must be said, it's exceptionally well made.\n\nBoyle takes a situation that's almost impossible to make cinematic: For about an hour of screen time, maybe more, James Franco as Aron is stuck under a rock. Aron wants to be any place but there, and so do we. Aron can't leave the rock, but we can easily get up and leave the theater. So Boyle employs memory sequences, fantasy sequences, breathtaking images of nature and perhaps a dozen shots so imaginatively conceived and framed that one can't help but feel awe at Boyle's visual mastery.\n\nThe problem is that \"127 Hours\" has the feeling of a film conceived for that very purpose, to be so static and lacking in narrative movement that there's nothing to notice but the director's flair. Boyle more or less keeps the enterprise from sinking, and yet for all his exertions, \"127 Hours\" is not exactly enjoyable. It's an ordeal for Aron and for the audience, too. Nor is the suffering worth it. The film does not have anything near a psychological or philosophical depth on a par with its visual inspiration.\n\nIt's just a story about a bad thing that happened to a happy-go-lucky goofball. He's an idiot when he gets stuck under the rock, but by the time he gets out, he's not an idiot anymore. He's not a hero, either, but he's tough as rock and has the guts of 10 men. This comes through in Franco's performance, but in a muted way, because he's not really Boyle's focus. Boyle's focus is his own virtuosity.\n\n\"127 Hours\" is sometimes agony to sit through, sometimes dull to sit through, and some shots so gruesome, so gory and horrifying, that many viewers will never see them. They'll avert their eyes. Still, hardly 10 minutes ever go by without Boyle showing us something extraordinary. Sometimes it's a shot of the sun breaking into the crevice and warming the rocks. In another case, it's an extended fantasy sequence, in which cascades of water rescue Aron, and he shows up at an ex-girlfriend's door, begging for help.\n\nBoyle does something remarkable with sound. Two or three times, when Aron experiences blinding, shrieking, inconceivable pain, Boyle shocks the audience with a loud, electric-buzzing sound that, in its harshness and suddenness - in the way it overwhelmingly becomes the only thing in the room - becomes a sonic analogue for pain. It's an impressive effect. When he's in pain, so are you.\n\nSo \"127 Hours\" is the work of a very talented person. But I can't imagine I'd have endured more than 30 minutes of it, were it not all in a day's work.\n\n-- Advisory: This film contains strong language - if a boulder fell on you, you wouldn't just say, \"Oh, fiddlesticks!\" - and horrible, disgusting, disturbing scenes of gore and terror.\n\nHow he got out is a matter of public record and is something virtually everyone will know going in, but knowing doesn't enhance the experience of the movie.\nBoyle takes a situation that's almost impossible to make cinematic:\n[...] Boyle employs memory sequences, fantasy sequences, breathtaking..."}

The Aviator was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, winning five, including one for actress Cate Blanchett. \u2013WikipediaI have a particular dislike of biopics because the vast majority of them use the same damn formula: get an actor to do an extended impression of the subject of the biopic, show the subject going through\u2026 read review"}

And most importantly, it limits itself to the most important years of its subject's life.\n\nBy focusing on Ed Wood's friendship with horror legend Bela Lugosi, the film wisely gets to both humanize Ed Wood and examine his outlandish personality, since those years coincided with the making of his most memorable films. We don't see Ed Wood as a child, and we don't see him as an old man. We see Ed Wood only as a crazy filmmaker, which is all we really need to see."}

His main adversary is Javsnooze (Russell Crowe), who hates him cause he's a better Australian singer than he'll ever be. One day, Snooze Valsnooze escapes and then finds asylum in a church, but then he steals stuff from the church, is caught, but the priest lies for Valsnooze, which makes no sense, unless the priest wanted to sleep with him, but he doesn't, cause he's not a small boy [PRIEST JOKES!!!!!!!!!!!!!]\n\nThen years pass and Snooze Valsnooze now has a new identity and owns some sort of sewing company that employees a comely but really poor Snoozetine (Anne Hathaway), who can't stop crying cause she has a daughter that she needs to feed, but needs a job to feed her, but she can't really do her job cause she can't stop crying, so basically she's the world's worst employee. Snoozetine gets fired (SHOCKER), so she sells her hair and her teeth and her body, and sings a song about dreaming and basically dies, then dies. Is this a dream or a nightmare??? Snooze Valsnooze feels bad that she died cause he's a thief with a heart of gold, and a voice of platinum!!!, so he takes Snoozetine's daughter Snoozesette (younger version played by Isabelle Allen & older version by Amanda Seyfried), but then Snooze Valsnooze has to run away cause Javsnooze smells his faux sewing ruse, so Snoozesette lands in the hands of Sweeney Todd and Mrs Lovett (Sacha Baron Cohen & Helena Bonham Carter, the only BRIGHT spot in 9 hours of dark and dreary bllllaaaaaahhhhhhhness), who are like slimy innkeepers who also sing cause the musical play theater play musical said they had to\n\nAnywho, Snooze Valsnooze returns to take his faux kid back from the comic relievers, and he does, and then Valsnooze and Snoozesette get new identities like 'Boring Valborings' & 'Boringsette', and then hide in some little Hobbit house in a graveyard or something. Then a fake French Revolution happens and that annoying redhead who faux bedded Marylin Monroe (Eddie Redmayne) sees Boringsette walking around Francetown and instantly falls in love with her, but he's being secretly loved by Sweeney Todd and Mrs Lovett's real daughter (Samantha Barks), but her story doesn't matter, even though she's hot, and how is it that that annoying redheaded guy has two women who want to bang him?? He's so lame that even his left hand refuses to beat him off\n\nAnywho, the half-assed revolution begins by the dirty French people throwing furniture into the streets, and then the army shoots all of them, cause the furniture pile is a giant mess. Most of the revolutionaries die (SPANK DAWG, cause it means the movie's closer to ending), but Boring Valborings saves that annoying redhead cause he knows that he would be a good person to bang his faux daughter Boringsette for eternity. Then he feels ashamed for some reason and disappears, and then Javsnooze reappears and is ashamed or something (mainly cause of his singing voice) so he kills himself, and then Boring Valborings dies, but right before he does, he gets to see Boringsette's face one last time (see below)\n\nThink that was what the movie was.

{"text": "Wow, that was certainly an experience. I haven't seen many of Lars von Trier's other movies, only Dancer in the Dark and Breaking the Waves, but I've seen enough to feel like I know what to expect (and I learned about him and the Dogme 95 movement in film school). Even so, this movie blew my expectations out of the water.\n\nDogville makes it clear from its opening scene that it doesn't care about a mainstream audience. My wife didn't watch more than 5 minutes before quitting. This was most likely because it lacks a traditional set, using what I would call instead a symbolic set. That places it into a more avant-garde or experimental camp. The entire story takes place in the town of Dogville, and its entire contents are laid out on a soundstage. Chalk lines on the ground demarcate the different buildings, and the only set pieces laid out on top of it are the pieces that bear some function in the story. I've never seen anything else like it.\n\nThis choice, combined with the voiceover narration, and its division into chapters makes the movie feel very much like a storybook. It also has symbolic meaning, as well. There are no walls, because each person knows every other one's business. You can't see anything outside the town, because the story focuses on the town itself. You never see the doors (though you hear them) because they don't matter. You do see their clothes, and certain set pieces, because they add character (and realistically, they have to wear something).\n\nThe story has it's charms, and kept me engaged throughout, although because it's a Lars von Trier movie, I had certain inklings about where it was going. His films excel at creating uneasiness. The ending, for me, ties it all together. I would never spoil it, but let me say it's a very unique happy ending."}

{"text": "Secrets and Lies: 'Adoration' - A Review\n\nAs thoughtful, calculated, somber and cold as a heavily footnoted term paper, \"Adoration\" is the first film by Canadian writer-director Atom Egoyan to get a Memphis theatrical booking since the heartbreaking \"The Sweet Hereafter\" in 1998.\n\nLike that earlier movie, \"Adoration\" could be described as an investigation of a tragedy, but in this case the disaster that inspires the drama is a mix of reality and fantasy, as a high school student (Devon Bostick) is encouraged by his sexy-eyebrowed Lebanese theater teacher (Egoyan's wife, the striking Arsinee Khanjian) to concoct a fact-based terrorism fable that circles back to bite its makers when it's accepted as true and goes viral via the Internet.\n\nIn his clumsy, incipient way, the student is a born storyteller, which is to say an artist. \"Why would you make people feel all those things if it wasn't even true?\" an angry adult asks the boy, and it's a question Egoyan seems to be directing at himself. Why does an artist create fantasy situations and characters to inspire feelings of sorrow, terror and joy? Is a fictional tale less worthy of our full emotional investment than a real-life report of horror? If it's not, is art dangerous?\n\nThe movie suggests many other Big Questions about religion, memory, family, purpose. A mysterious woman in a burka haunts the film, and the script contains evocative references to Bethlehem and 9/11. \"If every life was precious, the world would not be able to sustain itself,\" asserts one character.\n\nThe performances of the actors are impeccable, but their faces provide this rather dull and unconvincing story with its only visual interest.

{"text": "The Hurt Locker for Best Picture 2009!\n\nSeriously, if you haven't seen this movie, buy, borrow, or bootleg it by any means necessary. It's one of the best-directed, best-acted, and best-scripted films I've ever seen, and I say that without a shred of exaggeration. If the Academy still thinks James Cameron has more talent than Locker director Kathryn Bigelow (his ex-wife), he's probably paying them off.\n\nBut this isn't just a review of the movie. Locker is one of those rare Iraq War films that can't get panned for being Another Stupid Anti-War Movie. It effectively conveys the finer details of explosive ordinance disposal and the emotional side of combat with no needless preaching about the political reasons why Teh Warz is Evil OMG. (See also: Lions for Lambs, Stop-Loss, In the Valley of Elah, etc.)\n\nTo listen to Bill O'Reilly talk about movies like that, you'd think their core flaw is their left-wing position. That's not quite accurate. Their flaw is that they take one unyielding political position, emote about it for one hour, and demonize the other position for the second hour. Right-wing movies, however few and far between, are capable of doing the exact same thing and failing miserably at turning it into a decent screenplay, not to mention improving it a little with direction that isn't completely passive.\n\n\"But, Jess,\" you ask, \"don't you strongly prefer it when people delve into the political side of things? Isn't The Hurt Locker all imagery without making a point?\" First of all, it did make a point: that not everyone who participates in combat reacts to it in the same way, which I would take as a very important message. It never got up on any high horse and said, \"I am right, you are all wrong, and if you question me, I will ridicule you for all eternity.\"\n\nSecond of all, I like it when people delve into the political side the way The West Wing did, by engaging the policy aspect of each episode's issue. It may have subtly favoured Democrats, but it always treated Republicans with respect, except for the occasional caricatures. Doing this inspires serious debate with far less bias. Locker didn't do this, but again, that's because it's not a political movie (how most so-called \"war movies\" of today would be better identified).\n\nSo, if all you've been doing with this column is skimming over it, only paying attention to the long words (you jackass), let me sum up by saying this: The Hurt Locker does for Iraq what Saving Private Ryan did for the invasion of Normandy.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nWhy should the Hollywood backslappers consider a quality movie like that when they're already committed to handing James Cameron a slew of awards for a movie they hadn't even seen when they nominated it? I don't know why anyone still takes these film awards seriously. The level of bribery and insider trading that goes on is staggering."}

But there are misconceptions, such as Kapur's tale of an ageing diva (Julie Christie), a bell hop, and a bunch of violets; or Brett Ratner's ridiculous tale of a prom night virgin. Yvan Atal's encounter between a writer (Ethan Hawke) trying to pick up a glamorous stranger (Maggie Q) outside a restaurant works the form well, as does Mira Nair's tale of a young Hassidic Jewess talking with an Indian diamond trader on her wedding eve.

{"text": "Chronicle Reviews (2012)\n\nOne of the central tenets of both the X-Men comic books and the films spawned from them is that humans are terrified of mutants. Their special powers set them apart from the rest of humanity, and in many powerless human's minds, that makes them a threat. With X-Men, we generally tend to side with the mutant race, since they have Charles Xavier around to teach his X-Men about how to use their powers for the purposes of good. But what if Professor X weren't around to guide these young powerhouses? What if there were just a bunch of Magnetos, Juggernauts, and Pyros running around wreaking havoc on everything? Your opinion might differ slightly, then.\n\nChronicle attempts to address the idea of impressionable young minds suddenly emboldened by superhuman abilities in a more realistic, less blockbustery fashion. Its method is to delve into the suddenly extremely popular found footage genre, turning its tale of three teens of varying levels of angstiness whose lives are turned upside down by inexplicable telekinetic powers into something of a cross between X-Men: First Class and Cloverfield. It's actually kind of shocking that nobody had thought of it before. Even more shocking is how well Chronicle handles the challenges of its premise.\n\nInitially we meet Andrew (Dane DeHaan) and Matt (Alex Russell), two related suburban Seattle teenagers who are, for various reasons, something of social outcasts. Matt's handsome and not altogether disliked, but also highly invested in reading philosophy texts and quoting to others why this whole world is, like, bullshit, man. Andrew's issues are perhaps a bit more dire. His drunken father regularly abuses him, his sickly mother is on the verge of death, and he's little more than a creepy punching bag for the kids at school. For reasons that mostly seem to exist to carry the plot forward, Andrew begins filming everything around him, including a rave at an abandoned barn that Matt drags him to. Somewhere over the course of that night, they hook up with Steve (Michael B. Jordan), the star school athlete and soon-to-be class president, and find themselves on the outskirts of the property near a mysterious cave that pulses with both light and an imposing sound. See if you can guess what happens next.\n\nYes, the introduction to all of this is contrived as hell. Thankfully, first time director Josh Trank and screenwriter Max Landis (son of John Landis) don't spend much more time trying to explain away why any of this is any of this. Suffice it to say, mysterious things have suddenly turned them into something other than merely human. It starts off small, with them simply tossing baseballs at each other and playing minor pranks on people--that poor girl who suddenly found herself facing a floating, seemingly sentient teddy bear is probably scarred for life--but soon they begin to realize that the more they use their powers, the stronger they get. It's not long before they're learning how to use telekinesis to stop objects from penetrating their bodies, and flying through the sky like bro-dude supermen.\n\nThere is perhaps no greater truth than the innate understanding that to everyone but teenagers themselves, teenagers are insufferable creatures that deserve little more than scorn and disdain. Watching realistic teenager behavior is like watching monkeys in the wild fling shit at one another. It's maybe a little bit interesting from an anthropological perspective, but you'll be glad to keep your distance from it.\n\nCredit to both Landis' script and the actors portraying these teens then that you don't find yourself hating them as the movie goes along--except when you're very clearly supposed to. As angsty and overwrought as their behavior can get, they never veer too far into the unlikable category. Their journey of discovery (and eventual conflict) is an entertaining ride that, at times, actually feels pretty authentic. Landis' script has a good sense of the way teenagers think, which is to say that self-gratification tends to take precedence over responsibility or rational thinking. He crafts a number of ridiculous but fun scenarios for them to both come to grips with new abilities, and suddenly realize they have no idea what they're actually doing. When they're flying around in the sky, it seemingly never occurs to them that, hey, an airplane might come tearing through there at some point and knock them back on their hovering asses. The consequences of their powers aren't lost on them, but in an effort to amuse themselves, and even help Andrew become a bit more popular, they aren't opposed to showing off a bit to impress their classmates.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the honeymoon doesn't last. Andrew's grim home life and tortured school life seem like ripe fodder for him to go Columbine times a thousand at just about any moment, and eventually his darker urges take over. He begins comparing his abilities to nature's food chain, and other humans as lower forms of life to be squashed. He scowls, broods, and obliterates with reckless abandon, leading to a showdown between he and Matt in downtown Seattle that combines the chaos and insanity of Cloverfield's better action sequences with a live action rendition of the end of Akira.\n\nThe trick, of course, is how Trank chooses to capture all of this. In order to keep up the found footage gimmick, Landis' script has Andrew keeping the camera with him at just about all times, even sometimes having it float above him as he goes about his business. But what about when Andrew isn't around? Landis inserts a minor love interest for Matt, a pretty blonde (Ashley Hinshaw) who also has a penchant for filming random things, purportedly for her blog. And when she isn't around, Trank darts between security cam footage, cop car cameras, and whatever else might be in the vicinity to edit together his more fast-paced action sequences into something surprisingly compelling. It's also pretty hokey and ridiculous, and requires a good bit of suspension of disbelief to completely buy into. But if you're capable of bringing your brain past that one particularly formidable barrier to entry, you'll likely enjoy what Chronicle has to offer."}
{"text": "A successful ad executive actually stole the identity of a dead man. A war hero is actually a terrorist. At first blush, FX's The Americans, about two Soviet spies undercover as a Virginia couple in 1981, seems to share elements of each of these antihero shows, along with less celebrated series like The Riches. But maybe the greatest success of the show so far is that, after three increasingly strong episodes, it has a voice and a (secret) identity of its own. One thing that distinguishes this Cold War story from its predecessors is that there are two protagonists perpetuating a fiction, against another country, against their neighbors, against their own children\u2013even, to an extent, against each other. So as much as The Americans is the thriller you'd expect\u2013tense, well-paced and laced with well-curated period detail\u2013it's also an intriguing study of marriage as partnership. Reversing the common order of things, The Americans asks whether marital routine can develop into actual love. Certainly the relationship of Elizabeth (Keri Russell) and Philip Jennings (Matthew Rhys) is more complicated than that of the average husband and wife who happen to be co-workers. The two were paired as young KGB agents in the 1960s, taught immaculate English (and hand-to-hand combat) and sent to the U.S. to live as husband and wife. They've put down roots, blended in to the suburbs and are raising two very American children. (When their son describes a school project about the moon landing, Elizabeth answers defensively, \"You know, the moon isn't everything.

Their actual work involves the occasional night of violence or seducing strategically placed government employees. (In a gesture of egalitarianism, both Philip and Elizabeth get a chance to"}

{"text": "Review: 'My Life So Far' is barely there\n\n(CNN) -- Hugh Hudson's \"My Life So Far\" is a well-meaning, amiable little movie you've seen maybe 30 times before, even if you've never seen it. This is one of those \"I grew up in an eccentric family\" testimonials in which a man reminisces in voice-over as we watch him cavort through his idealized childhood.\n\n\"My Life So Far\" is set on an estate in Scotland, but it could take place in Bora-Bora and it would contain the same string of characters and the same life-defining \"wacky\" situations.\n\nStory-wise, you get a pinch of everything, from the starry-eyed vision of childhood in \"Hope and Glory\" to the obsession with aviation and budding sexuality of \"The World According to Garp.\" The characters are also exactly what you're expecting. There's even a sage old grandma whose death engenders the collapse of the family.\n\nIt's likely that none of the similarities are intentional, since the narrative is based on a memoir (\"Son of Adam\") by British television honcho Sir Denis Forman.\n\nBut Hudson's film never manages to make an appearance. It's like he's cooking something up in the other room; it smells pretty good, but you'll just have to imagine the meal. And, for a movie that's supposed to deal with big human emotions, it's benign to a fault. There's nothing here to hate, but you'd have to work pretty hard to fall in love with it.\n\nNothin' says lovin' ...\n\nRobert Norman stars as Fraser Pettigrew, the little tyke who leads us through his supposedly eventful formative years. Fraser and his family live on a beautiful estate owned by his wealthy grandmother, Gamma (Rosemary Harris). Fraser's father, Edward (Colin Firth), is viewed as a bit of a nut by Gamma and his stiff-upper-lip brother, Morris (Malcolm McDowell).\n\nRich-but-practical Morris would be pleased if Edward could come up with a better income-generating scheme than the one he's currently wasting his time on, namely digging up moss around the estate and selling it by the bag full. It doesn't make the family much money, plus it ruins the grounds.\n\nEdward is always building crazy things like a paddle-driven flotation device and an underground chimney that funnels smoke away from his peat-processing plant. If that doesn't make you fall over in hysterics, you can bet nothing else in the movie will, outside of a couple of innocently sexual one-liners from the oblivious Fraser. There's also a nail-biting curling match for sports enthusiasts.\n\nNothing much happens for quite a while, including an unexpected visit from a barnstorming French biplane pilot (Tch\u00e9cky Karyo). Don't' be concerned if you're wondering why the pilot shows up, makes eyes at Fraser's sister, then flies away without her. It's all clarified later on when he shows up again, makes eyes again, and flies away again.\n\nIt seems like half of what happens is included for its \"whimsical\" nature (the sight of a plane unexpectedly dropping out of the sky), rather than for any constructive purpose. Even the pivotal event of the story, when Edward falls for his brother's pretty fianc\u00e9e, Heloise (Ir\u00e8ne Jacob), plays for its entirety as if it's just getting started.\n\nTo begin with, Heloise as written is hardly enticing enough to make an apparently happy man turn his back on his loving wife (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, for some reason.) There aren't any big scenes between Firth and Mastrantonio before Jacob shows up, so you have no reason to suspect that Pop might want to stray. You can't even tell that the newcomer is affecting Edward, outside of his being happy to show a pretty woman around the estate and brag about his lame-brained inventions.\n\nHeloise just smiles a lot and playfully throws peat at Fraser, but it's somehow enough to turn Edward into a complete ninny. He pouts and slouches around like a 6-year-old after Heloise rebuffs his attempt to kiss her.\n\nIn the end, it all amounts to very little, and that's being generous. This is the least crazy movie you could ever hope to see about people who are trumpeted as oddballs.\n\nThere's no bad language in \"My Life So Far,\" and no actual nudity. You do get to see some erotic etchings that Fraser discovers in the attic, and he makes a few remarks about the history of prostitution at the dinner table. Look in your encyclopedia under \"Who cares?\" Rated PG-13. 93 minutes."}

Its not even a character study as much as just a study of the idea of addiction. Its sex addiction, because drugs and alcohol seem too specific unto themselves. Also, there's a bit of a misconception that sex addiction isn't real. This amazing film shows, not so much the horror of addiction, but the pure misery of it. Because it is sex, which can and should be enjoyable, that is making someone miserable is very effective. The best part is the dynamic between him and his sister. Just her existence, and knowing that she has her own brand of screwed up-ness going on, tells us all we need to know about their childhoods. Simple and powerful. And generally amazing!!"}

David Lean's British film, adapted from No\u00ebl Coward's one-act play Still Life, takes as its center a maybe-love affair, in which two people spend as much time as they can together in person. All told, it isn't that much\u2014some time out in town, a trip to the cinema, a tea. But it seems like much more because there's another heard-but-not-seen film running alongside it, inside the constant head of the married woman (Celia Johnson), adulterous in thought, imagining in breathless voiceover everything that she and her possible lover could be. He's a stiff, slim doctor (Trevor Howard) with a strong sense of the moment, knows what's proper and improper in public. Her large eyes look towards him, and her face's flesh seems to rise. \"No, no, I don't want that time to come ever,\" she thinks. \"I want to remember every minute, always, always to the end of my days.\"\n\nThey're sitting at a table at the train station. \"We've still got a few minutes,\" he says, and then they're interrupted; a loud woman, an acquaintance, but still basically a stranger, sits at their table and starts chattering away. There's no way that she knows what they mean to each other\u2014how could she?\u2014and he stands up. There's been a terrible possibility floating quietly throughout the film, which is that two peoples' mutual belief isn't mutual at all: They might not mean the same to each other, each one's thoughts might be different from the other's, and that might be the real, deeper reason that they'll end up alone. We don't know what he thinks, just what she hopes he thinks. Time is passing, life changing. Then he softly places his hand on her shoulder, which here at this time can mean nothing, or worlds."}

{"text": "With six different plot threads twined together, Cloud Atlas is as lofty-minded as the title suggests. Based on another so-called unfilmable novel - this one by British author David Mitchell even used a different literary style for each subplot - the book and movie both tackle big spiritual ideas. But the film's grand conceit in the clouds is not quite supported by the Atlas weight of its interwoven stories.\n\nMonumental enough to require three directors, Tom Tykwer and the Wachowski siblings, Andy and Lana (formerly Larry), the epic is as difficult to explain as Inception, spanning past, present and future linking characters and themes that seemingly have no connections. They include a noble abolitionist on an ocean crossing journey in the 19th century, a 1920s homosexual composer who commits suicide, a 70s journalist working on a nuclear reactor story, a modern day book publisher who gets into debt, a futuristic Seoul with cloned slaves and an even farther along future on a Pacific island (though it looks more like a primitive past) with spaceships and shamans.\n\nThe other well publicised gambit of the production required its stars (Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent and others) to play numerous characters crossing race, gender and age. Why? Because it's part of its earnest theme about karma and how we are all interdependent through time, space and causality. \"Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others past and present,\" says one character and the phrase is repeated into a mantra. Think of Cloud Atlas as Crash with metaphysics and time travel.\n\nAs stories crisscross, conjuncted by details like shared birthmarks and journals and writings of one character that another in a different period reads, the cumulative episodic effect is less cinematic transcendence than overwhelmed distraction. In short, it's hard to focus on the forest if you're constantly thinking about one tree's relation to another.\n\nThe multi-role device is also quite distracting. As an audience, you end up thinking \"Look, it's Tom Hanks as a cockney gangster! And isn't that Hugh Grant as a marauder with face paint? Wow, is that really mainland star Zhou Xun as a white woman with dirty blonde hair?\" Just as jarring are the future Hawaii segments with Hanks and Berry jiving it up in a Jar Jar Binks' patois. Some of the humour is intentional, such as Hugo Weaving in drag as a nasty nurse in an old-age home. There's also a priceless and demented Soylent Green reference.\n\nIt's not that Cloud Atlas is a terrible movie. Far from it. It's a noble failure that aims high but falls very short.\n\nAt 172 minutes, it could use a judicious edit of entire scenes and story lines to refine its trans-generational Kumbaya chorus of fate, truth, freedom and love.\n\nBy the way, the whole controversy of white actors given Asian facial prosthetics becomes an ironic joke since Zhou and South Korean actress Bae Doo-na have such huge eyes. They make Hugo Weaving and other non-Asian cast members' squinty slants that much more embarrassing."}
{"text": "Salute Your Shorts: Debra Granik's \"Snake Feed\"\n\nSalute Your Shorts is a weekly column that looks at short films, music videos, commercials or any other short form visual media that generally gets ignored.\n\nAlthough we didn't cover it in our 2010 Sundance roundup, one of the films we noted to watch out for was Debra Granik's Winter's Bone. The movie took away Sundance's Grand Jury Prize, won several awards at the Berlin Festival and has been picking up critical raves since its first screening. Unfortunately, despite the accolades it's being released by small indie-distributor Roadside Attractions, which doesn't have the money to try and make this festival darling into a big hit. Unless you really follow Sundance, you're probably unaware that the movie landed in limited theaters last Friday.\n\nThis is too bad, as Debra Granik is an example of what Sundance is really all about. Although major studios have been using the festival as a marketplace since Steven Soderbergh's Sex, Lies, and Videotape blew up in 1989, it's essentially supposed to be about fostering young filmmakers' voices. Granik's latest project is only her most recent success at Sundance, but the festival has been supportive of her throughout her career. Her feature debut Down to the Bone won the festival's Special Jury Prize, which helped it gain distribution, and even that was in fact an expansion of her first film short, which won Granik the short filmmaking award.\n\nThat first film was \"Snake Feed,\" which Granik made shortly after finishing her masters at the Tisch School of Arts at NYU. Like Down to the Bone, it focuses on a woman trying to raise her family despite a drug addiction. In the feature, the film's protagonist in fact spends the movie itself dealing with this problem, making it into a sort of counterpart to Half Nelson. The short that inspired it, the aforementioned \"Snake Feed,\" is in fact fairly different form this despite the part it had in making Down to the Bone possible.\n\n\"Snake Feed\" stars Corinne Stralke as Irene, who, unlike her counterpart, played by Vera Farmiga (Up in the Air), is in fact finished with her drug addiction. Although she was previously hooked on drugs, she's currently off of them and trying to go straight while raising her two children. The film's conflict is simple: she finds out that Rick,who's either her boyfriend or husband, it's not particularly clear, is dealing again, and she doesn't want anything to do with this. She initially confronts him, but he claims it's a very small-time business. She briefly believes him, but when a customer of his returns, it's clear that this isn't the case and she vacuums up his drugs. The film ends on an ambiguous note, where Irene is still struggling with what to do with both Rick and herself.\n\nAdmittedly \"Snake Feed\" isn't the most original work. This is the type of depressing drama that Sundance and other festivals have accustomed us to by now, and even its lack of any real resolution can come off as a cliche. The beauty of the short is how Granik approaches the subject and treats her characters, who are delicately balanced into more than just a typical case of art film lost causes.\n\nGranik's M.O. is indebted to the style of kitchen-sink drama that's become the specialty of contemporary British cinema, a follow-up to the Angry Young Men of the 1950s and 1960s who tried to revolutionize British filmmaking but fell out of fashion almost as they gained success. This is best characterized by films by Ken Loach, Mike Leigh or Andrea Arnold, who've used modern technology to their advantage in telling realistically-drawn stories. The unfortunate part of their style, though, is their tendency towards metaphorical proselytizing. In this sort of cinema, it's become common for a reoccurring concept to scream out symbolism in a way that draws away from their realism. While the camera may be handheld, the writing is frequently overwrought and shrill.\n\nWith \"Snake Feed,\" Granik sets out to copy this sort of filmmaker but with a different type of writing. Admittedly, Granik's dialogue tends toward extreme stylization, but her narrative is much looser. Of the film's 23 minutes, only half or so compose the plot, which is obviously quite loose in any case. The other half is characters being themselves, talking to one another and living life without having the narrative forced upon them. While in some filmmakers' hands this would be tedious, Granik has such a natural sense of pacing and has chosen good enough actors that the documentary realism of things so entracing the lack of a tight plot doesn't detract. It's fascinating simply watching the characters be who they are.\n\nSo \"Snake Feed\"'s meandering, elliptical story is in fact more interesting than a lot of the tighter ones more frequently told in short films. What it does right is picking out characters who feel true, and if they're real enough their situations are less important. It's just nice that Granik decided to expand things into a feature. \"Snake Feed\" is an extra on the DVD for Down to the Bone and like its accompanying films is well worth the time. Hopefully Winter's Bone will surprise me with its success and we'll see Granik get the support to continue making her unique brand of Southern gothic realistic films more than once every five years."}

Shot in black and white on a dinky $60,000 budget, the movie follows a math whiz (Gullette) who's obsessively hunting for a pattern in the seemingly random numbers of the stock market. As he feverishly calculates away, both a Wall Street firm and a breakaway Hasidic sect whose members believe God is in the numbers, try to force Gullette into sharing his research. It's all very intense, and, as pi progresses, ever more dismaying as it becomes clear that what we are witnessing is less a mathematical breakthrough than a mental breakdown. What's most startling and impressive about pi is how first-time filmmaker Darren Aronofsky has found a surrealistic visual vocabulary (an ant in a computer, a hand dripping blood, a pulsating brain) to convey both intellectual overdrive and madness, pi is not for the squeamish.

They plan an escape, but his friend dies, and Edmund escapes alone, with a map showing the location of a treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. He meets up with pirates and ultimately finds the treasure, enabling him to return in a new persona, the Count of Monte Cristo, where he will prove that \"revenge is a dish that is best eaten cold.\"\n\nThe script falters, with some clunky dialogue and a Hollywood-ized ending that Dumas fans will find overly convenient. But the performances (especially Pearce, descending from pettiness to decadence and complete corruption), the swordplay, the splendor, and the story, featuring what is probably literature's all-time best revenge fantasy are old-time-movie satisfying and lots of fun.\n\nParents should know that the movie features PG-13-style peril and swordfights and characters are wounded and killed. Edmund is beaten in prison by a sepulchral warden who clearly enjoys torturing the prisoners. Though it is not explicitly shown, we hear screams and we see his extensive scars. A character attempts suicide and there is a suggestion that suicide is an honorable way to respond to discovery of dishonor. There is a non-explicit sexual situation, references to adultery and a child conceived out of wedlock. Omitted from the movie are the book's depiction of character's use of opium and a concubine.\n\nFamilies who see this movie should talk about what made Fernand turn from Edmund's friend into his enemy. Why did it make Fernand angry that Edmund was \"happier with his whistle than (he) was with his pony?\" How do we see that Edmund is at first too trusting and then not trusting enough? What does it mean to say, \"treason is a matter of dates?\" What does it mean to say, \"perhaps the thoughts of revenge are serving God's purpose of keeping you alive?\" Or that \"neglect becomes our ally?\" How did hope change Edmund's attitude during his beatings? Why does he want to hold on to his hatred? How does Edmund determine the revenge that will be most painful for each of his foes?\n\nFamilies who enjoy this movie will also enjoy \"The Three Musketeers,\" also based on a Dumas novel. There are even more versions of that story on film than there are of this one, but the 1948 (starring Gene Kelly) and 1973 (directed by Richard Lester) versions are the best"}

There wasn't anything that extreme.\n\nI hadn't intended to watch this movie when I did.

{"text": "Under London\n\nDirty Pretty Things (rated R for sexual content, disturbing images, and bad language) is a gritty thriller set among struggling immigrants in London. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Okwe, a Nigerian illegal holding down two demanding jobs-he's a cabbie during the day and a hotel desk clerk at night.\n\nWhen Okwe finds time for sleep, it's on a couch in a small, dingy flat rented by Senay (Amelie's Audrey Tautou), a Turkish immigrant working illegally at the same hotel. There are seeds of a friendship-and perhaps more-between the two, but they work opposite shifts, so their paths cross only briefly each day. This routine is interrupted by an alarming, exceedingly unpleasant discovery in the hotel's plumbing. Okwe soon learns that a black-market industry hides beneath the surface of the well-appointed London hotel.\n\nThe movie realistically, sometimes graphically, portrays immigrant life. Okwe and Senay's illegal status makes them easy prey, but it's interesting to note that their abusers are primarily other immigrants who have reached some position of authority. Dirty Pretty Things exists in a London unseen by most, with the film avoiding shots of Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, or anything else that might show up on a postcard.\n\nDirty Pretty Things deserves a strong R. The more brutal images in the film, although almost never explicit, are still disturbing. Even what is implied is often hard to take, particularly as Senay faces sexual abuse by several employers. But the best scenes in the film show Okwe, by contrast, exhibiting a quiet resolve, intelligence, and compassion that guide him through this grimy underworld."}

{"text": "Shuji (Hidetoshi Nishijima), the central character in Amir Naderi's Cut, is a figure not unknown to anyone likely to see the film in America. He lives alone, in an apartment wallpapered with lobby cards and movie stills. He hosts screenings on his roof, running prints of Keaton and Ford films. He reverentially visits the tombs of Kurosawa, Ozu, Mizoguchi. And he walks the streets with a bullhorn, shouting pronouncements of the dire state of cinema. \"The artistic side of cinema is dying! Most of today's movies are simply made to entertain!\" he seethes. \"They have no right to extinguish pure cinema!\" He has attempted to contribute to the art himself, but his films thus far have only managed to lose the money provided to Shuji by his brother, a yakuza enforcer. Then Shuji finds out that those debts were never repaid--and his brother has been killed. He has inherited the balance of the debt, over 12 million yen. He has two weeks to make it right. The threatening man who gives him that information doesn't say what will happen at the end of that two weeks. He doesn't have to; there's a head-sized box on his desk.\n\nThere's something rather delicious about this set-up, in which the movie-crazy aesthete finds himself in a remarkably cinematic situation, and--one would think--must find a definitively real-world solution. Instead, Naderi's uses it as a realization of the all-too-commonly invoked notion of suffering for one's art--and drawing strength from it. This is not metaphorical suffering and strength; the scheme that Shuji stumbles into, somewhat accidentally, is to offer himself up as a paid punching bag for the various gangsters and gamblers that work for and with the organization. He gets paid by the punch. At first, he lets them punch anywhere, but it quickly becomes clear that he won't last long doing that. So he charges five thousand yen per body blow, and takes the abuse. And takes it, and takes more.\n\nAs he subjects himself to the punishment, he reminds himself of what it is worth, what he is paying off (the films he made) and what he is preserving (the life ahead of him--one in which, presumably, he will watch and make more movies). At first, he mutters trivia to himself. Later, when the going gets tougher, he hypes himself up and keeps himself going with a contemptuous cry of \"shit movies!\" He visualizes himself as the art, of the purity; he takes the punches of crass commerce.\n\nIf it sounds a little silly, blame the messenger--there's all sorts of ways to read what's happening here, and it's the kind of film that allows interpretation without insisting on it. If it sounds brutal and ugly, well, it is (a little, anyway), but it's not a cheap or exploitative picture; Naderi is a classicist, using deliberate pacing and unconventional rhythms early on to soften viewers up and acclimate them to his speed. His compositions are dynamic but clean, carefully arranged within his mostly locked frames (camera movements are deliberate and purposeful).\n\nSome of the stylistic touches don't quite play, like the switches to black and white during those tomb visits, a ponderous shot of a punching bag during the first beating session, or the puzzling cutaways to aerial city shots during a particularly desperate fight scene. But for the most part, the picture is technically masterful, and shows a remarkable visual efficiency.\n\nIt probably gives little away to hint that the scheme goes down to the wire, with a heavily battered Shuji finally determining that one last day of sheer hell, one final pummeling that will risk his life, is a small price to pay. \"I want to live! I want to make films!\" he insists--finding, in art, the very will to live. And thus is constructed Cut's most electrifying sequence, in which he wagers that the can take 100 punches and survive. To push himself through, he ticks off his 100 favorite films (a task any movie lover relishes), which are seen as text on screen as the pounding progresses. And then Naderi does something really interesting: he takes the sound effects out, and lays in that bullhorn audio, those announcements of what he's (literally) fighting for, which compliment the examples of it in the titles and names on screen. It all comes together--thought it seems at first a gimmick, he's actually creating a manifesto film, something borderline Godardian. And he's creating an additional cause for rooting interest: thought the list is supposed to be \"in no particular order,\" he's clearly ranking at least the top slots, and we're really want to see what his top ten is--even more, perhaps, then we want to see him survive. Cold blooded? No, just cinematically curious. Something tells me Shuji would understand"}
{"text": "No related\n\nLet's be clear about this from the start: Gaspar No\u00e9's Irr\u00e9versible isn't for everyone, to put it mildly. Of the 24 entries in our Inventory \"Great Films Too Painful To Watch Twice,\" it's to my mind the most extreme and difficult to sit through, a rape-revenge thriller that's deliberately calculated to attack the nervous system and keep viewers in a near-constant state of queasy disorientation. It has as its centerpiece a nine-minute, single-take rape scene that's as horrifying to witness as anything I can recall seeing in a theater; and since it unfolds in reverse chronology, the \"happy ending\" feels nearly as sadistic, because we know what happens in the future. No\u00e9 has been called a \"punk nihilist,\" and like any good punk, his work deconstructs and alienates; it's safe to imagine him agreeing with John Waters' famed sentiment that someone puking during one of his movies is like a standing ovation. (Waters himself called Irr\u00e9versible \"the most shocking movie I ever saw in my life\" and, amusingly, \"the worst date movie in the history of cinema.\")\n\nBefore I finally caught up with Irr\u00e9versible at the 2002 Toronto Film Festival, it existed as an urban legend as much as a movie. Earlier in the year, the film premi\u00e8red to uproar at Cannes, where more than half the black-tied legions stuffed into the massive Lumi\u00e8re theater reportedly walked out in disgust. So when I sat down at the late, lamented Uptown 1 Theater\u2014at the time, the festival's non-Gala equivalent to the Lumi\u00e8re in terms of seating and screen size\u2014there was a palpable feeling of dread among many in the audience. (At least among those who had read up on it. Others just peeling off another coupon from their ticket package were woefully unprepared.) And as jaded as untold thousands of movies have made me, and as firmly as I braced myself for it, watching Irr\u00e9versible remains one of the rare cases where the experience itself was worse than anything my imagination could conjure.\n\nThe first impulse after seeing Irr\u00e9versible is to take a shower, literally and metaphorically, but it isn't a movie that's so easily washed away. While I would never begrudge anyone for simply not having the stomach for it, I think the mass revulsion that greeted it from many quarters was too hasty and ill-considered. Too many critics found it enough to simply write off No\u00e9 as a sadist and a homophobe who tries to couch a reprehensible vision in facile, pretentious philosophizing. Though I would describe my own opinion of the film as strongly ambivalent, I bristle at the then-prevailing wisdom that it was worthless and beneath discussion merely because it isn't pleasant to experience. There's actually a lot going on in No\u00e9's bold provocation, so let's drop an Alka-Seltzer and dig in.\n\n(At this point, those who haven't seen Irr\u00e9versible\u2014and aren't scared off by the prospect\u2014are advised to take leave. I wouldn't want to spoil the beginning for you.)\n\nDivided into 12 scenes, Irr\u00e9versible unfolds from the end to the beginning, opening with an aged Philippe Nahon, as \"The Butcher\" from No\u00e9's nasty debut feature I Stand Alone, voicing regret for the life he's lived. \"Time destroys everything,\" he says. From there, No\u00e9's film sets out to put that thesis into action. Primed to maximum disorientation, the first 15 minutes are a near-literal descent into hell, with swirling camera movements and oppressive, bass-heavy sound effects that turn the stomach before the images even have a chance to shock. Hell, in this case, is a fetishistic gay nightclub called \"The Rectum,\" where Vincent Cassel searches frantically for the man who raped and pummeled his girlfriend Monica Bellucci earlier in the evening. Though his friend Albert Dupontel\u2014who, importantly, turns out to be Bellucci's ex\u2014pleads for Cassel to come to his senses, the search ends with an act of unbelievable violence, which retroactively becomes the first of many cruel ironies to come.\n\nIt isn't until later\u2014or in this case, earlier\u2014that we find out the context for Cassel' deranged quest for revenge. Until that point, he simply seems out of his mind, spewing epithets and shaking down people for information with a fists-first approach that would shame Mike Hammer. Seeing him behave like this before we know why is an effective strategy for No\u00e9, who wants to show the breakdown of order and the deterioration of the rational mind. When we finally learn what happened to Bellucci, it explains Cassel's actions without necessarily justifying them, which is an important distinction to make, and one I'll get into in a bit. Our first encounter with Bellucci is maybe the saddest moment in the film: As Cassel and Dupontel leave a party, they come upon her laid out unconscious on a gurney, her face bloodied and lacerated nearly beyond recognition. And then just one quick cut into the past, she's Monica Bellucci, one of the world's most beautiful women, looking stunning in a silky, skin-tight party dress.\n\nBy the time the infamous rape scene happens, the movie has gone through a reel or so, and it's worth pointing out that the majority of the walkouts\u2014at least at my screening, and I suspect at others, too\u2014have already occurred. For 20 minutes, No\u00e9 has ground the audience down with his vertigo-inducing 720\u00b0 camera movements and low-frequency soundtrack, courtesy of Daft Punk's Thomas Bangalter. Now he follows Bellucci into a symbolically loaded red tunnel beneath the city, where she crosses paths with a vicious pimp (Jo Prestia) who pins her down at knifepoint, sexually assaults her, then smashes her face in for good measure. In contrast to the visual and aural pyrotechnics that preceded it, No\u00e9 bolts the camera to the floor for the seemingly endless duration of this horrific act, and with the help of special effects\u2014not to mention the fearless contributions of Bellucci and Prestia\u2014he gets the whole incident in one take.\n\nThere's only one proper reaction to the rape scene in Irr\u00e9versible, and that's revulsion. Opinions vary widely over whether it's necessary or gratuitous, and I can sympathize with those who resent No\u00e9 for including a scene this potent in a movie that can't support it. A few have speculated that No\u00e9 is somehow appealing to extreme misogynists who might take pleasure in seeing a woman abused, but that's nearly impossible for me to take seriously; there's nothing to take away from what happens to Bellucci other than abject horror, pure and simple. What we witness is needless destruction, and it's a stretch for people to speculate that No\u00e9 is appealing to the sickos just because they personally find his film empty and his motivations suspect.\n\nThe other, more legitimate concern is over the film's alleged homophobia, which I have trouble defending. Bellucci's assailant tells her that he doesn't normally go for women, and indeed, he frequents The Rectum, where keen-eyed viewers will notice, likely on second viewing, that he manages to sidestep Cassel' revenge plot. In one important sense, No\u00e9 needs to make it clear that the assailant's actions have nothing to do with sexuality and everything to do with man's power to destroy, and having Prestia be a heterosexual might make that distinction impossible. And yet I have trouble denying the film's depiction of gay men as the height of filth and depravity, based on the rape scene and the long descent into the nightclub. Contrast that with a blissful bedroom scene later in the film, with Bellucci and Cassel frolicking in a hetero paradise, and that impression is confirmed. Some of the film's most ardent defenders have talked of The Rectum as a place of ambiguous sexuality, but I just can't see it.\n\nThere are other things about Irr\u00e9versible that bother me, too, like the too-neat ironies and foreshadowing (or \"postshadowing,\" as my colleague Noel Murray called it) that its reverse structure allows. Having Bellucci's assailant on the sidelines while Cassel and Dupontel go after the wrong man in The Rectum effectively underlines the futility of revenge, but having the man's face pummeled in much the same manner as Bellucci's is a little pat. So too is a scene later (earlier) in the bedroom when Cassel floats the idea of anal sex to Bellucci, and she scoffs it away, when we know she'll be submitting to it involuntarily. And then there are the sick what-might-have-been scenarios at the party: Would Bellucci have been raped had a drunk, coked-up Cassel not driven her away with his loutish behavior? What if she had listened to Dupontel on the way out, when he warned her it was too dangerous to leave alone? When a story is told backward, hindsight is definitely 20/20.\n\nIn spite of these serious reservations, though, Irr\u00e9versible is extraordinarily ambitious and accomplished in other ways. For one, the backward timeline makes the strongest imaginable argument against vigilantism. As the title suggests, there's no going back in this life: Revenge doesn't change what's happened. What is tarnished and ripped apart cannot be made whole again.\n\nIt's little like the \"remote control\" moment in Funny Games stretched out to feature length, only it's No\u00e9 holding the clicker; he presses the rewind button and offers the fantasy of acts being undone, but we as viewers are acutely aware that time doesn't move in that direction. Cassel' quest for blood doesn't change anything but himself and Dupontel, who's goaded into an act of violence that eradicates his hyper-rational nature.\n\nBy going in reverse, Irr\u00e9versible also gives a deeper sense of what's lost, underlined by the crushing revelation in the final scene. In No\u00e9's mind, time is a journey from purity and innocence to degradation and corruption, and there's nothing a person can do to turn back the clock. However, there's another, more radical way of looking at it that's improbably bittersweet: Since No\u00e9's timeline goes from hell to heaven, darkness to light, rape to un-rape, he's really offering a dream that things could be different, our humanity could be restored, and paradise could be attainable. (As my friend, Cyprus Mail critic Theo Panayides, eloquently put it, the film is \"reaching for a tranquil Eden forever lost.\") Those final images of Bellucci, looking radiant on the impossibly green park grass with children playing and Beethoven's Seventh swelling on the soundtrack, can make viewers forget, just for a moment, that transcendence is possible. Such is the power of the movies."}
{"text": "Pages\n\nSunday, December 18, 2011\n\nReview: Shame\n\nWhat you know about Shame is that it's an NC-17 portrait of a sex addict. To a teenager (or those who have never watched an Almodovar film) the taboo rating signifies something immediately forbidden. There will be nudity, there will be sex that somehow qualifies as \"more adult\" than the MPAA's R-rating. In all likelihood: there will be boobs. It's true. But, you know, where aren't there boobs? So, the thing is that there will also be a penis flopping about somewhere. If you're lucky, it won't belong to Harvey Keitel. What gets overlooked, often times, is that simple body parts do not an NC-17 rating warrant. In the case of Shame, and, in my experience, the case of a great deal of NC-17 'serious' films (versus 'unrated'), anatomy is sullied. Sexualized content is rarely sexy. It will be somehow dirtied up, plot relevant, and often horribly unpleasant. What this really means, apparently, is that when an NC-17 film actually makes it into a theater, the combination of these elements will prove a great annoyance. Personally? I was carded multiple times before the film started, the theater management felt the need to post detailed warnings as far out as the parking garage elevator that Shame contained content of a graphic nature, and that the final usher to check my ID muttered \"Good luck\" as I walked in. \"Don't worry,\" I assured him, \"I won't ask for my money back.\""}
{"text": "Martin Scorsese is a director of astonishing power and \"Gangs of New York\" is a movie of astonishing imagination, ambition, and scope. The first fifteen minutes are as dazzling as any images ever put on screen. The rest of the movie veers from brilliant to flawed, but it is unfailingly arresting, provocative, and powerful.\n\nScorsese has shown us his fascination with New York City (\"New York, New York,\" \"New York Stories,\" \"The Age of Innocence\") and with violence (\"Goodfellas\"). Both themes come together in this story of the origins of New York, in the Civil War era where it was not yet a city, but \"a furnace where a city might be forged.\"\n\nIn a brief prologue, the leader of a gang called the Dead Rabbits is killed by the leader of \"the natives\" (those who have been in the United States for generations) in a huge and brutal skirmish. His young son, Amsterdam Vallon, is taken to an orphanage/reformatory. He returns twenty years later, determined to finish his father's fight.\n\nBy this time, the man who killed his father, Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) runs just about everything in the sprawling area called \"the Five Points.\" Even the legendary Boss Tweed (Jim Broadbent), the real-life figure who presided over the most corrupt political machine in American history, has to ask Bill for his cooperation and support. Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) arrives in the Five Points. Bill the Butcher controls just about everything. Amsterdam recognizes some of his father's former supporters, including Happy Jack (John C. Reilly) and McGloin (\"Billy Elliot's\" Gary Lewis). The only one who recognizes him is Johnny (Henry Thomas of \"E.T.,\" in the year's worst haircut).\n\nAmsterdam becomes a part of Bill's inner circle, and finds himself drawn to him in spite of himself. Bill is magnetic and when he begins to treat Amsterdam like a son, the boy who lost his father cannot help but respond. As he says, \"It's a funny feeling being under the wing of a dragon. It's warmer than you think.\" Amsterdam also begins to care for a pickpocket/thief, and sometimes prostitute named Jenny (Cameron Diaz).\n\nThe struggle between good and evil is represented throughout the movie at every level, from the internal struggles within Amsterdam to the massive battles between the immigrants and the natives. Scorsese also puts the combat in Five Points within the context of the riots in New York after the Union began conscripting soldiers. His reach is over-ambitious at times, but he has a sure hand with the narrative and fills each frame with splendid images. Who else would have P.T. Barnum's elephant lumbering through the city as combatants hurl themselves at each other? After the terrible fighting is over, Scorsese shows us how the city was delivered, in both senses of the word.\n\nSuperfluous voice-overs and flashbacks are very annoying, Thomas' character is poorly conceived, and Cameron Diaz, though game, is badly miscast. DiCaprio just manages to stay on top of his role, but Day-Lewis gives a career-topping performance of such ferocity that the character almost bursts out of the screen.\n\nParents should know that the movie is extremely violent, with savagely brutal battles and oceans of blood. Bill the Butcher uses his expertise to cause the most painful damage possible. Characters are badly wounded and killed, including a hanging. The movie also has very strong language, including the n-word and sexual references and situations, including nudity, prostitution, a character in bed with three naked women, and a reference to abortion. Characters engage in every possible kind of corruption and illegality.\n\nFamilies who see the movie should talk about how our history creates us. What does the movie tell you about present-day New York? Why does Amsterdam's father tell him to leave the blood on the blade and never to look away? How does Scorsese show us parallels between the different gangs and between the gangs and other groups, like the Tammany hall politicians and the draft protesters?\n\nFamilies who enjoy this movie will also enjoy \"Goodfellas.\" They also might want to find out more about some of the real-life historical characters in the movie, like P.T. Barnum and \"Boss\" Tweed"}

{"text": "Oliver Stone's World Trade Center is the second major movie to emerge this year that literally re-enacts events from September 11, 2001. Earlier this year, Paul Greengrass's United 93 was released, and the two movies couldn't be more different in approach. Where United 93 is an evenhanded depiction of tragic events eliciting unique and personal responses from each viewer, World Trade Center wants its audience to respond in a collective, singular manner, using whatever manipulative tactics it deems practical.\n\nThis doesn't mean the movie is poor, necessarily. Stone has never been known for subtlety -- I think he wields the sledgehammer more than any current director -- and yet he's usually been able to craft a film worth seeing, mostly because his methods are incorporated into an overall boldness of vision. Stone isn't shy about making his feelings known, nor about how obvious it is that he desires big things from his movies -- forceful story delivery, clear points of view, and strong reactions from his audience.\n\nSo what's disappointing about World Trade Center, which centers on the true-story plight of two Port Authority police officers (Nicolas Cage and Michael Pe\u0146a) trapped under rubble after the two towers collapse, isn't so much Stone's tone of approach, which could've been foreseen. It's perhaps the simplicity -- some might even say lack of depth -- of its mission. Ever since the events of 9/11, America has been addressing the tragedy in different ways, trying to make sense of it, measuring responses to it, learning how deep the wounds are, and what parts of the psyche they've reached. United 93 offered a reflection point after four-and-a-half years, allowing us to recalibrate our view of the subject. Stone's film, on the other hand, isn't going for anything more contemplative than \"remember the heores\" and \"people are capable of wonderful heroism.\"\n\nThose are noble ideas; it's touching that the movie only wants to be a tribute and a memorial. But that makes this movie similar to others lauding the efforts of a band-together rescue mission, or, more broadly, the struggles of underdogs facing incredible odds. It isn't complex material; one veteran of this subject is Ron Howard, and movies like Apollo 13 do feel like the precedents here. Stone, whose previous works reveal some amount of cynicism, isn't Howard, and his attempts to evoke the true heart of Americans comes across less gracefully, with familiar character personalities -- crusty and colorful New Yorkers, down-to-earth working class men, strong and devoted wives -- going through the usual motions of a crisis situation (hang in there, stay with me, I'm not gonna let you die).\n\nAs the movie is based on true events, I began to wonder just how much of these moments rang true. I wouldn't doubt that this is the way we act, react, and talk in times of crisis. I do believe, however, that such moments can be delivered with an honesty, without an oversell that highlights its intentions as drama. Stone strives for cheers and tears by going the extra mile, or two, or three (we're given a slew of heartstring yankers, from flashbacks to visions to humorous, mushy ironies involving baby naming; we're even given an angry ex-Marine to inject a dose of jingoism). At some point, the audience should be trusted to meet the material half way.\n\nStone fares much better in the film's pyrotechnics, and the sections that effectively bookend the movie are awesome feats of production value and special effects. The moment when the buildings collapse is as terrifying as anything I've ever seen on screen. And once the rescue attempts are underway, an urgency develops that very naturally brings to the surface our common faith in the best that people can offer.\n\nBut if World Trade Center only wants to remind us that people have \"a best to offer\" when the chips are down, we're not given much new to take away. In our hearts, we know this and we like being reminded of it, but the specific subject of 9/11 is still going to hurt for a long time; and with so much to explore and investigate, it's disheartening that World Trade Center can boil down its own exploration of the subject with a summarizing end-of-movie voiceover. The movie means well, and we can appreciate the sentiment; it works on the level of heartbreaking spectacle, but it doesn't add more to our wisdom."}
{"text": "Posts tagged: Julio Medem\n\nHipsters (Russia, dir: Valery Todorovsky) \u2013 In 1955 Moscow, where the Soviet citizenry fills the streets in a palette of industrial blue, black and gray, a group of culture rebels parade about in rainbow colors that in America would be crimes against fashion\u2014a cacophony of plaids and checks, greens and yellows and purples and other garishly clashing colors\u2014and commit something much more daring: crimes against conformity. They are the self-defined \"hipsters,\" dancing to swing and small combo dance bands in fashions that defies the uniformity of the Soviet ideal. \"I can't understand why everyone doesn't want to live like everyone else,\" smiles the youth commissar of conformity, who proclaims that \"Every hipster is a potential criminal.\" Mels (Anton Shagin, who comes off as a wide-eyed Neil Patrick Harris) is part of the conformist army until he switches allegiances for the best of possible reasons: a girl, Polly (Oksana Akinshina). Mels dons the Soviet answer to a zoot suit, hits the Broadway scene and is rechristened Mel (in the Yankee-ization that all hipsters undergo), the newest member of the swing cat underground.\n\nA musical (where they do indeed break into song and dance, evoking the mechanization of the industrial revolution when it's the plebian citizens doing the honors but exploding in the plumage of mating birds when the dances erupt in the club setttings), a coming-of-age tale and an adventure in youthful rebellion, Hipsters (from Emerging Master Valery Todorovksy) is a bright blast of underground culture and expressions of individuality in a society where rebels are regularly jailed for much less. The eye-gouging color, flamboyant fashion, pompadours and curls and appropriated style is not just a fashion statement, it's a cry of individualism and freedom in a country where \"kowtowing to western ideology is punishable by up to ten years\" and \"a saxophone is considered a concealed weapon.\" (And what about owning banned music, which here is copied and passed around on pirate discs cut into the remnants of old X-rays sheets?) It's also a warped mirror reflection of what these soviet youths imagine American culture is like from the snatched glimpses and slivers of artifacts gleaned from between the cracks of the Iron Curtain, a recreation at least ten years out of date and exaggerated to hyperbolic extremes. Which, in a very real way, ultimately makes this a uniquely Soviet rebel culture. The drama itself is much more conventional, with kids forced to choose between their rebel identities and donning the costume of conformity for advancement, marriage, parenthood and responsibility, all of it essentially hurdled in a song to embrace the happy ending. But the story of Hipsters is less in the narrative than the evocation of this underground culture, in both the texture of realistic detail and expressionist song and dance sequences. And if you think you recognize Polly (\"Good Time Polly to those who know\"), it's not just the American affection; she starred as Lilya in Lukas Moodyson's Lilya 4-Ever."}
{"text": "Nichols leaves the details up to the viewer's imagination as he limns an often striking, at times agonizing portrait of the effects of rampaging fear on one man, and the ripple effect it has on his family, loved ones, and community. Unfortunately, Nichols' ideas start to run out of steam before the film reaches its conclusion, while, ironically, the finale itself might leave viewers craving something a little more substantial.\n\nMichael Shannon (Revolutionary Road) delivers another impressive performance at the center of Nichols' carefully constructed maelstrom of foreboding. Shannon plays Curtis, a foreman with a small-town Ohio construction company. He shares a comfy suburban home with his pretty and loving wife, Sam (Jessica Chastain), their spunky little deaf daughter, Hannah (Tova Stewart), with whom they communicate via ASL, and the family dog. Curtis' good life is the envy of his friends and co-workers.\n\nBut the nightly news is full of paranoia-inducing horror stories of mining disasters and chlorine spills. Soon, Curtis is hearing ferocious thunder cracks when the sky is perfectly clear. He starts having apocalyptic visions of oily brown rain, lightning bolts exploding across the sky like fireworks, ominous swarms of birds creating gigantic, swirling Rorschach patterns in the sky, or dead crows raining down from above. Even worse are nightmares that hit Curtis (and the viewer) on a terrifyingly visceral level because they start out so real.\n\nNichols is very effective in seeding these dream sequences seamlessly into the texture of the narrative, so the audience, like Curtis, is always a little off-kilter about what may or may not really be happening. Curtis tries to cope by reading up on mental illness. (We see why when he goes to visit his mom\u2014an understated Kathy Baker\u2014in assisted living.) But he can't shake the irrational panic that grips him day and night, affecting his job and his marriage. Falling behind in his other obligations, he fences in the dog, buys gas masks, and takes out a risky loan against his mortgage to renovate and provision the old underground storm shelter in his back yard.\n\nThere are two ways one might interpret Nichols' unfolding story. Either the pervasive culture of fear in this country is all in our heads (and we need to get a grip), or it's a mass premonition of something truly dire to come. (\"I'm afraid something might be coming. Something that's not right,\" is the closest Curtis can come to articulating his feelings to his wife.) The film seems willing to support either thesis (or both) depending on how one reads it.\n\nBut the trouble is, beyond the impending sense of all-purpose dread ratcheted up to fever pitch a half-hour into the movie, or so (Don't go to sleep! Don't get in the car! Don't get too close to that equipment!), the viewer doesn't really experience whatever the movie is saying on any profound level. Nichols generates plenty of tension and anxiety for its own sake, but that's not the same thing as telling a coherent, affecting story. He does succeed in replicating the suffocating panic of non-stop fear, but the film as a whole amounts to little more than an exercise in metaphor, told with the eerie sensibilities of a horror movie, a premise in search of a story at"}

When Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) invents a trick that astonishes the world, bitter rival Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) makes it his life's crusade to figure out how he does it.\n\nDon't worry, I won't give anything away here.\n\nI am not sure I disliked The Prestige because it is a poor film or because I figured it all out about half way through. Perhaps it's not the The Prestige's fault.

Even then, I thought that surely another twist was right around the corner and would start me guessing all over again.

{"text": "We Bought a Zoo\n\nIn \"We Bought a Zoo,\" Matt Damon plays Benjamin Mee, a widower who's been alone with his kids for six months when he decides to upend their lives and buy a broken-down zoo in Southern California. Based on the real-life Mee's actual memoir, \"We Bought a Zoo\" contains all the ingredients of a maudlin, treacly weeper (\"Dozens of Marleys and Three Mees\").\n\nHappily, writer-director Cameron Crowe keeps the most mawkish manipulations to a minimum in a movie that moves through its requisite stages - grief, acceptance, zany sights gags and healing - with smooth, entertaining efficiency. You want the tough, spiky version of virtually the same story, see \"The Descendants.\" You want sunshine and uplift, see \"We Bought a Zoo.\"\n\nThe title, by the way, is spoken twice by Mee's 7-year-old daughter, Rosie, played by the beguiling Maggie Elizabeth Jones, whose scene-stealing cuteness proves to be one of the most likable things in a movie that's all about being liked.\n\nLess adorable but even funnier is Thomas Haden Church as Benjamin's skeptical brother, Duncan, who speaks in a surfer's drawl and carries a series of mordant zingers in his quiver to defend against incoming earnestness. When he meets the zoo's comely manager, Kelly (a miscast but sporting Scarlett Johansson), he advises Benjamin to \"dump the animals and keep Kelly. That's true joy.\"\n\nKelly is part of a team of eccentric zoo staffers that the Mees inherit when they buy the sweetly decrepit zoo, which animal lovers will be happy to hear isn't the jaillike fortress they avoid but a delightfully ramshackle, rambling affair of low fences and open grassy spaces. Granted, the grizzly bear is suffering a bout of depression, and an elderly tiger is facing end-of-life issues, but the animals are humanely treated and can be counted on to put on dazzling displays, especially when they join in a gutteral chorus once the sun sets.\n\nWhile Benjamin guts his savings to keep the zoo going until its official summer-season opening, \"We Bought a Zoo\" pivots around that deadline, his fractured relationship with Dylan and the simmering attraction between Benjamin and Kelly.\n\nCrowe, who made the blandly slick comedies \"Jerry Maguire\" and \"Almost Famous,\" knows how to keep those balls aloft without too much strain, even if he resorts too often to nostalgic music cues to inject emotion into a scene. Still, the low-key appeal of \"We Bought a Zoo\" is nearly impossible to resist, not just because it provides the minimal daily requirement of hugs and closure, but because it's such an apt wish fulfillment fantasy when for many viewers Plan B isn't just a dream but a necessity.\n\n\"We Bought a Zoo\" provides a welcome seasonal dash of wholesomeness and humor (although parents may need to explain a few naughty word-definitions here and there), but it's also a heartening celebration of second acts, even at their most unwelcome"}

{"text": "I've been working through the movies of Danish director Lars von Trier for the past few weeks, a project that I took up knowing mostly his current reputation as a divisive figure, the maker of movies that some people accuse of being simple exercises in provocation. What's been interesting is that while his works (particularly the early ones) engender a discussion of how much they say anything other than say it stylishly, none of the movies have been particularly 'shocking'. I know I'm a jaded viewer, but I'd like to think I'm not completely numb to those things.\n\nWell, that changes today.\n\nBut first I think we need a history lesson. Two weeks ago I talked about the Dogme 95 movement, but didn't really explain it. Unfortunately, we're at the point where that's no longer an option, as the movie we're watching today is the only Dogme film von Trier has made to date (likely the only one he will make, I'd guess). So to approach the film one must understand some of the ideas and restrictions wrapped around it.\n\nCreated by Lars von Trier and fellow Danish director Thomas Vinterberg, Dogme 95 was a filmmaking movement the two men thought up as a rejection of 'traditional' movie-making, which they both claimed was far too artificial and philosophically impure to create moving, worthwhile art. So they wrote out a manifesto of 'vows of chastity', limits on what Dogme films could include in order to qualify. This was to return cinema to its immediate roots, inexpensive and immediate. The rules can be found on the wikipedia page, if that interests you, but mostly they were straightforward: no sets, no props, no special effects, no score (outside of what's naturally in the world), no tripods or crane shots or Steadicam. In fact, no action or genre works, nor period or fantasy, were allowed. Dogme movies take place here and now, and are different from cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 primarily in that they use real actors who follow these rules as well.\n\nThe Dogme 95 movement took off in certain arthouse circles primarily because it cut out a lot of the expense of making a movie. Sure, one of the rules was that you still shoot on film, but the productions were by and large otherwise very accessible, low budget affairs just because there wasn't anything to spend money on. When you don't have all the trappings of a production, you don't have a big crew either, and so the whole thing immediately becomes much cheaper. That said, Dogme was not without its criticisms. It is such a stringent set of rules that the movies in question are all kind of ugly affairs, in particular the rule that states that there can be no camera mountings lead to a lot of handheld 35 mm shooting, which in the mid-90s was a far more horrifying prospect to people than it is today, when rampant handheld has infested every level of movie making.\n\nAnd there's a question of just how seriously Lars von Trier took the very idea. In some ways it was a publicity stunt, as von Trier used an opportunity to speak on the future of film at a French film festival to paper the audience with Dogme 95 manifesto pamphlets, only to later admit that he wrote the rules down on a whim one day, while drunk, in a scant 45 minutes. Which is just another wrinkle in the frustrating duology of von Trier. The idea to create a genre of cinema that's not beholden to the massive budgets and excess of 95% of film is a noble one, but von Trier can't do anything genuine without adding a level of showmanship that makes you half convinced he's doing it just to get a rise out of people.\n\nAs it is, Dogme 95 has produced a few dozen movies from various directors, mostly foreign language films, but it never really took off as an actual revolution of cinema. Partially due to just how restrictive it is, but also probably due to the influx of people in the past decade who have had great success with no-budget cinema in a post-digital camera world. And even the films that did supposedly adhere to the principles regularly violated one or more of the rules, as shooting a film with no artifice other than narrative is apparently next to impossible if you want to have a real product on the other end. But it is a key part of von Trier's evolution and influence, part of the reason he's such a controversial figure particularly among long-time critics, and explains some of why today's film is the way it is.\n\nThe Idiots (1998)\n\nSo let me just lay down the plot of The Idiots for you, free of value judgements, so you know what we're getting into: The Idiots is the story of a woman named Karen (Bodil Jorgensen) who encounters a group of adults who have an unconventional sort of performance art. They go into public spaces, or the house where they're all squatting, and unleash their 'inner idiot,' which often involves acting developmentally disabled, in order to seek a sort of societal and emotional freedom that they feel their bourgeois setting is built to repress. They do this by spassing, which involves things such as group trips to restaurants or public pools, where one of them acts as the 'normal' supervisor of the group while the rest act out, and then they all gather back home to talk about their experiences.\n\nSo I've lost most of you already, I'm sure. This movie was controversial upon release and it still feels absolutely shocking on a fundamental level that it exists even today. Part of it is cultural norms, but as someone raised to even question the use of the word 'retarded' as a pejorative, the idea of adults emulating the behaviors of actually disabled people hits all my 'offensive' buttons. But that's no surprise, because this is Lars von Trier, and in all things he seeks to provoke and scandalize as much as he does make genuine statements. So while plenty has been written on the moral questions of making this your subject for a film, I don't think that discussion is terribly interesting. This probably should offend you, but if you're interested in seeking stuff beyond it, we'll talk about those things. If you'd rather just consider the whole premise too much? Can't say I blame you. Adi\u00f3s, vaya con dios, and see you around, as next week's movie is much more conventional.\n\nWhat's most interesting is that behind all of that initial shock and scandal is one of the more human of von Trier's films. It plays out as almost a documentary of this fictional dadaist performance art troupe, as they act out as both a way to entertain themselves and as a profound sort of therapy that they seem nearly guilty admitting. The movie, shot in a smeary hand-held that looks unlike the entirety of von Trier's other filmography, seems almost like a found footage movie at times (the genre didn't exist yet, of course, and nobody acts like the camera is there), especially since it's inter-cut with interviews with the characters involved at some point past the scope of the movie, where they somberly try to provide justifications and reflect back on that time. But each moment is surprisingly revealing, even when everyone struggles against each other and personalities clash, and that's before they even begin to spass.\n\nIt's those sequences that really define the emotional moments of the film, and do so with a sympathy that leads one to even go so far as to understand why these people are doing the things they do. There's one sequence where one of the members, spassing, is left by the normal-presenting leader of the group, Stoffer (Jens Albinus), in the care of some violent biker guys, a test of sorts to see if he can keep up the facade under threat of potential violence if these guys feel they're being put on. But people's reactions to the disabled are often heartbreakingly humane, as these rough and tumble guys instantly go into caretaker mode, even going so far as to bring him into the bathroom when they decide he needs to go, one of the men holding the spasser's penis for him. It is at the same time one of the most uncomfortably exploitative and infinitely sweet moments I've seen on film in some time, and it's that juxtaposition that really drives home most of the poignant images of The Idiots.\n\nStoffer is the group standout, as he's the only who organizes most of the group efforts but is also the one who seems most interested in the political uses. To him, the group is a statement against society, a way to act out against a culture that has become safe and coddled. If that's true, then what truer role could a human try to become than an idiot? He's also the one who seems the most angry, lashing out sometimes violently when he confronts people in the real world who don't immediately fold under the societal pressure to accommodate the disabled. Contrasted with Karen, who spends most of the time being the audience surrogate, tacitly disapproving of this way of life while still staying around, fascinated by it. By the time she feels comfortable letting go the first time, it becomes a transformitive act of beauty, this rather proper, closed off woman accessing this deep emotional well that move others in the group to tears.\n\nIt seems strange to call a movie with such a ridiculous premise nuanced, but I'm going to walk out on that limb. There's a lot about human nature, about the lies we tell ourselves and the roles we assume to hide away our pain, that The Idiots says in a way few movies ever try to communicate. It does it in incendiary ways, but I feel that's as much to jar people into recognizing themselves in this madness than it is to just shock and offend. Provocation is a tool with actual results, something that often gets forgotten in a world where trolls shock people for no other reason than the lulz. If von Trier is doing it for lulz, it's only after the pain and suffering clearly on display, deeply felt by a director who makes each film seem like a cry of anguish he can't express any other way. And for all the weird artifice of the spassers, there's real discussion there about how people treat the disabled, and what it means to act out in society on various levels and with increasing degrees of consequence.\n\nOf all the movies I've ever written about, this is absolutely the hardest to condone, much less recommend. But there's material of worth here, buried under the obvious objections, that make it all worthwhile. This is undoubtedly as divisive a film as von Trier has made to date, and with good reason, but I've already followed this rabbit hole this far and it not only doesn't feel out of place, but feels more humane and compassionate that most of von Trier's work. There's heart buried here, so long as you're willing to find it.\n\n2 Responses to Directed Viewing: Dogme 95 and \"The Idiots\"\n\nI've been interested in seeing this for ages, but never got around to it.

{"text": "On \"Miss Bala\"\n\nThe film \"Miss Bala\" is a powerful and truly realistic (and pretty violent and ugly) depiction of the current drug war in Mexico. The film begins with a 23 year old lady named Laura Guerrero (played beautifully by Stephanie Sigman) who wants to enter and win a beauty pageant. What happens is that Laura Guerrero gets caught up in the brutal and vicious drug war and becomes involved with a powerful drug lord. Her beautiful dream of being a beauty queen quickly spirals into a descent into hell as she is caught between the forces of drug war rivals and a brutal and corrupt military using every means to crush the drug lords even if it destroys the innocent. In this movie there are no winners and no real good guys, but plenty of victims.\n\nThis movie is all too real about the present day drug war conflict. The film makes it very clear that as long as there is corruption then the Mexican government's drug war is futile. It is very clear that the real war should be against corruption and the brutality shown by both sides. Clearly Laura Guerrero is symbolic of Mexico's people being caught in the middle between the drug cartels and the Mexican government's policy against the cartels. I find the violence in the film very disturbing, but it is meant to be disturbing. This film does not attempt to glorify the drug cartels, and that is a departure from many other films. The film is a very serious look at Mexico today and how the drug war conflict impacts the people. \"Miss Bala\" was directed by Gerardo Naranja."}

Independent filmmakers like me seem to have no influence on society, and whatever I produce doesn't have a large effect on society at large. If it was a large studio like Toho, for example - and it actually happens that last year, they were planning a film similar to mine, and they were probably shut down by the police because, in a large company like Toho, there are former members of the police who have become executives in the corporation.

I could compare it to a film of that year, say Okamoto's Kiru!, and well there's just no competition.\n\nEvery time you think KT is going to take his curious, roving camera away from an uncomfortable scene, he doesn't, and brings you to that next level of depravity, met with more discomfort, and then fascination. A good take on the Sadean philosophy.\n\nAs good as In the Realm of the Senses, probably better. Funny how you can get such a different approach from two different directors. I like this version for fleshing out the character of Abe Sada more. Oshima did not do a good job at making compelling characters in Ai no Corrida. I think he was more concerned w/ sex, or at least Anatole Dauman was."}
{"text": "Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole\n\nThe hero's journey is a classic. From \"The Lord of the Rings\" to \"Star Wars,\" the story of the young, untested kid being forced into an epic journey to find his inner strength and eventually vanquish the gathering forces of evil never gets tired.\n\nThat is, if you do it right.\n\nThe animated \"Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole\" tries to follow that arc as owlet Soren (Jim Sturgess, \"21\") is kidnapped from his hollow, escapes from captivity and makes the journey to the mythical Tree of Ga'Hoole to enlist the help of the Guardians.\n\nIt seems like it would be easy to follow the usual pattern \"\" the call to adventure, the refusal, the supernatural helper, the transformation, etc. \"\" to move Soren along his destined path. However, director Zack Snyder (\"Watchmen\") doesn't seem interested much in making a coherent story.\n\nSoren beings with his jealous, less-talented brother, Kludd (Ryan Kwanten, TV's \"True Blood\"), learning how to fly and playing Guardian. When the sibs dare each other to go flying without parental supervision, they wind up on the ground, where they're snatched up by roving representatives of the Pure Ones, a group of racist owls led by Metalbeak (Joel Edgerton, \"Animal Kingdom\") and his mate, Nyra (Helen Mirren, \"Red\").\n\nThe Pure Ones are gathering owlets to brainwash to their cause, which seems to be domination of the entire owl world, possibly with a side of ethnic cleansing. Toward this goal, they force their slaves to gather little bits of metal from owl pellets, which, when piled together, create some kind of magnetic field that disorients owl by doing something unclear to their \"gizzards.\"\n\nSoren escapes, while Kludd embraces the warm fuzzies that come with being part of a fascist collective. Soren escapes with Gylfie (Aussie actress Emily Barclay) and they search for the Guardians, picking up a couple of other owls along the way, and finding Soren's snake nursemaid, Mrs. Plithiver (Miriam Margolyes, \"Happy Feet\"). They travel together across the sea until they reach their goal.\n\nOnce there, they find that the Guardians are real, and the events that made them famous aren't really that far in the past. Soren meets his hero, Ezylryb (Geoffrey Rush, \"Elizabeth: The Golden Age\"), now a semiretired chronicler. He takes Soren under his wing, so to speak, and mentors him in the art of flying battle.\n\nThe look of \"Legends\" is fantastic, but the story feels disjointed. This is probably because \"\" like too many movies \"\" it's based on a series of novels. This one supposedly covers the first three books. Unless those books are really short, that's way too much to pack into one movie.\n\nWhile it's not a horrible start, if Snyder and company plan to produce sequels, they should spend a little less time making animated bird feathers pop out of the screen and a little more time nailing down the script."}

{"text": "This might be the saddest, darkest film I've ever seen. From the people who made Watership Down (which I still haven't gotten around to), an animated British film from the 80's about two horribly abused dogs that escape from a military test center and make their way through the English countryside while their former captors hunt them down.\n\nThe animation is haunting and beautiful, at times terrifying. There are images in this film that you will never get out of your head.\n\nNot a kid's film either. It's not an adult cartoon, in that its not filled with T&A or gratuitous violence (though it does get very violent at times). But had I seen this movie when I was a kid it would have wrecked me for months, rather than just for a weeks like I assume it will now.\n\nThis also has amazing character development, and goes in places you just do not expect, no matter how much you steel yourself going in. The two main characters are amongst the most sympathetic hero's ever put to film, especially if your a dog person ( I work with dogs, so yeah...fuck me...).\n\nIt's on Netflix instant, and I highly recommend it, and even though its actually depressing, and not just melancholy, its also deeply riveting and probably the most intelligent animated film I've ever seen (and I'm not trying to diminish animated films--but even the transcendent ones are rarely this mature).\n\nPS. The opening credit's song sets the tone for this film as good as any I can think of before or since.\n\nI just watched this again as well. It was mentioned in the Netflix Instant thread, I think. Anyway, I read the book about 20 years ago or so, and could only remember that it was extremely sad without recalling details. Then that scene right at the beginning with Rowf in the tank reminded me of just how depressing the movie was going to getA great film. I actually saw this when I was a kid and it has probably the saddest ending to a film ever. I actually think it's better than Watership Down. Dammit... just thinking about that ending makes me want to cry.\n\nUpon re-watching, I actually think the ending isn't quite as downbeat or even ambiguous as it seems at first. The first time you watch it, the fact that everything is so bleak and doesn't end on a happy note, kind of colors the way you look at it (at least it did for me). But seeing it again, the island does show up as the credits roll, and the song is a pretty happy one. Although it doesn't resolve what happens to them, really, I think it heavily suggests they at least make it to land.\n\nAt least, I really, really need to believe that.\n\nAlso, the final voice overs of the humans in that scene seems to suggest that b/c of all the bad publicity, they're closing down the research facilityYeah, but I don't view WD as a total downer....after all, Hazel passes away at a ripe old age after leading the warren to safety and defeating Efrafra.\n\nWhile it's intense (I had to rewind after I saw them all-but-come-and-say that Woundwart's soldiers got, er, conjugal privileges), it isn't the total soul-crushing that The Plague Dogs is. When the lone friendly human they meet accidentally gets his face blown off, it would sink a lesser film. Here, it's just another scoop of horrible on these dogs' livesPoor fucking fox...\n\nPS: They totally drown, Z.Vasquez.\n\nYou're a bad man.\n\nAnd yeah, love the Todd. It's great because you totally expect him to betray them, but he never does. He just helps them every step of the way, and eventually his goodness is rewarded with death. It's like The Wire, but animated and with talking animals.\n\nETA: I've heard the book actually has an all-out happy ending.\n\nBy the way, I'd love to read some of those articles. There's a real lack of coverage for this film out there.\n\nIt's not really 'coverage' (and I realize I'm implying I actually read the book in what I wrote). It's also not great writing, but I'm proud of myself for at least trying to suggest people saw some of my favs."}
{"text": "Related Films\n\nBoth Joe Carnahan's The Grey and Asger Leth's Man on a Ledge opened last week during the movie industry \"dead zone,\" a name film scholar David Bordwell gave to the first quarter of the calendar year. During this stretch, lower-profile releases with limited box-office expectations often sneak into theaters for brief runs alongside their Oscar-craving kinfolk. At their worst, these movies slip in and out of the multiplex without a peep. But at their best, these movies are more nervy and creative than most summer blockbusters and autumnal prestige pictures. After seeing Carnahan's and Leth's latest films this weekend, I was left with two questions: First, what made The Grey such a bracing example of this kind of neo-\"B\" film storytelling? Second, why was Man on a Ledge nothing more than a high-concept fiasco?\n\nLet's start with the actors. The Grey stars Liam Neeson as John Ottway, a tormented man who survives a plane crash in the Alaskan wilderness with seven other members of an oil-drilling team. Like Clint Eastwood, Neeson has defied time. He's gotten older, yet thanks to movies like 2008's Taken, he's also transformed himself into a bankable action hero. His two great traits are his bulk and his gentle demeanor: He's capable of assuming the alpha-male role among a pack of surly Hemingway types, but he's also capable of flavoring a line like \"You're gonna die; that's what's happening\" with something like paternal care. The Grey surrounds him with an able-bodied cast of middle-aged character actors like Dallas Roberts, Dermot Mulroney, and Frank Grillo, who give the film an air of solemnity and seriousness. These men aren't playing around.\n\nThe titular \"man on the ledge\" in Leth's film is Avatar's Sam Worthington, who shares Neeson's space-eating screen presence but lacks any corresponding moral force or psychological complexity. Worthington plays an ex-cop who's been wrongfully imprisoned, but for all his outrage and frustration, he feels like he's just playing with the role rather than inhabiting it. This is kind of remarkable: How can you make clinging to the side of a building seem phony? His capable co-stars \u2014 Elizabeth Banks, Anthony Mackie, Ed Harris, and Kyra Sedgwick \u2014 never fill the emotional void he creates. For a while, Banks is pleasingly matter-of-fact as she tries to talk him back inside. But the other performers seldom bring any elements of danger or volatility to their roles. They're paid professionals doing risk-free work.\n\nAnother key difference between the two films comes from the apparent simplicity of their plots. For example, The Grey focuses stubbornly and pitilessly on how Ottway and his fellow crash survivors are going to survive the wilderness. Carnahan spends the rest of the film whittling down his ideas about man and nature (and about God and faith) until they're as sharp and wounding as spear points. Instead of staying focused on its protagonist's tense situation, though, Man on a Ledge heads in the opposite direction. Leth and screenwriter Pablo F. Fenjves frantically broaden their canvas in an attempt to weave together the heist film, the cop drama, the social-protest picture, and the romantic-comedy caper. Eventually, all the reversals, revelations, complications, and expansions tug the movie in so many different directions that it's torn into little scraps.\n\nBut it's not like either movie is a model of realism. No matter how savage the wolves of The Grey are, their threat is not grounded in fact. Wolves simply don't kill people, much less methodically hunt them down like the members of a highly trained lupine assassins' guild. However, if you think of these outsized predators as symbols of the natural world's savagery or what Jack London once memorably described as \"the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life,\" then the film gains strength as a nasty parable about the fragility of human existence. After a while, Carnahan doesn't even need wolves to get his point across. He just lets them howl in the darkness. And when day breaks, he watches his ever-dwindling band of survivors trudge through the ankle-deep snow of Alaska's windy, treacherous vastness.\n\nThere's no way to read the ridiculous plot twists and shabby action set pieces of Man on a Ledge as anything other than the desperate flailings of a filmmaker trying to mix-and-match genre conventions. More ridiculous and offensive than these scattershot chase scenes and plot twists are the statements about class envy shoehorned into the film. When the long-haired Occupy Wall Streeter who joins the crowd of passersby and takes an interest in the drama between Banks and Worthington unfolding 21 stories above him spouts some prefab nonsense about the rich getting away scot-free while the poor suffer, it's a gesture, not an emotion. This guy's shouts of \"Attica!\" aren't rallying cries for a wrongfully accused man; they're a smart-ass allusion to Dog Day Afternoon, a far more volatile account of a big-city standoff.\n\nThe most important difference between The Grey and Man on a Ledge comes from the ways in which each film plays with genre expectations. Starting with a truly horrifying plane-crash sequence, The Grey begins with blood and violence but ultimately slows down, growing more pensive, contemplative, and potent as its characters come face to face with their tragic destiny. Man on a Ledge, however, grows more breakneck and goofy until it plummets off its perch and lands in the safety net made from dozens of action-film clich\u00e9s."}

She's an ultra-Christian World War II widow fidgeting in her haunted mansion off the northern coast of England.

{"text": "Alice is not one\nof Woody Allen's best films, but it's one of his most daring, proving beyond any\ndoubts the nearly unprecedented freedom which Allen is continually afforded. Pic\nstars Mia Farrow as a rich, unhappy woman who embarks on a journey of self-discovery.\nWhile not a novel logline, the little touches and twists Allen provides are outrageously\noriginal (for instance: it's a magical acupuncturist who sends Farrow on her voyage\nvia herbs that make her by turns, invisible, completely sexually uninhibited,\nable to fly, haunted by ghosts and the object of all men's desires). Allen quickly\nand effectively establishes the odd world in which Alice unfolds, and from that\npoint forward, Allen isn't afraid to go anywhere this woman's journey might take\nher. There are elaborate dream sequences which work equally well as efficient\ncharacterization and surreal setpieces. There is a scene in which Farrow dances\nwith the ghost of Alec Baldwin, a past lover. On the soundtrack plays a series\nof dialogue soundbytes from various moments in their relationship, all the way\nfrom when they first met, to their breakup. It's a brilliant idea to condense\nan entire relationship into a few minutes of soundtrack and Allen pulls it off\nperfectly. One of the trickiest parts of filmmaking is conveying characters' histories\nwithout resorting to easy exposition or clich\u00e9d generalities. Allen must\nbe particularly careful with his movies given his often sprawling casts and their\ncomplex interrelationships. Through devices like this soundbyting, Allen proves\nhimself always a step ahead of the pack, still figuring out innovative ways to\nadvance character and plot.\n\nWhat I like most about a movie like Alice, is that as a\nviewer, I'm never complacent. The majority of films follow so many conventions\nfrom the opening scene forward, they render themselves impotent by the twenty-minute\nmark. Since most films never even attempt to break free from their creative\nprisons, I frequently find myself settling into my seat, disheartened by the knowledge\nthat I know exactly where I'm gonna be at the close of the first two acts and\nI'm certain the ending's gonna be all ribbons and bows.

{"text": "Proverbial wisdom be damned: absence\ndoesn't make the heart grow fonder-it makes the heart\ncrawl beneath the sheets and sob and throb ceaselessly,\nsleeplessly, for days that feel like weeks, growing\nnot fond, nothing so feathery as fond, but more and\nmore sore. Sore from the hurt, from anger, from being\nleft or having to leave, sore from all of that uninterrupted\nfeeling.\n\nTsai Ming-liang works too subtly and too organically\nto lay it out for us, but with What Time Is It There?\nhe explores every worthy connotation of the word departure,\nfrom taking a trip away to taking the final, mortal\nbow; from making a substantive personal change to simply\nsaying goodbye. Even better, he shows how it all amounts\nto the same, sore thing.\n\nThe familiar, deceptively light question posed by the\nfilm's title is actually a suitable, vernacular expression\nof no less than the state of being. Time, rather than\na fixed fact, is a collusional construct, a structure-while\neminently useful and essential-that's descriptive, not\nprescriptive. Tsai yanks time back to its original metaphorical\nplane, where it ticks and tocks, the tin man's new heart\nfilling the empty space, making sense, the best it can,\nof what's behind, before, and beyond us. Too slow, too\ndismayed to operate in the swift seconds of the literal\nhere and now, we're yet capable, as that question implies,\nof imagining (or at least wondering) what it's like\nover there, of setting our hearts to another time, of\nbeing in both places-if sloppily-at once. It gives our\nlives spatial dimension and, for the privilege, gives\nus heartbreak.\n\nThe first scene, an otherwise banal documentation\nof an old man (Miao Tien) sitting and moving quietly through\nan empty apartment, establishes the film's vocabulary\n(long, deep focused stationary shots), sets the tone (quiet,\nattentive, humanely whimsical), and immediately involves\nthe viewer in its exploration of absence (at the outset\nof the second scene it's implied that the old man has\ndied, and those first, banal moments are all we'll have\nto call on while his wife and son spend the better part\nof the film grieving his loss).\n\nAs with our short glimpse of the old man, interactions\nthroughout What Time Is It There? are fleeting;\nover time, in the company of only oneself, moments of\ncontact swell with meaning, memories carrying into the\nfuture a deepened feeling for what's past. Rather than\nreceding, the hunger to recall what's passed imbues meaning\nin everything, animating the inanimate, impregnating empty\nspace, and bending time. Tsai shows people literalizing\ntheir loss by fixating on objects: the widow (Lu Yi-ching)\ntries to bring back her husband's spirit by casting spells\non household items, cooking his favorite meals, and adjusting\nto \"his time\" by covering the windows and eating and sleeping\nat strange hours. Though it's never shown, \"his time\"-as\nestablished by the off-time kitchen clock-was likely set\nby the son, Hsiao-kang (Lee Kang-sheng), a watch salesman\nwho we'd earlier seen changing the clocks in his bedroom\nto \"Paris time\" in honor of a Paris-bound girl, Shiang-chyi\n(Chen Shiang-chyi), to whom he sold his own dual-time\nwatch. But the son never corrects his mother, and nor\ndoes Tsai define which clock time is Paris and which is\nTaipei: they're each in their own time, sharing a space\nbut in different orbits, real time subordinate to the\ndesire to span all that empty space and get back in step,\nin time, with the departed.\n\nTolerant at first, Hsiao-kang\ngrows weary of his mother's erratic and desperate behavior,\nand he tries to make her stop. But he can't, nor can\nhe offer any comfort save for staying out of the way.\nConvinced that the deceased will return, she forbids\nthe killing of any living thing for 49 days. When a\ncockroach is apprehended in the kitchen, the son drops\nit into the fish tank, where it is immediately, comically\ndevoured. Before long, mother surmises that her husband's\ntraveling soul is in fact swimming around in the belly\nof their large white carp. Face to face with the fish,\nwater rimming her eyes, it's a devastatingly funny moment.\nIrrational and pathetic in her grief, she proceeds to\nspeak with shattering honesty. \"Have you come back to\nsee me?\" she asks, expressing abandonment's deepest\ndesire. If only, as if it would make it better, or easier,\nor less lonely-if only the departed could see us in\nour grief. To him, to the fish, to us, to herself, she\nconfides, \"It's just so hard.\"\n\nHsiao-kang acts just as erratically, transferring his\ngrief to an obsession with Shiang-chyi in Paris. Though\ndismissive of his mother's reliance on magical spells\nto reach the dead, his obsession with the girl has something-though\nnot everything-to do with the dictum that it's bad luck\nto take an object, such as the watch, from a person\nin mourning (he relays this to Shang-chyi before finally\nrelenting and selling her the watch. To allay his fears,\nshe claims no belief in luck: \"I'm a Christian\"). By\nkeeping time with her, and trying to align Taipei's\ntime-through increasingly risqu\u00e9 public clock manipulations-with\nParis's, he's moved by the desire both to be with her\nand to protect her. It's not much, but with father gone\nforever and mother out to lunch, his traveling sympathies\nare keeping him, and his grief, company.\n\nShiang-chyi, in turn,\nlives the perpetually temporary existence of a foreign\ntraveler, always alone, always on the move, always in\nher own head. She's got that dual-time watch, keeping\nher in both places at once and never fully anywhere.\nA bold gaze from a stranger is at first returned and\nthen rebuffed. Meals are at once commonplace and uncommonly\nthick with anxiety. She asks for help, and then, when\nit's given, she grows weary of the generosity. To travel\nalone is to prefer, on some level, one's own company;\non another level, travel widens the search for connection;\non all levels, one grows terribly lonely and desperate\nfor the company of another. Tsai's observations here\nare pitch-perfect, detailed and emotionally specific,\nand yet iconic. Isolation of this sort, of the silent\ntraveler in a city where one doesn't speak the language,\nhas a certain sound, and What Time Is It There?\nhas it down. By going without a score for the duration\nof the picture, Tsai calls attention to the ambient\nnoise of various spaces, and to the tentative, spooky\nand spooked noises bodies make when alone with themselves.\nIn the city spaces that the girl passes through, silences\nare cavernous and sounds, like the banging in an upstairs\nhotel room or the clip of heels on an empty street,\nare amplified and threatening.\n\nWhile mother's grief crescendos with a fancy (and ultimately\nmasturbatory) date at home with her beloved's photograph,\nthe two young principals move against their tide of\nisolation and try to connect with other human beings:\nHsiao-kang, in his car, with a prostitute, and Shiang-chyi\nin the bed of a fellow female Chinese expat. Fresh from\nletting their mutual connection pass too quickly, they\neach hold on too long and too strong, looking for company\nwhere only momentary comfort was on offer. Burned, Tsai\nliteralizes their worsening state of affairs by leaving\nthem robbed-boy of his wares, and girl of her belongings.\nThey sleep heavily, and no doubt will be more sore in\nthe morning.\n\nThen, after staring filmlong into the faces of absence,\nthere's presence.

{"text": "Search\n\nThe French Star Who's at Home on Screens Both Sides of the Atlantic Talks Crime & Passion\n\nWith a handsomely commanding if somewhat wiry presence, Vincent Cassel has been the go-to guy when it comes to finding that continental touch of villainy. Truly making a splash as one of the French punks in 1995's la haine (Hate), Cassel has gone on to play the criminal mastermind of Dobermann, the supernaturally psychotic aristocrat of Brotherhood of the Wolf, the pimp who ruins Clive Owens's life in Derailed, as well as a limber cat burglar who twisted through the last two Oceans movies. And that's just the tip of the twisted iceberg that Cassel plays like few actors anywhere in the business.\n\nIf Cassel's rogues gallery has often caked cinema screens with blood, then it's likely connoisseurs will notice the acting talent that runs with it. As the son of legendary French performer Jean-Pierre Cassel (The Three Musketeers) and husband to Monica Bellucci, it's not as if Cassel hasn't been able to play men of some principle as The Crimson Rivers' cop and the distraught boyfriend of Irreversible (with his character avenging Bellucci's). But somehow it's the humane energy that Cassel puts into his most popular, immoral bent that makes evil acts understandable if somehow even likable, even when he's about to kill a baby as the pathetic crime heir of Eastern Promises. For Cassel is the kind of bad guy whose magnetism always puts audiences under his wild-eyed command.\n\nMuch of the same can be said for the real-life super villain Jacques Mesrine, a master escape artist, robber, and likely killer. Yet his panache made the thousands of people he'd likely victimize into his number-one fans. Now the stranger-than-fiction escapades of Mesrine provide Vincent Cassel with his ultimate bad-guy role. Over the course of two riveting films, Cassel gets to indulge in alternately humorous and horrifying acts that make our Scarface seem like a piker as Mesrine rises to public enemy number one. It's a cavalcade of kidnappings, beatings, awful prison stints, and animal attraction that Cassel gets to make mincemeat of. But make no mistake that his performance resembles any cartoon crime lord. In Cassel's capable hands, Jacques Mesrine is very much human, alternately likable and terrifying in his rush to become France's answer to John Dillinger \u2014 an amazing performance that truly puts Vincent Cassel at the top of the criminal world.\n\nDaniel Schweiger: They say that an actor has to truly empathize with the characters they play. Given the number of villainous people you portray so well, how much do you love Jacques Mesrine, and how much do you hate him?\n\nVincent Cassel: While I always need to understand my character, I'm not the kind of character who needs to like him or hate him, so there's no passion from me toward Mesrine, but I am very interested in the contradictions he provokes. Many times, when we were shooting, I would turn back to the director and say, \"We're going to lose the audience because what this guy is doing right now is awful.\" But the deal was to recreate the magic that happened in Mesrine's lifetime, and even though this guy did all those terrible things, people still like him. So the deal from the start was not to hide anything. Yes, we're going to keep Mesrine a racist. Yes, we're going to keep him violent with women. Yes, we're going to keep him killing people. But eventually, people might still root for him. And that's Mesrine's \"magic.\"\n\nDS: Mesrine starts out like Scarface's Tony Montana, in a way \u2014 a criminal with a moral code about whom he maims or kills, but that line gets crossed with the audience very quickly, which makes it even more troubling when we end up rooting for Mesrine to escape the cops. What was it that shocked you the most about Mesrine's actions?\n\nVC: It's in the second film, when he tortures a journalist. The guy was a real extreme right-winger. He was terrible. A scumbag. But he didn't deserve what Mesrine did to him. Mesrine's accomplice even took us to the cave where it happened and gave us all the details. But somehow the reporter lived through it all, and when they accused Mesrine of trying to kill him, he said, \"No I didn't try to kill him or he'd be dead.\" He probably survived because Mesrine couldn't aim properly. His friend said, \"I had to keep the reporter down with my foot with each and every bullet because he moved so much!\" That's the truth, and it was scary to hear that. I just wanted to get rid of that scene and move on.\n\nDS: What do you think are the biggest tonal differences between part 1 and part 2 of Mesrine?\n\nVC: The storytelling is different. Public Enemy #1 is a little more classical. Killer Instinct is more about getting into the ego of the guy, where everything becomes too much. There are a lot of jump cuts from one thing to another because it's more about the craziness of it all. So in that way, I think the second movie is more complex. I think it's also more depressing because the first one is the rise of the guy, which is pretty inspiring in terms of energy. Then, in the second one, the guy goes crazy so he goes down, down, down until his death. That makes it a little pathetic, a little sadder.\n\nDS: Do you think there's something specifically \"French\" about Mesrine? Or do you think there's kind of a universal \"language\" that master criminals like him, John Dillinger, and Pablo Escobar speak?\n\nVC: Having played bad guys on a regular basis, I'm approached by people who are like them in real life \u2014 big dealers \u2014 and I realize that they love to be portrayed in cinema. I've talked to bank robbers who identify with Scarface. He might not exist, but they want to be him. It's like they recognize themselves in him.\n\nDS: When we meet Mesrine in Algeria, he's already doing some horrendous stuff under order of the French army. In that way, do you think Mesrine is a government-made killer who really isn't to be blamed for what he was shaped into?\n\nVC: I think it maybe was justification that he found for his actions. Jacques Mesrine had a problem with authority. Doing these movies, I've discovered that people like my father, who came from the same generation as Mesrine, were ashamed of their parents because they lost the second World War. So when the war in Algeria happened, they were all willing to go there to wash the honor of the previous generation. It's a very strange psychological mechanism.\n\nDS: Do you think criminals like Mesrine want to be movie stars when it all comes down to it?\n\nVC: I think that when you're a real tough guy, you're not making movies. You have something else to do, yet I think they would still like to have the recognition and all the glam of so-called celebrity. But you don't get the same adrenaline because there's no real danger in acting. Yeah, you can fuck up your career eventually, but that's the worst thing that can happen to you. When researching my characters, these robbers would tell me crazy things for advise, like what happens when you go for a heist. Your heart's pumping because you have no time. You have to hit the guy, and he has to feel you all the time until you're out of the bank. \"Gun in the face! Gun in the face! Don't let him think for one second.\"\n\nDS: They had actually made a Mesrine film back in 1984.\n\nVC: Yeah, but it was really bad. I think you can see bits and pieces of it on YouTube. It was made for no money. It was very stiff. Plus, it was too fresh. There were a lot of things that are portrayed in that movie that people couldn't really tell the truth about at the time. The trial concerning Mesrine's death ended like a month before we started shooting \u2014 30 years later!\n\nDS: What do you think really happened?\n\nVC: I think the guy got too loud. The government felt like fools at the time. They just decided to terminate Mesrine, even though they never called it that. In '78, one year before he died, Mesrine was the favorite celebrity of the French people. Everybody was looking for him, and he still managed to give an interview threatening the government. It was a cover story which showed Mesrine with a machine gun and hand grenades. At that point, the government just said, \"Enough. Stop everything you're doing right now and concentrate on finding him. We want to get rid of this guy.\" So Mesrine died because he was too loud. Even today, there hasn't been one murder that Mesrine has been accused of committing where he's been proven to have been the actual killer. So we don't even know that Mesrine truly killed anyone.\n\nDS: One of the best scenes in the two Mesrine films is in part one, where he goes mad in ultra-solitary confinement. I can imagine it's one thing to psych yourself up to play the tough guy, but it's another to be absolutely convincing as someone who's gone mad because of prison torture. What was it like shooting those scenes for you?\n\nVC: A lot of people are telling me about how harsh that scene is, but it wasn't the roughest thing to play because it's all fake, really. The water was kind of warm, and the things they were hitting me with were soft, so it's all about the choreography and the acting really. I didn't suffer that day.\n\nDS: You certainly made me believe it.\n\nVC: It works. That's what it's all about. It wasn't the roughest thing really. Actually, I think the roughest thing in Mesrine for me to play was when I had to torture that reporter. It was a very strange day because I felt like Mesrine's accomplice was truly excited by what he was showing us. He was excited by the revival of that moment. I just wanted to shoot that scene and go.\n\nDS: One of the first movies I truly noticed your criminal talents in was 1997's Dobermann. It's an incredible, ultra-violent crime film that has yet to be released in this country.\n\nVC: I know. Miramax bought it and kept it in a locker room forever. Dobermann was pretty new for the French cinema at the time. We were killed by the press. They called us fascists. They called our director, Jan Kounen, a \"Mussolini-an\" director, whatever that means, but I guess when people get crazy about a movie, they start to use that terminology. But it also means that they've been touched by it, one way or another. If there's a movie I've done that Mesrine also reminds me of, it's Read My Lips. I think Mesrine is a mix of Dobermann and Read My Lips a bit because it has the craziness and graphic violence of Dobermann but in a less cartoonish way, and Mesrine also has the texture and truthfulness that Read My Lips had.\n\nDS: For me, your true talent at playing so many great bad guys is how you invest even the worst of them with a real humanity, especially as Kirill in Eastern Promises, even when he's about to drown a baby.\n\nVC: If I've got a good guy to play, I'll find the dirt in him. And if it's a bad guy, I need to find the bright side to him. I think it's that \"bright\" side that makes the villains more \"real\" on screen than the good guys. The truth is that we all do terrible things. Maybe not to that level, of course, because most of us don't kill or rob banks, yet we all have skeletons in our closets. We cheat, we lie, and we can be cowards. But if you want to play a hero, you can't really use those things. When you play a bad guy, you have to use those things. So all together, I think bad guys are closer to reality. They're more human to me, most of the time.\n\nDS: I read that they're going to be doing a sequel to Eastern Promises. Would Kirill be back for it?\n\nVC: Definitely.\n\nDS: What's happened to him since?\n\nVC: I'm not going to tell you, but the idea is to make a sequel that would be shot in Russia using the same crew. I'm dying to do it because I really like the character \u2014 the complexity of him being a hidden gay person. Hopefully the film is going to go. It's not quite sure yet, but I know David Cronenberg wants to do it, and I think Viggo Mortensen is interested, so hopefully it's going to happen.\n\nDS: Another one of my favorite villain parts you've done is playing Jean-Francois in Christophe Gans' Brotherhood of the Wolf. Now you're set to be in his Fantomas, who is a famed French super-villain.\n\nVC: Fantomas is going to be a huge movie in terms of budget. It's going to be around 60 million Euros, if not more, and we're going to shoot it in 3D. It's a superhero movie, except that they are all super-villains and their battlefield is the world. So that's the idea of it.\n\nDS: Like Despicable Me?\n\nVC: Kind of, except it's not a cartoon, but it will involve a lot of high technology and CGI. Fantomas was the master of disguise, but because this is more futuristic, we'll use some kind of holograms and I will use other actors' personas. I will be dressed with CGI and I will look like other actors, but it will always be \"me.\"\n\nDS: You and your wife, Monica Bellucci, are essentially the Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie of France. In a way, do you think it's easier to be that kind of superstar couple in France than in Hollywood?\n\nVC: Definitely, but we're not as known as them so it's a different scale and it's a little more normal, I guess. Here, that kind of celebrity culture comes to an extent that is really insane. People started to think it's normal, and that's the worst part of it, I guess. In Italy, they can also be stupid like that. But in France, I think we still have some kind of dignity about it. You can still sue people if they take pictures of you.\n\nDS: What does it take to be the go-to Euro villain of Hollywood?\n\nVC: First of all, I don't really feel like that, but I don't mind. I started with la haine, where I wasn't a good guy. Then came Dobermann and Irreversible, so it's not like I have to make an effort to play bad guys. It's something I like. I say \"bad guys\" so people understand me, but to me, they are not bad. They're just complex.\n\nMusic Box Films' 'Mesrine: Public Enemy #1' is released on September 3, 2010."}
{"text": "Review: 'Windtalkers' flat, by-the-book war movie\n\nWoo's, Cage's pyrotechnics overwhelm film\n\nBy Paul Tatara CNN Reviewer\n\n(CNN) --Now that a new age of warfare is upon us, so is a new age of war movies. Hollywood has yet to release any battle films that were made after the sad awakening of September 11, but the pictures that were kicked into development by \"Saving Private Ryan's\" success are establishing new boundaries for onscreen violence.\n\n\"Windtalkers\" is a textbook World War II melodrama with enough carnage to convince the \"Black Hawk Down\" crowd that it's an unflinching depiction of real combat. Well, maybe it is, and maybe it isn't. But no amount of burning, blasting, stabbing, and shooting can hide a weak script.\n\nThis is supposed to be the story of Pvt. Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach), one of the many Navajo radio operators who relayed combat instructions during World War II, via a code that was based on their native language. The enemy never managed to break the code -- Japan and Germany had no Navajos -- but that didn't stop them from torturing any apparent American Indians they captured to see if they'd spit out the answers.\n\nSo Yahzee is teamed up with Sgt. Joe Enders (Nicolas Cage), a physically and spiritually wounded combat veteran whose mission is to protect Yahzee ... or to kill him, if it looks like he's about to fall into enemy hands.\n\nMissing the point\n\nThat could have been a pretty good movie, but the screenplay, by John Rice and Joe Batteer, is quickly victimized by a common Hollywood back-pedal: It mostly ignores the minority figure in favor of focusing on a white guy.\n\nThis pivotal misstep can also be traced to the fact that Cage, for whatever reason, is a big movie star, while Beach is a relative newcomer. And you don't gamble with such an expensive picture.\n\nThe result is a wishy-washy storyline that feints toward importance while settling for blood-and-guts and a string of \"war is hell\" clich\u00e9s. Some of these scenes would make John Wayne blush. Woo breaks out the been-there-done-that early on, when we see Enders receiving the head wound that will torture him throughout the picture. When one of his men dies in his arms, Cage plaintively screams \"Noooooooo!\" before he, too, is taken out by a grenade. It's hard to be moved when you're so busy giggling.\n\nThat's just the beginning, though. Yahzee is written as a near-saint who, until cornered, gently sidesteps the racism provided by the vicious hick in the platoon. His quiet Navajo buddy, Pvt. Whitehorse (Roger Willie), on the other hand, occupies his time by playing tunes on his flute, which enables him to forge a Special Interracial Bond with harmonica-playing Sgt. Henderson (Christian Slater, but it could have been anybody for all he's asked to do).\n\nThere's also the usual scene where the guys talk about their unique plans for making a fortune when they \"get outta here.\" This leads to Slater's character ruminating for an entire sentence over how he's hoping to sell a newfangled product called \"yogurt\" once he gets home. Don't ask me.\n\nNo emotion\n\nOther characters include a gruff, by-the-books officer (Peter Stormare) and a pretty young nurse (Frances O'Connor) who falls for Enders when he's in the hospital. It should come as no surprise that they warm to each other the night before Enders is shipped off to hell in the South Pacific, or that he's haunted by horrifying flashbacks at every turn.\n\nAnd then there's Cage's by-now requisite histrionic performance. Though Enders is supposed to be haunted by the men he lost in that early battle, his bulging eyes and toothy snarl look exactly like Nic Cage trying desperately to convince us that he's a killing machine.\n\nIt's no secret by now that Woo can orchestrate a complex action scene like nobody's business. But you don't really sense any fear or anguish in these men because everything about the movie, aside from the flying body parts, is cartoonish.\n\nA master of pulp -- and Woo made some terrifically compelling action pictures when he was still in Hong Kong -- should stick with what he knows best. If there's too much weight to the subject matter, the whole thing sinks in the blood.\n\n\"Windtalkers\" contains bad language and as broad an assortment of violence as you can imagine. It isn't lingered over, but you have to leave the theater to avoid it. This one is a missed opportunity, which places it a step above most pictures nowadays, where there's basically no opportunity at all."}

{"text": "Circuit interruptus.\n\nMenu\n\nDaily Archives: September 5, 2007\n\nThe reckoning is here! The scoring is very arbitrary and specific for these films, but the last set of figures represent things I've found I look for in every movie. Production values are something that often mean nothing (the best looking movie can still be shit), but it's where I'll give bonus points for nice photography or an excellent score. Unique selling points account for cool moments that cannot be classified otherwise. Oh, and sorry for using an obnoxious corporate phrase.\n\nAs for liveliness, a degree of coherent energy can make up for a lot of other failures, and by that I don't mean crazy pace. Something slow-paced, e.g. Jonathan Glazer's widely hated Birth (off the top of my head), barely moves at all, but there is an intelligence and plan for maximum effectiveness to that film that many films lack despite the frenetic editing or stunt-packed explosiveness or otherwise skillful filmmaking. It's just apparent there's some attention to pacing beyond making individual scenes work in a certain way, something that extends from committed and thoughtful performances on set down to the arc of the movie, and whether it works as a progressive ebb and flow from the first moment to the last, i.e. has the director figured out the movie's parts and whole from a God position instead of just focusing on the money shots, for lack of a better word. It sounds silly and nitpicky, but I'm always surprised at how many talented or untalented directors nowadays can't be bothered to figure that out. ::shakes cane at whippersnappers on their skateboards::\n\nUgh, it's something I've been thinking about for a while, and hope to explain better in the future, as well as come up with a better word for it. Not right now, though. We've got facing/off to do.\n\nI will admit, kneejerk dislike of the leads didn't help here, but as much as Schreiber and Thewlis get on my nerves, I'll admit they're talented, intelligent actors (cursed though they are with sinuses that function as reverb chambers). Here, though, they just give up, sleepwalking through the movie with just enough awareness to point their faces in the right direction. Gambon and Farrow bring it back through sheer insane effort, but John Moore really wasn't paying attention to some of the performances, and thus we get a mixture of apathy and shrill annoyance.\n\nYes, Thewlis' death was great fun, but once cinema has offered the sight of someone sliced into pieces by a flying wire fence (as in Final Destination 2), or a skull chopped into pieces by a dislodged engine (as in Final Destination 3), you've got to try hard to top it.\n\nLowest scores possible for originality, as it's pretty much a Van Santing of the original movie. As for cliche, perhaps it's a bit unfair to judge the script on that, but Moore offers nothing directorially that could sway me. Everything is filmed exactly the way you would expect it. As for offering something you can't get elsewhere, you've got the superior original and the macabre Final Destination trilogy, which not only loses the religious guff (a secular horror movie about fate!) but presents pregnancy as something positive and hope-inspiring. That those movies are horribly bleak is both an unfortunate side effect and a USP. ::sigh:: I really like those movies. Omen overall total: -69\n\nA truly appalling, cynical cash-in movie, and further casting doubt on the ability of John Moore to create anything memorable in his career, other than the awesome plane crash scenes in Behind Enemy Lines and Flight of the Phoenix.\n\nFor all the film's faults, Hopkins did get a bunch of talented actors and didn't get in their way too much, as opposed to Moore's higgledy-piggledy approach. Swank especially tries hard. I just can't hate on her. Her taste in projects is often way off, but she commits to it, at least. Andrea Frankle, playing Robb's mother, was in the movie enough to register, but was given nothing to do other than be a red herring. She might be good given something to do, but here she was ill-served.\n\nPlot elements specific to this film: Elegant transmission of exposition: -2 Crazy deaths: -2 Ridiculous character names: 0 Grasp of London geography: N/A (If you could see the London Eye above the bayou, it would win hands down.) Fair treatment of women/reproduction: -10 Avoidance of lazy dream sequences: -7 Survival of ethnic sidekick until final frame: -7\n\nTotal = -28\n\nIf only this film had a Bugenhagen, or death by satellite-crashing, it would register more. Instead the earnestness swamps anything, with only the staging of the locust scene making an impression. It's the only proof that the crew were awake during the planning of the movie. However, see below.\n\nNot as cynical as The Omen, and certainly the dour atmosphere tends to suggest Hopkins thought he was making something more than a silly potboiler, but it doesn't hide the lack of imagination, not to mention the derivative script. It rips off many better movies, and the best scene in it, i.e. the locust attack, is nowhere near as emotionally affecting or dramatic as the locust scenes at the end of Days of Heaven. Completely different film, but infinitely more compelling. Some nice photography and effects, though. Reaping overall total = -48\n\nBland to the point of barely existing. It looks a lot better than it should, but it's a film that just didn't need to be made. Not that that's a bad thing; lots of films don't need to be made, but they can still transcend that and become something great. A half-hearted rehashing of better plots without the wit or imagination to rework them, play homage to them, or push them to an insane level of melodramatic hysteria, is not what I have in mind, though.\n\nSo, in a fairish fight, The Reaping wins through superior acting and some nice production values. But as you can see from the score, it's a Pyrrhic victory. In fact, here is an accurate representation of the Biblical Horror Movie Fightbot Face/Off, from Stuart Gordon's massively entertaining Robot Jox.\n\nOh, the humanity! Those final shots show what me and Canyon's brains were like once the movies were over. Damn you biblical horror movies! We should have rewatched Exorcist III. And pooed ourselves with fear."}

His homosexuality isn't his entire being, either, and it's those other aspects of his life that form a bridge between him and his roommate.\n\nThis movie, which is just under twenty minutes in length, is a brilliant showcase of what short films are capable of achieving in the right hands.

{"text": "There are plenty of moments in its 150 minutes when Inception is flying in mid-air, uncertain whether there is a safety net or a parachute of coherent plot to explain its entire exhilarating enterprise. Don't ask to have its theory of dreaming spelled out in foolproof detail, just know that the age-old love affair between dreaming and the movies has been reasserted. Above all, treasure the film's serene lack of exhausting violence or ingenious cruelty. Yes, there is action aplenty, with car-chases and gun-battles, all edited with insolent speed, as if to admit that we all know a chase and a shoot-out are just familiar riffs, shaggy dog stories, the tunes of nostalgia, like Edith Piaf. And shiver a little that Piaf has been used in a movie where Marion Cotillard is the raw-eyed emblem of hurt feelings.\n\nThis absence of \"R\"-heavy violence isn't just a way of letting the teenage audience into the theatres without subterfuge. It's part of the airy sense of play that oxygenizes the picture. Indeed, the thing I like best about Christopher Nolan's film is that with all the attendant prospects of a Big-Time Metaphor (film equals dreaming), and the chance of major World-Ending Political Intrigue, the mission impossible here is as silly and evanescent as why people play golf, chess, or postman's knock. It's just that the game is pretty and passes time in an elegant, harmless way.\n\nSo, projected enemies are shot down, like the phantom figures in a videogame, but all the characters survive\u2014because we are asked to like them, and to admire the spirit with which they play the game. It. You get attached enough to the plucky stance of the dog for a couple of hours, but you could as easily have admired the splendor of the pocket battleship. Of course, this detachability in feelings and needs is very fair to the relaxed and rootless air of dreaming\u2014that aspect of experience (so like the movies) where we learn that the show is everything, so long as it doesn't matter so much that you start taking it seriously and believing it's Life. The deepest link between film and dream is that we are safe in our dark, no matter that the bright hurtling locomotive (the screen) comes so close.\n\nIf you want a measure of the film's wit, of its tongue- in-cheek delicacy, just notice how the intrigue is all achieved in the first-class cabin of a long-distance air flight. No matter the dream's turmoil, these people are cushioned and placed in the most artful bed-seat, gently mulling over the flight's choices\u2014the game hen in cilantro aspic, or the chilled lobster DeMille. There may not be such a dish, except in dream, but I name it to hark back to the impassioned vulgarity, the urge to see new things, that inspired that pioneer filmmaker.\n\nSo don't be put off by the way millions are flocking to Inception\u2014just study the ease with which these audiences are floating over the bits of plot they can't follow, carried along by the witty good nature of the film. And that's the crucial novelty.\n\nChristopher Nolan has tended to be a little gloomy in the past and that sometimes left him looking solemn. What really works in Inception\u2014and means so much to the future of movies\u2014is its grace, its ease, its happiness in being an entertainment and a game.\n\nAs I go back to it, and we all will, I think this truth will emerge, that amid its stunning visions of Paris folding up like a clever box and cliffs crumbling like abandoned tenements, it has the panache of a comedy. Leonardo and his gang do a great job with their inane task, but it could have been Laurel and Hardy getting a piano up those steps.\n\n4 comments\n\nI couldn't disagree more with this characterization of Inception as witty, graceful, light-on-its-feet, deft, fun, etc. These words describe Hitchcock movies. Inception was humorless, pretentious, clunky, and dull by contrast. Far from taking the plot -- Hitchcock's \"MacGuffins\" -- with a grain of salt, this movie is dominated by explaining, in turgid detail with non-stop inane chatter, the particulars of the conceit. The movie spends more time explaining the rules of the game than playing it, and, when it does play it, it feels like it's running out the clock.\nThe following is well-observed: \"It.\" Because of this, nothing feels at stake. We don't care about the wound, the loss, the destiny, and so we don't care what happens, which is necessary to enjoy a movie.\nMy theory about why people aren't bored out of their minds watching bits of make-believe is not that they care about the plot or the MacGuffin, but that they care about the people -- that even escapist entertainment is, in the end, \"character-driven.\" The characterization need not be complex, or literary, or even true to life, in order to capture our attention. We need a reason to give a shit. Often in light entertainment, chracterization comes in the form of, at a minimum, a *personality*. DiCaprio's character lacks personality. He's just a vessel for the silly plot. He's a big MacGuffin himself -- the due diligence, the thing that doesn't really matter. But once plot and character are zeroed out, there's nothing left to care about, and you just want to leave.\nAre the images beautiful, arresting,or witty? Not so much. The dreamscapes mostly resemble banal reality, like a rainy afternoon in an anonymous downtown city, scene of one of several tedious shoot-em-ups. Dreams are actually weird, freaky, trippy. These dreams are not remotely dreamlike. They don't scratch the surface of what dreams, or the unruly subconscious, are like. We get inside human heads and what do we find? Something unsettling, disorienting, intriguing? Nah, we just find another mundane battleground for some action sequence that pales next to Bond or Bourne.\nDo characters crack jokes, or crack smiles? Nope. (Remember, they don't have personalities.) How about the music? Any Hermann-esque style? Nope. Hans Zimmer blasts a lot of noise in rhythmic pulses, as if to say, This Is a Big Deal -- not We Are Having Fun. The love of DiCaprio's life, for the most of the movie, is a demonic presence. The drama of the film -- what little there is -- is downbeat, and surrounds an ugly suicide. Altogether, the general feel alternates between dull and sour. Panache of a comedy? I'm unconvinced that Thomson saw the movie, or stayed awake. Perhaps this reflects his dream version.\nIt injects a little play into the last moment, but of the cliched, chessy sort, like tacking a question mark onto \"The End,\" and serves merely to convince us of what we already knew -- that nothing that happened before was worth caring about.\n\nPeople seem to be split on this one. I enjoyed it. I thought it was a playful homage to multiple past genres, from the one last heist to Freud with a side of Hitchcock (or vice versa) to Tarkovski's slow-motion symphony of memory, dream and reality\u2026there was even an obvious nod to Fred Astaire's Royal Wedding.\nThis dream-within-a-dream tesseract is genre-within-a-genre, Borgesian Noir. More playful then original, it invites, and eventually forces multiple interpretations.It brings to mind Ecos's \"opera aperta\" where meaning meanders freely un-imprisoned.\nThe film itself is an inception a seed where interpretations uncertainty and doubt grow like ivy in the mind. If you let them.\nIt may require an acquired taste, to which naysayers may answer \"so does poo\". I'm not commenting to tell people why they should like it\u2026only why I liked it (and I don't \u2013yet- like poo).\nIn the end for me Nolan wove a entertaining jaunt into hyper-reality, which is everything I ask for when I go to a movie.\n\nWhy is Salt, a disposable star vehicle, better than Inception, a supposed modern classic? The answer lies in the fundamentals.\nCharacter: I said before that even escapist entertainment is character-driven, because caring about the characters is a prerequisite to caring about what happens to them. You like Jolie from the start, and are invested in what happens to her. The same can't be said about DiCaprio's character. Why not? DiCaprio is an excellent actor. But Jolie has the charisma of a movie star. DiCaprio looks and sounds boyish and twerpy and needs strong material to shine, as he did in Aviator and Revolutionary Road. Jolie needs only her easily expressive face and screen presence. Both Salt and Inception begin with the familiar trick of placing the hero in peril from the git-go, but Salt immediately takes a step back to allow the character to project intelligence, charm, and warmth, such that when we're plunged into the action ten minutes in, we're already sold. You could argue that Inception concerns a mystery about Cobb, and the movie has to maintain some distance from him. But Salt even more obviously concerns a mystery about its hero -- is she a good guy or a bad guy, \"Who Is Salt?\" It doesn't matter! We root for her even when the evidence suggests that we should reconsider our allegiance. Inspiring loyalty that leads us to suspend rational inquiry and moral judgment is the stuff of movies and story-telling. You might even say that it's the stuff of love. As Hitchcock, Wilder, and countless lesser Hollywood hacks knew, movies are a romance. Since the wonderfully engaging Memento, Nolan seems to have forgotten that.\nAction: What happens to this character we care about? She's chased. Chases are better than shoot-outs, because they move. They distill the notion of suspense to its essence. The action in Salt is well choreographed and shot -- more sweepy than jolty, thankfully -- and it feels taut. *This* is fun. For all its movement from dreamscape to dreamscape, the actual set pieces in Inception are curiously static and dull.\nPlot Construction/Length: We don't need to be rigid about this in the manner of Screenwriting for Dummies -- as in, you must have three acts, divided by two plot points. But it's worth noting that Salt follows a familiar pattern and sustains our interest, whereas Inception is ponderous and meandering. Having established a character we care about and plunging her into the action, Salt pulls the rug out twice at well-spaced intervals on its way to a satisfying conclusion a mere 90 minutes later. Done and done. Inception is a full hour longer, and it never pivots. I believe the technical term is \"switcheroo.\" Inception doesn't have any. It just plays out the caper more-or-less according to plan, with some fresh perils thrown in that feel arbitrary. It peels away Cobb's character, but the reveal packs no punch, because something of the sort had been telegraphed ad nauseum and, as I said, we don't care about Cobb anyway. The half-assed suggestion at the end that we might still be in a dream doesn't count, although something of the sort could have worked if Nolan had taken the trouble to work it out. Imagine a movie that starts the third act with a revelation that everything you thought was happening was really in DiCaprio's head, that his subconscious was being invaded by extractors not working for him but who are on some other more interesting mission, that DiCaprio is laboring under an implanted idea, that he and not Cillian Murphy is the target of the caper -- something along those lines. Too obvious? Maybe, unless it's all skillfully befogged and revealed. (Some have suggested that Nolan was actually going for something like this, and that it's so well befogged that I missed it, and that you have to see it twice or thrice in order to decipher the clues, and so forth. I doubt that this is what's going on, but, even if it is, I don't go to the movies for a homework assignment. Seeing it once should be enough to understand what happened.)\nMusic: Inception's score goes like this: \"Booooom. Booooom. Booooom. Booooom.\" Salt's, of the Bourne school, goes like this: \"Ta-ta-Ta-ta-Ta-ta-Ta-ta-Ta-ta-Ta-ta-Ta-ta-Ta-ta.\" This is a nice illustration of the difference between the two movies. Slow and bellowing vs. quick and light.\nSex: Here, Salt doesn't score so well. The elimination of sex from the genre, in favor of a fanboy's vision of what's sexy, is a whole other topic under the heading The Decline and Fall of the Hollywood Thriller. I suppose that Jolie's sex appeal was enough to check off this box, though barely. But Inception has zero sex appeal. *That's* certainly not Hitchcockian! Cotillard is mostly a demon presence or off her nut. There's not a hint of a real relationship there. Page's sex doesn't register in her anticeptic role. On the whole, Inception is ironically barren and lifeless."}
{"text": "Formula One is close to meaningless in America, but the longer you watch this movie the more you get hooked. By the spectacle, the racing, the athleticism. Ayrton Senna wins the Brazilian Grand Prix and passes out, it was just that much of an effort, just that draining. Walking through the crowd after coming back to, he keeps imploring people not to touch him, he's in that much pain. When you're a superstar, you're no longer beholden to your fans, you're beholden to your art. Which is why we never expect Van Morrison to tweet, why it's unnecessary for the Belfast Cowboy to be nice to his audience.\n\nAnd who knew Formula One was so political? You'll wince when the powers-that-be go against Ayrton, snatch away victory for a reason that's never been employed previously, despite being in the rule book. Making him start on the wrong side of the grid, even though he won pole position. In the Internet era, you get to do it for yourself, you can avoid the b.s. The younger generation has got no idea how freeing this is, the same way today's young women don't appreciate all the rights their mothers won for them back in the seventies.\n\nAnd it all comes down to the car. The greatest driver can't win if the wheels are bad. That's one of the unseen problems with so many sports. He who has the best equipment has a huge advantage. At the elite level, a small edge makes all the difference.\n\nAnd then we watched \"The Other F Word\". The movie about being a punk rock dad.\n\nWe needed to be cleansed after \"Senna\". Ayrton's so alive in the movie, yet so dead in real life.\n\nNot quite as watchable, I wish wannabes could see \"The Other F Word\". Because I've yet to see a film that depicts the tedium of the road so well.\n\nHere's the story. They were rebels living in SoCal beach towns. They played punk music not for tomorrow, but today. No one even believed there would be a tomorrow. And so many punk musicians never did make it.\n\nBut those who did\u2026\n\nNormalized. To a degree. They got married. Had kids.\n\nAnd now, to support their families, they've got to go on the road, hundreds of days a year. Not because they love it, but because they have to pay the bills.\n\nOne of the great scenes is when Jim Lindberg says you've got to hold your tongue. You're in some far-flung town and you've got to be nice to the audience when really all you're doing is counting the days until you can get back home, you're wasted, you're pissed, using drugs just to get by.\n\nLindberg's choice is Ambien. Yup, sleeping on the road is impossible. First of all, you're in a bus with not only the band, but the crew, it smells like a locker room. And when you check into a hotel, it's not the Four Seasons, but the Comfort Inn, it's barely habitable and the food makes you yearn for home cooking.\n\nYou've got an audience that will support you, but you've got to satiate it to stay alive.\n\nAlthough they're tattooed and pierced, they're just like you. Maybe worse off. These tend to be blue collar gentlemen. If they're not playing music, they're\u2026working in a print shop, as one ex-member of Black Flag is doing.\n\nSomehow, as a result of the burgeoning classic rock scene and then the MTV explosion there's a conception that playing music means you're rich, that it's a 24/7 party, that the highest and best occupation is playing music.\n\nThat's wrong. That's all it is, playing music. You've got to love it, otherwise it's tedious. Not only do you miss out on normal life, taking your kids to school, being there for their birthdays and Halloween, you've got to endure the endless road, arguing with your bandmates and wasting the 23 hours a day you're not on stage. It's some weird bizarro world, where not only do you not get to do what you want, but most of what you do do is positively awful.\n\nNow if you're in your twenties, if you're just out of the house, the road is an adventure. But it gets old real quick.\n\nEveryone in music complains that they just can't make money like they used to, that the Internet and the public have screwed them. But no matter how much money they pay you, going on the road becomes an endless repetitious tunnel. The only saving grace is the music. And if you're lucky, the money.\n\nIt's like God hit a giant reset button. It's like someone flipped the Monopoly board. We're starting all over, building up from the ground. And if you don't need it, it doesn't pay to do it."}
{"text": "Categories\n\nCheck out the Archives\n\nOf Interest\u2026\n\nAwards & Nominations\n\nI am torn. Savages feels as if Oliver Stone somehow found a way to stream his thoughts on celluloid for the world to devour at their leisure. It's bright, vibrant, random, illogical, contrary, obtuse, surreal and visceral \u2013 often all at the same time. It's far too uneven to earn an unqualified recommendation, as it's a disorienting mess of a film at the best of times. However, it's also consistently interesting, a strangely compelling. Savagesmight be too all over the map to ever be consistently great (or even good), but it is never boring.\n\nThat's a savage mask!\n\nSavages barely hangs together as a narrative film. In fact, that's where the bulk of the flaws lie. The characters are painfully over-written and the plot depends far too much on double-cross and intrigue for its own good. In many respects, Savages feels overloaded, a little too packed with characters and conspiracies to really fit within the confines of a two-hour film, without seeming fit to explode at any given minute. The story itself seems at odds with Stone's style and technique, and the two never really find a way to co-exist. It seems like they are constantly at war with one another.\n\nYou know there's a problem with a film like this when you sympathise more with the bloodthirsty, torturing, raping, killing and necklacing Mexican drug cartel over the three kids selling dope to sick people. Our lead trio are played by a bunch of young actors to varying degrees of success, but they're the root of the film's problems. These are three cardboard cut-out archetypes. There's the pacifist. There's the hothead. There's the girl with messed up issues. These aren't any more complicated than the archetypes you'd find in a disposable slasher film.\n\nYep, so it's a bit like The Hangover\u2026 except, you know, with more brutal murder and torture and less monkeys\u2026\n\nIn a way, their shallowness kinda works with rapid-fire stream of thought style Stone brings to the film. The problem is that the script resists it. The script over-compensates for their shallowness, giving us awkward philosophical tracts and seemingly endless narration in an attempt to build character. \"You don't change the world,\" the hothead tells the pacifist. \"The world changes you.\" Deep, man. Our narrator goes on and on about how great the three of them are and how they've got their stuff together, and how they're fundamentally decent people.\n\nThe only problem is that dialogue is terrible, and Blake Lively can't make it work. \"I have orgasms,\" she explains at one point. \"Chon has war-gasms.\" It's supposed to be smart, but it's just terrible, as if you're waiting for a shot of her firing imaginary guns at the camera while winking. But she's too busy \"$%#!ing the war out of him\", her own radical post-traumatic stress counselling technique. The movie demonstrates it's working wonders. She talks about the pacifist, telling us his philosophy is \"Buddhist\", while also assuring us that the hothead's philosophy is \"baddest.\"\n\nI can only imagine what the first draft looked like\u2026\n\nIt's the type of faux!deep nonsense that you get when an intelligent writer tries to use a less literate character to deliver a philosophical point they feel strongly about. It's an attempt to couch a statement in a way that feels like it could organically come from that kind of person \u2013 it's blending Eastern philosophy with valley girl chic, and it's often quite terrible. It gets so bad that the audience doesn't even care about these three people caught in a war with the big and ominous cartel.\n\nAfter all, the gangsters might be shallow archetypes, but at least they're honest about it. Stone wisely surrounds his young leads with more competent elder actors, and its these cast members who turn in the best performances. Salma Hayek's Elena is perhaps the most compelling and engaging character in the movie. She's no more complex or sophisticated than the leads, but she gets massive points for rather brilliantly exposing just how incredibly shallow the trio are. She gets the single best line in the script, and it's one that the movie might have been a bit wiser to pay more heed to, bu the movie instead struggles against her astute observation and trying to convince us that the three leads are actual more than just a bunch of entitled stereotypes.\n\nIt's a common misconception that bad guys twirl their moustaches. Del Toro knows that real villains stroke their moustaches.\n\nBenicio Del Toro plays the effective villain of the piece, who literally spends most of his screentime stroking his moustache and demonstrating that Tom Hardy hasn't quite cornered the market on intense accented characters. Del Toro's enforcer is almost ridiculously one-dimensionally evil, but the actor pitches his performance perfectly. This man is a violent and aggressive psychopath, a misogynist, a bully, a murderer and torturer. He couldn't exude any more evil if he tried. Del Toro embraces the archetype, and produces a fascinating and compelling performance.\n\nDemi\u00e1n Bichir has a nice small role as a cartel right-hand man, and John Travolta makes the most of a relatively tiny role as a DEA agent who has one priority alone: looking out for himself. These elder veterans do a much better job than Lively, Taylor or Kitsch. They seem to realise that they're trapped inside something resembling a fevered dream, and embrace the elegant simplicity of their characters. While the script frantically pads these characters with monologues designed to craft the illusion of depth, the older actors are smart enough to accept that less is more, and to embrace the archetypes they inhabit, rather than struggling against them.\n\nGrease is the word\u2026 to describe what they're doing to the wheels of justice\u2026\n\nAnd yet, despite these fundamental problems, there's something strangely hypnotic about the way Stone constructs the film. Lots of quick shots and ambient music. Occasionally he'll switch filters or go for a weird close-up, or give us a nature shot, or a montage. He brutally juxtaposes the images on-screen and the soundtrack, setting a cartel execution to classical music, and keeping the score going as he transitions effortless to a shopping excursion.\n\nThere's a wonderful energy all this, and it often seems like the movie is tripping over itself, as if it has so ethereal and quality that it can barely get ahold of itself. It's occasionally frustrating, but it's also strangely engaging. At one point, towards the end, Stone even gives himself a \"do over\", as if literally editing the movie as we watch it. He decides that a certain scene doesn't work, so he goes back and does it again, from a different angle, with a tweaked outcome.\n\nIt's her way or the Hayek way\u2026\n\nOf course it's all painstakingly scripted, but Stone does it with enough skill that the audience doesn't know whether to be excited or appalled by his boldness. It seems as if Stone's subconscious was chewing away on a movie about drug dealers, and his subconscious just sorta coughed the whole thing up in one chunk for his conscious mind (and ours) to parse. There are times when the movie seems to abandon its narrative, plotting and characters, and just becomes this melting pot of images, music and ideas. These are probably the strongest moments of the film \u2013 as Stone often feels trapped by the paint-by-numbers plotting and the shallow characters.\n\nWatching the film, it seems almost as if Stone is discovering the film as we are. That works! That doesn't work! Okay, but what if\u2013? Hm, that was good, but then\u2013? It's an experience that is compelling, but also feels a little reckless. It's rather unlike most films, and it takes a while to adapt to it. If you can let yourself get swept along, there are more than a few lovely moments to be found, surreal diamonds in the rough, like fragments of a barely-remembered dream. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to discover Stone had imagined the whole thing one night after reading the book, almost exactly as it turned out on screen.\n\nI want some of what Stone was smoking..\n\nUnfortunately, Savages isn't nearly consistent enough to stand up to that sort of scrutiny. Stone's style is fascinating, but the content itself is far too mundane to really suit it. It's a hard film to wrap my head around. Truth be told, I am still trying to sort out precisely how I feel about it. It's not a great film, and I'm not even sure I'd argue it's strong enough to be a good film. But it is an interesting film, and one that will contain a few mercurial moments for a suitably open mind. The problem is that those diamonds are buried with an awful lot of coal."}
{"text": "Now that we know something of the visions, allusions, and conceits behind Matthew Barney's Cremaster Cycle, it's important to acknowledge that you will, in all likelihood, scarcely be able to juggle all of its metaphors as the nearly seven-hour epic unfurls. This art-world novice spent most of his marathon screening barely moving on from an extensive game of \"Spot That Reproductive Organ,\" as far as decoding its symbolism goes. So let's forget about its conceptual merits for a while, because while The Cremaster Cycle is undeniably a textbook example of the barely scrutable piece of video art, it is also a thoroughly cinematic experience.\n\nBut/so, are they good movies? I'll give you five answers, in sequential (if scatologically descending) order: no, god yes, yes!, only after it's over, and sort of but not really. The success of each Cremaster film basically correlates with Matthew Barney's experience and confidence behind the camera, which grows in leaps and bounds from Cremaster 1 and 4 (from 1995 and 1994, respectively) to the operatic bombast of the three-hour Cremaster 3 (2002).\n\nCremaster 1 is the most technically and symbolically rudimentary of the five films, but it's a crucial introduction to the basic visual vocabulary of the Cycle. In it, two Goodyear blimps hang over the blue Astroturf football field of former-athlete Barney's hometown of Boise, Idaho. On the field, dancers with creepy plastic smiles (\u00e0 la David Lynch fantasies from Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire) gather in varying formations representing female reproductive organs; above, bored stewardesses smoke and mill about the two blimp cabins, identical save for the color of grapes that fill a table; in a womblike space under the table, a bombshell writhes in her constricted space, yanking grapes down from above her, which then fall out through the heel of her shoe in formations mirroring the action on the football field (you'll chuckle at the very early CGI). The soundtrack is a mundane din on the blimp, and a jaunty orchestral score on the field.\n\nThe problem with the short (40-minute) piece, apart from that barely anything happens, is that its bold colors and arresting visuals are undercut by a student filmmaker's sense of framing and timing. The cross-cutting is choppy and random, the sound editing is worse, and the theoretical magnificence of the dancers on the football field is hampered by the limited shot selection used to explore this space.\n\nCREMASTER 2\n\nCremaster 2 (1999), on the other hand, is an atmospheric, dimly lit, and barely coherent stunner. Not that you'll get it, but the plot connects Gary Gilmore's 1977 murder of a gas station attendant to a covered-in-bees Johnny Cash (who, as played by Morbid Angel singer Steve Tucker, called Gilmore on the night of his execution) to Harry Houdini, who, as played by Norman Mailer(!), may have been Gilmore's grandfather.\n\nNone of this is terribly important, because it's all awesomely portrayed. Dig Barney, playing Gilmore and looking like an eyeless Ted Kaczynski, spends untold minutes stuck in an (again, womblike) vehicle at a gas station, molding something out of Vaseline(/semen) before murdering a poor attendant named Max. Bask in the stunning execution sequence where horses and, later, buffalo reenact the exercise in formation Cremaster 1's dancers did, this time in an Arctic landscape (dig that cloud cervix!) guided by Mounties and American police, in the midst of which Barney rides a bull. Watch the severe Victorian-seeming woman in a black veil ask Mailer-as-Houdini, \"How did you fare tonight . . . with your metamorphosis?\" The soundtrack throughout shifts from horror-movie organ music to the bustle of bees to a country two-step. Cremaster 2 proceeds with the logic and hallucinatory vividness of a fever dream."}
{"text": "By turns warmly sentimental, serial-killer sinister and science-fiction fantastical, The Lovely Bones was an unlikely book to achieve worldwide success. In the film version, those mismatched elements come back to haunt the story, so to speak, making the final product more hit-and-miss than unblemished triumph.\n\nParents need to know that director Peter Jackson's drama based on Alice Sebold's best-selling book The Lovely Bones centers on the aftermath of an enormous tragedy: the death of a child (though the actual death itself isn't shown on screen). The intense subject matter -- murder and molestation -- may overwhelm younger teens. Although the movie's messages about love and loss are ultimately positive, the film is often deeply sorrowful and, at times, quite violent (images include dead bodies, bloody clothes, and more). Language includes mostly name-calling; there's also some kissing, and one older character smokes and drinks in front of children.\n\nFamilies can talk about the movie's messages. Do the violence and intense subject matter make it harder to see the positive take-aways, or do they come through?\n\nHow does the impact of the violence in a movie like this compare to that of an action/sci-fi movie? Which affects you more? Why?\n\nTalk about the events that lead up to Susie's murder. What lessons can be gleaned from the tragedy? Why is Susie stuck in the in-between?\n\nHow did Susie's death affect everyone, including herself? Dothese reactions seem believable? How doeseveryone find peace?\n\nThe good stuff\n\nMessages: Though it centers on a shocking murder, the movie takes great pains to juxtapose the violence with love and domesticity. Loss, though destabilizing, is portrayed as far from decimating. Death isn't explored as an end but a passage.\n\nRole models: Yes, there's a murderer/pedophile involved, but besides him, the movie's characters are decent and earnest -- as well as realistically imperfect. Though the mother reacts in a surprising way to her daughter's death, her love for her child comes through; the father is more textbook caring. And the younger sister is impressive in her courage and determination.\n\nWhat to watch for\n\nViolence: Brief flashes of a man grabbing and throwing a teenager to the floor and against the wall (though her actual death takes place off screen). He's also shown carrying a bloody bag and soaking in a tub, his blood-stained clothing strewn on the floor. The sink is filled with bloodied water. A safe that presumably holds a corpse is repeatedly shown. The bodies of a serial killer's victims are shown in the various places where they were dumped. A teenager beats up a man with a baseball bat; the man is later shown bruised and battered.\n\nSex: Some kissing. Implied pedophilia.\n\nLanguage: One \"f--k,\" plus occasional use of words like \"hell\" and \"oh God\" (as an exclamation). Also some name-calling, including \"jerk off,\" \"moron,\" and \"stupid.\"\n\nConsumerism: Some labels and signage are visible (Kodak, Seventeen magazine).\n\nDrinking, drugs and smoking: A grandmother chain-smokes and drinks heavily in front of her grandchildren.\n\nFan Reviews provided by\n\n\"OUCH!\" by dck39648\n\"Ouch,\" the book screamed, as Peter Jackson yanked a fair story from its pages and slapped it stupid with cloying morosities.

{"text": "The Lucky One\n\nCan a drama be too restrained? \"The Lucky One,\" adapted from a Nicholas Sparks novel, stars Zac Efron in a sudsy romantic melodrama that in the 1950s would have been directed with lurid overkill by the likes of Douglas Sirk.\n\nWould that this tepid, inert enterprise had Sirk's nerve and verve. Instead, director Scott Hicks lavishes good taste and sunsets on a story that - devoid of genuine tension, conflict or combustible chemistry between its two stars - just prettily sits there.\n\nEfron plays Logan Thibault, who as a Marine in Iraq happens upon a photograph of a beautiful blonde and proceeds to see the picture as a talisman that saves his life. When he returns to the United States, he tracks down the girl - who turns out to be a single mother named Beth (Taylor Schilling) - and begins working in the dog kennel she runs with her grandmother, played with vinegary acumen by Blythe Danner.\n\nAll great romances hinge on two things: keeping the principals apart and getting them together. When a conclusion is as foregone as the one in \"The Lucky One,\" the first part of the equation becomes nothing but contrivance and ginned-up conflict. Here, the obstacles consist largely of Logan's attempts to tell Beth why he has come to Louisiana (changed from North Carolina in the book), but choking handsomely on his words.\n\nHuman Dreamsicle Efron has buffed and tattooed himself to the bulked-up extreme for his big dramatic turn in \"The Lucky One,\" but the role of a stoic, expressionless philosopher-soldier requires that he tamp down his natural exuberance and physical grace, a regrettable misuse of his native talents.\n\nSchilling possesses the natural beauty of Reese Witherspoon mixed with the less processed charm of Leslie Mann, but her travails with a bullying ex-husband and sensitive son don't quite qualify as dramatically high stakes.\n\nMost of \"The Lucky One\" consists in proving how sensitive Logan is (he reads Melville and plays the piano with a suitably faraway look) and how put-upon Beth is as she clatters around her grandmother's impeccably distressed cottage and affects Veronica Lake-esque bangs-in-the-eye sultriness. (Surely one index of age is the reflexive desire to tell an actress she'd be so much prettier if she'd get her hair our of her face. But really, Schilling would.)\n\nIn 2004, \"The Notebook\" - from another Sparks novel - became a bona fide sleeper hit, catapulting the relatively unknown Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling to newfound stardom. \"The Lucky One\" tries hard to re-bottle that lightning, to no avail. Some bolts are best delivered out of the blue"}

{"text": "'The Master' is a mixed bag of good and bad\n\nCampus Correspondent\n\nPublished: Monday, October 1, 2012\n\nUpdated: Monday, October 1, 2012 22:10\n\nWhen the credits begin to roll in the movie theater, people always turn to whoever they came with and say something simple like \"that was so good\" or \"that was so bad\" or even sometimes \"what the hell was that?\" When \"The Master\" ended I sat there in a state of awe and shock, unable to find any words to explain my two-and-a-half hour experience. This may sound like a good thing, but \"The Master\" left me in silent awe because I was so unsure of what I had just seen that whether or not I liked it wasn't even relevant. In one sentence, \"The Master\" is about so many things that it kind of goes right over its own head as well as the audience's.\n\nThere were two things I did manage to take away from the film. Firstly, Joaquin Phoenix and Philip-Seymour Hoffman will win Oscars. Joaquin Phoenix is so creepy as a lonely insane drifter. Philip-Seymour Hoffman does a phenomenal job imitating the founder of Scientology, and the chemistry between the two is strong. Both do such great jobs that they really make the film interesting all on their own, and I say that because that's all that really moves the film along. Second, Amy Adams will at least be nominated. Adams does a great job as always. She plays Hoffman's wife. While she doesn't manage to steal the stage as she usually does, when Phoenix and Hoffman aren't around she reminds us why we've all come to love her so much. She is really creepy at times!\nPaul Thomas Anderson's previous films \"Boogie Nights\" and \"Magnolia\" are constantly referred to as two of the best films ever made. He seems to have lost his touch in \"The Master.\" While the acting is outstanding, there isn't a plot or much of anything to go along with it. There isn't a single likeable character. Freddy is supposed to be our hero, but he's literally insane. The film states this. Anderson has said that this film is about the effect of war on soldiers mostly, rather than Scientology, but we never see or hear about what sort of things happened to him in the war and it's never brought up. What we do learn is that Freddy's mother was insane and institutionalized, he's been drinking paint thinner for years, he's addicted to sex and is a violent pathological liar. It's implied he was like that before the war. So the war effects argument doesn't add up. What we do see is this religion that mirrors Scientology being constantly questioned and criticized. At one point the founder's son even says, \"He's making it all up.\" We see that Freddy never believes the religion and just sticks around because he is lonely and hates his life the same way the others in the church who weren't raised into it are. So this film is basically about debunking Scientology and showing what kind of people the director believes are attracted to it.\n\nAll in all, the film is an interesting look at Scientology, but I don't know enough about the subject to say how truthful it is to the real-life people behind Scientology and to the church itself. It tries to be about a lot of other stuff too, but fails to develop any of it. You probably won't like a single character or understand their motives, and the last five minutes shouldn't have even been there. It is so well done and acted that I can't say it's a bad movie, but it's certainly no \"Boogie Nights\" or \"Magnolia\" that we'll be talking about after Oscar season."}
{"text": "Summary:The immediate subject matter of Crash is the strange lure of the auto collision, provoking as it does the human fascination with death and the tendency to eroticize danger. Most motorists will slow down to stare at the scene of a collision; they may feel their pulses quickening and become exquisitely aware of the fragility of their own bodies. The characters of Crash carry this awareness a step further, cherishing and nurturing it. For them, a car collision is a sexual turn-on, and a jolting life-force they come to crave. (Fine Line Features)\u2026Expand\n\nThe Crash characters sleepwalk through this story in a state of futuristic numbness, seeking extreme forms of sensation because familiar feelings have long since failed them.

Seeing it again a week ago, knowing what to expect, I found it a more moving experience.\n\nWithout the breathing spaces allowed by the long-form, gone are the slow and developing rhythms of the original, its depth of characterization, and its refusal to sentimentalize a really vicious protagonist.\n\nThe problems come in the shadow world, where everything's a jumble, where Dark's compositional strategy ('all clues and no solutions') eventually becomes wearing, and Gordon's direction can't hold it all together."}
{"text": "Cast & Crew\n\nWhen a troubled young mother leaves her baby on the steps of Good Parents John and Lily Malone (Keith Carradine and Farrah Fawcett), do you think they'll take the child into their home? If you don't know the answer to that one you haven't been watching many Movies of the Week, and TNT's Baby is no exception to the baby-in-a-basket formula. So try to keep up.\n\nSet on a bleak and remote island somewhere in the northeast, Baby's setting serves as an apt stand-in for its characters and its theme. Lily Malone is haunted by the recent death of her infant son and shuns the world around her. The 12-year old Larkin (Alison Pill) sees the basket baby as a shoddy replacement for her dead brother, hiding the letters the absent mother sends, letting the family know she's still alive and coming back. Grandma Byrd (Jean Stapleton) is old and dying. The power goes out a lot. And John does a fair bit of tap dancing. In other words, it's all very depressing.\n\nUltimately, Baby probably has a lot more to say than can be crammed into 90 minutes, and what's left on screen has been done before, time and time again. It's an admirable effort and scrubbing the Hallmarkitis out of the subject matter, but the haphazard, meandering -- and ultimately, surprisingly hollow -- tale won't have you running back for the \"encore\" presentations."}

Once he makes his first sale, Yuri is hooked on the feeling of\nmaking big money for selling firearms, and continues to sell the\nfirearms but he wants more and more of a profit and more and more of a\nchallenge. It's not until an Interpol agent (Ethan Hawke) is hot on\nYuri's case that he begins to question the nature of his business and\nwhether what he is doing for a living is moral and if he should be\nresponsible for the hands these weapons get into and what they are used\nfor. A powerful performance by Nicolas Cage, as well as a great\nthought-provoking movie ensues I love movies like this one for a few\nreasons. The main reason is that for the most part you can't predict\nwhat is going to happen next or where the film is going. Another reason\nI like movies like this is because it's powerful and its makes you\nthink. And lastly I like a movie like this because it doesn't end in a\ntypical way and actually leaves you feeling blown-away and surprised.\n\nThe filmed starred Nicolas Cage who lately has done of some the best\nwork of his career. His performance here is top-notch and powerful.\nThere are so many other people in the film including Jared Leto, Ian\nHolm, Ethan Hawke and Bridget Moynahan to name a few who are also very\ngood at the roles they played. This film is written and directed by\nAndre Niccol the same man who wrote \"The Terminal\" and \"The Truman\nShow\" so I guess I shouldn't be so surprised by why I actually liked\nthis film so much, it had a good lead actor and a good screenwriter.\n\nI guess this movie all comes down to how open minded the movie-goers\nwho see this are. I guess it also amounts to where you stand on the\npolitical fence. The film is not for those who don't have an open mind\nabout things that are going on in the world today. The movie is based\non true events so be warned that some of things shown in the film are\nhappening in real life or did happen at one point in time. To be\nhonest, I do believe what the film states in the end, it doesn't seem\nat all far fetched. It's like Yuri says in the film \"it's not our war\nand no matter what we do we can't stop it\" and that's true it's like\nsmoking kills people every day but there are people who run cigarette\ncompanies everyday knowing that they are killing people every single\nday and getting people addicted to something that in the end will kill\nthem. Is that moral? What can we do to stop it? These are questions\nthis film asks and leaves it to the viewer to decide on.\n\nSo in the end, this movie isn't for everyone. In a sense this film is\nkind of like the movie \"Blow\" because it's about a man who feels his\nlife isn't complete without selling something that is bad. He has\neverything he could ever want but still needs to sell the firearms.\nIt's an amazing and powerful story which I feel really puts things in\nperspective as far as us Americans look at things. Nicolas Cage's\nperformance is incredible as he seems to not care at all for the\npeople's lives he puts at stake every day and when it comes to his own\nlife he still seems unemotional and doesn't seem to worry. Personally I\nthink this is one of the best film's of year and is in fact just as\ngood as the other political drama currently released called \"The\nConstant Gardner\" so if you have an open mind about things and enjoy\nmovies that will make you think, well check out \"Lord of War\" because\nit's well worth the price of admission at the theater"}

{"text": "Rosetta, the new film by the Belgian filmmakers\nLuc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, is an undeniably major film. It's also nearly unwatchable.\n\nThe film's difficulty begins in its\nsubject matter. Like its predecessor, 1996's brilliant La Promesse, it details the squalid events in the life\nof an impoverished child. Rosetta (Emilie Dequenne) lives in a rural trailer park with her\nalcoholic mother. She survives by poaching fish and selling clothes, all the while\nstruggling to find the security of a real job. La Promesse was populated\nwith a rich assortment of characters and situations, which provided some relief from the\ntragedy of its main storyline. Rosetta is far more single-minded: Dequenne is in\nvirtually every frame of the film. Her world is one of strict limits; she knows only\na handful of people, and is in constant conflict with them all. This concentrated focus should draw\nus into a deeper understanding of Rosetta, but the film's relentless visual style\nprecludes any such identification. Every shot is handheld. Dequenne is most often framed\nin medium closeup from behind: for nearly a third of the film, we watch the back of her\nhead. The film opens with Dequenne running through the factory at which she's just been\nlaid off, the cameraman chasing behind her, struggling to keep her in frame. It's an\naudacious formal choice, but an exhausting one: twenty minutes go by before the camera\nfinally settles, allowing us a moment to breathe. The framing keeps us from watching\nDequenne's face: we rarely see her eyes, and we're never provided shots from her point of\nview. Since we can't see her, and we can't see the world as she does, we are kept at arm's\nlength from her. None of the other characters are really developed - it's Rosetta's film -\nso we're left with no real point of entry. Dequenne's feral performance, though\nimpressive, exacerbates this. Her determination to break away from her life is so complete\nthat her sole motivations are survival and escape. She rages through the film, attacking\nor betraying everyone she encounters. We see enough of her life to understand this drive,\nbut it doesn't make it any less trying to endure. It's rare - and brave - for a film to\nfocus so intently on such a defiantly unlikable character while so completely discouraging\nour sympathy. Yet despite the obstacles the film\nthrows in our way, it manages by its final, shattering scene to be affecting on its own\nterms. For most of its length, the film carefully cultivates an enormous distance between\nits heroine and the audience. This is broken in a nakedly emotional scene that is all the\nmore overwhelming because of our inability to step inside of Rosetta before that moment.\nLike La Promesse, the film refuses any easy resolutions or pat sociological\nexplanations, and we're left exhausted and brutalized. Rosetta is anything but\npleasant, but it is a formidable achievement nonetheless.\n- Gary Mairs"}
{"text": "Parents say\n\nKids say\n\nWhat parents need to know\n\nParents need to know that The Intouchables is an award-winning French drama based on the true story of a wealthy quadriplegic and his down-and-out personal aide. Like most odd-couple stories, the drama includes worthwhile lessons about friendship being deeper than the superficial differences that divide people (in this case, race, wealth, education, and physical ability). It's subtitled, but there are about 10 translated uses of \"f--k,\" as well as \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" and other insults. There are several references to sex, an ongoing comedic flirtation between a man and an uninterested woman, and plenty of cigarettes, wine, and even some marijuana -- used both medicinally and for leisure.\n\nThe Intouchables offers valuable reminders about how you can't assume anything about anyone regardless of their wealth, education, or physical abilities. Philippe and Driss' trusting, open relationship proves that race, status, and disability don't have to be obstacles to understanding and unconditional friendship. Disability also doesn't have to stop a person from finding love.\n\nEven though they're employer and employee and of different socioeconomic and racial backgrounds, Philippe and Driss grow to respect and love each other, and each changes the other. Their odd-couple relationship transcends superficial differences and becomes based on their mutual ability to see beyond what others see in them.\n\nDriss intimidates a couple of guys (one of them a teen) by shoving them against a wall and getting in their face. The police -- with guns drawn -- handcuff and act rough with Driss until they notice Philippe in the car. Driss' younger brother is under a drug dealer's thumb. An older woman slaps a younger man. At one point, Philippe, a quadriplegic, looks like he's in distress and even about to die.\n\nA man shamelessly flirts with and propositions an uninterested woman, who sometimes plays along by unbuttoning her top a few buttons while the man disrobes down to his underwear. Bikini-clad \"massage therapists\" (prostitutes) have to be told not try to go below the waist. Teenagers make out until they're interrupted. A woman who's revealed to be a lesbian suggests a \"threesome\" but is doing it as a joke.\n\nThe movie is subtitled, so only French speakers will understand the spoken curse words. But in the subtitles, there are about 10 uses of \"f--k\" and even more of \"s--t,\" as well as \"a--hole,\" \"ass,\" and insults like \"moron,\" \"idiot, \" \"insane,\" \"jerk,\" \"crazy,\" and the occasional religious exclamation.\n\nThe movie takes place in France, where smoking cigarettes is still very common. Several characters smoke them, and adults are also shown smoking marijuana. Wine and cocktails are shown at every meal or party, and a teen girl purposely combines anti-diarrhea medication with painkillers after she's dumped (she's OK, though). A sick man takes many prescription drugs and uses pot to help with his appetite. A teen boy is arrested for marijuana possession.\n\nWhat's the story?\n\nThe award-winning French drama THE INTOUCHABLES is about a rich, white Parisian quadriplegic who hires a black ex-con as his live-in personal assistant. Loosely based on a true story, the story follows how paralyzed aristocrat Philippe (Francois Cluzet) gives down-and-out petty criminal Driss (Omar Sy) a chance to be his health aide, even though there are many more qualified applicants. At first, Driss is skeptical and even disgusted by some of his responsibilities (like bathroom duty), but soon enough the two very different men come to understand and respect each other -- and help each other above and beyond any employer-employee dynamic.\n\nIs it any good?\n\nAs unlikely friendships in movies go, the one between Philippe and Driss is purely on the sweet and inspiring side. There's nothing all that complicated about their alliance. Wealthy Philippe and street Driss understand each other and can teach other the respective importance of Beethoven and Earth, Wind and Fire. Though Philippe can't drive, Driss can use his legs to drive Philippe's Maserati fast and furious, providing a thrill that Philippe thought he'd never feel again.\n\nAlthough deeper issues about the socio-economic divisions that separate Philippe and Driss aren't substantively explored, The Intouchables is a fantastically acted, surprisingly funny film. It's obvious what Driss gets from being Philippe's aide (a steady income, a ridiculously beautiful place to live, and all the other luxuries that being part of Philippe's household staff offers). But it's equally obvious how Philippe benefits from the relationship: He gets a sense of spontaneity, a lust for life, and a companion without pity. It's no wonder why France selected the feel-good movie as its 2012 submission to the Academy Awards for best foreign language The Intouchables teaches about disability. Why was Philippe happier with Driss as an aide than the other, more objectively qualified assistants? How did Driss treat Philippe differently than the others?\n\nSome critics have said the story dismisses any deep exploration of the differences (particularly race and class) between the two men. Do you agree?\n\nHow does the movie portray smoking? How is it different in that regard than an American movie?\n\nCritically acclaimed French drama goes a thin line between PG-13 and R!\n\n\"The Intouchables\" is a French drama based on a trues story. It was a huge success in Europe, bith financial and critical. I actually was surprised that this movie wasn't nominated for the Academy Award as \"Best Foreign Language Film\" since in Europe, this was the most acclaimed movie of the year.\n\"The Intouchables\" is a witty and sweet story about a friendship between the handicapped, but wealthy Philippe and the big-mouthed african-origined Driss. While they are both minorities, they both have faced the dark side of life. The two very different people learn from each other, and a very strong friendship begins.\nWhat makes \"The Intouchables\" more than just a French version of \"The Odd Couple\" is its original way of storytelling. It is serious and comic, both touching and funny. it is one of the few movies that doesn't focus on political correctness, but still treats everyone with respect. This is not a big budget Hollywood movie, and that what makes its charme. It lacks the structures we are used to, and brings in something new. Sometimes you don't need a plot twist or a highlight to make a movie good. If you expect a pure drama or comedy movie, you will be disappointed. But if you're open for something new, you'll be fine with this movie.\n(SPOILERS may follow:)\nThe movie is neither violent nor sexual. There are some verbal references to sex and sensuality (a character gets aroused by getting his ears rubbed), but it is at the PG-13 level.\nThere is one scene in which characters smoke marijuana, but there is not much talk about it. Since i'm strictly against drugs, I don't know if this will appeal to others. But it is not that strong. Know your kid.\nThere are about 10 uses of the f-word (in subtitles), very infequent.\nThis movie goes a thin line between PG-13 and R. If there was no language, it was PG-13 for drug abuse and some mild sex references.\n(END OF SPOILERS)\nI think it is okay for teens and up.\n\nGREAT MOVIE-ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE STUDYING FRENCH!\n\nThis is a fantastic, uplifting, movie with great messages about making the best of what you've got and never giving up. Some of the sexual references in this movie can be a bit confrounting (e.g. a man is aroused by people licking his ears) and there is a considerable amount of strong language. However, by the time your child is 15 I believe that there is nothing that they wouldn't be able"}

{"text": "Email\n\nShare\n\nMore I Watched This On Purpose\n\nNo related Where to start? Caligula is the rare sort of film whose production seems more relevant to its storyline than its actual content. It's a monstrous, shambling wreck that infuriated its director and its screenwriter, thoroughly embarrassed its cast, and so appalled critic Roger Ebert that he was unable to sit through the entire two-and-a-half-hour running time. (He gave it zero stars anyway, calling it \"sickening, utterly worthless, shameful trash\" in his review.) Most critics were equally dismissive. Bob Guccione, the recently deceased founder and publisher of Penthouse magazine, financed the film with little understanding or interest in how big-budget epics were actually shot, ultimately firing original director Tinto Brass and editing footage into a hash that removed what little sense may have originally existed in Gore Vidal's screenplay, and inserting hardcore sex scenes to spice up a movie already loaded with enough naked flesh to make David Duchovny blush. Wikipedia currently lists an astonishing nine different cuts of the film, including the 102-minute R-rated version, the 156-minute unrated version, and the horrifying-if-real 210-minute work print. Given its salacious content and infamous reputation, it's no surprise that Caligula has been released on home video and DVD multiple times; the only surprise would be if anyone watched it all the way through more than once.\n\nCuriosity factor: If reading the previous paragraph doesn't make you even a little interested in watching the movie, well, you're made of sterner stuff than I. A porno starring Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole, and John Gielgud? Oh hell yeah. I was under no illusion that Caligula would be any good at all, and that 156-minute run time did make me nervous (yes, I went with the unrated cut; would you expect less?), but some movies persist in the cultural memory simply because they're so outrageous, we can't help but be delighted they're real. Oh of course it's trash, and of course it's filth and perversion and horse-fucking and girl-on-girl and Peter O'Toole being crazy and Malcolm McDowell fisting a dude and\u2014wait, what was I saying? Right. It's trash, but in concept at least, it has the potential of being gloriously transgressive trash.\n\nWarning: All of these clips are decidedly NSFW.\n\nThe viewing experience: Transgressive? Yeah, maybe, although not in any way that matters. Trash? Honestly, I'm uncomfortable with the moral component there. I've heard nothing of anyone being assaulted or brutalized over the course of filming that I could find, so \"trash\" is probably going a little far. It's stupid, but not hatefully stupid. Glorious? Er, no. Aside from some impressive pieces of set design and the occasional strong performance or striking shot, \"glorious\" doesn't fit here. \"Sleazy\" would be more appropriate\u2014and that's a moral-ish word I do feel comfortable using, because I'm pretty sure Guccione was aiming for it. Watching Caligula is like flipping back and forth between a prestigious but dull historical epic and a movie in which people masturbate a lot. The masturbation may be some kind of symbolism, but when you're watching actual genitalia onscreen\u2026 well, to paraphrase Freud, sometimes a dick is just a dick.\n\nIt's tempting to blame most of Caligula's flaws on Guccione's meddling, and there's little doubt that his additions\u2014including, most infamously, a five-minute lesbian sex scene that doesn't have anything to do with anything beyond being a five-minute lesbian sex scene\u2014were distracting, pointless, and, by the end, irritatingly dull. During a late-movie orgy sequence, I'd swear I saw the same woman giving the same guy the same blowjob at least six times. Apart from ruining any sense of narrative momentum, the constant assault of fuckery just gets old. It starts as shocking, becomes compelling in a Rube-Goldberg-meets-the-Marquis-De-Sade kind of way, but by the time you hit your third finger-bang, the magic is gone.\n\nEven stripped of its sexual content, though, this would be a slog, though admittedly a much shorter one. Again, much of the problem can be laid at Guccione's feet. His influence in the editing room changed the order of some scenes, which probably didn't much help the story's attempts at rising action, not to mention scene-to-scene continuity. Yet I can't help but wonder whether Vidal's screenplay and Bass's original vision would've been anything more than another by-the-numbers historical epic without the interference. There would have been nudity, and there would have been a quality cast, but as it now stands, this is an epic that mimics a standard rise-and-fall arc without ever generating any drama outside a few isolated moments. Obviously, it's impossible to judge what might have been, but this is fitfully intriguing at best.\n\nTake the plot: Malcolm McDowell plays Caligula, inveterate sister-fucker and heir to not-quite-dead Emperor Tiberius (Peter O'Toole). The movie opens with a familiar quote about gaining the world and losing one's soul, but let's be honest here: When your idea of a perfect day involves romping naked through the woods with a sibling, then screwing that sibling to your heart's content, the soul train has already left your particular station. Caligula and his sister Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy, who replaced Maria Schneider) form the closest thing to a positive, loving couple in the entire film, and something could've been done with that. As creepy as their situation is, at least this is a starting point of (incredibly comparative) wholesomeness.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no place to go from here, because there's no sense of anything important being lost once Caligula takes over Rome. Tiberius, who spends his days bathing, groping slaves, and hanging out in what looks like the hell set from The Apple, comments on what a bastard his heir is, and Tiberius' advisor, Nerva (John Geilgud) kills himself to avoid living under Caligula's reign. Maybe not everybody understands what's coming, but Caligula's rise to power and his instantaneous corruption seem like inevitable outcomes of his poisonous upbringing and his own built-in crazy. There's nothing wrong with that for a movie\u2014inevitability is one of the cornerstones of tragedy\u2014but aside from the spectacle, and the initial curiosity as to what the nutty bastard will come up with next, there's surprisingly little drama here. Caligula commits atrocities, anonymous attractive people grope each other, rinse, repeat. (Not kidding on the \"rinse\" part.)\n\nLate in the film, Drusilla catches a fever (probably from Caligula himself) and dies, and Caligula goes mad. Well, madder, I guess. He goes and hangs out with the common people, who mock him and his dead lover, and that bothers him somewhat. You can tell because he claims he's a god, and then he goes to war against Britain, even though they don't provide an army to fight against. He also declares himself the Pimp Of Rome, and we get the really, really big orgy scene that ties the other orgy scenes together thematically. My grasp of Roman history is limited to what I remember from Robert Graves' I, Claudius (Claudius shows up a few times here, but is never anything but a joke), but much of this seems familiar; what's odd is that here, the story seems almost sympathetic to the strutting, venomous creep. We see most of the movie through his perspective, and he's largely opaque, doing ugly things one scene, rending clothes and mourning his sister the next. Apart from the personality-free victims of his atrocities, none of the people in the film distinguish themselves as worthy of our admiration or emotional investment. So who cares?\n\nBut hey, what about that cast? Nobody winces on camera, and they all manage to escape with their dignity intact, which is the most anyone could hope for. Performance-wise, McDowell is just doing a less charismatic version of Alex from A Clockwork Orange, and Gielgud's role barely qualifies as a cameo. Helen Mirren does what she can with what she's given, which is mostly just hanging out and occasionally getting naked. (Her expression of bored contempt when McDowell mounts her from behind during their first sex scene is great.) About the only one to really make an impression is O'Toole. Glowering through a face full of sores, he is gleefully decadent and vile, and when he dies, he takes with him the only thing that could've saved the movie: a sense of humor.\n\nHow much of the experience wasn't a total waste of time: Because I refuse to believe that anything with a naked Helen Mirren in it could be completely worthless, I'll say 30 percent. It's worth seeing as sort of bragging-rights viewing experience, although viewers with weak stomachs are advised to look elsewhere. As a reenactment of history, Caligula is too scattershot to be much use; as entertainment, it's a drag; and as pornography\u2014well, a person can only take so much in one sitting."}

{"text": "Foreign films are cool. Because they're foreign, and they speak foreign languages, and they have plots you'd never see in America, like Bullhead, about a steroid-fueled cattle farmer named Jacky Vanmarsenille who gets involved with a criminal meat trader (those exist?) and is forced to face his tragic childhood as federal agents begin to investigate an assassination of one of their colleagues... Who comes up with this stuff?\n\nOh yeah. People like writer/director Michael R. Roskam, who makes movies, like Bullhead, that are nominated for Academy Awards.\n\nBullhead is up for Best Foreign Language Film, and you can see why. Its premise is just kooky enough, its characters just colorful enough and its plot just sad and disturbing enough to work in ways that it has no right to.\n\nRoskam uses a somber pallet to paint the Belgium countryside as a dark, depressing place full of secrets and innocence lost. Every aspect of the movie feeds from this canvas, from its collection of colorful but tragic characters to its seedy and strange but far from wild story.\n\nMatthias Schoenarrts turns in one of the oddest, subtlest and confusing performances in memory. He is both the film's greatest piece and its big weakness. He plays a meathead -or in this case, a Bullhead - a slightly simple but far from stupid young man whose identity is lost in a swirling concoction of steroids and hormones. He's Lennie Small on steroids - literally - someone who wants to do good but can't, his destiny predetermined by a childhood incident that is shocking and too disturbing to put into words here.\n\nSchoenarrts plays the role perfectly, and yet the character is so distant, so locked away from what he once was that it's nearly impossible to relate to him. There's a small part of me that feels for Jacky, but mainly he deserves what he gets. He's the protagonist and antagonist and Roskam's decision to leave which he is in the end up to the audience doesn't entirely work.\n\nWhen the end credits rolled, Bullhead left me shrugging my shoulders, not at the movie per se but at the character the movie is about. He suffered, he lived and he made decisions that defined his life. What happens to him is shrug worthy. Maybe that's the point, but I wish it wasn't. It's hard to say whether Schoenaerts' performance is fantastic or forgettable.\n\nStill, there's something about Bullhead that's alluring. The fact that you never know how you're supposed to feel. The realization that if not for one minute decision as a child, Jacky would have been an entirely different person. The acceptance that foreign films are cool, because they are in foreign languages and have plots about beefed up cattle farmers that get involved with criminals and murder. That's Bullhead."}

We meet David Norris (Matt Damon), a Senate hopeful in New York who's making his second run for office. Just as some frat-boy antics sink his campaign yet again, he meets a mysterious dancer named Elise (Emily Blunt) with whom he feels an instantaneous intimacy.\n\nThen things get weird.\n\nGuys in gray towardThings start off firmly enough in The Adjustment Bureau. We meet David Norris, a Senate-hopeful in New York who's making his second run for office. Just as some frat-boy antics sink his campaign yet again he meets a mysterious dancer named Elise (Emily Blunt) with whom he feels an instantaneous intimacy.\n\nThen things get weird.\n\nGuys in grey and nudging us back towards40Critical Appeal\n\nThe Adjustment Bureau is loosely based on a short story by Philip K. Dick (\"Adjustment Team\"), and it feels that way -- like something short that's been overstretched and made thin. What the movie doesn't trust itself to show is hurriedly described, and much of the abundant, clumsy exposition falls to Harry (Anthony Mackie), an adjustor who, for some reason, wants to help Norris. They rendezvous on boats and in other moist locations, because in an inexplicable, Shyamalan-esque plot device, the adjustors' powers don't work near water. From Harry, we learn that the agents of the Adjustment Bureau are supernatural beings, eons old, who work for the unseen \"Chairman\" (heavily implied to be You Know Who), tweaking the fate of mortals and keeping them in line with the master plan for humanity. Though they've been mucking around with the fate of humans for thousands of years, for some reason, they dress like they had all of their tailoring done in the '60s. Oh, and they have magical hats. Seriously.\n\nThe Adjustment Bureau manages to pull off the dubious trick of over-explaining itself while still remaining woefully vague and unconvincing. The central conceit -- that there's an agency of government-type bureaucrats controlling our fates -- seems tired from the get-go, and the agents' pseudo-technical jargon about \"recalibration,\" \"adjustments\" and staying \"on-plan\" seems mostly intended to make their bromides about fate less pointless. The ending, I'll simply say, is a triumph of vagueness, with a message along the lines of \"We don't control our own fates, unless we do\"\u2026 or something.\n\n60Guy Appeal\n\nAs a writer, first-time director George Nolfi has a solid resume of films that appeal to guys, including Ocean's Twelve and The Bourne Ultimatum. Since The Adjustment Bureau is basically one long chase scene, you'd think it would, at least, be an exciting ride. But it's not. The bad guys really aren't that bad. They're unarmed, even-tempered and though they threaten Men in Black-style brain erasure at one point, the idea is never revisited. Catching Norris is clearly a hassle, and the agents chasing him seem bored with their roles as destiny's hall monitors. Mostly, they just trail Damon and talk his ear off.\n\nWhen the adjustors decide that Norris is a troublemaker and decide to bring in the big guns (a guy they used to call \"The Hammer\"), you might justifiably sit up in your chair and hope for some action. But no such luck. The Hammer (an intense but miscast Terence Stamp) ends up just being an even older and even more humorless guy in a fedora. All in all, the adjustors simply don't do very much -- though at one point they do rob Damon of the girl's phone number. (How do you like them apples?)\n\nDamon has played a hunted man often enough to be pretty good at it (again, see \"Bourne, Jason\"). His David Norris is a likable and understandably confused guy, and the sad-eyed Emily Blunt plays her character disarmingly and with a saucy wit. The two have good chemistry, and their scenes together are sexy and among the best parts of the film. Unfortunately, they barely get three minutes to themselves before they're interrupted by another gray-suited spook on a mission to scold Norris into giving up on love.\n\nThe fact that you're left yearning for more romantic scenes is mostly a testament to the film's failure as a sci-fi thriller. There are shades of The Matrix and Dark City here, but where those films introduced us to compelling characters and pulled us into challenging curtained worlds, The Adjustment Bureau is dramatically dreary and intellectually flat. When it attempts to engage with the weighty philosophical questions of fate and free will, the film quickly finds itself out of its depth and with very little to say. In other words, The Adjustment Bureau would collapse under the weight of its own ideas, if it were able to get them off the ground."}

William James (the terrific Jeremy Renner, in what should be a career-making turn). James is addicted to the adrenaline of war, and he's certainly found the right job for scoring his daily rush.\n\nJames is part of a bomb squad working in the Iraq War.

It's mad enough that he puts himself in harm's way just for the fun of it, but he's also putting them in danger.\n\nBigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal aren't really offering up a standard story here, a dramatic progression that arcs and releases. Instead, they're simply following these three soldiers as they try to survive a nasty desert war punctuated with bombs built into cars, bombs left along a roadside, bombs placed inside human corpses.\n\nAs with most war films there's a countdown toward the day the men will get to go home that hangs like an ax over their heads. Pull one wrong wire and that day never comes.\n\nIt's tense stuff well tendered and the ever-macho Bigelow (\"Point Break\") is just the woman to explore such dark and sweaty corners. But in the end, the adrenaline addiction is somewhat self-explanatory and a bit limiting dramatically.\n\nThe question isn't how do you live with the buzz of looming death; it's how do you live without it?

{"text": "Posts Tagged 'quentin tarantino'\n\nThe Christmas rush of holiday movies is upon us, and if you find this whole notion of peace on earth is already beginning to wear thin, they offer some harrowing alternatives. Two of them, Jack Reacher and Django Unchained, had their premieres cancelled last weekend because their scenes of gun violence were considered inappropriate so soon after the Newtown massacre. Jack Reacher, which reboots Tom Cruise's career as a action hero, has landed with especially unfortunate timing in light of the Sandy Hook massacre\u2014it opens with a scene of a sniper killing five random civilians, including a mother holding a young child. Django, Quentin Tarantino's tale of slave liberation, is tale of merry vengeance that opens Christmas Day.\n\nJack Reacher opens Dec. 21, along with Judd Apatow's fractious family comedy This is 40. Those two studio pictures will likely lead the weekend box office, but also opening Dec. 21 are The Impossible and Rust and Bone, a pair of potent dramas from European directors that could win Oscar recognition. The Impossible is the harrowing tale of a family on holiday torn apart by the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami; Rust and Bone is a romance about an animal trainer (Marion Cotillard) who loses both her legs to a renegade killer whale. No one ever said escaping Christmas would be a walk in the park.\n\nSo many movies, so little time. Here's the rundown:\n\nJack Reacher\n\nAs a fan of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels, I was as mortified as everyone else when it was first announced that the 5'8\u2033 Tom Cruise would play the 6'5\u2033 Reacher It seemed like a historic coup of miscasting. Since then Child has endorsed both Cruise and the movie, which is loosely based on One Shot, the ninth novel in the Reacher series. Now that I've seen it, I still feel Cruise is miscast, and not just because he's too short. Size doesn't matter so much on the big screen. But character does. Reacher is a rugged Army veteran, a multi-decorated former U.S. Military Police Major, who has gone rogue and become a drifter. Cruise doesn't look like he's a veteran of anything but the gym and the red carpet. Reacher, who has a brutal manner and a forensic intellect, is cool, detached and laconic. He's like a human bullet: smooth, fast and hot. Too intensely polished for the role. That said, he's an athletic actor who is always impressive in hand-to-hand combat. He functions best with blunt, minimalist dialogue, and in that sense he makes the character his own. Continue\u2026\n\nQ: Anyone who takes film seriously in this country knows who Brian D. Johnson is. He's been writing about movies at Maclean's since 1985, he's been to Cannes for the last 18 years in a row, and this will be his 27th year covering the Toronto International Film Festival, and he wrote this book [Brave Films Wild Nights: 25 Years of Festival Fever], which in my opinion should be required reading for any journalist covering the festival. Heck, for anyone who loves movies. Now, Brian, let me get this straight. Your first involvement with TIFF was actually delivering films before you were writing about movies?\n\nA: Oh, yeah. I was a freelancer, and when TIFF came around for three years I paid my dues at the festival by hoisting celluloid up fire escapes to projection booths, which is kind of what you had to do back then. It was really the best job I ever had. I'd pack an Econoline van full of, you know, metal crates of film, and go . . . they treated you like a hero.\n\nQ:Really?\n\nA: You know, people were lined up around the block . . . you know, the organizers are very nervous because if I don't show up with the film . . .\n\nQ:There's not going to be a movie!\n\nA: There's no show. I've never felt such a vital part of the film industry as when I actually delivered the movies to the theatres. It was great. And also it was like going to the gym, you get into great shape.\n\nQ:I can imagine! But then you didn't stop there, you just didn't deliver film, you've had different roles with the festival. Such as\u2026?\n\nA: Well, mostly I've been a film critic, you know, being part of the publicity mill. But I've been a filmmaker, I've had two films programmed at the festival, and this year\u2014I'm kind of dreading it\u2014but I'm an interview subject in a documentary about Garth Drabinsky. So that's going to be a bit weird because, you know, seeing yourself on the big screen is . . . I'm sure that can't be easy. So I'm going to get some of my own medicine, you know?\n\nQ:Exactly! That'll be interesting. Now, listen, when you were a kid is this something that you always thought about? Were films always important to you?\n\nA: Films, no. I mean, I liked movies like any other kid, but movies were not special to me until I became a film critic.\n\nQ:Really?\n\nA: Well, I shouldn't say that. But yeah, so I've had no education in film aside from just watching films at a particularly ripe period during the late '60s and early '70s when that whole kind of New Wave splashed through North America.\n\nQ:You lived through it.\n\nA: Yeah, and everybody who was at all kind of intellectually/artistically inclined, movies were a huge part of your life. I mean, you know, foreign-language films, we all went to foreign-language films, you know, it just was part of growing up in the late '60s and early '70s. So I had that kind of informal education in film. And I was politically involved, I was kind of left-wing, and also, you know, the New Wave movement, and also film criticism itself\u2014although I didn't know it at the time\u2014was kind of a very, you know, somewhat ideological movement. It was critical of the status quo, it was full of all kind of French structuralist nonsense. But I just lucked into it. I went to journalism first\u2014it's a long story, you don't want to hear the whole story, but basically I was sort of into hard news and then kind of flipped into the arts, and when the Maclean's film critic kind of disappeared I stepped into his shoes, knowing a good job when I saw it.\n\nQ:Enthusiastically, I imagine.\n\nA: Yeah, it's a great job, because films are about everything, so you can basically cover every single kind of human activity and write about it in a way that very few other beats allow you to.\n\nQ:You mentioned that sort of the most memorable moments in the festival sort of in the 1980s and in the early '90s were always in the cinema itself rather than at a party. Do you still feel that way?\n\nA: Well, there have been some good parties, but the amount of time that I've spent sort of chasing celebrities and party tickets and all the rest of it, when you come down to it it's just a blur. But, you know, what really does remain with you. It's the films. And that's particularly true in Cannes as well. I mean, you're in this spectacular fairy-tale setting on the Riviera but it's really in the dark room, that's where the magic happens. And I remember in Toronto at TIFF\u2026 like, increasingly as journalists we have to follow, you know, the Oscar pedigree films because that's what people are interested in. But meanwhile the joy of going to a festival, if you're a cinephile, is that there's this whole world of films that you'll never get another chance to see. You know, or the notion of discovering a film.\n\nQ: Right.\n\nA: And I remember once, after my business was kind of done, towards the end of the festival, Ruby Rich\u2014who's an American critic\u2014and I, we sort of said, \"Let's try to find something,\" you know, \"really interesting to go to.\" We went and we saw this film by Claire Denis, a French director, called Beau Travail, which was set in East Africa in the deserts, the moonscape of East Africa, where you had French Foreign Legionnaires choreographed like modern dancers with a Neil Young song in the background, and it's\u2026 it was like dying and going to heaven because of the surprise. You know, it's like you walk into a theatre not knowing what to expect, not knowing what you're going to see, and then you're transported to another world, and that's the magic which doesn't get old.\n\nQ:Now, listen, you deal with celebrities pretty much on a weekly basis, you're interviewing them for stories and so on. Have you ever been star-struck?\n\nA: Well, it's kind of your professional duty not to be star-struck. Inevitably there are celebrities who pose more of an emotional challenge than others. I mean, outside of film. You know, talking to Mick Jagger is kind of the Everest of interviews, you know, what do you ask and how do you. But part of the way you do a celebrity interview is you establish, as soon as you can, that we're both just people and we have our agendas and you're going to try to make it interesting for them because they're on an assembly line. You're not. I mean, you're on a different kind of assembly line where during a festival you're seeing one celebrity maybe after the other, but they're sitting in a room having one journalist after another come in for maybe eight hours? And I'm not saying we should feel sorry for them\u2014it's a privileged existence\u2014but that is difficult and it's difficult to stay fresh. So it's part of my job as a journalist, not quite buttering them up, but you want to kind of find the moment. You know, you want to find a chemistry of some sort, and usually that means that you're going in there with a very specific set of questions, just like if you're playing a jazz score and you've got the score in front of you, but you've got to be ready right from the opening moment; to find a spontaneous kind of hook into it that doesn't feel scripted.\n\nQ:You just gave away all your trade secrets. I feel so lucky right now!\n\nA: One of my favourite TIFF interviews actually was with Errol Morris, the documentary director, who is a famous interviewer, so my first question was, \"What's the secret to a good interview? \" And he said, \"Shutting up.\"\n\nQ: Oh, wow!\n\nA: And then there was a long pause.\n\nQ:Oh, no!\n\nA: It's true, though.\n\nQ:Really? Because then you are forced to fill in the silence?\n\nA: Yeah, in fact often if you feel uncomfortable with a subject and you don't kind of pave over all of the gaps and if you ask a difficult question then say, \"Like, like, you know, when\u2026\" if you don't do that, you just leave an abyss and let the person fill it, there's something about an open mike where people feel they have to say something, whereas if you make it easy for them you're cutting your own throat as an interviewer.\n\nQ:Twenty-seven years of covering the festival, there must be a moment that stands out. Is there?\n\nA: It's a blur. I wish there was a moment that stood out!\n\nQ:Gotta be one, one juicy little\u2026\n\nA: One juicy little\u2026 I mean, there are lots of moments. I remember meeting Quentin Tarantino with Reservoir Dogs\u2026\n\nQ: Wow.\n\nA: . . . before he was Quentin Tarantino, and you're interviewing him, and this guy was talking, I mean, like a mile a minute. He makes Martin Scorsese sound like he's on Quaaludes he's talking so fast. And I'm asking him about violence, you know, and his language is violent, the way he defends his violence, because it's more disturbing than Hollywood violence. And he'd been up all night partying with his, you know, festival rat friends, Robert Rodriguez and all these guys who are, like, this new sub-wave of American filmmakers that were coming along. In retrospect, you think, \"You know, that's when he was just starting out\" . . . and that's kind of exciting when you catch people early on or, you know, if you go to a diner and have a hamburger with Jason Reitman and he's doing his second film, Juno, and you have no idea what's in store for him. Talking to Jane Fonda and sort of studying her complexion. You know, the thing about movie stars that is really interesting when you talk to them, is that in person their beauty\u2014or lack of it\u2014you can't really disguise it in person. You see the person, you know? I don't think I was ever so star-struck by anybody as Gregory Peck.\n\nQ:Really?\n\nA: Just because he was sort of an icon for movies of my youth. And most of all I wasn't expecting much when I walked in. It wasn't, \"Oh, wow, Gregory,\" but the charisma of the guy just bowled me over, I thought, \"Wow, this is a real movie star.\"\n\nQ:That's lovely.\n\nA: Jessica Lange, back in the day, thinking this is the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.\n\nQ:Wow.\n\nA: Madonna, not so hot.\n\nQ:Really? Wow! Wow! Incredible. You heard it here first! I read about, in this book, a place\u2014was it called Heaven? An after-hours sort of disco club that everyone frequented and anything happened and everything did happen and was encouraged to happen. Did anything happen there for you?\n\nA: No, nothing happened. I didn't go to Heaven.\n\nQ:You didn't?\n\nA: I didn't die and go to Heaven, I didn't live and go to Heaven. No, you know, a lot of the festival lore I feel I kind of missed out on.\n\nQ: You were working.\n\nA: And, you know, films get out late, and what are you going to do with Robert De Niro and, you know, Martin Scorcese . . . and it was a time in the film industry where the whole thing was kind of a river of sex and cocaine, you know? So I didn't actually take part in that, you know? I mean, I was in a band at the time, in a different kind of world, but that sort of champagne-and-limousine world . . . escaped me.\n\nQ:It's for the best.\n\nA: Yeah, for the best.\n\nQ:Professional through and through.\n\nA: Well, no, just missing out, I think. Just missing out on it, you know? Yeah, the parties, the parties. And it used to be I would go to a lot of TIFF parties, but now who's got the time, you know? The TIFF schedule is so insane you spend all your time chasing films and interviews and you drop into a party to grab a bite or get a drink or talk to someone . . .but it's definitely the TIFF industrial complex now, it's not as festive a festival as it once was just because it's not so local, it's not so homey, it doesn't really belong to us anymore, it belongs to the world, for better or worse.\n\nQ:I want to ask one more question, if there's something that you're excited to see.\n\nA: Yeah, I think The Master, which is\u2026 I think everybody's excited to see The Master because it comes from Paul Thomas Anderson\u2014Magnolia, etc.\u2014because it stars Philip Seymour Hoffman, and because it is about\u2014or not about, depending who you listen to\u2014Ron L. Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, and the trailer looks great. So that's one we're all dying to see. I'm kind of dying to see the De Palma movie. I mean, De Palma . . . with Rachel McAdams in it. I'm also dying to see the Terrence Malick film, also with Rachel McAdams. So there's those, and there's a lot of good films at TIFF that I've already seen, you know, at Cannes, including Michael Haneke's Amour and The Hunt, a Danish film. There's lots of stuff. You know, it's funny, TIFF gets obscured by the celebrity glitz but the fact is there's still a bedrock of world cinema there that's there for the taking for those who want to expend the incredible energy it takes to actually navigate this festival.\n\nQ:Do you ever get sick of movies?\n\nA: I get sick of bad movies, and the majority of them are not great, but you never get sick of good movies. And whenever you see a really good movie it's like, \"What was I thinking? \" You start to sort of give the benefit of the doubt to kind of okay and mediocre stuff, and then something blows you out of the water and you say, \"Wait a minute, that's why we're here. That's why we care,\" you know? So you never get sick of the good stuff.\n\n500 Days of Summer: This is the one with that anime-eyed chick who has the indie-pop duo, right? And the whole movie is pretty much just her being super mean to some guy for a year and a half? And the title comes from the character being named \"Summer\", which should have been a dead giveaway to her boyfriend that she was a narcissist raised by obnoxious people?\n\nAn Education: I'm guessing the working title was A Pedo-cation. The \"-cation\" is short for \"hour-and-a-half vacation in a movie theatre that's probably not gonna be crowded at all\".\n\nThe Hurt Locker: Whoa, wait, I actually saw this one! Protip: it's the same old buddy-cop movie, only in Iraq. [NOTE: REVIEW IS NOT IRONIC]\n\nInglourious Basterds: I was going to make the standard cheap joke about how Quentin found a way to make Hogan's Heroes look relatively tasteful, but then I remembered that nobody under 80 really has any business questioning the tastefulness of Hogan's Heroes (several of those cast members ran from the Nazis or risked death fighting them or both; the guy who played LeBeau was in Buchenwald). I find myself wondering if maybe QT did us a favour by bringing WW2 back within range of a purely artistic treatment. I'm actually going to watch this later today, so pretty soon I'll be entitled to an opinion!\n\nInvictus: Am I the only one who literally couldn't believe this is the first time Morgan Freeman has played Mandela in a movie?\n\nThe Messenger: Outstanding year for Woody Harrelson, with Zombieland, Defendor, and now this. It's not even a comeback\u2014he's always popping up in cool stuff, even though he's got that Skoal-stuffed Kallikak face and gives every indication away from the set that he started life with an IQ of 80 and gave away about a sawbuck of that smoking the chronic. This is a guy who spoke the following words about making this very movie: \"It made me care about the soldiers. Prior to that it wasn't that I didn't care about them, I just thought of them and the war as all the same thing.\" And yet here we are, legitimately wondering: great American actor, or greatEST American actor?\n\nA Serious Man: Do you figure the Coen Brothers realize we've all figured out which ones to skip and which ones to go see? Given the pattern of their career, you can actually catch yourself thinking \"God, it's almost like they're two different people.\" Just fire the Hudsucker Proxy one and keep the Fargo one already!\n\nStar Trek: My hypothesis about the Disney-Marvel deal was that comic books don't need to be profitable because they've become storytelling R&D labs for the movies. This is confirmed here by the use of the time-honoured \"retcon\" strategy as a means of breathing life into an effed-out bunch of characters we could otherwise hardly stand the sight of.\n\nUp: Let you in on a secret: I've never really liked, as in really really really liked, a Pixar movie. I find even the good ones a little bit sterile and contrived. Which, obviously, they are, but that doesn't stop other people from flipping out about how deep the philosophy of The Incredibles was or how Ratatouille was pretty well the equal of anything Kubrick ever did. The emperor has no clothes, guys! Most celebrities are terrible at voice acting, most of these movies have Kricfalusi's Cal Arts disease in the worst way, and we should be way past having \"Ooh, cool\" reactions to nerdy little touches in CGI animation! Plus, shame on anybody who fell for the 3-D thing. You're, what, the fifth or sixth generation of audiences to fall for this crap?\n\nWhere the Wild Things Are: I didn't think it was possible for any literary work to attain a higher exegesis-to-original-text ratio than either the New Testament or Shakespeare, but Sendak proved us all wrong.\n\nTonight I had a beer with Germany's biggest box office star. I was introducded to Til Schweiger at a small, jammed party for TIFF's gala premiere of Phantom Pain (Phantomschmerz)\u2014a German movie inspired by the true story of a Canadian cyclist Mark Sumner, whose life was traumatically changed by a car accident. Til Schweiger has been called Germany's Brad Pitt. And he co-starred with Pitt, speaking English as one of his Nazi-scalping squad in Inglourious Basterds. But when I ask Schweiger about the comparison, after expressing his huge admiration for Pitt as an actor, he says, \"I'm not Germany's Brad Pitt; I'm Germany's Will Smith.\" (Given that Smith is Hollywood's biggest earner at the box office, the analogy makes sense.) Inglourious Basterds has been a massive hit in Germany, bigger than Pulp Fiction. But Schweiger told me he was furious that European countries chose to dub the film rather than subtitle it\u2014undermining the multilingual intrigue that serves as its central comic conceit. \"Here comes this guy who goes against all odds,\" says the actor. \"At the risk of alienating all the Americans, Quentin had everyone speak their own language, so you wouldn't have Germans speaking English to each other in a phony German accent.\" In his role as a German-American soldier, Schweiger naturally spoke English with his comrades. But for Germany's version of the film, he had to dub his English lines into German. \"The German audience knows me as a native German speaker. And when I'm in an international film speaking English it's a different timing, a different rhythm. Then I dub it into German, and the German audience wonders, 'why does he talk like this?' \"\n\nWhen Schweiger asked me what I thought of Phantom Pain, I confessed I had to work late and missed the premiere but planned to catch it in a repeat screening. He said he appreciated the honesty, then recalled an incident at a party where he caught someone's bluff. Once he was schmoozed by a producer who profusely congratulated him on his performance in a film that he didn't appear in, but was incorrectly listed on his IMDB page.\n\nThe director of 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Kill Bill' once epitomized the future of moviemaking. But now he's mostly interested in movies of the past.\n\nIs Quentin Tarantino old-fashioned? There's a question you'd never have heard 15 years ago, when Pulp Fiction made him arguably the most famous and influential semi-independent filmmaker in America. But his new movie, the Second World War adventure Inglourious Basterds (opening Aug. 21), has the usually cocky Tarantino sounding insecure. Sebastian Haselbeck, founder of the Quentin Tarantino Archives website, told Maclean's that an important part of Tarantino's persona is \"enormous self-confidence in what he does,\" but far from sounding confident, Tarantino told the New York Times he rushed to get the film cut because he hasn't yet made a great film in the last 10 years: \"I wanted to have a masterpiece before the decade's out,\" he said. Still, he wouldn't say that Basterds would be it, only that \"this was the hardest movie I've ever made.\" Tarantino has also made some self-promotional comments that sound more like the brilliant, obnoxious media personality from the '90s, like his statement that he refuses to hire composers because he doesn't want a musician \"coming in here and throwing his s\u2013t over my movie.\" But he's increasingly acting like someone who doesn't want movie history to pass him by. Others think it already has: Gerald Peary, a critic who edited a book of interviews with Tarantino, now says, \"I don't find him as significant a cultural icon\" as he was in the Pulp Fiction days.\n\nAudiences don't always know what to make of Inglourious Basterds; the film got a mixed reception at the Cannes Festival (where Pulp Fiction took the top prize in 1994), and even favourable reviews warn that it's not the rollicking action-packed movie we'd expect from the trailers. Inglourious Basterds has all the things we've come to expect from Tarantino: horrifying but cartoonish violence, silly comedy in inappropriate places, sexy women out for revenge (M\u00e9lanie Laurent as a Jewish woman trying to destroy the Nazis in retaliation for killing her family). But it also has surprisingly little action for a movie about ragtag Nazi-killers who take their victims' scalps; two key scenes, the opening and a long one in a Paris tavern, consist of 20 minutes of dialogue followed by a few seconds of violence. And top-billed Brad Pitt, who plays the head Nazi-hunter, doesn't have much screen time in the movie; his character doesn't really drive the plot compared to the relatively unknown Christoph Waltz, who plays a charming but ruthless Nazi officer. Continue\u2026\n\nAt a festival loaded with heavyweight auteurs, and light on Hollywood celebrity, Brad Pitt was the designated superstar. But at the Cannes press conference for the premiere of Inglourious Basterds, he held off his entrance with noblesse oblige, and let his chuffed director, Quentin Tarantino, soak up the spotlight \u2014flanked by leading ladies Diane Kruger and M\u00e9lanie Laurent\n\nAnd you have to wonder, what deal with Brad's English garden-party get-up\u2014the cream jacket and the ascot-like scarf? All that's missing is a shooting stick. Did Angelina dress him in the morning as a joke? You'll notice, by the way, that in Cannes the press turn into fans in the presence of celebrity. Snapping photos I can understand\u2014everyone, myself included, wants visuals for their websites\u2014but the notion of journalists scrambling for autographs is downright embarrassing.\n\nAside from inventiveness with which filmmakers portrayed brutal violence, the other prevalent trend in Cannes this year was the camera's tendency to turn on itself. So many movies contained references to cinema, and quite a few had stories that revolved around a film within a film, or at least a show within a show\u2014notably Pedro Almodovar's Broken Embraces, Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds, Tsai-Ming Liang's Visage, Francis Ford Coppola's Tetro and Terry Gilliam's The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. It makes you wonder if world cinema is fleeing the world, and happy to lose itself in its own reflection, like the characters who plunge through the funhouse mirror of Gilliam's Imaginarium. Quite the vicious circle. You've got several thousand film critics obsessively watching films that are obsessed with film. One of the French soldiers in Tarantino's movie is a film critic. And Isabel Coixet's Map of the Sounds of Tokyo drew a big laugh from a mass audience of critics with this line: \"How can you trust a guy who spends all day in a cinema?\" Precisely.\n\nIn this incestuous mix of art and life, nothing was spookier than seeing Heath Ledger's last performance in Imaginarium. His character makes his entrance dangling from a noose. And the film contains references to dead movie stars like Valentino and James Dean finding immortality on the silver screen\u2014allusions that now seem like morbid premonitions. But then movies lend themselves to meditations on mortality. And these days, when every auteur seems obsessed with the Death of Cinema, it was thrilling to see a film by an old man that celebrates its life\u2014Les Herbes Folles (Wild Grass), a gem by 86-year-old French master Alain Resnais, who's most famous for Hiroshima Mon Amour. Resnais's movie emerged as the festival's sleeper hit, and after catching up to it late in the week, I can see why.\n\nPlaying catch-up, I'm posting a bunch of blogs today, most written on the flight home. The festival officially ends with the awards Sunday, but by now it's effectively over, as all 20 features in competition have screened. Among the more high-minded entries, one of the favorites is The White Ribbon by Austrian director Michael Haneke. Set in a Protestant village in northern Germany on the eve of the First World War\u2014and shot in forbidding black-and-white\u2014it has the austere look and moral gravity of an Ingmar Bergman film. The village has become cursed by a contagion of strange and violent acts, beginning with the local doctor being thrown from his horse by a wire strung between two trees. A field of cabbage is chopped to bits. A retarded child is viciously mutilated. But there's also systemic abuse in this corrupt domain. Children are beaten, a daughter is molested, a midwife abused. So we assume the mysterious crimes are acts of punishment. Various patriarchs\u2014a baron, a steward, a pastor, and the doctor\u2014emerge like suspects in a Germanic game of Clue. As with Haneke's previous film, Cach\u00e9 (2007), this is a whodunit that's never clearly resolved. But with the children somehow implicated in a cycle of abuse and retribution, Haneke appears to hinting that these are the future architects of the Third Reich.\n\nQuentin Tarantino's, Inglourious Basterds (sic) is radically different from The White Ribbon, but it's another picture that doesn't exactly make one predisposed to love Germans. Tarantino concocts a Jewish revenge fantasy that rewrites history, immolating Nazis in an eye-for-an-eye conflagration, a mini-Holocaust. At the film's press conference, pulp filmmaker Eli Roth (Hostel), who plays one of the Tarantino's avenging \"basterds,\" gleefully called it \"kosher porn.\" Although Tarantino's fantasia exists in a world quite divorced from history, it makes flamboyantly explicit what is darkly implied in Haneke's film\u2014that the Nazis' crimes are rooted in some sort of original sin.\n\nYesterday was Brad Pitt Day in Cannes\u2014although hard-core cineastes, especially the Gallic variety, perhaps thought of it as Quentin Tarantino Day. And for die-hard Canadians, it was Mike Myers Day. In the biggest blitz of Hollywood talent that we've seen during the festival, all three were on hand for the premiere of Inglourious Basterds, Tarantino's outrageous Second World War epic. It was one of the most anticipated titles among the 20 films in competition here. The 2,300-seat Lumiere theatre was packed for the morning press screening, well before the 8:30 a.m. start time. And at the end of the two-and-half-hour opus, the Palais erupted with some of the strongest applause we've seen here. The movie is a hoot, and so was the press conference that immediately followed the morning screening. More on that in minute, but first a few details about the film"}
{"text": "Combining a police procedural with a musical comedy, the Swedish film Sound of Silence brings a comedic and thought provoking take to the crime caper genre. It's a film that reveres the art of music, while simultaneously criticizing it, and although the final act becomes a bit muddled, it's still an easy recommendation for any music lover.\n\nOn the surface, Sound of Noise is about a group of rogue percussionists, who set out to make the ultimate flash-mob-esque street music, and the police detective charged with bringing them to justice. The film follows Sanna (Sanna Persson), the quasi-leader of the musicians, and Amadeus (Bengt Nilsson), the tone-deaf detective who's desperately trying to track the group down.\n\nSound of Noise plays out like a typical cop flick, except instead of watching heists or murders, we see quirky musical interludes, followed by Amadeus investigating the crime scene and piecing together clues. It's in these interludes that the film is at it's best. The musical numbers are entertaining, comedic, and ingenious. Who would have thought playing a fat guy's gut like bongos would produce such a great rhythm?\n\nBut this isn't just a cops and robbers story. It's a statement on the rigidity and confinement of traditional music, and a call to arms for those musicians willing to experiment, and attempt something new. It has that \"Music is all around us, we just need to listen,\" vibe going for it. This is most apparent when looking at the relationship between Amadeus and his family. He comes from a family of musicians, and his younger brother is a famous composer, however Amadeus never had an interest in music and is tone deaf. This leads to some of the film's more existential moments, which unfortunately didn't really work.\n\nIn addition to these almost supernatural elements, it becomes clear within the first act of the film that there would be an inevitable love story between Sanna and Amadeus. This was not problematic to the plot, but it felt slightly tacked on by the end. In a film that has so many other things happening, it seems like adding a love story at the climax is just unnecessary.\n\nWith clever music, and a nice blend of comedy and heart, you'll find yourself smiling and tapping your toes throughout most of the movie. While it may not move you like a Haydn symphony, this is still an entertaining film, and is a must-see for any music aficionado."}

Martin Scorcese and Nicholas Pileggi set the tone for a decade of amazing films with Goodfellas, so it seemed natural to grab the same stars, and just do it all again five years down the line."}
{"text": "Transylvania\n\nLike Tony Gatlif's previous outing Exiles, Transylvania comes as close as you possibly can to a plot without actually having one. In a ragbag, mashed up story, pretty Zingarina (Argento) travels to Romania with her buddy (Casar) and translator (Alendra Beoujard) to find the father of her unborn child, a musician called Milan (Costoldi). However, Milan wants nothing to do with her, which sends the broken-hearted Zingarina into a head spin and she dumps her companions. Picked up by travelling trader Tchangalo (Unel), the two embark on a road trip deep into the hinterland of Romania. Because the story is barely there, it's the characters that are front and centre and while Argento and Unel deliver sound performances, nothing much happens to them, and boredom soon creeps in. The usual Gatlif themes are present in Transylvania: the aforementioned plotless momentum (which Gatlif might argue is 'narrative space'), characters who are swallowed up by alien cultures, a bleak and desolate landscape and the massive part indigenous music plays. Gatlif is to be praised for not imposing/jamming scriptwriting rules, that result in the majority of releases seem formulaic, into his films but his deliberate shunning of story principles sometimes feels like he's throwing the toys out of the cot"}
{"text": "Turning Hugo Into a Yugo\n\nMoviemakers have been making themselves miserable wrestling with Les Miserables for almost ninety years. The very first American feature film was a 1909 silent adaptation of Victor Hugo's dark masterpiece, and it's been reprised on the screen at least half a dozen times since then. Most memorable? The 1935 version, with Frederic March and Charles Laughton, and the 1957 French edition, starring Jean Gabin and Bernard Blier.\n\nThrow in that kitschy stage musical Americans love so much, the highly derivative TV series The Fugitive and the two recent movies it begat, and you've got a major industry in reformed convicts and obsessive cops.\n\nThe Danish director Bille August (Pelle the Conqueror), whose films move more slowly than French justice itself, probably won't be remembered for his take on what every dewy-eyed matinee-goer now calls \"Lay Miz.\" And Hugo, the towering romantic who wasn't around to spend the royalties from the dozens of movies inspired by Les Miserables and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, probably isn't turning cartwheels in literary heaven this week. Despite the best efforts of Schindler's List hero Liam Neeson as the beleaguered Jean Valjean and less effective ones of Shine's Geoffrey Rush as the implacable Inspector Javert, this is a pretty tedious hunk o' Hugo. And novelist Rafael Yglesias has yielded to the basest temptations. What we have here is much less a tale of justice and redemption in nineteenth-century France than the love story of two good-looking kids, one of whom just happens to be M. Valjean's adopted daughter.\n\nIn other words, the greatest figure in French literature has been \"Titanicized.\" The rising sap in lovely Cosette (Claire Danes) and her pop-revolutionary boyfriend, Marius (Hans Matheson), takes center stage here. Forget the Battle of Waterloo; it no longer exists. Hugo's famous chase through the Paris sewers? It's been trimmed and rewritten to suit this year's fashion. As for the novelist's central conflict between authoritarian moralism and social justice, it's been relegated to the back table of the cafe so August can gaze upon young love in bloom.\n\nThis is, of course, the dictatorship of the marketplace. The bulk of the contemporary movie audience is 17.3 years old--something like that--and the moguls know that audience refuses to digest anything like the world's most famous shipwreck or the contemplation of the nature of freedom unless it's been so dumbed down and softened up by soap opera that the original event or source is unrecognizable.\n\nAugust and Yglesias defend their choice in regard to this diminished and demeaned Les Miserables by saying that Hugo's turbulent novel is so enormous and unwieldy that they had to cut out something. Well, what they've cut out is the heart of the matter--like excising the whale from Moby Dick. What they've left is petty, pretty romance. Cosette and Marius don't attain the age of lust until halfway through these agonizing two hours, but once they do, Neeson and Rush may as well cease to exist. What do trifles like restoring the Republic or contemplating the birth of European fascism in the procedure-ridden soul of Javert matter when young romantics have a misty rendezvous to keep at midnight?\n\nHey, this author and director can't even get Valjean's sentence for nipping the loaf of bread straight. That's supposed to be five years' hard labor in the quarries of Toulon, guys, then nineteen more in the galleys."}

{"text": "Rage\n\nSynopsis\n\nAn accidental nerve gas leak by the military kills not only a rancher's livestock, but also his son. When he tries to hold the military accountable for their actions, he runs up against a wall of silence.\n\nGeorge C. Scott both stars in and directs this tale of revenge and does a pretty good job at both. The first half builds slowly as the army attempts to cover up a nerve gas leak that leaves Scott infected and his son dead. When he finally finds out the truth he goes on an explosive quest for payback. Scott does the angry, vengeful father bit to perfection, embodying the films title in his fiery performance. Richard Basehart makes the most of a small role as the family doctor and a very young Martin Sheen makes an appearance as an army doctor. There's a fatalistic air to the films finale that suits it perfectly, showing the futility of one man's rage against the establishment. It leaves you feeling angry, which was surely Scott's intention."}

{"text": "WHAT I ALREADY KNEW ABOUT THE MOVIE:\nIt's a Western, starring Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Gene Hackman, and directed by Clint Eastwood.\n\nLET ME EXPLAIN...\nI have to admit, there was a fair amount of anticipation for me to see this movie. This was the first Clint Eastwood Western I had ever seen, and everyone I know who had already seen it always say things like \"SUCH a great movie\" at just the mention of its name.\n\nHowever, when my wife and I saw another Western, \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" (rated #73 on AFI's list), we didn't like it. Or more appropriately, we didn't get it. We'd heard from so many people how great that film was, but we thought it was slow and we never really got into the plot. (If anybody can explain to me why that movie is so good, please leave a comment on here and tell me.) So with this being really only the 2nd Western I had ever seen after \"Butch Cassidy\", I was nervous I wouldn't like this one, either.\n\nFortunately, I did like this movie. Actually, I liked the movie right up until the ending. Then I loved it.\n\nI really don't know how to discuss what I thought about \"Unforgiven\" without giving away anything to those who haven't already watched it. My wife and I spent a good half hour after it ended talking about what we both thought, and the crux for every topic - all the character development, every crucial scene or piece of dialogue, etc. - is dependent on seeing this movie in its entirety. It's like watching a mystery whodunnit: most of it might not make much sense or seem that great until you find out who the murderer is. Then, after the big revelation, you end up thinking the whole movie is great (at least, I do). \"Unforgiven\" isn't a mystery whodunnit, but it has that same dependency on the ending to make every other scene better. And it delivered. Trust me on that!\n\nWhy is this a \"Top 100\" Movie?\nWhile being an admitted \"Western novice\", I felt watching \"Unforgiven\" educated me on what a good Western should be. Of course, not having a lot of viewing experience to compare it to in that genre, I can only say that I at least know that this particular Western is awesome. This movie also speaks volumes into the complexities of life and morals in the Old West, particularly regarding the act of killing a person (which most Old West examples I've seen portray killing as practically just another job, but this film rightly conveys it as a difficult and horrible act to commit). So I'm inclined to say it's a Top 100 movie because it's an epic Western, but in my opinion, it's just an awesome movie. It also won multiple awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor (Gene Hackman) in 1992.\n\nNot really a complaint, but...\nThrough most of \"Unforgiven\", Clint Eastwood's acting seemed to be wooden and emotionless. But - once again - the ending changed all that for me. I ended up seeing his character as someone fighting emotion and his natural tendencies which - to me - explained his \"wooden\" demeanor. Plus, Clint Eastwood at the end was entirely believable, so this is just another example of how the ending made the entire movie - including Eastwood's acting - better.\n\nLET ME SUM UP...\nI would not call myself a fan of Western films by any means, but this movie was awesome. It's a fantastic example of how an ending can kick the rest of a movie up a notch just by being so good (Vertigo is another classic example of this). When the movie ended, I almost wanted to start watching it all over again to see just how much better I'd like the rest of it after knowing how it ends.\n\nWHAT I ALREADY KNEW ABOUT THE MOVIE:\nOnly 2 things:\n1) It starred Charlie Sheen\n2) It's about the Vietnam War\n\nLET ME EXPLAIN...\nThis is the third \"Vietnam\" movie I have seen. The first one being \"We Were Soldiers\" (decent, but it felt more like a Mel Gibson movie than a Vietnam War movie), and \"Apocalypse Now\", which I would categorize not so much as a Vietnam movie (though it does convey the horrors of it very well), but more of a horror story set in the Vietnam War (if that makes sense). \"Platoon\", in my opinion, has been the best example of showing what fighting in the Vietnam War was like.\n\nBeing too young to have lived through Vietnam, I've always been a little confused about why we were there, though I keep getting the feeling most people were confused why we were there while we were there. This film did nothing to make me think otherwise. In fact, if I had to describe \"Platoon\" in two words, it would be TOTAL AMBIGUITY... What are we doing here? Who's really in charge here? Who are the real bad guys? At a confusing time in American history, this movie does an excellent job of illustrating how confusing being in the war must have been.\n\nAnother quick note on the overall story: the tagline for the film is \"The first casualty of war is innocence.\" This is spot on in \"Platoon\", and Charlie Sheen's character is the perfect illustration of that.\n\nWhat makes this a \"Top 100\" Movie?\nWhen I think of what movie probably conveys World War 2 the best, \"Saving Private Ryan\" immediately comes to mind. And now when I think of what movie probably conveys the Vietnam War the best, I'll think of \"Platoon\". It's a very well done film about a significant war in American history. It was also nominated for 8 Academy Awards, winning 4 of them, including Best Picture and Best Director.\n\nNot really a complaint, but...\nAt first I was disappointed at the lack of back-story for practically every character in the movie. You only get tiny hints of where guys came from and what they did back home, but then I realized that that's something that made the movie better. Why? Well, this movie was very realistic, and it puts the audience in the situation of being a brand new soldier who's thrown into the hell of Vietnam. Just like a new soldier, you don't know the other guys, and you don't know their back-stories. That's more realistic than getting told through flashbacks or heavy monologues why some guys are the way they are. It also added to the ambiguity of the movie because you couldn't truly know what some guys were capable of.\n\nLET ME SUM UP...\n\"Platoon\" was captivating (the 2 hours went by really fast), it was hard to watch, it was sickening, and it was realistic. I was really glad I finally saw it, but I didn't feel like I wanted to ever watch it again. However, it seems like the best illustration on what the Vietnam War was probably like; it was well acted (Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe were both nominated for Best Supporting Actor, and Charlie Sheen did an excellent job in his transformation from \"innocent\" to \"corrupted by war\"); and all that together makes me say this is definitely a film to watch at least once in your life.\n\nWHAT I ALREADY KNEW ABOUT THE MOVIE:\nOnly one thing: it's of the film noir genre. Film Noir, according to the ever-so dependable Wikipedia, is defined as: \"a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas, particularly those that emphasize moral ambiguity and sexual motivation.\"\n\nLET ME EXPLAIN...\nSeeing as how \"Double Indemnity\" is a film noir, I was apprehensive about watching it, especially since I didn't like The Maltese Falcon. However, after watching this film, I've come to the conclusion that it's not film noir I dislike. I'm just not a big fan of \"The Maltese Falcon\". In other words, I really liked \"Double Indemnity\".\n\nWhat did I like about this movie? Well, the use of lighting and shadows was very cool. I thought Barbara Stanwyck's performance was excellent. Edward G. Robinson was also outstanding, and his character - \"Keyes\" - was my favorite. But the story itself was easily the best thing about this movie.\n\nIt had some outstanding suspense (two scenes in particular I remember feeling REALLY nervous that they were going to get caught), and it was very Hitchcock-esque. And to spend the whole movie hoping the characters get away with murder while their plan continues to unravel (not really spoilers, since you know from the very first scene they don't get away with it) made this movie fly by quickly. I was surprised when I looked down at the clock and realized there were only about 5 minutes left.\n\nWhat makes this a \"Top 100\" Movie?\nAfter watching a special on the DVD's \"Bonus Features\", I got a pretty good idea why this movie is considered one of the greatest ever. First of all, \"Double Indemnity\" is considered by many to be the first real American \"film noir\" movie, and seeing how that genre holds a significant niche in film history, it makes sense that the first great example of it is considered one of the best. The story itself was also quite controversial, as it took 8 years before the Hollywood Production Code allowed it to be filmed because it centered around such an immoral plot (and I'm learning that controversy in a well-made film usually helps boost its significance in film history). It also received seven Oscar nominations in 1944. And from my perspective, the story had great suspense and the basic idea has been re-done so many times since that it seems to be quite the groundbreaking plot.\n\nMy complaint (or, in honor of Keyes, \"What the little man inside me says\")...\nThe ending. Maybe I missed the subtleties of it, or I just couldn't appreciate it enough. Up until the last 5 to 10 minutes, I was ready to give this a solid 8/10, but the ending seemed really flat and anti-climactic, and it made my opinion of the whole movie drop a bit.\n\nLET ME SUM UP...\nThis is a great story of suspense and could almost be mistaken for a Hitchcock film. Even though elements in this movie have been re-used in many suspense-thrillers since 1944, I found it to have some original excitement. Up until the ending, I was extremely entertained and found the first hour and 40 minutes to fly by."}
{"text": "The Magic Christian (1969) was mostly villified on its original release. Words like \"tasteless\" and \"incomprensible\" were thrown around very freely indeed. Time, however, has been kind to the film. Its reputation has grown considerably\u2014though not to the point that it has entirely lost its controversy. And that's a good thing, since a non-controversial Magic Christian would not be in the least desirable. This is a film that was meant to polarize viewers\u2014and it still does. Consider that it is a film that steadfastly refuses to ever explain its plot or assign a point to any of what happens. Its trailer is in the same key, since it refuses to tell the viewer who or what \"The Magic Christian\" is, leaving the deliberately provocative title provocatively unclear. The film itself doesn't reveal what it is until late in the proceedings and leaves the \"why\" of the name choice entirely up to the viewer. What we know from the outset is that Sir Guy Grand is filthy rich (and eccentric) and that Youngman (Ringo) is a young man Sir Guy meets in the park\u2014and immediately adopts. From there\u2014well, the viewer is asked to follow their adventures and make sense out of them. If you can, it's exhilirating in its utter anarchy. If you can't, it's probably frustrating. But you'll never know till you try\u2014and even if you have tried, there are so many subtle jokes in the film that you almost certainly didn't get them all. And there's John Cleese and Graham Chapman, three Badfinger songs, and Thunderclap Newman's \"Something in the Air,\" too.\n\nThe Asheville Film Society will screen The Magic Christian Tuesday, June 7"}
{"text": "6/11/2009\n\nBut slightly before that, Giuseppe Tornatore\u2014 the filmmaker behind the classic Italian Oscar winning Foreign Film, \"Cinema Paradiso\" and equally solid works like \"Malena\" \u2014 and his new film, \"Baaria,\" have been tapped to open the Venice Film Festival according to Variety. Evidently the picture is generation-spanning, lavish and an ambitious Sicilian epic. You probably don't care, but \"Baaria\" is notable because it's the film that Italian music maestro EnnioMorriconedecided to compose instead of Quentin Tarantino's \"InglouriousBasterds\" which he bailed on after initially being asked to write original music for the WWII epic, which he tentatively agreed to. You kinda can't blame him, Morricone and Tornatore have a long working relationship. So if 'Basterds' and don't like it, you might want to shake your fist at Morricone next time you see him on TV or whatever (like that's gonna happen). [Note in one interview Tarantino called Ennio's participation a \"rumor,\" but why then was it in the trades and why did Morricone take to his website to announce that he unfortunately wouldn't have time to write the score? Mmm, yeah, we don't think so]\n\n\"Baaria\" will star Monica Bellucci (who starred in \"Malena\"), Michele Placido, Raoul Bova, Luigi Lo Cascio, Laura Chiattiand DonatellaFinocchiaro.

{"text": "Imagine this: a country is run by a totalitarian government, which occasionally selects groups of teenagers to methodically kill each other. On TV. Until only one remains.\n\n\"The Hunger Games\"? No, actually it's \"Battle Royale,\" a bloody and harrowing movie that came out several years earlier, depicting an alternate Japan where the youth are forced to kill each other. It's one of those movies that is strangely fascinating and filled with social commentary, with brilliant performances from pretty much everyone concerned.\n\nA class of high-schoolers are being transported on a bus, when they are gassed to unconsciousness. When they awake, they have electronic collars around their necks. A former teacher named Kitano explains that they have been chosen for the B.R. (\"Battle Royale\") Act, wherein teenagers are forced to fight each other to the death until only one is left standing.\n\nIf you don't play, try to escape, refuse to kill or stray into a \"death zone,\" the collars explode. Each teenager is given food, water and a random item, and are set loose on a remote island.\n\nIt doesn't take long for them to fall prey to suicide, paranoia, bombs and one student's brilliant efforts to hack the system. As the teens slowly weed each other out, Shuya Nanahara and his girlfriend Noriko try to find a way out that doesn't involve death. But if they refuse to kill, then they must escape the fascist nightmare... which no one has done before.\n\n\"Battle Royale\" (both the novel and the movie) was condemned in Japan for being so violent, and having a bunch of normal high schoolers killing each other off. But \"Battle Royale\" would have been striking even if it hadn't been publicized like that -- not only is it viscerally fascinating, but it asks the question straight-out: how much will people do to survive? Who would you kill to live?\n\nIt also seems to be a story about how governments will oppress innocent people in response to the brutality of a few. However, the movie avoids any outright preaching -- instead it uncoils a tense plot, peppered with bursts of bloody violence, sexual assault and murder. There's a wild, frenetic energy to the story, and director Kinji Fukasaku unleashes it through every cold, bloodspattered scene.\n\nFun trivia: Fukasaku actually lived through something almost as cold-blooded during World War II, when he saw children having to hide from bombs under EACH OTHER. The survivors had to clear away the corpses.\n\nTatsuya Fujiwara and Aki Maeda really give outstanding performances in this story as nice, normal, everyday kids like the ones who live down the street, but suddenly they're faced with their friends and classmates... wanting to kill them. Takeshi Kitano gives a bloodcurdlingly creepy performance as Kitano, who is nevertheless given plenty of fleshing-out (such as a fondness for one of the students).\n\nViolent, creepy and wonderfully atmospheric, \"Battle Royale\" is a brilliant cult movie that takes a look at how far people will go to stay alive. Absolutely brilliant.\n\nPreviously to viewing a copy of BR, I read the raving reviews from the other amazon customers..and you know what? I strongly agree with their 5 star ratings. this movie doesn't pull any punches when it comes to violence, but at the same time it's also a social commentary regarding violence within today's high schools, (especially in america)and the bad bridge between the generation gap.\n\nbeat takashi (brother) does a great portrayal as the sadistic teacher/controller KITARO. BR has influences from previous american flicks like the running man, lord of the flies,escape from new york and fortress (the necklace bomb \"wedlock\")\n\nwhat's disturbing is watching those cute japanese kids get slaughtered in so many ways(shootings,hackings,slashings,poison etc.) that it almost resembles a virtual videogame. the ending i felt was anti climatic, but the flashback sequences adds much depth to the characters. too bad most americans will NEVER get to see this DVD Gem because of the contriversial content, but if ever there was a us adaptation like THE RING, director paul verhooven(robocop,starship troopers) would be my first choice and/or maybe quinten tarantino just as long as he doesn't make a cameo appearance like he did in his previous movies.\n\nJames Gunn, director of Slither, lists this as one of his favourite movies. I can see why. It's amazing. I'm a pretty lazy guy, so watching a movie with subtitles seems like lots of work to me, but it is well worth it. So far, the only other movie I can say this about is Pan's Labyrinth.\n\nThis movie has it all. Lots of violence, a love story, and some truly funny moments. Plus, it has that Vic Romano guy from MXC!!!!\n\nJust be aware that you'll need an all-regions DVD player, as it will not play on strict North America region DVD players."}
{"text": "RATING:\n\nstar55\n\nThis movie is pure art! Critics who pan this film as \"silly\" and \"sugary\" and viewers who see it as \"heartwarming\" or \"a tibute to music\" are missing the point. Only the reviewer who saw the movie as an example of \"magical realism\" (a la Garcia Marquez' Hundred Years of Solitude or Allende's House of Spirits) and the critic who thought the movie was \"prone to long shots of light sparkling off bright objects\" appoached the heart of the matter. The movie is a montage of visual shots and audio bites which express the delight and wonder of people caught up in a musical rapture. They are separated physically and emotionally by their own unique response to the stimulation of music, only to be reunited at the end by the commonality of music as a means of communication, which is at oncle individual and universal. In essence, August Rush is a metaphor for this emotional transfiguration sparked by music. It is a visual poem, and like a poem the meaning is in the connotation of the images, not in the story as such. Sure, the story line is trite and silly, and the acting is saccharine, but the movie as art demanded this approach. \"The medium is the message.\" I give this movie a standing ovation- and at 67 I am not easy to please!"}
{"text": "Tag Archives: Elliott Sullivan\n\nGeorge Sanders can do no wrong in The Saint's Double Trouble, so much so, he has the ability to smooth the film over. He's such a joy to watch, the critical part of the brain shuts down. Eventually, as the film nears the conclusion, Sanders looses his control, letting judgments percolate to the surface. This condition isn't particularly rare, but what makes Double Trouble is the repeating effect. Even after it's clear the film's charm is pulling the wool over the viewer's eyes, it goes ahead and charms him or her again, setting up another realization a few minutes further into the running time. It keeps it up until the final shot, which plays on the surface like it should get a pass\u2026 but it's really quite hollow.\n\nThere's a distressing lack of content to The Saint's Double Trouble. It opens rather grandiosely\u2013or, with grandiose promise\u2013in Cairo. Bela Lugosi shows up, mailing a coffin back to the States (there's no reference to Dracula, which is kind of unfortunate, because it's got to be what the viewer's thinking). Lugosi's actually quite good in Double Trouble\u2013it might be his best performance (or the best performance I've seen from him). But then the film skips to Philadelphia and in The Saint's Double Trouble, Philadelphia only has one exterior street corner. There's a depressing lack of scale, with the script, budget and direction failing each other. Hively doesn't do anything to make the film feel like it's taking place anywhere other than a backlot. He's a decent director, even if he likes cheap shots occasionally\u2013and he can't direct a suspenseful scene\u2013but he's generally fine.\n\nThe script's a different story. It's got some good one-liners and some fine conversations, but the film's plot is so addlebrained, the incredibly complex series of double crosses\u2013occurring off-screen\u2013is never unraveled. It's not as important as the film's hook, George Sanders playing both the Saint and the villain. These two characters apparently know each other\u2013it's implied, at least\u2013but there's never anything more about it. I'm all for letting the viewer figure things out for him or herself, but The Saint's Double Trouble asks the viewer to ignore critical reasoning and it goes down like castor oil.\n\nThe film's abbreviated running time\u2013sixty-six minutes soaking wet\u2013means not only does Lugosi get short-changed (he's even funny at one point), but so does second-billed Helene Whitney. She has a bunch of history with Sanders\u2013thank you expository dialogue\u2013but it doesn't go anywhere. Their scenes together are wasted, accelerating the plot. Sanders is great in the scenes, but the film doesn't have a single payoff. It keeps deferring the payoff\u2013it really does seem like it'll come at the end\u2013but no. The film pulls it away again\u2026 and the end is so cheaply done, it makes The Saint's Double Trouble seem like a low budget impression, filmed in someone's backyard. Hively's not entirely at fault\u2013RKO controlled the budget\u2013but he doesn't do anything creative.\n\nDirected by Jack Hively; screenplay by Ben Holmes, based on the novel by Leslie Charteris; director of photography, J. Roy Hunt; edited by Theron Warth and Desmond Marquette; music by Roy Webb; produced by Cliff Reid; released by RKO Radio Pictures."}
{"text": "The Edge (Blu-ray)\n\nPublisher:\n\n\"Because today\u2026 I'm gonna kill the motherfucker!\" In that sentence, the \"I\" is Anthony Hopkins, and the \"motherfucker\" is a Kodiak bear. The movie is 1997's The Edge, a peculiar survivalist adventure with a script by David Mamet. Hearing words like that come out of Hopkins, the most archly patrician of actors\u2014playing to type here as an introspective billionaire\u2014gives the line an extra punch, because the journey there is much longer for him than most. And it's a credit to Mamet, a writer forever concerned with the world of men and their animal natures, that he could deliver an actor like Hopkins to the point where he loses his aristocratic air and becomes the swarthiest of heroes, ready to do battle with a motherfucking bear. Let that be a warning: If any raccoons dare get within the vicinity of Howards End, they should know what's coming to them.\n\nIt's a shame The Edge wasn't also directed by Mamet, whose economic style might have cut the fat from a film that behaves too much like a conventional Hollywood thriller. Those duties were handed over to New Zealand director Lee Tamahori, who must have seemed like a natural choice based on his 1994 breakthrough Once Were Warriors, a forceful tale of masculinity and violence among Maori. But Tamahori's workmanlike production doesn't match the elemental power of Mamet's script, and it fails to evoke the harsh physical conditions that turn ordinary, civilized men into resourceful survivalists and predators.\n\nNevertheless, Hopkins does fine work as a billionaire stranded in the middle of the Alaskan wilderness with a smarmy photographer, played by Alec Baldwin. The early scenes establish a seething rivalry between the two men over Hopkins' statuesque wife (Elle Macpherson)\u2014to the point where Hopkins asks Baldwin \"How are you going to kill me?\" before their plane goes down\u2014but it's put on hold as they rely on each other to make it out of the woods alive. As it happens, the book-smart Hopkins has accumulated a lot of knowledge about living in the wild, but his cunning is tested when he and Baldwin face off against a relentless, bloodthirsty bear. (He's played by \"Bart The Bear,\" in perhaps the greatest of his many star turns, including appearances in The Bear, On Deadly Ground, and The Great Outdoors.)\n\nBeyond a stock of punchy Mametisms\u2014Baldwin: \"A month ago, old Smokey here would've reared up, you probably would've called your lawyer.\" Hopkins: \"Nah, I wouldn't do that to an animal.\"\u2014The Edge remains gripping mostly because of Hopkins, who suggests a blueblood secretly excited to be in mortal peril. In the woods, he's no longer a billionaire with the resources to do anything he likes, but simply a human being relying solely on his wits and instinct. Tamahori doesn't have the chops to give his transformation the Straw Dogs treatment it deserves, but The Edge is an interesting footnote in the Mamet canon, manifesting in brute force what he generally expresses in words."}
{"text": "How many body pans can you stand? You know, the reclining shots where the camera begins at the toes and worms its way (slowly) up the female body? In Swimming Pool by Francois Ozon you see this shot several times. Way too many times. It's soft core porn with a fairly good story. Unfortunately, the story is not good enough to cover up the fact that it's soft core pornography. Ozon has been called \"Europe's most daring and inventive writer/director\" so that should give you a fairly good idea of what you're in for if you spend an hour and 43 minutes watching this film. Oh, wait: I guess if you live in Europe and take a recommendation like that seriously, I should try and make my point from another angle.\n\nThe way Rampling's character wolfs down her food and sucks on her cigarettes while on vacation, along with the oh-so-symbolic removal of the wooden cross above the bed where she sleeps, tells us all we need to know about the mystery writer. The bouncing boobs and the naked men in the bed asleep the next morning tell us all we need to know about the daughter. So what is left to tell? The way two very different people can morph into each other when thrust together in a strange locale? The way we sometimes cannot separate fiction from fact? I'm not sure what the point was in this story, or even if there was one, aside from the body pans. It's not often you see a film with primarily female protagonists. When you do, it should be done with fewer gratuitous boob-shots than this. Try Ingmar Bergman's Cries and Whispers or his Persona or Robert Altman's 3 Women for films that might mean something over and above childish sexual fantasies.\n\nOzon wrote this in collaboration with French novelist and screenwriter Emmanu\u00e8le Bernheim. They worked together on a previous film, Under the Sand, which I didn't see and probably won't.\n\n\"Ozon means to have perversity speak for him, but in the end, it doesn't have a lot to say.\" -- Ella Taylor from the LA Weekly\n\nSwimming pools are artificial pools of water designed so humans\ncan swim in them. They come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, from\nslightly larger than a hot tub, to an olympic regulation sized swimming pool\n(50m long, wide enough to accommodate a number of lanes for swimmers,\ngenerally about 25m wide.)\n\nYou can have pools that are built above ground, or inground, built into a\nhole excavated in the ground. They will often have a shallow end, and a deep\nend, with the shallow end being shallow enough that some children will be\nable to have their feet touching the ground and still having their nose\nabove the water. Generally about 1 metre deep. The deep end may be only\nslightly deeper, or it may be deep enough that you can safely dive into it\nfrom a high dive. Deepest I've seen is about 10 metres, but I'm sure there's\nmuch deeper out there.\n\nYou can have indoor or outdoor pools, and you can have pools built in\nfunky shapes like a guitar.\n\nThere are two main types of pools. Personal backyard pools, and public\npools. Let's focus on the backyard variety first.\n\nHaving a pool in the backyard is awesome. You've got a nice place to\nrelax when it's hot out, swimming is great exercise, and you're going to\nbe a lot more popular than you were before. And trust me, you could use a\nfew more friends.\n\nThere are of course a few things to consider before getting yourself a\npool. The first to consider would be how often would you use it. I myself\nlive in a vast barren wilderness known as \"Teh Canada\", where the\ndaily high temperature is -50C more than 300 days a year.\nTherefore, the pool would generally only be usable between the months of\nMay and September. I would therefore get a lot less use of out my pool than\na person who lived in Southern California, or anywhere else that generally\nhas Hot to Mild temperatures year round.\n\nThe next factor to consider is the cost. A low end, pre-fabrication above\nground fiberglass pool will still probably set you back about $4000 USD.\nStart looking at excavation, for an in ground pool, and you're probably\nlooking at about $20,000 USD, with the costs increasing if you want a larger\npool, a custom design, or have any adverse ground conditions that may make\ndigging more difficult. You can pretty much spend as much money as you want\non a pool, with increasing size, quality, and fancy features. I want a swim\nup bar.\n\nIf you want your pool to be heated, that's also gonna cost you, the price\nof the heater, plus another $60 - $100 USD a month, in addition to about $20\nUSD a month for electricity to run the pump, and about $400 USD a year for\ncleaning supplies to make sure your brand new pool doesn't grow algae.\n\nAnd, next off, do you have kids? Kids love pools. They get to splash and\nplay in them and it's all a grand old time.\n\nIn the United States, there are over 375 annual drownings of\ntoddlers in residential pools. More than 2700 are hospitalized.\nThat's in kids under the age of 4 *only*. So, if you have children, or if\nyou will *ever* have children over at your house, you need to build a fence\naround that sucker. One that they can't get through. In many places, it's illegal to have a pool without a proper fence around it. It only takes a minute\nfor a kid to slip into the pool, and if that happens when you're not\nwatching and can get them out right away, then they *will* die if they do\nnot receive immediate medical attention. Even if your kid manages to avoid\ndrowning, there is serious risk of permanent brain damage due to oxygen\ndeprivation.\n\nThat's about all I can think of to say about backyard pools. Oh yeah, and\ndon't pee in them.\n\nAnd then there's public pools. They don't necessarily need to be owned by\nthe government, although quite a number are, mostly by the municipal\ngovernment. They're also likely to be owned by the fitness club, the\nY, the local University, or any number of\norganizations.\n\nFirst off, they are far more likely to be indoor pools, and are more\nlikely to have a deep end, and to be a lot bigger. The two main differences\nare that they are quite likely to have a trained lifeguard on duty at all\ntimes, and of course the public changing rooms, with their\ncommunal showers, tiny little lockers to shove your clothes into, and the\nathlete's foot.\n\nThey will often offer scheduled swimming lessons for all ability\nlevels, so it would seem to be a good idea to start out at a public pool and\nwork your way up to getting your own. That's about all I can think of to say\nfor public pools. Oh yeah, and don't pee in them.\n\nTo sum it up, if it's warm where you live and you can afford it, getting\na pool can be great. Just be sure to be safe with them. If\nit's not warm enough to justify buying your own, go to the pool at the\nY or something. I'm sure there's probably at least one near you that\nyou can swim in for a nominal fee."}
{"text": "Movie Review: Paul Greengrass's United 93: Guts\n\nUnited 93 recreates the flight of the fourth plane on September 11, 2001, the one on which the passengers got word by cell phone of the attacks on the World Trade Center, figured out the hijackers were on a suicide mission, and attempted to retake control of the plane. The movie was clearly made to dramatize our fascination with the fate of the unsuspecting people on the plane, those resourceful anybodies whose actions, in this version, saved the U.S. Capitol\u2014What would we have done in their place? Would we have had their nerve?\n\nThe English writer-director Paul Greengrass allows for this projection, but doesn't hype it. He divides the story into three movements: the air traffic controllers figuring out that something is up, though they don't know what; the jihadists' attack; and the passengers' and crew's counterattack. We always feel we're present because Greengrass and his cinematographer Barry Ackroyd shoot everything with handheld cameras, but at the same time this makes every situation feel roughly equivalent. The camerawork functions like an even coat of opaque paint.\n\nThe terrorists aren't fully characterized, but neither is anyone else. (The pilots and stewardesses are played by actual pilots and stewardesses, and among the actors playing passengers I recognized a few names but no faces.) Even the famous line with which the passengers launched their offensive\u2014\"Let's roll!\"\u2014isn't isolated and framed in the usual movieish way. Our immersion in the situation is total, which also means our perspective is less limited but also less intense than it would have been if we had actually been on board.\n\nOf course we know from the start who the terrorists are and what they're up to, and so they affect us in a more conventionally suspenseful way. (When they delay making their move on the plane, you may find yourself idiotically hoping that they won't.) Even when the terrorists and passengers appear in the same shot, waiting for the flight to be called, for instance, the terrorists seem to be in a different, more focused movie, while the passengers chat on their cell phones or peck at their laptops.\n\nThe scenes set among the air traffic controllers are altogether more interesting. The controllers are tool-edge sharp, picking up and deciphering the slightest hints over their headsets, and they're effective to the extent possible against a sneak attack. (The only snafu is the military response, but in the case of flight 93 what could the air force have accomplished that the passengers and crew didn't\u2014downing the plane on uninhabited ground.) But it's a relief that Greengrass avoids turning the controllers' alertness into romance by focusing on heroes battling against the forces of evil and incomprehension. It's nice for a change that a major event is not being processed into the same old crud that our moviemakers have always passed off as historical filmmaking."}

For me, it probably tops out somewhere around ten miles, and that was in good weather, wearing good shoes. Still, my feet felt like they were going to fall off, my back ached, and I never wanted to take another step again. (Yes, I'm kind of a wimp.) \"The Way Back\" is a film about a handful of men (and one fourteen year old girl) who escape from the gulags of Siberia and walk\u2026all the way to India. 4000 miles, across some of the most treacherous, rugged, and beautiful country in the world. Four. Thousand. Miles.\n\nIt's an incredible story, a testament to the human will and endurance. Sadly, that's not enough to make it a compelling movie. Because these men, and this girl, they don't do much. They walk, and walk, and walk. Through blizzards, and swarms of mosquitos, across deserts, up mountains and down the other side. \"The Way Back\" is co-produced by National Geographic, and it's filled with some really amazing photography of landscapes. But it's a movie about a long haul, and it's a long haul of a movie. It took an incredible amount of perseverance to complete this journey, and not everyone who embarked survived. It'll take a much smaller act of perseverance to finish this movie, but not everyone who starts it will make it to the end.\n\nStar Rating: The Way Back is said to be about gulag escapees who, during World War II, trekked to freedom on a 4,000 mile journey from Siberia to India. I'm well aware that there are many true stories from that time about the triumph of the human spirit, but this particular story seems utterly impossible to me. Maybe it's because the film is based on an autobiographical book that has, for all intents and purposes, been debunked. Or maybe it's \u2026 more\n\nDirector Peter Weir's \"The Way Back\" is a pretty straight-forward tale of human survival. It doesn't try to be more and it doesn't pretend to be more. Being based on 'true events', a viewer would know immediately what they would be in for once they go in to see this film. The characters in the film have the clear-cut staple of what characters in this type of movies are all about. There is nothing really different or special \u2026 more"}

I don't think I've ever connected with a style or story or characterization in the way I have with Jane Campion's movie. SWEETIE is very radical and tender and poetic and it's only her first movie! It's as bold and original and immediately arresting a film as Lynch's BLUE VELVET, Wong Kar Wai's CHUNGKING EXPRESS, Tarr's WERCKMEISTER HARMONIES, and Aronofsky's PI. There are other masterpieces like the aforementioned that have surely slapped me into attention and clawed into my noodles but nothing like this, it's like love, and now that I've found it, I wonder where she's been all along."}

{"text": "Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers does a most difficult and brave thing and does it brilliantly. It is a movie about a concept. Not just any concept but the shop-worn and often wrong-headed idea of \"heroism.\"\n\nIt's a noble undertaking, and Eastwood is stylistically bold enough to create a view of combat based mainly on images that are clearly manufactured. (As with \"Saving Private Ryan,\" the movie's principal source is \"The Big Red One,\" whose director, Samuel Fuller, actually experienced the war.) But this is underimagined and so thesis ridden that it's nearly over before it starts.\n\nThis is the first time I've ever given a movie a ten on MetaCritic. This is definitely one of the best, if not the absolute best, WW2 films ever created. It pays its respects to the soldiers who fought in WW2, but at the same time it shows the other side of the story. Similar to the fictional Catch 22, it depicts the ugly side of America and her military during a time of war. If you are into World War 2 video games, books, movies, you MUST see this movie! The realism and authenticity of the battle scenes are worth it by itself, and the political and philosophical themes will get you thinking, long after you've seen the movie.\u2026Expand\n\nDirector and American icon Clint Eastwood follows up Million Dollar Baby, which was controversial but shouldn't have been, with a surprisingly subversive critique of America's participation in the Last Good War that even managed to hoodwink ultrapatriotic right-wing movie reviewer Michael Medved (Baby's prime and most notorious detractor) into uncritically awarding it three and a half stars. (Maybe it's the title.) While Eastwood and writers Paul Haggis and William Broyles Jr. never mention Iraq, the parallels are certainly there for all to see: their movie's vision of World War II is one where funding and public support are controlled and manipulated by (largely fraudulent) PR gimmicks, and both Jessica Lynch and Pat Tillman are shown to have historical predecessors. Ultimately, this is all a lot more interesting to discuss than to actually watch: Eastwood's storytelling approach derails itself with a tortuous, serpentine flashback-within-flashback structure of the kind that occasionally works in romantic dramas and spy thrillers but virtually NEVER in war movies, as the poor reception given to the similarly-structured 1944 Humphrey Bogart French Resistance drama Passage to Marseille (made by the people behind Casablanca) will bear out. (Saving Private Ryan wisely limited itself to making the entire movie a simple journey through only one character's past; perhaps Steven Spielberg, doing co-producer duty here, was trying to top himself. If so, quit while you're ahead!) Eastwood's use of decolorized cinematography in his depiction of the struggle for Iwo Jima is visually effective but nowhere near as gripping or as frightening as Ryan's opening battle sequence, and the use of highly unconvincing special effects and props to depict battlefield gore doesn't work at all. Actors as frequently bland as Jesse Bradford, Ryan Phillippe and Paul Walker, playing servicemen, do nothing to intensify our identification with them, and the only time Flags of Our Fathers really hits the mark is in its fascinating portrayal of Pima Indian Ira Hayes (movingly played by Adam Beach) who generally accepted racist jokes about squaws and wigwams from his fellow Marines as good-natured male bonding but couldn't handle the official and unofficial racism of the folks back home, and because of that AND the knowledge that he was ordered to promulgate a fraud for the sake of building support for the war and selling war bonds, became one of World War II's most poignant psychological casualties. In the last couple of months, we moviegoers have been treated to two inspirational football dramas, two period pieces involving magicians, and THREE films in which a real-life character is so fascinating and beautifully played that he just dwarfs all the other stuff surrounding him. Put together a three-part movie consisting of just the George Reeves material from Hollywoodland, the Idi Amin footage in The Last King of Scotland and everything involving Hayes in this picture, and the resulting anthology would be a prime contender for one of the 10 best films of 2006!\u2026Expand\n\nThe direction, acting and painfully boring political spectrum involving the war leads to a war movie that has each character mearly one politicians handshake away from becoming a cliched and forgettable film experience. There is absolutely no connection between the characters and with such long pauses between past, present, future and politics you almost forget that Eastwood set out to do a film about war. This movie is definietly not worth the time and suggest seeing Letters from Iwo Jima where Eastwood gets it right\u2026Expand"}

{"text": "The close shots of sweat-coated faces were stunning. Beautifully framed photography permeated right through, and into a final act that resolved - and crumbled - in a regressing cycle of tiny thwarting misfortunes. Thrilling and exquisite - a truly great heist film.\n\nSet the tone for future heist films like \"The Killing\" or \"Heat\" (which were IMO better), but Rififi is amazing on its own: exciting, entertaining and gripping, a true classic !!! \"Wake up, you bastard, I don't want you to miss anything\" ==> bam\n\nSuperb location photography, great characterisation and a definitive heist sequence make this a must-see noir. The taut narrative and risque interaction between the underworld characters hasn't dated, but the inevitable tragedy for all involved felt like a product of its time.\n\nCertainly a heist movie. The basic plot points are about what you'd expect and I found it quite reminiscent to Bob le Flambeur, only with less engaging characters. Where this movie finds its footing is in the architecture of individual scenes/sequences. The famous dialogue-free heist and the overall look of the film elevated the material so it felt fresh. The style was noticeable but not intrusive.\n\nThe centerpiece heist scene is amazing, the way sound is used in that sequence really heightens the tension. The rest of the film is very good as well, I thought most of the characters were pretty strong. Besides a few minor things I disliked about it, I think it's a great film overall.\n\nA flawless heist film against which all others should be judged. The elliptical narrative is a masterful example of classic dramatic structure. The first act functions as introduction to Tony le Stephanois, utterly down-and-out, and a perpetually grey, rain-soaked criminal underworld. Most famous is the near-silent robbery, as methodical and suspenseful as anything Hitchcock ever filmed. Finally the film deteriorates into a tragedy of Greek proportions, never relenting its bleak disposition.\n\none or two mixed bag elements, the ending was especially iffy. my biggest gripes are a couple things that make no logical sense, making plans over the phone while never really actually giving a where or when, and a mother pulling her child out of a crashed car while leaving her dying brother-in-law there without a second thought. the actual lead up to and heist it's self are utterly awesome. good watch, not to be ignored.\n\nThis is a really cool French crime film. The heist scene itself was awesome. I loved how meticulous they were (both the characters and the filmmakers). That's only half the film though - the rest is the consequences of the crime. It ended up being far more exciting and suspenseful than I anticipated. I really enjoyed it overall. It also shows how the French were leagues ahead of the US in terms of pushing the envelope content-wise.\n\nDark, dreary Paris; in this film a shower of deep shades of black and grey. A notorious, immoral underworld of doom and gloom, and inevitably death (and with it, failure). The perfect heist does not exist, the minute details, the promise of glory and riches unknown to the common man (and its seeming immortality) are all illusions. We know it, the crooks know it, but somehow they still search and try their hand, always coming up with a bitter fate. The best heist scene ever.\n\nOne of the two best heist movies along with Heat I have ever seen only this one was engineered in 1955. Sadly the heist movies of today are all flawed and depend mostly on jumping thru the laser lines in the vault room or overriding voice recognition coded, finger print coded security systems and a lame love story.\nThe heist directots of today who can't understand why they fail to build proper tension and emotion despite such scenes, should study Rififi first.\n\nClearly, Rififi set a benchmark for future heist-movies. Nevertheless, it still got a bunch of startling scenes that can make your jaw drop. It can't be said often enough how much tension is created without words during the actual heist-scene. Another impressive scene is the final scene when the excellently narrated story finds its climax - storytelling-wise as well as filmmaking-wise. 04/07/09\n\nAn extremely well crafted Heist/Noir movie. The actors that played the four robbers are absolutely fabulous and make a very compelling crew. The actual robbery scene literally had me on the edge of my seat and really got my heart beating. But after that section of the movie it started to lag a bit for me, but was still irresistible to watch."}

{"text": "Post navigation\n\n90s Movie Review: Edward Scissorhands\n\nWhen it comes to 90s movies, there are many films that would seem too obscure to reach profitable popularity in any other decade, but in the 90s they produce a massive cult following. One of these films is Tim Burton's humble, lovable Edward Scissorhands.\n\nOur story begins in an old, lonely castle atop a menacing hill. It is there that an inventor lives, creating new devices and tinkering around with them. One day, he decides to create a man whom he decides to named Edward. The scientist is like a father figure to the creature, but dies before he is able to finish making Edward. Left alone, confused, and with scissors for hands, Edward isolates himself in a dark corner of the castle and watches the days pass by. It isn't until the super-friendly, motherly makeup saleswoman, Peg, discovers him that he is granted a new life. Peg pities Edward and decides to invite him into her home.\n\nHis scissor hands are not appreciated by everyone, though, and his eccentricities quickly become a barrier to friendship and acceptance. Through his own quiet, gentle, humble disposition, Edward eventually makes an impression on everyone he meets. Whether it be curiosity, anger, or fear, Edward is the talk of the neighborhood.\n\nUnfortunately, Edward's good nature leaves him open to be taken advantage of. His artistic use of his scissor hands is exploited and he is tricked into burglarizing a house by Peg's daughter and her asshole boyfriend. Edward's frustration and feelings of rejection make him shy away from society, and he also learns that he is unable to touch others without accidentally hurting them with his sharply-bladed fingers. The townspeople's curiosity and love toward him is replaced with fear and a desire to get rid of him.\n\nEdward Scissorhands is simultaneously a love story, a lesson in kindness, and a tale of rejection and estrangement. It's a tale about how a strange person, no matter how gentle and well-meaning, can enter a conformed society and shake things up beyond repair. It explores the reaches of human tolerance for someone who is different than them and how those who stray from the norm will be used and eventually rejected, damaging their inherent goodness. Despite all of the evil that exists around Edward in the form of deceit, gossip, jealousy, hypocrisy, and a lack of understanding, he remains vigilantly gentle and innocent.\n\nIt's definitely my favorite pairing of Johnny Depp with Tim Burton, and his performance as Edward is touching and believable. The lush, pastel beauty of the neighborhood landscape is well-contrasted to the dark, grey, gothic scenery of Edward's world. The irony exists in the fact that the lonely, isolated castle is a more comforting shelter from the pretty world outside where the evil truly exists. Danny Elfman's score is a perfect blend of the weird and the soft in much the same way the film is. While not always remembered as the most popular film Burton ever did, it is one of my favorites and certainly the most beautiful."}
{"text": "Lifestream\n\nNews for the 'Foreign+' Category\n\nDogtooth (Kynodontas, Greece)\n\nThree children (Aggeliki Papoulia, Christos Passilas, and Mary Tsoni) live a sheltered existence with their parents (Christos Stergioglou and Michele Valley) who control them to the extreme in order to protect them from the rest of society. They invent an older brother who, they tell the children, ventured outside the confines of the estate and was killed by a vicious, flesh eating cat. The parents improvise new definitions for words like sea (an armchair) and zombie (little yellow flower) to further isolate them from anything beyond their bizarre, manipulated microcosm.\n\nThe children's only link to the outside world is Christina (Anna Kalaintzidou), a security guard at the father's workplace, who is paid to relieve the son of his sexual urges. One day, Christina offers a present to the oldest daughter but she is obligated to give her something in return \u2013 oral sex. The family structure starts to unravel once Christina is gone and the oldest daughter is forced to replace her role as the son's personal prostitute. Whatever cruel punishment her father exacts, the oldest daughter isn't deterred from rebelling and, eventually, going to great lengths to gain her freedom.\n\nDogtooth, original Greek title of Kynodontas, is shocking and depraved. This is not for most people and most definitely not for anyone under the age of 18. With multiple sex scenes (a few including incest and a very graphic fellatio clip from a pornographic video tape), an act of animal cruelty, violence and bloodshed, child abuse, and full frontal male and female nudity, this is not for the casual viewer. It seems the only debauchery left out of the film is bestiality (thank goodness).\n\nThe dialog is painful to endure at times but the acting is kind of hypnotic. In fact, it's hard to stop watching entirely because of how inappropriate and insane the movie is. It plays out in a silly fashion with the lies the parents tell the children elevating to absurdity for their own selfish desires (e.g., Frank Sinatra is their grandfather so they have a reason to listen to his records).\n\nFor me, the highlight of Dogtooth is when the two daughters dance for the parents, who are celebrating their anniversary, while the son strums an expressive tune on the guitar. An innocent, reverent dance with her younger sister turns into a frenzied solo interpretation of Flashdance that becomes so intense, she's ordered by her mother to stop. Imagine contestants on shows like America's Got Talent or So You Think You Can Dance who are aired only because their dancing is so horrendous, so hilarious, so over-the-top, but so full of spirit that it must be witnessed."}

{"text": "Update: Whoops! I originally posted that Raya Green was played by Vanessa Oryema. I was wrong - she's played by Rutina Wesley. Sorry!\n\nOk, I'll admit it, I kind of have a teen dance movie problem. One of my favourite movies of last year was Stomp the Yard (I will make an honest case for why I truly believe it is a passionate appeal for gender and racial equality! Also it is full of hot babes).\n\nBut while I understand why some might not quite agree that Stick It is among one of the most rousing and anti-establishment pieces of cinema of the early '00s, with ZERO guilty pleasure quotient I highly, heartily recommend How She Move.\n\nIn a word, what distinguishes How She Move from all the other teen dance movies that I hold dear to my heart, is how Real it is. And Realness is pretty unusual for a genre that can rarely hold itself back when it comes to fulfilling stereotypes about poor neighbourhoods, teenagers, men and women and physically impossible dance sequences.\n\nBoth the female and male characters span a broad spectrum of personalities, instead of falling into socially sanctioned roles of what it means to be a man or a woman. Or when they do fall into those roles, the motivations and reasons for why they choose to follow that path is clear - demonstrating (intentionally or not) that gender is learned rather than biological. That's a pretty hefty topic for a movie featuring Keyshia Cole in a cameo.\n\nMore than that, How She Move features Toronto neighbourhood Jane Finch in all its gritty glory (And yes, the story is actually set in Jane Finch - not Bed Stuy or 8 Mile. Whoohoo Canada!). Unlike other CanCon which tends to try and portray Toronto as a \"world-class city\" the film is honest about both the city's crappiness and potential. Which if you think about it, is more patriotic and loving to Toronto than trying to pretend that Toronto is New York City - despite the fact that the dialogue does still take potshots at poor old Scarborough.\n\nAnd if that's not enough, here's another great thing about How She Move: Rutina Wesley, who plays lead character Raya, just looks like a regular cute teenage girl, instead of a Pussycat Doll. EXTREMELY unusual for a teen dance movie. And Wesley plays Raya as a woman on her own terms, who has an extremely clear sense of what she wants, and is affected but not swayed by the heavy expectations that our culture has of women. And darn it, call me sucker but if that ain't inspirational I don't know what is.\n\nOh, and of course, the dance moves and convoluted plot will knock your socks off. But you already knew that. We are, after all, talking about a teen dance movie. Anyways, must dash, have to go get in line for advance tickets to Step Up 2: The Streets.\n\nPS A Film Friday on a Monday?

{"text": "No related\n\nIn his book-length conversation with Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Alfred Hitchcock famously outlined the crucial difference between surprise and suspense. Surprise, he explained, is a bomb suddenly, unexpectedly exploding underneath a table in the middle of a mundane conversation. If you want suspense, on the other hand, simply make the audience aware of the bomb's presence beneath the table, well before it goes off, so that they're constantly thinking about it as the characters mindlessly chat. \"In the first case we have given the public 15 seconds of surprise at the moment of the explosion. In the second case we have provided them with 15 minutes of suspense. The conclusion is that whenever possible the public must be informed.\"\n\nThere's a third option to this scenario, however\u2014one that movies seldom employ, except in small doses. You can inform the characters as well. Granted, if your protagonist is James Bond or Jack Bauer or even Jeremy Renner's bomb-defusing cowboy from The Hurt Locker\u2014somebody for whom tick-tick-tick is an standard occupational hazard\u2014then you're still in suspense mode. But let a handful of ordinary Joes know that they're liable to explode at any moment, and you don't have 15 seconds of surprise or 15 minutes of suspense, but 150 minutes of pure, unadulterated terror.\n\nAt least, that's the basic idea behind Henri-Georges Clouzot's 1953 classic The Wages Of Fear, in which Yves Montand and three other roughnecks attempt to transport two truckloads of highly unstable nitroglycerin over 300 miles of mountainous terrain. Deriving endless anxiety from brawny men moving as gingerly as possible, it's a riveting anti-action movie, one of the most memorable high-concept pictures ever made in Europe. (William Friedkin directed the inevitable American remake, Sorcerer, in 1977; it's a lesser film, in my opinion, but has a deliriously grungy vibe of its own.) In this scene, our perpetually nervous heroes are using some of their dangerous cargo in an attempt to blow up a gigantic boulder blocking the road.\n\nGiven the nature of the movie, this sequence practically qualifies as frenetic, simply because someone's actually doing something, as opposed to avoiding doing something, like, say, hitting a bump in the road, or just making a sudden stop. Nonetheless, of the four characters onscreen, three are almost entirely passive throughout, watching and waiting and sweating and praying that the next instant, and the next, and the next, won't be their last. In a way, they're in the exact same position we are, albeit with an additional sense of imminent personal doom. They know something disastrous may happen at any moment, but they, like us, can do nothing but observe. (Hitchcock, who had a sort of friendly rivalry with Clouzot\u2014and who actually attempted to purchase the rights to the novel from which Wages Of Fear was adapted\u2014employed the exact same audience-identification tactic the following year in Rear Window.)\n\nPeter Van Eyck, playing the blond dude who pours the nitroglycerin down the hole (having already set in place the hammer that'll set it off), has a different task: portraying fear held barely in check by purposeful action. Rather than contorting his face (as Charles Vanel does at the end of this clip, in a different context\u2014I'll get to that), he lets his breathing do most of the work, packing audible anxiety into each exhalation. He also gets the physical details of sustained tension exactly right. Poker players know that a suddenly trembling hand is a reliable sign that a player knows the pot is his: He unconsciously tenses his muscles, awaiting the perfect card, and can't prevent a tiny spasm when they finally relax. Likewise, Van Eyck's hands are steady as he pours the nitro, but visibly betray him when he lights his cigarette after the task is finished. (I also love the bit where he starts to pick up the thermos of nitro, then stops for a moment to make the sign of the cross over the hole.)\n\nEven more memorable is the symphony of nervous tics the other three men perform during this process. Montand repeatedly, pointlessly fake-striking his lighter; Folco Lulli chewing the end of his cigar like a cow with its cud; Vanel restlessly drumming his fingers on the truck's door\u2014Clouzot really does all but fashion a brief musical number from these signifiers, giving the drivers' collective fear its own percussive rhythm. (It helps that the scene is otherwise completely silent at this point, save for ambient background noise and Van Eyck's breathing.) Their restlessness also underlines their impotence, further reminding us of our own. Empty, repetitive gestures are all you have sometimes. I recall performing similar routines\u2014squeezing my seat's cushioned armrest, usually, but tooth-grinding will do in a pinch\u2014during protracted exercises in heightened, maddening stasis like this one. Possibly even during this one.\n\nFinally, the boulder goes up in smoke, though not before it belatedly occurs to Van Eyck that it might not be the world's most brilliant idea to set off a massive explosion beside rock-strewn hills towering over two trucks loaded with nitroglycerin\u2014in uncovered beds. (Whether Lulli survives the blast, I'll leave those who haven't seen the film to discover for themselves.) In truth, that is the kind of detail someone could easily forget\u2014the fellas were careful to move the trucks some distance from the detonation, around a bend, so they'd be safe from hunks of blown-up boulder, but they weren't thinking about the gravity that put that boulder in the road in the first place. And so they, and we, get to watch a rousing game of Death Pachinko, with small rocks in place of metal balls, and jugs of concentrated kaboom in lieu of pins and holes.\n\nVanel, playing a guy so paralyzed with fear that he can't even flee the truck, arguably goes over the top in his depiction of controlled panic, shuddering as if he were in a massage chair on its highest speed, and screwing his eyes tightly shut at each prospective hit. But this is one of those cases where you do need to know what happened earlier in the movie, which spends almost its entire first half establishing this character as an utterly fearless badass of the first degree. He's comfortable handing his loaded pistol to an enemy and daring him to shoot\u2014and then slapping him hard in the face when he hesitates, and daring him again\u2014yet he goes to jelly at the sight of a small rock tumbling in his direction. That's the whole point; his exaggerated cowardice in this scene counterbalances the exaggerated machismo seen earlier. If even he can't handle the stress, this nail-biter of a film implies, what possible chance do we have?"}

Carnage, Polanski's follow-up to the genially wicked Ghost Writer, can't entirely transcend its stage-bound origins (Yasmina Reza's Tony-winning God of Carnage), but it works as a fantastically nasty showcase for some immensely talented performers to get down with their bad selves. Think a mixed-doubles tennis match, with cherry bombs. Kicking off with a deceptively placid shot of kids at play, Reza and Polanski's screenplay follows the thermonuclear differences of opinion that occur when an upper-crust New York pair (Jodie Foster, John C. Reilly) invite another couple (Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz) into their apartment in an attempt to resolve a scuffle between their children. Verbal dustups of all shapes and sizes quickly follow. For all of Reza's celebrated dark wit and way with a punch line (the running gag involving a hamster just kills), there's a rather flowcharty feel to her scenario here, with the various escalations and shifts in allegiance between the four coming at fairly predictable intervals. Thankfully, Polanski keeps things moving at an expert clip, mainly by taking his cast's most distinguishable characteristics (Reilly's cuddly everyman quality, Winslet's repressed earthiness) and cinching them all a few notches too tight, particularly in the case of Foster, who delivers a merciless lampooning of her own intelligence. (The most outwardly reprehensible of the lot, Waltz's Blackberry-obsessed lawyer, somehow comes off the best, simply by being self-aware.) First-daters may want to stay far, far away, but in Polanski's hands, Carnage delivers a brisk, blackly hilarious 79 minutes in the presence of some wonderfully bad company. --Andrew Wright"}
{"text": "Movie Review: It Might Get Loud\n\nDavis Guggenheim wanted to make a documentary about the electric guitar. But what he created was far more \u2013 a portrait of the artists as men.\n\nJimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, The Edge of U2, and Jack White of The White Stripes and The Raconteurs. The buildup to their meeting is beautifully orchestrated, each talking in the back of their own town car, heading to a nicely upholstered showdown at high noon.\n\nThey come from their respective corners to meet in the well-lit center of a huge studio. There is a moment of silence, hands are shaken and then each settles warily into his own corner. No one is sure what might happen next.\n\nGuggenheim manages to strike a balance between the current incarnations of the artists, and where they came from \u2013 why they began playing; how they got to be who they are. In a combination of individual interviews and historical footage threaded through this two-day \"summit,\" we are given a picture of these men as musicians, as creators, and as people. They are guitarists of different generations, influences, places in their lives, and the world. But their common drive to create makes them shine on the screen and pound in your ears.\n\nThe most incredible moments happened when the guitarist started talking about how they make \"their sound.\" Academically, it's easy to say that Zeppelin sounds different than U2 and different than The Ranconteurs, but it's harder to quantify exactly why. But then Jimmy Page starts discussing how he first discovered distortion pedals to create sustain, so a single note can go on to infinity, and you're hearing the sonic boom of Led Zeppelin. And then The Edge starts voicing an E-chord: moving the rich inner notes out and paring it down until it's the ringing, glorious tones that are U2. And when Jack White sits in a plain wooden room talking about his constant need to work against the circumstances, through warped wood and out of tune strings, searching for the rawest, realest sound possible where all the emotion is out on the surface, everything he's done makes just a bit more sense.\n\nMoving from Page's home in England, to Edge's studio in Ireland, and White's farm in North Carolina, the picture of who these artists are becomes more and more clear. There is a lot of discussion of the instrument itself, and what it is capable of. The Edge is central in these scenes, as his studio is practically a sonic supercomputer, with huge arrays of effect pedals and distorters. Page and White stand in interesting contrast to this, as Page was developing his sound at a time when the technology was new, and White searches for the lo-fi version of it all: a crackly-edged sound form an old LP."}

{"text": "Parents say\n\nKids say\n\nWhat parents need to know\n\nParents need to know that while this movie's content is squeaky-clean (with sexuality limited to a few brief kisses), the plot behind the songs and dances is racier than that of the typical musical, featuring romantic complications, infidelity, and a predatory female character who seems intent on turning Gene Kelly's character into a gigolo. Younger kids probably won't get the innuendos, while older ones may be a bit discomfited by the romantic duplicity of the film's characters.\n\nWhat's the story?\n\nTriple threat Gene Kelly acts, sings, and dances beautifully in this eye-catching musical laced with Gershwin songs and gorgeous dance numbers. Jerry Mulligan (Kelly) is a former WWII soldier who stayed in Paris after the war ended to pursue his love of painting. A wealthy divorcee (Nina Foch) has offered to be his patron, though she's clearly interested more in Jerry himself than his work. Meanwhile, Jerry has fallen for a pretty French dancer (Leslie Caron, in her screen debut), and is having trouble choosing between financial security and passion.\n\nIs it any good?\n\nThe song-and-dance segments are the main appeal of AN AMERICAN IN PARIS particularly Gershwin's 17-minute title piece, accompanied by a lengthy ballet built around the main characters. It's a knockout, and a good thing, too, because the plot is nothing to write home about.\n\nThe characters are silly, duplicitous, and grasping, and resemble nothing so much as cardboard cutouts meant to push a plot along in between musical numbers. But what does it matter, when the songs are so delicious (particularly \"S'Wonderful\" and \"I Got Rhythm\") and the dancing so infectious? Lavish sets, gorgeous costumes, great music -- this one's a feast for the eyes and ears, not for the brainGood for what it is:\n\nA 50+ year old musical with mediocre acting. It is interesting visually, but the ending is a ridiculously long number that is 100% unneeded. Mostly for Kelly's fans, or real old movie buffs. Probably the worst Best Picture winner I've seen thus far.\n\namerican paris"}
{"text": "Sometimes, you just need a good movie to watch indoors. We get it, you can't go out every night.\n\nThat sounds ridiculous, really, but hey, it's your life.\n\nSeriously, we're here to help. Once each week, we'll recommend a movie to rent, Netflix, download or steal from a friend. Just make sure you give it back when you're done.\n\nThis week, it's ...\n\n'A Hard Day's Night'\n\n\"Bieber Fever\" has swept the nation, much like the very mop on the kid's head. The release of \"Justin Bieber: Never Say Never\" is probably the apex of such fever, with an unmemorable but good-enough Grammy performance accompanying the ailment.\n\n\"Never Say Never\" is a documentary, showing Justin as Justin, as a kid readying for his biggest performance yet. There are flashbacks and stories, drop-ins and quick cuts. It's a well put together spectacle of celebrity, the insider's look that really isn't an insider's look, more just a way to keep the fans wanting more.\n\nBut that's how it goes today. Celebrities are carefully sculpted and protected, from films to promotional appearances. And Bieber has to be Bieber, the one that tweets, the one that shows up on MTV - you can't make things up, just show the truth as protectively as possible. So \"Never Say Never\" is a good documentary, but nothing monumental.\n\nThat leads us to \"A Hard Day's Night,\" directed by Richard Lester, the first film that really peered into the glass of rising celebrity. Sure Elvis made movies, but those films showed Elvis as a character on a beach. The Beatles first film was about them - the Beatles - and how crazy their lives had become so instantly.\n\n\"A Hard Day's Night,\" though, isn't all about protection, and it doesn't tell the truth. There's a loose plot about Paul's meddling grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell), who must travel with the band and be kept watch of because he starts trouble. In reality, Paul's grandfather didn't travel with the band, and really, we knew nothing about him at all. This whole business isn't part of the Beatles lives - it's just a plot to tie things together.\n\nAnd protection is little, if at all. John Lennon wisecracks throughout, especially in a party with upscale Brits. The humor is near seething as the Beatles take down their uppity counterparts. Bieber? He wouldn't offend a fly, since that fly could potentially be part of his target audience.\n\n\"A Hard Day's Night\" really gives the Beatles added personality, more than what people saw through press conferences and quotes. Back in 1964, that's all you had - some quotes, some conferences; no Twitter, no YouTube, no MTV, no nothing. Protection was inherit. So \"A Hard Day's Night\" tries to round out the image that the Beatles' sculpted early: Paul is charming, John is sarcastic to a fault, George is shy, Ringo is odd. In the most poignant scene of the film, Ringo decides to leave the group for a walk along the river. He skips stones and meets a young boy, with whom he plays. It's set to the subtle and sweet \"That Boy,\" one of the Beatles' earliest dips into melancholy.\n\nCompare that to Bieber. Could you imagine Bieber walking by the river, alone, skipping stones and playing with a kid? Moreover, could you imagine it not being contrived? Of course not - this is reality. Bieber is there for the world to see. Ringo? He wasn't Tweeting back in 1964. The river scene, fictional or not, seemed plausible.\n\nSo in that sense, \"A Hard Day's Night\" is a genuine film, showing how fame can affect people in a short amount of time, but without cameras poking into their lives, and without quick cuts leading to exposition about drum sets and YouTube videos. Mystery, at least in 1964, was much more thrilling than constant information.\n\nOh, and then there's music.\n\nOf course, \"A Hard Day's Night\" is like \"Never Say Never\" in that it's an excuse to play all the hits. The opening montage set to the title song is iconic - it captures instant fame in a way no three minutes in any modern documentary could dream. You also get the lovely \"If I Fell,\" the charming \"I Should Have Known Better\" and the romantic \"And I Love Her.\" Not to mention the other giant A-side from that record, \"Can't Buy Me Love,\" which also gets the music video treatment - a wondrous multi-minute camera adventure through an open lot. Simpler times, indeed.\n\n\"A Hard Day's Night\" is a masterwork of cinema verite. It's gentle, but at times ravenous, and it always seems tucked in its own world. It doesn't shout at you, but it doesn't make you fall asleep. It's simply a film that shows humans in a life that slowly is becoming inhuman. But it never felt so real"}

Susan Sarandon does the usual Hollywood hatchet job on the stereotypical conservative cold-hearted opportunistic prosecutors who only care about getting re-elected, the kind of evil (i.e. Republican) politician she and her fellow liberals love to parody. But her character does point out a major problem with the \"drug war,\" that things like mandatory sentences, long-term no-parole prison time, and \"three strikes and you're out\" penalties are really just ploys, part of the smokescreen the politicians use to rack up convictions so they can get re-elected on their \"law and order\" record, no matter what their party affiliation is. Members of Congress and state legislators, not just prosecutors, they're all playing the system against us. There's a lot of substance in this movie that parents and kids could talk about.

{"text": "Search form\n\nPHONE BOOTH - DVD review\n\n'Phone Booth' is a great call.\n\nJohn J.\n\nPuccio\n\nSaturday, June 21, 2003 - 12:00am\n\nA phone booth hasn't gotten this much attention since \"Superman.\"\n\nFrom filmmaker Joel Schumacher, who directed Colin Farrell in \"Tigerland\" (2000) and Kiefer Sutherland in \"The Lost Boys\" (1987) and \"Flatliners\" (1990), comes this 2002 thriller starring Farrell and Sutherland about a sniper who pins a guy down in a phone booth. It sounds preposterous to sustain for the duration of a feature-length film, you say? Think again. \"Phone Booth\" may be imperfect, its biggest flaws being two unsympathetic main characters and a contrived and far-fetched plot, but that doesn't stop the audience from having a heck of a good time most of the way. It's quite an accomplishment, really, when you consider that Farrell is on screen almost 100% of the time and Sutherland is a disembodied voice.\n\nWe're told at the beginning of the movie that despite practically everyone in the greater New York metropolitan area owning a telephone, approximately 4,500,000 people still use phone booths on a regular basis. One of these people is publicist Stu Shepard, a married man who daily uses the last remaining old-fashioned phone booth in the city for calls to his girlfriend, Pam (Katie Holmes). He calls at same time every day from a place he feels his wife (Radha Mitchell) will never find evidence on the phone bills. It's a booth in busy, downtown Manhattan, about to be retired and replaced by a ubiquitous telephone kiosk. But today it's all Stu's, his privacy secure. That is, until a sniper targets him for his personal amusement.\n\nHigh above the phone booth, hidden in one of a thousand windows, is a madman with a high-powered rifle and a telescopic lens, a man who knows Stu's every move and has rigged up the booth with all manner of gizmos to get and keep Stu's attention. He's never met Stu, but he's researched him and hates what he represents: a fast-talking schemer, a conceited ladies' man, and an unfaithful husband. It's enough for the sniper to call Stu at the booth and then keep him there with the promise of a bullet through his head if he dares leave. If Stu hangs up or steps out of the booth, it's good-bye, Stu. Those few square feet suddenly become for the duration of the movie Stu's whole world, his whole life.\n\nDoes the killer mean what he says? \"Stu,\" the sniper tells him, \"I never kid.\" And then he blows away a pimp who's come to claim the phone booth for one of his girls. The police arrive, finding Stu in the booth and the dead body outside, and assume Stu is a murderer.\n\nThat's the whole situation in a nutshell, set up in the first few minutes of the picture and continuing for the remainder of the film. The sniper is a self-appointed vigilante who finds Stu guilty of \"inhumanity\" to his fellow man. Forest Whitaker plays a policeman, Captain Ramey, who has to figure out what's going on and what to do. Before long, Stu's become famous, because not only does half the NYC blue show up but so do the television cameras. Yet Stu can't explain why he won't leave the booth or what's happening to him, lest the unknown, unseen sniper put a bullet through him.\n\nThe situation is tense, scary, and gripping throughout, even if the whole affair is too incredible to believe. It's to the film's credit, however, that it doesn't give one enough time to consider the logic until it's over, by which time you don't care because it's been so entertaining.\n\nI did have a few quibbles, though, that nagged me during and after the picture. Most important, was it really necessary to make both leads so repellant? It goes without saying that the sniper is a lunatic, a serial killer who's done this kind of thing before; we're not supposed to have any heart for him. He is virtually never seen, and Sutherland projects in his voice exactly the right degree of slimy menace to make him totally repulsive. Indeed, it is Sutherland who practically steals the show, he's so mesmerizing, a little like the old-time \"Shadow.\"\n\nBut Farrell's character is almost equally offensive. Stu is the kind of guy who gives PR a bad name: a lying, cheating, conniving, self-centered young jerk without a care in the world for anybody but himself. Frankly, for most of the picture, we don't feel enough for him to care whether he lives or dies. Indeed, I'd be willing to bet that a lot of folks in the audience would like to see him blown away regardless. Worse, there's a reason for Stu's being such a total creep, and when it's revealed, it's almost as bad as our not knowing.\n\nI also had issues with the movie's ending; with the police captain's extraneous problems with a department negotiator; with the director's overreliance on split screens and multi-angles; and with the fact that the plot runs out of steam about two-thirds of the way through, making the film probably too long even for its brief eighty-one minutes. Still, it's a good time while it lasts.\n\nThe story is the brainchild of writer Larry Cohen, hitherto known for B-movie and schlock horror flicks like \"Maniac Cop\" and \"It's Alive.\" With \"Phone Booth,\" however, Cohen is right on target and hits the mark, if you'll excuse the expression. It's still B-movie material, mind you, but it's good B-movie material, elevating the substance of this film well beyond anything we have had any right to expect from the genre.\n\nVideo: As usual, Fox delivers a clean, crisp DVD picture, projected in both an anamorphic widescreen that measures an approximately 2.17:1 ratio across a normal television and a pan-and-scan, standard format. The P&S on side two is not entirely objectionable, however, as it restores information at the bottom of the screen while cutting off the edges. Even movies shot specifically for release in widescreen formats like Panavision are most often photographed in larger negative sizes in order to ensure that things like microphones, booms, and other hanging objects in a frame can later be cut out. Since \"Phone Booth\" was released to theaters in something like 2.35:1, the widescreen on the disc will be the preferred viewing for movie purists.\n\nAs to the picture quality, understandably, there's not a lot of color in the movie; I mean, the guy's in a phone booth, after all. But the transfer is as sharply defined and the hues as clearly presented as I would imagine they looked in a movie house, and there is virtually no grain and there are no moir\u00e9 effects or other digital transfer artifacts of mention.\n\nAudio: The Dolby Digital 5.1 sonics are at least half the fun. In a movie that depends upon our sense of hearing as much as our sense of seeing, the audio reproduction does its part admirably. The surround speakers are used to create an all-encompassing environment, and the front speakers erupt with violent outbreaks of dynamics and bass. What's more, it's satisfying to hear Sutherland's unflappable speech patterns projected not just from the center channel but from above and beyond the center channel, and it's good to hear other voices actually moving across the screen along with their characters. The movie provides an enthralling aural experience all by itself.\n\nExtras: Not a lot going on here. Besides offering the film in standard and widescreen formats, the only other bonus item of note the Fox people provide is an audio commentary with director Schumacher. Beyond that, there are twenty-eight scene selections and theatrical trailers for this film and something called \"Garage Days.\" English, French, and Spanish are the spoken language options, with English and Spanish for subtitles\n\nParting Thoughts: \"Phone Booth\" is, without a doubt, little more than an amusement-park joy ride, but what an enjoyable ride it is! With the sure hand of a capable director and the exceptionally fine performances of its three principal actors, the film is one of the edgiest, most exciting dramas to come along in a while. In short, \"Phone Booth\" is a great call."}

{"text": "Tools\n\nJohn Waters' Cecil B. Demented concerns a gang of crazed young underground filmmakers, led by the eponymous Cecil B. (Stephen Dorff), who kidnap a Hollywood star and force her to a play a role in their anarchic, shot-on-the-run anti-Hollywood 16mm film. As the movie opens--in Baltimore, as always--the star, Honey Whitlock (Melanie Griffith) is bitching about crab cakes and having to be polite to the yokels. The city's revenge comes swiftly. Cecil's gang sweeps her out of a charity premiere and spirits her to its hideaway in an abandoned movie theater, where she finds that her new company is an assemblage of snarling misfits: a porn star, a Satanist (she does make-up), a junkie, a gay guy and his beloved, a straight guy who's racked with guilt over his heterosexuality.\n\nGiven the premise, you may or may not be surprised to learn that Waters has again awarded a small part to his friend Patty Hearst, who once upon a time was kidnapped and forced to play a role in the radical scenarios of a group of crazed media-seekers. Does Patty not get the joke, or is her appearance in the film her way of saying it's OK, even she can laugh at her gun-toting past? Hard to tell.\n\nAs Patty once did, Honey eventually comes to identify with her captors and casts her lot with them. And why not? Beyond being a bunch of cool wackos who have lots of goofy fun, they're just the opposite of the rich, jaded Hollywood types she knows too well. These kids are passionate about cinema. Their makeshift studio-cum-hideout is a combination of Che Guevara, Peter Pan and Norma Desmond's derelict manse in Sunset Boulevard. They've even tattooed themselves with the names of their favorite film directors. The list includes Otto Preminger (Cecil's choice), Peckinpah, Warhol, Sam Fuller, William Castle, Almodovar and Fassbinder.\n\nCecil and his cronies are like the Bonnie and Clyde of oppositional cinema. Berserk with hatred of Hollywood, they stage attacks on its local manifestations (and film themselves doing so): a multiplex showing of Patch Adams: The Director's Cut, the shooting of the sequel to Forrest Gump, a party where the Baltimore film commission schmoozes studio creeps. Rather than Tinseltown's phony, brain-destroying crap, Demented and Co. want to save real movie culture: art houses, porn theaters, the last of the drive-ins.\n\nAll of this is fun and pretty consistently funny--especially for viewers who get the references. Waters stages his daffy satire at an assured clip and gets droll, confident performances from his cast, especially leads Dorff and Griffith, who don't undercut their roles by winking at them. But that's not to say that Cecil B. Demented is a seamless success. In fact, watching it can produce something akin to vertigo: Call it movie-culture cognitive dissonance, in spades.\n\nProblem is, the film's as cluelessly out of sync as Rip Van Winkle. If it had been made 10 or 12 years ago, it would have seemed only five to 10 years out of date. Whose notion of \"underground cinema\" does it purvey? The '60s', of course. And all those tattooed-on-the-arm celluloid heroes? Ditto. I can't believe you'd find many 20-somethings in the year 2000 who know the oeuvres of--much less give a toot about--Otto Preminger and William Castle. Both were cult faves of collegiate cine-nerds circa 1969.\n\nAnd look who's selling a mock-revolutionary pose in making Cecil B. Demented. Not only is Waters 54 years old, but he's now as much a part of the system as his fellow Baltimorean Barry Levinson. (Cecil B. Demented comes to us from USA Films, which is owned by Universal.) Who does he think he's kidding? The most giddily clueless thing about the movie is that it seems to think it's a barb that will sting the gilded hide of Hollywood. If it were satirizing kids who imagine themselves as cinematic rebels, when all they're doing is aping the radical chic of 35 years ago (which was a bit ridiculous to begin with), that would be one thing. But Waters' sympathies and allegiances are actually with Cecil B. and his motley crew, as if they bore even a faint resemblance to present-day young film aficionados.\n\nOf course they don't. They're part of an imaginary world in which independent filmmaking--a term never used in the film--simply doesn't exist. Shooting on 16mm? That's so retro, too, at a time when any would-be auteur can pick up a mini-DV camera and make a feature. In fact, all of Cecil B. Demented's reference points for \"radical\"--tattoos, gays, porn, what have you--are now all so thoroughly a part of mainstream culture that the movie's own sensibility ends up seeming barely a step away from the shopping-mall, multiplex mindset it purports to detest.\n\nWhat Cecil B. Demented gives us ultimately is further proof of how some revolutionaries survive, once their salad days have passed, as nostalgia merchants. Still, it's hard not to retain a fondness for John Waters; from the era of Multiple Maniacs and Pink Flamingos on, his love of sleaze and bourgie-tweaking sensationalism always had a true believer's guileless exuberance. Of course, Almodovar, one of Waters' heroes, started from similar premises and has continued to grow, turning out films in recent years that far surpass his early work in depth and humanity. But Almodovar clearly was willing to grow, where Waters has been content to endlessly recycle his childhood fetishes and fantasies. If anyone's interested, that's one definition of the difference between an artist and an entertainer"}

{"text": "Review\n\nThe title alone of Kirby Dick's alleged documentary Sick: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist practically screams: \"This is not your standard biopic!\" And the first scene, in which Flanagan reads his own obituary, is all the confirmation we need. Dick's film is an unquestionably straightforward and unflinching depiction of Bob Flanagan's painful and prolonged death from Cystic Fibrosis and the director manages to bend some of the affectations of \"documentary etiquette\" most other filmmakers place on themselves, without ever traversing into essay film territory. Flanagan is portrayed in the film as a mordantly hilarious man who has turned his entire life into a realization of his fictional fantasies. He has made his own body the canvas for his gruesome art displays. Simple enough, but Dick is savvy enough to realize that a scrawny little dude committing various atrocities to his body isn't profound in and of itself and is liable to send audiences running for cover. (Though thanks to a notorious scene involving a hammer, a nail, and Bob's knobby cock, many exited before the final reel anyway.) Instead, what makes Sick more than just a provocation is how Dick conveys how often people attempt to understand those around them in terms of themselves. Though no one, not even Bob, can offer a conclusive explanation for the appeal of sadomasochism, everyone has their own theory (that more often than not speaks to his or her own various life outlooks). Bob suggests that engaging in S&M actually makes him a stronger person, and more resistant to the debilitating effects of his disease (a theory made more plausible when one takes into account that Bob lived a couple decades longer than most CF patients do). His mother, who has already buried two children to CF, seems fairly certain that Bob uses his whips n' chains to punish the body that has betrayed him. Between the two extremes is Bob's life/artistic partner Sheree, who knows that it's mostly a kinky turn on; but, of course, she could just be saying that because he's her butt-plug bitch."}

{"text": "To find a new movie with\na tight, toned plot, you'd have to settle\nfor an old one that happens to feel as good\nas new. Right now, you won't do better than\n''Elevator to the Gallows,\" the\ntasty 1957 noir thriller that introduced the\nworld to French filmmaker Louis Malle, who\nat the time was a 24-year-old assistant director\nfor Jacques Cousteau.\n\nThe movie is cooler and more heartless than\nthe films that would define him. But even\nas a preliminary exercise in suspense, the\nfilm suggests Malle could have made a name\nfor himself as a Hitchcock copycat, though\nhe'd go on to make more feeling pictures, such\nas 1971's ''Murmur of the Heart.\"\n\n''Elevator to the Gallows\" gets\noff to a swift start. In a phone call, illicit\nlovers Florence (Jeanne Moreau) and Julien\n(Maurice Ronet) imagine their future once Julien\ndoes away with his boss, who's also her husband.\nJulien hangs up, tells his secretary not to\ninterrupt him, closes his door, and pulls open\na drawer. Inside are a pair of leather gloves,\na pistol, and a length of rope attached to\na grapple. He then slips out the window and\nonto a veranda\n. Julien hoists himself into the boss's office,\nwhere he puts his gun to the man's head.\nWhen he fires, we see his secretary downstairs\nand hear what she hears: the grind of pencils\nin the sharpener. Upstairs Julien slips the\ngun into the corpse's hand, then climbs back\ndown to his office just in time to call it\na day.\n\nThe sequence is a pleasure to watch both\nfor the smoothness of the criminal and\nthe craftsmanship of the crime. Malle allows\nus to see past the absurdity (Julien is wearing\na suit and dress shoes!) in order to admire\nthe man's aplomb. That I can recount the murder\naction for action suggests a bygone vintage\nof filmmaking. There is neither slam nor bang,\njust an absorbing deliberateness.\n\nJulien, sadly, isn't as meticulous as Malle\nin that sequence. It's not until he's in\nhis convertible, ready to meet Florence, that\nhe looks up and realizes he's left the rope\ndangling in plain sight. Slipping back inside\nto retrieve it, he's trapped in the elevator\nwhen the building is closed for the night.\nIt would be a delight to give you a synopsis\nof what follows, but it would rob you of the\nquality of Malle's storytelling.\n\nMalle was working with the master French\nNew Wave cinematographer Henri Decae, who\nunderstood that the sinister and the sexy did\nnot have to be mutually exclusive. Decae's\nblack-and-white photography infuses Malle's\nmovie with the street-level ominousness he\nused for the formidable noir specialist Jean-Pierre\nMelville, whose ''Bob le Flambeur\"\nhad come out two years before.\n\nThe film's look makes a divine accessory\nfor its music, which Miles Davis composed.\nThere's not even 20 minutes of it in the film,\nyet it still defines the atmosphere, transforming\na crime yarn into a bebop noir. During a particularly\ntense scene in the elevator, all Davis needs\nto do to make us grip our armrests is tap a\ncymbal and pluck a bass. But between Davis\nand Decae, the movie is probably too cool for\nits own good. This picture works better as\na gripping mood piece than it does as a study\nof character.\n\nNothing anyone does is quite believable.\nStuck in that elevator, Julien calmly smokes\naway the hours. As for Florence, she wanders\naround Paris looking for Julien, thinking she's\nbeen jilted. She looks blue yet more fabulous\nas day breaks. When a car screeches to a stop\nto avoid hitting her, Moreau doesn't even bother\nto look up. So, needless to say, panic is conspicuous\nby its absence.\nBut the noticeable lack of human warmth doesn't\ncompromise the plot's strength. Had Malle opted\nfor mannequins over movie stars, the casting\nwouldn't have made the proceedings any less\nentertaining."}
{"text": "What's the story?\n\n\"Fast\" Eddie Felsen (Paul Newman) is a pool hustler. He and his partner, Charlie, go into pool halls and set the local players up. Eddie's dream is to beat the legendary Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), so he challenges him to a contest. After more than 24 hours, Eddie realizes he can't win. He leaves Charlie the money and the car, and goes off on his own. Eddie meets Sarah (Piper Laurie), an alcoholic, and moves in with her. Eddie struggles with his identity in more than a few ways, but grows closer to Sarah. He teams up with gambler Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), who sets up a game with a rich man. In a mirror image of the game with Fats, Eddie loses at first, and then, defying Sarah's appeal to quit, persists, and wins $12,000. In the tug-of-war for Eddie, Bert has won, and Sarah commits suicide. In a new frame of mind, Eddie decides to challenge Fats to a game again.\n\nIs it any good?\n\nDespite the seedy settings (so evocative that they are almost a character in the story), this is almost a traditional morality play about humility and redemption. In the beginning Eddie is, as Fats notes, as fast as his nickname, slick, cocky, superficial. He wants to win for the kick of it. But inside him, there is someone who wants to win for the beauty of the game, and the honor of doing something surpassingly well. But before he can be a real winner, he must get rid of the part of himself that wants to lose, that is afraid to take a real risk. For that, he has to experience real loss, especially the loss of Sarah.\n\nAs Nietzsche said, \"That which does not defeat me makes me stronger.\" Eddie is strengthened so by these experiences and by what he has learned, that he can no longer be contained by what had once been his entire world. Bert's threat that he will no longer be able to play big-time pool is meaningless to him. Even if Bert had offered him a 50-50 deal, he would not have taken it. That world is too small and self- contained for him now in this movie have different ideas about what makes someone a winner or a loser. What are those ideas? How do they fit with others you have heard about, or with your own? What made Eddie different between his two games with Fats? Why didn't Sarah want Eddie to keep playing Findlay? How do Sarah and Bert represent two different parts of Eddie that fight with each other"}
{"text": "This Swedish film is strongly rooted in comic books and video games, though it truly bears little resemblance to either medium. What opens with the promise of being an action film filled with bloody street brawls, turns out to be more of an examination of one man's inability to feel (both emotionally and in a tactile capacity).\n\nDonny, more commonly known as DD, is a hapless, pot smoking lay about, who is too cheap and lazy to even get himself laid. By chance (or so it seems), DD is given a mysterious white box by a woman named Lova, who claims the box is the key to \"everything.\" As it turns out, Lova may also be an immortal and a fictional character\u2014 the star of comic books and video games, Storm. The DVD synopsis says that they travel through time in a battle of good vs. evil, but I'm not sure that's entirely accurate. What it boils down to is that there are a group of bald maniacs led by a man with a scar, who wants to keep DD from remembering some suppressed childhood memory. Personally, I don't see revisiting memories as time travel. It makes little sense when you're watching it, but the film has a great sense of humor, softening up the audience with an Amelie-style introduction from DD.\n\nThe synopsis also compares the film to The Matrix, which is really unfair to Storm. The two films are nothing alike, and Storm, with its virtually unexplained, complicated storyline, is far more intelligent than the Wachowskis' action-fest. And as I hinted at before, there is very little fighting, though the film opens with Lova beating the maniacs with a bike chain. But there is one incredible action sequence, which harkens less to The Matrix than to comic books in general, where DD is reading a comic book about Storm. The sequence begins in animation and dissolves into live action, with Eva Rose (who plays Lova) as Storm, maneuvering her way through a series of laser trips and kicking some bald maniac ass.\n\nOverall, Storm may be a little off-putting to some viewers with its vague storyline and sporadic periods of more introspective down time, but it is definitely worth a watch for those who enjoy more experimental cinema."}
{"text": "This is a hard-hitting movie. So real and true to life and yet so beautifully crafted. Amazing work done by the actors of the movie, especially by Irfan Khan and Tabu. Excellent direction by Mira Nair. Its like reading the novel without the book, its like living with the characters themselves. It just doesnt get better. Its thought provoking.\n\nExcellent family story of typical intergenerational communiction problems. It is not just because of cultural differences that families do not communicate well, but it does add a lot to this story. Excellent acting and plausable twists kept me interested as did the deep emotional content of the material and actors. I cared about this family and their well-being.\n\nTo its credit, \"The Namesake\"(which tops the two-hour mark), could've been a lot longer without causing anybody(who isn't a philistine) to check their watches. If a director's cut exists, that's where we'll learn how Gogol Ganguli(Kal Penn) met Maxine(Jacinda Barrett). \"The Namesake\" has a truncated feel because Gogol is already treated like a member of Maxine9;s wealthy family when the audience is first introduced to her. Perhaps the filmmaker simply wanted to avoid the predictability involved in seeing a white family adjust to their offspring's \"exotic\" new friend, if acceptance into the fold is going to be the end-result anyway. \"The Namesake\" does a terrific job of not turning Maxine into an ugly American when she's inside the Ganguli household. Contrary to Maxine(who for the most part seems unaware of her countless faux pas' to Indian customs), Gogol and his sister are consciously arrogant about their American-ness when they return to their native India. \"The Namesake\" is mostly an amazing film about being an American on a cultural group's own terms.\u2026Expand\n\nProbably the best movie out this year! Great cast, with terrific Indian scenery. The best part is the message about foreigners trying to assimilate into a new culture, and the desire to keep traditions. This is the must-see movie of the year!"}
{"text": "zimchick's review:\n\nOk so this movie will require a bit of effort seeing as it is subtitled, but I can assure you it's worth it. I might be a tad biased due to my African upbringing but what you see is a movie from the usually overlooked perspective as what would be perceived as the 'villain'. Tsotsi means thief. What you will see is an insight into the path that leads a boy to become a thief. Set in South Africa, this is sadly too true a story for many of the locals whose lives inevitably lead down a hopeless path."}
{"text": "Mont-Laurier\n\nUser's review\n\nIt's an 8 if you'd enjoy a reflective look at human nature and facing, pondering or preparing for death. That is what most of this movie is like. It's an 8 for me because it also has a few freaky thrills, loud and intense, and because it's a drama that makes you jump from time to time as well as any real quality thriller. That's a pretty unique combo that worked for me. However, it's mostly a deep and heavy drama. Going in expecting thrills, horror and intense violence, you'll be disappointed by 95% of the movie. Going in and expecting a drama while not being turned off by 'scary' at times, or a little gory on occasion, you just might love it."}
{"text": "After a four-day coma Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) can't remember much other than taking a shower with his wife, Liz, which isn't so bad since she's played by January Jones. The trouble is that Liz doesn't recognize him anymore and another man (Aidan Quinn) claims to be the real Dr. Martin Harris, which leads to what's surely the biggest-ever mix-up at a Berlin biotechnical summit. The buzz: Lately Neeson's no stranger to major trouble in Europe (\"Taken\") or thrillers that stretch credibility like a rubber band wrapped around the equator (\"The Next Three Days\"). In \"Unknown,\" which is based on the novel \"Out of My Head,\" the question is only if the 58-year-old actor will be another veteran badass or just an intellectual at the center of a conspiracy. Or both? The verdict: Perhaps there's a place in the world where cabbies look like Diane Kruger, who plays the driver of the cab that tumbles off a bridge and puts Martin in a coma. Maybe viewers won't mind when Jones speaks like she's trying to remember her lines or when a creepy scenario continuously turns funny, such as when the two Martins speak in unison. What undoubtedly matters is the way \"Unknown\" twists a mystery into such nonsensical idiocy that the movie should be used in labs to monitor brain activity as it moves from curious to bored to annoyed.\n\nDid you know? Martin indicates that women are brave to marry scientists. Consider what other professions (scientist's assistant?) you'd find even less desirable for a spouse"}

{"text": "June 30, 2011\n\nI know. Who cares what I think? If you don't, then you don't have to read. If you do, then go ahead.\n\nTerrence Malick's The Tree of Life is a pretty, poetic, and even confusing film created from a white, privileged, hetero male perspective. Necessarily. But to those who think The Tree of Life is all about boyhood (Roger Ebert): it probably is to you, but I beg to differ. The only person that walked out of the theater when I saw it last night was a man. My boyfriend liked it less than I liked it. But we both found plenty to say about the movie and talked about it for hours afterwards. He found it confusing and inaccessible. I found it pretty and fruitful. For whatever that's worth.\n\nNone of the characters are realistic; they are all excellent conglomerations of pieces of people with both endearing and revolting traits. The mom was so unrealistically perfect, a pure mother Mary, and the dad so Biblically Old Testament doling out \"loving\" punishment, that we recognize them both as people we know, but not entirely. They are archetypes. They serve as metaphors of strict gender roles in a Judeo-Christian Western civilization. It is sad that a mom won't speak up and a dad won't shut up. Things I've learned in life: don't expect a revolutionary message from Brad Pitt. Or Terrence Malick, for that matter.\n\nStill, some of the themes are universal. To me, The Tree of Lifeis a meditation about nature v. grace, or the cruelty and goodness found simultaneously in nature, humanity, and history. I think most Arab Muslims and American Christians and Tibetan Buddhists would agree that humans are interested in the struggle between cruelty and goodness within our souls and in our environment.\n\nWhy do young boys get together and strap a frog to an exploding rocket? Why does a big brother put his little brother in danger? Why does a little brother trust so unconditionally? Why did a sweet 19 year old boy die? Why did God take him? Nobody knows. It is disgustingly sad that parents outlive their children, yet it is a fucking terrible truth.\n\nI don't know if you've ever had someone very close to you die. But when my dad died when I was 19, my thoughts turned to God and the Universe and BIG, mysterious, unanswerable questions. I wrote letters and emails and journal entries that didn't make a lick of sense; I'm sure my best friend at the time thought I was going crazy. The week after my dad died, I went back to college, and I bought a strand of Christmas lights, and I put them up on my dormroom wall in the shape of a tree. I told everyone who came to visit me that it was the 'Tree of Life.' No kidding. I still have pictures of it. Maybe I was going crazy, or maybe I was grieving.\n\nTo me, the human mind is hard-wired toward nostalgia. It is hard to sit in reality when you are greiving. You'll let your mind wander. Anywhere but the pain of here and now is better, you think. We grow into adults and get unhappy and look back. But Malick's film reminds us that we might all do well to notice how the buildings and bridges and the trees and planets and jellyfish are endlessly curious. Humans may be innately impatient and in a hurry; but I'm convinced capitalism makes this worse. See the modern-day character played by Sean Penn. It is sad how a little boy can grow up to be the man he knew he would become, but didn't try or want to become.We should all pay attention more.\n\nExcept when CGI dinosaurs appear on-screen. WHY!?! They made me cringe like when my mom says something awkward in the middle of a delicious dinner. I'm just gonna pretend it didn't happen.\n\nBack to the one thing every viewer and reviewer of the movie seems compelled to acknowledge: this movie is gorgeous. Roger Ebert was on to something when he said, \"Rarely does a film seem more obviously a collaboration of love between a director and his production designer, in this case, Jack Fisk.\" Awe. And I would say the wardrobe designer deserves some props, too. So here's to Jacqueline West! I loved the wardrobe. Loved. Every. Dress. That. Mama. Wore.\n\nOften, we want direct messages, commandments almost. But we don't get that with The Tree of Life, and I respect that Malick, instead, offers up a scenic-route meditation. I like the scenic route. I take it whenever possible.\n\nSeptember 5, 2009\n\nCaster Semenya\n\nMaybe you all have heard the story of Caster Semenya, the South African runner who won the 800m gold medal at the world championships recently; she is amazing, and fast, and muscular, and doesn't wear her hair down when she runs. Then, lo and behold, concerns were raised that she wasn't really a female. So the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF), put her through several tests- including hormonal, gynecological!, and psychological- to prove she was a female.\n\n#1 Testosterone levels vary from person to person, from male to male, and from female to female. They also vary at different times of the month, different times of your life (increasing during puberty), even at different times during any given day (highest in the morning), and over the course of any given activity (levels drop after ejaculation, for instance). They often increase under pressure or when risk or harm is posed to an individual. They also increase in winners of a competition and decrease in the losers of a competition!\n\nTo summarize, my first point is that TESTOSTERONE LEVELS ARE TOO COMPLICATED AND MYSTERIOUS TO PROVE SOMETHING AS BANAL AS WHETHER OR NOT AN INDIVIDUAL IS MALE OR FEMALE.\n\n#2 People who have been writing about this case, as well as the people who are conducting the testing of Semenya make no distinction between the terms 'SEX' and 'GENDER.' See ESPN. See The Guardian. See USA Today. What's the big difference, you ask? It is this: SEX refers to the type of reproductive organs you are born with. What's between your legs, to put is vulgarly. However, and this is a big however, more than two sexes exist in ALL animal species, especially the human species. When you are born with a mash-up, a variety, a rainbow of XX AND XY chromosomes, you are intersex. Sometimes, being intersex shows up at birth (which presents a real problem for these babies because they encounter all kinds of doctor and parental biases toward \"girls\" and \"boys\".) But sometimes nobody, not even you yourself will know that you are born with both kinds of chromosomes. Sometimes, men have a penis, produce offspring, feel and look like a regular dude, but upon autopsy after they die, they are found to also have a set of ovaries! This chart is very enlightening if you want to look into intersex diversity further.\n\nOkay, so what is 'GENDER'? Gender is how an individual identifies her or himself. Period. That's it, in my humble opinion. And, this is why, to me, the Caster Semenya story is such a tragedy. She says she's a girl. She was raised as a girl. She wore skirts to school for cryin' out loud! No matter what any doctor with ten degrees says, or what endocrinology tests show, there is only one expert on Caster Semenya's gender, and that is Caster Semenya!\n\nThe test results may show that she is intersex or whatever, but that doesn't prove she was cheating, nor do I think that means that she should be disqualified. It means that the categories that sports and the rest of our society have constructed are too plain to contain our complexities as human beings.\n\nI also think that she is being poked and prodded like a fuckin' animal, and I think it's because she is a woman and she is good and she is black and she is young. Which is fuckin' disgusting. So there.\n\nFebruary 22, 2009\n\nwhat do you think?\n\nshould folks who cannot carry and bear children be able to vote on the abortion issue? why or why not?\u2013or to resist binarism, just feel free to not pick a side and say something in general. (personal note: i like to say no, they shouldn't. not that it would ever happen, but to be essentialist for a tiny minute, i think that men are worried about women having the power to decide to have the baby or not. do people who are not able to grow embryos and feti in their bodies not trust those who are able to do so?)\n\nNOTE: ultimately, to me, this isn't a men/women issue; it's a who can bear and who can't issue. gender is socially defined, not biologically. sex is defined biologically. and sex is as fluid as gender (i love you, trannies!). some men can bear children, and some cannot\u2013same for women. some men would want to, and some wouldn't\u2013same for women. and yes, it does take an egg and a sperm to make an embryo. however, only one person's body actually carries the embryo and fetus and bears the infant.\n\ni'm not trying to rile y'all up. just wondering. secondary question: if only people who can carry children decided whether or not abortion was legal/illegal/etc., how would the issue and laws be affected? try not to be heteronormative and also try to re-think gender and sex. have fun!"}
{"text": "There was a Hushpuppy and she lived with her daddy in the Bathtub\u2026It begins almost like a \"Once upon a time\" fairytale. But children have a way of making the most complex stories sound so simple and \"Beasts of the Southern Wild\" is much more than a simple tale of a girl living with her dad.\n\n\"Beasts of the Southern Wild\" is the tale of Hushpuppy, a poor 6-year-old girl facing orphanhood. Economic struggles and the loss of loved ones can be difficult concepts for anyone to grasp and deal with, but for a small child, it's even harder. Despite the harshness of her reality, Hushpuppy's story is a magical one filled with imagination, bravery and hope. It's the type of heroic story that only a child could tell.\n\nAt the start of the film, Hushpuppy (Quvenzhane Wallis) introduces us to her isolated community, Bayou community known as The Bathtub. From her eyes, everything seems truly spectacular: you feel her sense of love for her father, delight in her pretend dinner parties and gasp with glee at her wonderful descriptions of the town's frequent holiday celebrations. For having no money and no mother, Hushpuppy makes it seem like she has a lot. But despite her optimistic narrative, it's impossible to ignore the tides of sadness ebbing in at the sides of her world. The reality is that Hushpuppy is malnourished, abandoned by her mother, and her beloved father (Dwight Henry) is an abusive, often absent drunk that's slowly dying. She's on the brink of orphanhood and the reality of her world is downright awful.\n\nRunning through Hushpuppy's narrative is the story of these mythical boar-like beasts, trampling straight for her and leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. These made up creatures are very real to Hushpuppy and are the embodiment of her fear. Their presentation is a lot like the beasts in \"Where the Wild Things Are.\" They're illogical and imaginary, but very matter of fact and tangible to the child, which makes them the realest thing in the world. Can Hushpuppy face the threat they pose to her carefully crafted world?\n\n\"Beasts of the Southern Wild\" is not an easy film to sum up in a few sentences, but I wouldn't have it any other way. It's a magical story with some very big and real issues that are presented spectacularly. It's not like poverty and death haven't been shown in film before, but Benh Zeitlin's \"Beasts of the Southern Wild\" is a unique, fantastic story with a perspective that's often overlooked in films. The young, new actors such as star Wallis are wonderful casting finds. Wallis brings a special authenticity to the story and has a bright future ahead.\n\nYes, there was a girl named Hushpuppy and she lived in The Bathtub with her father, but there was also so much more and it is worth going to theaters to see her story"}

{"text": "How does a moviemaker legitimately portray the life of a great artist? The question is in the air these days with the release of \"Anonymous,\" which posits Shakespeare as a nincompoop fraud, and now Philipp St\u00f6lzl's \"Young Goethe in Love,\" which turns one of the greatest geniuses of German literature into a love-struck rapscallion.\n\nIn Germany, the film's country of origin, it was simply titled \"Goethe!\" (I've always made it a point to be wary of movies with exclamation points in the title.) The title change in English is obviously meant to remind us of \"Shakespeare in Love,\" but the resemblance ends there. Despite its strenuous attempts at levity, not to mention high literacy, it's an earthbound and prosaic piece of filmmaking.\n\nYoung Goethe (Alexander Fehling, from \"Inglourious Basterds\") wants to be a famous playwright and poet, but his output is mediocre and his work habits are worse. Flunking his bar exams in 1772, he is sent by his autocratic father (Henry H\u00fcbchen) to the rural town of Wetzlar where he unhappily toils as a clerk at a county court under the Teutonic eye of ambitious prosecutor Albert Kestner (Moritz Bleibtreu). Goethe and Kestner end up pals, but that's before it's discovered that both are vying for the fetchingly giddy Lotte (Miriam Stein), whose widower father (Burghardt Klaussner) is angling to marry her off to the wealthy prosecutor.\n\nOut of all this hoo-ha comes \"The Sorrows of Young Werther,\" Goethe's novella about a suicidally love-stricken romantic that made his reputation just in the nick of time. It was a huge seller, although the movie neglects to mention that Goethe's name did not initially appear on it, and because of copyright laxities, he didn't earn a great deal from its success."}

{"text": "I've called Christian Carion's Farewell a \"spy thriller,\" and it is one. In fact, this is one of the most suspenseful films I've seen in some considerable time, but don't let this put you in mind of James Bond. And even though it's a Cold War tale, it has even less to do with Salt. This one is a serious fact-based tale about the Cold War and bringing an end to the Soviet Union. That's not what makes the film remarkable so much as the fact that it's a film about the people the spies are. That's the detail that makes Farewell unusual and unusually satisfying. That it's also very stylish and crafted with an eye toward suspense, on the other hand, shouldn't be sold short.\n\nThe story concerns a man, Pierre Froment (Guillaume Canet, Tell No One), who is not a spy in any sense of the word, but whose boss taps him to ferry information from the Russians to the French secret service. It isn't a task Froment likes, nor is it one he's really equipped for on any level. Moreover, the Soviet contact, Sergei Gregoriev (Emir Kusturica, The Good Thief), a man supposedly above suspicion, isn't exactly delighted to find himself working with an amateur\u2014at least at first. Partly what changes lies in the fact that Gregoriev is a patriot, who believes that Russia has to change in order to survive. He isn't after money for his services\u2014though he accepts some decadent Western goodies like champagne and a Walkman and some Queen albums for his son. Gregoriev truly wants to help his country. As things progress, he and Froment become friends of a sort\u2014tied together, in part, because they are the only ones who can even discuss what they're doing.\n\nThe characters are at the center of Farewell, but the film's players\u2014like the story it tells\u2014are drawn from a pretty broad spectrum, including Ronald Reagan (Fred Ward), who is presented as both a fairly formidable adversary, a bit of a paranoid and a man who can only understand the world by reducing it to the level of movies he's either seen or been in. It's an odd portrayal, but it does tend to match up with the facts as we know them, even while obviously being an interpretation. This isn't to say that the film is a leftist screed that paints the Soviets in glowing colors. Far from it, since nothing about Farewell suggests that the regime Gregoriev is helping to destroy is in any way admirable.\n\nIt would be a mistake to give away too much about the actual breakdown of events here. This is the kind of film that works better if seen cold. The more you let the film lead you in without much knowledge of anything beyond the basic premise, the more profoundly I think it will affect you. Knowing that this is a movie that puts a truly human face on espionage is enough. I suspect the film's subtleties, in terms of character development over the course of the story, would only improve on a second viewing. Still, it would be a grave disservice to give away the progression of the plot, which you need to see for yourself\u2014and I hope you take the time to do so. For me, this is the film everyone told me The Lives of Others (2006) was\u2014except this time I actually found it to be so. Not rated sounds like a very interesting movie and I definitely plan to watch it but I'm not finding much about it on the Internet - IMDb just says it has a September 2009 release in Belgium! Has it arrived in Asheville earlier than the rest of the US"}

What are they asking us to consider? The means that one should follow to track down one man? The amount we'll alter our own ideals to get a job done?\n\nOne of my favorite scenes in the film is when Maya and her fellow officer Jessica talk about what motivates operatives to resort to the measures that they eventually have to. Money? They dismiss that immediately. Ideology? The same basic concept of money. This movie isn't about politics. It's about a group of people in a room realizing that there the only ones left who are responsible for solving the situation. There's no on another floor, just them. Boal brilliantly and subtly captures anxiety, fear and humanism without ever compromising fact.\n\nAlthough it occasionally feels more like a work of journalism than a movie, Zero Dark Thirty is a searing, intelligent depiction that provokes more thought than any other film this year.\n\nThis article was written by a Hypable user! Learn more and write your own right here.\n\nThanks for the review! I'm going to see Zero Dark Thirty soon, and I'm looking forward to it even more now. I also just watched Argo today and it's fresh in my mind, so I appreciate the comparisons.\n\nhpatdh33\n\nIt reminded me a lot of Argo, but I think it made Argo look like crap. Zero Dark Thirty was my favorite film of 2012. The best scene was when the Helicopters were on their way to the compound. The anticipation was so intense and Alexandre Desplat's score for that scene was absolute perfection.\n\n Russell Turner\n\nI might go see it.. I hated The Hurt Locker.. so we'll see.\n\nGeorgia\n\nPretty sure you're watching an illegally released version of the film you probably pirated online and that's why it says \"For your consideration\" because filmmakers send out copies of movies early to people who give out awards (like the Oscars)..\n\njkredwine\n\nReally though, all legitimacy lost when I read that. Lets not get into the Oscar-fodder fray if we don't recognize phrases like \"for your consideration.\"\n\njkredwine\n\nI thought The Hurt Locker was absolutely terrible, almost exclusively because of Mark Boal's absurd and over-the-top screenplay full of cliche.\n\nThe writing for Zero Dark Thirty isn't much better, but the acting is certainly superior. Jessica Chastain is fantastic. For the record, though, you said another filmmaker might add \"the cushion of a human story amidst the strenuous ten-year project to hunt down the infamous al-Qaeda leader\" to make the story more palatable\u2013 Jessica Chastain's characters is exactly that. She allows the film to emotionally center around a precisely (and fictionally) crafted lead rather than struggle to maintain a narrative around the broad ensemble of actors who worked to bring Bin Laden down. It works, but it's certainly the easier route.\n\nIf Bigelow wins ANOTHER Oscar for this film I'm going to have to finally live up to my threats to stop watching the Academy Awards altogether. These films carry a grandiose self-importance that she just can't seem to back up with depth. Technique and a popular anti-war message aren't everything, Ms. Bigelow"}
{"text": "call \"Enemy at the Gates\" a German movie, but it\ncould easily be an American or British film. The movie stars English speakers\nin Russian roles, and Ed Harris, a distinctively American actor, as a German\nMajor. In\nan aesthetic choice, the actors all speak English regardless of their\ncharacter's nationality. Because this seems to be the case throughout the movie,\nthe effect is not as jarring, and easily accepted and soon becomes a nonentity.\n(After all, if I have to listen to yet another foreign actor faking a\n\"Russian\" accent while speaking English... I will never understand why\npeople choose to do this, because the whole thing is absurd.)\n\n\"Enemy at the Gates\" is the second Trivial Love\nTriangle During a Major Historical Event movie that came out in 2001, the same year that saw the release of\n\"Pearl\nHarbor,\" the other Trivial Love Triangle During a Major Historical Event\nmovie. Both films, in fact, are so similar that it's\nimpossible not to lump them together, even if one were to forget that both are\nTrivial Love Triangle During a Major Historical Event movies. Both films involve a love triangle consisting of 2 men and one woman;\nboth are set during World War II; both ends with 1/3rd of the love\ntriangle conveniently killed off so the other 2/3rd of the triangle\ncan live happily ever after. And, besides all that, both have love triangles that brings nothing to\nthe movie except to pad the running time and in an effort to draw the hopeless\nromantics sector of the moviegoing public. Or perhaps I'm just being too cynical\nand the film really did have a reason to include a futile love triangle...?\n\n\"Enemy at the Gates\" stars Jude Law as a Russian farm boy who joins\nthe army at a time when the Germans are about to break through the city of\nStalingrad, Russia's greatest city. The fall of Stalingrad would mark the\ndestruction of Russia, literally and figuratively, and the Russian brass,\ncontrolled by Nikita Khrushchev (he of \"We will bury you!\" fame), is\ndetermined to not let that happen.\n\nIn an effort to stop the German juggernaut,\nthe Russian brass is sending wave after wave of weaponless farm boys to die at\nthe front lines. If the Russian soldiers, half of whom have no weapons with\nwhich to fight, flee the battlefield, they are shot down by their own people. So\neither way, they are lamb to the slaughter, and their slaughter is shown in\nhorrific detail by Annaud. It's a terrible fight, a losing fight, and everyone\nknows it, but no one is willing to accept it, most of all Khrushchev and his\npeople.\n\nThen one day, during another hopeless battle, Jude Law\n(\"Road to\nPerdition\") distinguishes\nhimself as a marksman by (finally) getting his hands on a rifle and\nsingle-handedly killing 5 German officers. Luckily for Jude, a Russian public\nrelations officer played by Joseph Fiennes (\"Killing\nMe Softly\") is there to record it. By the time\nJude, as Vassili, returns to the barracks, he's become a legend. Vassili's\nlegend grows with each sniping run into German lines, and soon the Russian army\nis hailing him as a hero, and stories about his killings are giving the Russian\nsoldiers renewed spirits, while at the same time scaring the Germans.\n\nIn an effort to stop the dangerous Vassili, the Germans send for their\nown master sniper, Major Koenig (Ed Harris). Koenig has a back story of\nhis own, and has come to fight with Vassili seemingly not for his country, but\non a personal death wish brought on by the death of his own son, lost elsewhere\nin the war. Koenig is a\nstoic, brooding figure, and is the crafty veteran to Jude Law's brash Vassili.\n\nNow, if co-writer/director Annaud (\"The\nLover\") had stuck to the above\ndescription as the whole movie, \"Enemy at the Gates\" would be a stellar\nfilm. Instead, Annaud, falling into the same pit of misery that\nbefell \"Pearl Harbor,\"\nunnecessarily burdens us with an uninspired (and dare I say it, unconvincing) love triangle between Rachel Weisz as a\nRussian Jew, Vassili, and Fiennes' Danilov.\n\nThe movie is most effective when it concentrates on Vassili\nand his hunts through the bombed-out city of Stalingrad. Annaud frames the city\nin stark colors, giving us an effective view of Stalingrad as a city\nunder siege. As Vassili and his team of snipers burrow and crawl and climb their\nway across the city's bomb-marked landscape, the movie is at its most intense. It's only when Fiennes and the silly love triangle enter the\npicture that the movie bogs down into standard, recognizable mush.\n\nThere is a plot point near the end when Danilov realizes that Weisz has given her\nheart and body to Law's character, and feeling betrayed, decides to fight back by spreading\nuntrue propaganda about Vassili to the Russian brass. This is shown, but\nthere is no resolution to it. Did the brass receive Danilov's propaganda? Did\nthey buy it? Were there any repercussions against Vassili? Nothing is ever\nmentioned about this betrayal again. Why bring it up in the first place? As a\nmatter of fact, why introduce a love triangle in the first place?"}
{"text": "109 minute feature film DVD starring Ian Hart, James Bolam and Julianne Moore. \"This is a diary of hate,\" pounds out novelist Maurice Bendrix (Ralph Fiennes) on his typewriter as he recounts the lost love of his life in this spiritual memoir (based on Graham Greene's novel) with a startling twist. It's London 1946, and Maurice runs into his achingly dull school friend Henry (Stephen Rea with a perpetually gloomy hangdog expression). Their meeting is brittle, all small talk and chilly, mannered civility beautifully captured by director-screenwriter Neil Jordan (The Crying Game), and it only barely thaws when Henry suggests that his wife, Sarah (the luminous Julianne Moore), may be having an affair. Maurice's mind reels back to his passionate affair with Sarah during the war years, which she abruptly broke off two years ago. Gripped with a jealousy that hasn't abated, he hires a private detective (a mousy, marvelous Ian Hart) to shadow her movements. He prepares himself for the revelation of a rival but instead finds a deeper, more profound secret: \"I tempted fate,\" she writes in her diary, \"and fate accepted.\"\n\nJordan's cool remove captures the unease beneath formal manners but never warms into intimacy during the scenes between the lovers, even while Fiennes and Moore almost explode in repressed emotions, their faces cracking under their masks of civility and their resolve shaking through jittery body language. There's more thought than feeling behind this collision of passion and spirituality, but it's a sincere, richly realized portrait of ennui and rage against God energized by brief moments of shattering drama. --Sean Axmaker"}

{"text": "The 20-year-old Hubble Space Telescope--whose repair mission is the subject of this chronicle--turns out to be a bit of a stage hog, and audiences expecting a blissout of swirling galaxies will wonder why so much time is spent on astronauts sweating over screws and boltsSo why is this songwriter, so articulate on vinyl, so vague and spacey in current-day interviews? Something happened here, deeper than an aborted quest for fame, and the documentary hasn't gotten to it.\n\nJustice is blind - but there are cases where fingers start weighing down the scales. That's the j'accuse that Ra'anan Alexandrowicz's documentary puts forth regarding Israel's rule of law in its post-'67 occupied territories\n\nRedemptively, the cast goes a long way: Jean Desailly is perfect as a jowly literary celeb deep in midlife crisis, while the aloof Fran\u00e7oise Dorl\u00e9ac is magnetic as his airline stewardess and all-too-scrutable love object.\n\nShe has real sympathy--characters that might have been brittle, mockable creations in another writer-director's hands gain resonance here. But the filmmaker also might have very little to say apart from the way guilt enters into life, and then suddenly recedesNew Yorkers and those who've been following the neighborhood's plight know exactly how this ends; at the very least, Paravel and Sniadecki have preserved the memory of what was. Sometimes, that's the most you can do.\n\nThere has to be room for this kind of plea, especially a work that, obliquely, captures so many largely unreported details: the night raids rounding up children, the torn-up olive trees and kids' soccer games in the battle zone.\n\nGrand scale or no, this feels like a blockbuster on autopilot more often than not, curiously detached and self-importantly somber even by the director's standards - and without the cerebral heft of his best work.\n\nIn narrative terms, it's mostly an excuse to work in a trio of crooks whose banter may be even better than that of our hero; Mark Strong's disgusted rant about paying off policemen and Liam Cunningham \u2013 led musings on Bobbie Gentry's \"Ode to Billie Joe\" are enough to justify the entire movie on their own.\n\nThe director illuminates how the town's racial and economic dynamics have changed, while simultaneously reflecting on the ethics of nonfiction filmmaking. It's a powerful testament to how far we both have and haven't come.\n\nIt probably would have helped if Walker (who credits two other codirectors) had chosen just one of those avenues for deeper study; her doc has a vertiginous way of feeling arty and ephemeral at one moment, humane and maybe too earthbound the next."}

After aggressive police action, Empain was released without any ransom being paid\u2014but minus a finger. Belvaux takes the real-life scenario, including details such as the sliced-off digit and Empain's confinement in a tent put up inside a tunnel hideaway, and crafts an evenhanded procedural that becomes a not entirely persuasive parable of power and emasculation.\n\nFellow actor-director Yvan Attal plays Stanislas Graff, second-generation manager of an old-school investment firm, who is introduced breezing into a meeting with the French president and then a rendezvous with an appreciative mistress. His wife is the eminently respectable Anne Consigny, mother of two daughters; life is so haute bourgeois it hurts. Stanislas learns just how much it can hurt one day when masked men whisk him away to a secret location, and the police, the press (revealing his gambling and adultery), and possibly his own colleagues and lawyer each pose different threats to his freshly conditional existence.\n\nStill best known here for his 2002 trilogy of genre-refracted tales, Belvaux establishes the professionalism of the kidnappers and observes the poker-faced boardroom violence of Stanislas's firm.
