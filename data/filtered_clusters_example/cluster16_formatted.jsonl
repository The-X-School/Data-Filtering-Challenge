{"text": "Swiss Ball Workouts\n\nHere's a quick and easy way to fire up your golf muscles, and improve your strength and flexibility.\n\nMost golf professionals realise the importance of having a flexibility, strengthening and conditioning program. These days, a lot of tour pros use a Swiss ball as part of their daily workout. I suspect that nearly every tour player has a Swiss ball in his home. And, you'll see them in all of the medical facilities on tour. If top players are using Swiss balls to work out, then there's every reason that you could benefit, too.\n\nIf used correctly, a Swiss ball will allow you to build up your postural control. It can also be used to get extra flexibility and core stability. It's a moving sphere, so it requires you to do 'balance re-education'. From a practical point of view, it's light so it can be carried around and used anytime, anywhere, like in a locker room or office.\n\nHowever, there are certain requirements with Swiss balls that many people don't realise. First, you've got to use the ball dynamically to improve your posture. Just because you sit on a Swiss ball doesn't mean it's going to help \u2013 many people actually slump into bad postures. The other big mistake is to buy the wrong sized Swiss ball. If it's too small or big, you're likely to slump or compensate. It's important to be measured so that your legs aren't hanging off the ball and to prevent you from leaning too far forward. Also ensure the ball retains its pressure because a deflated ball can lead to soft posture as well.\n\nI like to think of a Swiss ball workout as an intrinsic challenge that you give yourself every day, rather than just rolling around on it with no purpose. My drills are a little different from generic Swiss ball workouts because I arrange them in a golf-specific sequence. It's a bit like the gears on your car. I want to make sure that you're 'layering up' your skill and motor control as you do these 'tasks', especially before a round of golf. If you use the last exercise first, then you won't get as much control as if you do them in the correct sequence.\n\nThis program takes some time to build up from level 1 to level 7. So contact your local physiotherapist if you experience sharp pain or difficulty with any of the exercises. But I guarantee your golf will benefit from the workout. You'll see the relevance in the golf swing and it will allow your golf muscles to 'fire'.\n\nI firmly believe the Swiss ball can revolutionise the way we prepare specifically for golf. If used correctly, it allows you to build postural control and gain extra flexibility and core stability.\n\nMy skill-graduated exercises are what I call 'primal' challenges. Your muscle groups perform different functions in a sequence rather than just a solitary action. You really have to concentrate throughout your body to keep good form through the chain. I guarantee the workout will talk to you. In other words, you'll see relevance to the golf swing with regard to your set-up and lower-body support. You'll feel the correct muscles 'fire' through the chain if you're doing them correctly. Your posture should improve, your lower base should stay stronger and you'll be able to sequence the right muscles at the right time.\n\nThe beauty of this sequential warm-up routine is that it allows you to measure your feels and tolerances every day. You can gauge your quality of movement for every exercise (say, with a mark out of 10). You can measure how quickly you fatigued on each exercise. And, finally, you can understand how each exercise relates to the golf swing. Since your energy levels vary, they're unique exercises that you can use to monitor your body from day to day.\n\nThe players I've trained see immediate relevance. The secret is not to overdo it. You've got to learn how much you can handle on a particular day. Some days will be better than others. So it's not about doing hundreds of repetitions or 10 times 10. It's about doing what you can handle and understanding your body from inside out"}

{"text": "Poor distance problems\n\nThe more distance you can get from your initial drive, the shorter you have to go with your subsequent shots. How far the ball goes is the direct result of one thing: how hard the club head hits the ball. That doesn't necessarily mean swinging harder, though. Your club is, essentially, a large pendulum. If you have a smooth, steady swing and make solid contact, the force generated by the club will have far more to do with distance than the muscle you put into it. That's not to say that strength doesn't figure in, of course. Male golfers average 20 to 30 yards more than women with a given club. Still, a female pro will consistently outdrive a stocky male amateur. A few lessons to straighten out your swing should be the first thing you try in order to achieve extra yardage. Beyond that, new, improved clubs are constantly being introduced that promise better distance. If you've mastered the basics of your swing, you might give them a try"}

In my experience, the most costly error is thinking that the golf club is swung by the arms and hands. It certainly looks that way.\n\nBut, to the untrained eye, there's a lot more going on. The golfer's trunk (these days known as the Core) is providing the most thrust that causes the most FORCE!\n\nTherefore, let's focus on the FOUR FORCES that produce the most force that produces the most distance with your driver! First, let's assume the back part of the golf swing is primarily an upper body event. The forward swing begins from the lower body or from the ground-up, utilizing:\n\nFORCE # 1 LEGS - Your legs are the major booster rockets in maximizing distance. Your arms are fast, but not as strong as your legs. Just like the booster rockets on the space shuttle lift the shuttle out of Earth's atmosphere, the legs boost the ball maximally.\n\nFORCE # 2 LEVERAGE - When the player hinges their wrists to create a 90 degree angle of the shaft and their lead arm, leverage is created. The longer that angle is retained as the player swings towards the ball, the farther the ball goes. As we learned in school, we get a lot more accomplished with little work when leverage is utilized.\n\nFORCE # 3 LAG - When the player ends the backswing and begins the forward swing properly from the ground-up, their arms lag behind creating a whipping motion which in turn multiplies the amount of velocity of the forward swing. This also increases velocity, club head speed, and distance.\n\nFORCE #4 LAUNCH ANGLE - We've learned that Tiger Woods has gone to using a 10.5 degree lofted Driver. With his swing speed, he is maximizing his distance and driving ability by adding loft and creating maximum launch angle. Most amateurs lose distance by using too little loft with their drivers. This makes the golf ball return to earth too-o soon! If you really want to hit the ball farther, add more loft.\n\nKaryn Dunphy lives and teaches golf in Studio City, CA.

{"text": "The Power of the Mind/Body\n\nWe know the average person thinks some 60,000 thoughts every day (there are only 86,400 seconds). The mind cycles almost endlessly with an incessant chatter, most of it of which we are totally unaware. Thoughts fuel emotions, emotions fuel more thoughts, and before we are aware of it, we have spent years and decades of our lives in a constant looping of unconscious mind repetition.\n\nOur brains, meanwhile, are more complicated and sophisticated than the greatest super-computer in the world, processing more than 30 billion bits of information each second. There are more than a trillion chemical reactions going on in our bodies each and every moment \u2013 each of them in direct response to the thoughts and emotions being communicated throughout the cells continually on a mostly subconscious level.\n\nAs far as golf is concerned, each shot is a reflection of what we are experiencing internally before we ever hit the ball. Say, for example, the mind is organized before a particular golf shot with a sort of kitchen-pantry formula \u2013 three parts visualization, one part tension, two parts anxiety, zero parts self-critical and four parts humor. This \"recipe\" will fire up in the cells and direct in the body a consistent and predictable type of movement.\n\nNow change the mental/emotional formula to something quite different \u2013 one part visualization, three parts tension, four parts self-critical, five parts anxiety and zero parts humor. Again, this recipe will produce a very different swing, and a very different result.\n\nThe bottom line is that a quiet, peaceful, focused mind will allow our bodies and our golf swings to be in \"flow.\" Tense and anxious thoughts and emotions cause our bodies to become locked in fear. The cells and muscles chemically respond to the signals sent to them by the brain because of our thoughts, emotions and beliefs."}

{"text": "In last month's issue we explained muscular loading. This month we are going to explain the most important foundation of the kinetic link which initiates muscular loading: Ground Forces.\n\nNo single link in the process of creating clubhead speed is considered more important than any other; however, your swing is only as strong as your \"weakest link\". During the golf swing, the transfer of energy and power from the lower body to the upper body is certainly the most pivotal, and thus the most common \"weakest link\".\n\nThe role of the trunk musculature in the golf swing is the same as the role of a crank shaft in an automobile. Just like the crankshaft turns horsepower created at the drive wheels, the trunk musculature turns energy created by the lower body into power at the upper body. This in turn creates clubhead speed. With maximum energy transfer comes maximum power.\n\nJust like a house, a solid golf swing must be built on a solid foundation. That foundation is lower body mechanics or ground forces. The movement of the lower body is composed of both Linear components and rotational components. It is this proper interaction between the two that creates a stable basis for the rest of the swing.\n\nYour feet generate forces when they push against the ground. These forces act to propel your body and create motion. There are two kinds of forces that are important to the golf swing: Normal and Shear forces. Normal forces are used to define the linear component of the swing. Shear forces are used to define rotational forces of the swing.\n\nThe Linear Component\n\nNormal force is applied by the feet downward or perpendicular to the ground (see Figure A). Weight is transferred to the back foot during the backswing and to the front foot during the downswing. When weight is shifted to one foot, the amount of normal force applied by that foot increases, while the normal force applied by the other foot decreases. This action defines the linear component of movement. The linear component of the lower body during the swing is very important, because from this movement that the body develops momentum and enhances the rotational speed and power the hips.\n\nShearing Forces\n\nRotational Forces\n\nShear force is applied by the feet along the surface or parallel to the ground (See Figure B). Throughout the swing, shear forces are being applied by both feet. These shear forces create torque that turn the hips around the axis of the trunk. This defines the rotational component of the lower body movement. The rotational component provides the basis for power during the golf swing and can be the most directly related to ultimate clubhead speed.\n\nFaults in Energy Transfer\n\nThe most two common breakdowns in transferring energy from the lower body to the upper body originate with the hip segment.\n\nThe first of these is called sliding hips, which occurs when the hips move laterally to the left without rotating. No rotational speed is created. Muscles aren't properly loaded and there is diminished energy created to be passed to the upper body. In many cases, sliding hips also indicates an excessive spine tilt. When the spine tilts, muscles that work to rotate segments around the axis of the spine become asymmetrical in that one shortens and the other side lengthens. This asymmetry cause inefficient generation of power or speed and can cause increased stress on the back and joints, resulting in back injuries.\n\nThe second is called \"spinning hips\" which occurs when the golfer forces the hip segment through the swing too quickly. This creates excusive lag between the lower body and the upper body. The upper body typically never catches up. The trunk musculature is never used to pass energy created by the hip segment rotation to the shoulder segment which means lost power and lower club head speed.\n\nBy building a solid foundation from the ground up, and then working on the efficient transfer of energy from the lower body towards the upper body, you can effectively increase power, distance and accuracy throughout your game.\n\nScott Beaumont is from ZenoLink. ZenoLink is a diagnostic tool that used 3D motion analysis for coaches to be able to measure their athlete's biomechanical breakdowns in their golf swing. By measuring hip speed, arm speed, shoulder speed, club release speed and club linear speed, ZenoLink creates separate analyses of kinetic linking, stability, muscular loading and club dynamics; helping a coach or instructor identify functional movement discrepancies that rob the player of power, and to design a personalized Progressive Skills Training program that addresses problem areas"}
{"text": "Learn how to increase your clubhead speed from one of the game's longest drivers\n\n4) WRIST HINGE: Hinging your wrists during the backswing has the same effect as turning your hips: It increases the length of your backswing, which, in turn, increases your opportunity to create speed (potential energy). It's no accident that most long hitters have long backswings, achieved in part by ample wrist hinge (note Quiros' full shoulder turn and parallel shaft). And it's rare to see a short hitter with a long backswing. So, to increase your clubhead speed, go ahead and hinge your wrists. And don't worry about hinging your wrists at a specific point in your backswing; try to hinge them gradually and in synchronization with the rotation of your shoulders and hips.\n\n5) BEGINNING DOWNSWING: You've set yourself up on the backswing to maximize your clubhead speed. Now your downswing will determine whether that speed is realized or not. There's a real and definable sequence to the downswing that's best for all golfers, and that sequence is: hips, shoulders, arms and clubhead. In starting the downswing, the hips should move laterally toward the target and begin to turn while the knees remain flexed. When the hips get slightly past their original position at address, they stop moving laterally, but continue to rotate. At this point, the front leg also begins to straighten. It's this action that allows you to maintain your wrist hinge long into your downswing and release the club with maximum force at impact, resulting in greater driver distance.\n\n6) IMPACT: Impact is the moment of truth, the culmination of events that occurred up to that point. Arriving at a powerful impact means that you've shifted your weight onto your front foot while unwinding your hips. Notice how Quiros' weight is toward the front of his left foot, and his belt buckle is pointing in front of the ball\u2014a clear sign he has combined his weight shift and hip rotation. There's no spinning off the back foot as is common with slicers and shorter hitters. Another thing to notice in Quiros' incredibly powerful impact position is how his hands are slightly ahead of the ball and both arms are fully extended\u2014you can't release the stored-up energy any better than that!\n\nRandy Peterson, PGA, is the director of fitting and instruction at the Ely Callaway Performance Center, where he oversees all Tour professionals' club fittings and development of club-fitting protocols."}

{"text": "How to read a green\n\nOne of the things that makes golf so challenging, and often frustrating, is that greens aren't flat. Every one has some sort of tilt to it so it can drain after rainstorms. Beyond that, there are various bumps, knobs, and valleys that invariably find their way between your ball and the hole. If you've been good enough or lucky enough to be closest to the pin when your group hits the green, you'll have the advantage of being able to see how the other golfers' shots react to the green. There are a few other things you can do to prepare for a course. Before the round, try asking a grounds attendant about the general area. Greens usually follow the slope of the land as a whole. If there are mountains to the west, chances are most greens will slope away from them. If there are bunkers nearby, the architects will have designed the couse so that water will drain around them. When figuring speed, consider the grass itself. The broader the leaves, the slower the green. Bermuda is slower than bent grass. Damp grass is slower than dry. Like many plants, grass leaves will point toward the sun, moving from east to west as the day passes. Putting (PUTT-ing) with the grain is faster than putting against it. Reading a green is never an exact science. The best plan is to play the same course several times until you get the feel of each green"}

{"text": "A DISCUSSION ON BETTER UNDERSTANDING C.O.R.\n\nC.O.R. is easier to understand with a few additional examples and a little deeper explanation. First, recognize that when two objects collide there are 3 basic conditions of impact that exist. There are perfectly elastic collisions, perfectly inelastic collisions and everything else in-between.\n\nAn almost perfectly elastic collision is best demonstrated by two ivory que balls. When they collide, no or very little mechanical energy is dissipated so the speed-in of one ball is equal to the speed-out of the other ball after the collision.\nSo, the C.O.R. is 1.00 or 100%.\n\nA perfectly inelastic collision is best demonstrated by using two balls of putty, let's say the size of golf balls. When one ball of putty impacts the other ball of putty, they both stick together, so the speed-out of the second ball of putty is 0. So, the C.O.R. is 0 or 0%.\n\nYou will rarely know the real loft of your driver even if you are reading the loft engraved on the driver head or if you are reading the loft and face angle specifications on a company's internet site.

Below is a common problem called the chicken wing, where your lead elbow juts out in an attempt to prevent the club from flipping over through impact (see bottom photo).\n\nIn this case, since I know the player's swing, I can tell you that at address, his grip is too strong. And when the club slows down at the top, you can see the result \u2014 the clubface is shut in the hook position (see the top photo). There are good players such as Dustin Johnson and Graeme McDowell who play with a shut face, but most golfers don't do well. And it doesn't take but a few snap hooks before anyone with an ounce of talent chicken-wings to keep the face open.\n\nBeing able to identify and then fix the cause of a problem is why a good teacher gets the big bucks.\n\nThe takeaway: the chicken-wing error occurs through impact, yet the cause is far away at address. If you can't fix your problem, maybe you're looking in the wrong place.\n\nTomasi writes for universal UClick.\n\nAt the top of the backswing, the clubface points at the sky in a shut position, a harbinger of the pulls and pull hooks.\nYou fix the fault by tracing the chain of error back to the root of the problem \u2014 otherwise, it will never go away."}

{"text": "The big deal is we'd rather not be playing a ball that has rolled through your disgusting chaw.\n\nYes, there's bird crap and lots of other things of that nature on the course anyway, but we can't do much about that, whereas you have 100% control over whether you spit into a cup or not.\n\nI wouldn't have thought so many people were so worked up about spitting. When you golf you're outdoors, who cares?! I agree that it's lame to spit on the green or on the tee box near where the marker line is that day, but only because people are touching the ground there, or rolling the ball through that area. People don't get worked up about spitting on or near other sports fields, and you're a heck of a lot more likely to roll around in someone's spit if they do it on a football or baseball field.\n\nSpit wherever you want so long as it's not on me, the greens, or the tees.\n\nWhen I lived in New Mexico we'd spit on our golf balls to clean 'em. Towels would dry out so fast in the heat that you couldn't keep a towel wet for more than a hole or so. A little spit, a little rub... clean golf ball.\n\nWhat are you people, pansies? Afraid of spit? Spit is \"disgusting\"? I can think of a whole lot more disgusting stuff - like people who smoke, or people who drive carts to the edges of greens and tees - than a little spit.\n\nHere in around Tokyo (haven't played outside a 200km radius of Tokyo so I can't speak for the rest of Japan), I think it comes down to price of the green fees. Let me explain.\n\nI don't know about the average fees you guys in the US pay for 18 holes, but here, it costs about 150 bucks minimum, added to the fact you have to drive usually 2 hours to get there from central Tokyo. Most clubs force you to play with a caddie (1 per foursome), have a strictly enforced dress code, etc., so people who play golf here have \"expectations\" and preconceived ideas about style of play (in all senses of the term). So they don't spit because:\n\nthe price of play still gives a slight prestige to the game, so \"golfers don't spit\".\n\nif the caddie sees you, well, she (\"she\", because it is usually an old lady) might raise a stink about it.\n\nif you're taking out a big client on the course, this might not give the best impression.\n\nAs for my point of view, well, on the fairway or in the rough, if no one sees you, who cares? You can't touch the ball while it's on the fairway anyway, the spit will be evaporated quickly (and if it rains, what's one more drop of fluid, right?), so it's not like it's gross or anything. Just like anything else, do it discretely, it's a natural thing.\n\nOn the other hand, spitting on the tee box, on the green, while people are taking their stance, etc. yeah, that's a no-no in my book.\n\nVoted the second option. I spit rather rarely, but I do spit. A couple times in my life someone has looked askance at me for spitting and then I feel guilty - don't ever do it close enough to someone that they might be offended. Easy to do if you aren't careful.\n\nI do something else on the course, more frequently than spitting. It would be much more obnoxious/disgusting if I ever did it on the green. This biological activity requires disappearing behind thick bushes, trees or rocks. Completely out of sight of other humans.\n\nThere's a time and a place for everything, including on the golf course.\n\nLong as your keeping it off the green, I could care less. Me and a couple of my friends chew smokeless tobacco and have never considered spitting in a cup though..? I'm outside so I've never seen the point of going out of my way to spit in a cup, but I've always made a point to not spit on the green and to throw my dip out somewhere in the rough, water, or wooded area.\n\nSome of the more ridiculous posts I have ever seen here... Get over yourselves.\n\nI spit on the course, however infrequent, but not on the green/fringe/teebox/anywhere playing partners might walk.\n\nThank you! Is this seriously an issue for anybody? I mean, we're not talking about wads of half chewed tobbaco laying in a big clump in front of the hole. When was the last time anybody had a shot or putt altered because someone spit in the grass?\n\nI spit on the course all the time...I smoke cigars and spitting is kind of just a part of that...it soaks in, dries up, whatever...I mean, you don't spit in a guy's line before he putts or any other insulting type of action..and no, you don't spit out a big chaw on the green or manicured grass area or whatever, but come on - people don't do that (at least civilized people)...but just spitting on the green or wherever on the course is reason for scorn and a fine?....I don't think so"}

Well... sort of. The objective, just like the other MMORPG's, is raising your levels. And instead of slaughtering monsters over and over and over, Shot-Online gives you a different kind of grind: putting. That's right, swinging the club and having the ball land neatly in the sand might boost up your statistics. OK, so the concept is a little silly, but this strangely works out a little - just enough for golf fans. Let me repeat: golf fans; everyone else, there are better ways to spend fifty dollars on golf.\n\nThe best thing going for this golf game is, actually, not the golf. The stuff beyond, such as creating your own team and communicating with others on tour, is where you'll dig it. The leveling-up system is, as expected, not as grand and complex as World of Warcraft or many others, but it's deep enough to spur that sense of competition and addiction. As you become someone for newcomers to freak out over, you'll be able to have more fun. The game's tutorial is also a warm welcome for people a bit confused by how the world is set up.\n\nOnce you actually play golf in this game, however, you'll find that this is merely an OK alternative for when bad weather hits, and nothing more. Playing through tours takes the dedication to sit on your butt at the computer for an ass-long time. Assuming your schedule has nothing on it and you can dedicate a full day to Shot, it's still not very competitive. Winning involves a lot of luck and, simply, higher levels; plowing through the field's handicap is often embarrassing, and probably irritating to others. The whole process of swinging and selecting your clubs is basic and becomes boring very quickly. To mix things up, there are weather effects and a few other little factors that come in to change the likelihood of who will win in the end... but it's not fun; actually, even for the most skilled golfers, it downright obnoxious"}
{"text": "Why do golf balls have dimples?\n\nQuestion\n#42963. Asked by Hamlet.. (Jan 02 04 10:00 PM)\n\nrobboy\n\nTo make the ball rise, if properly struck. This area of science isn't my forte, and neither is golf if you've ever watched me, but when the club strikes the ball on a downward swing, producing backward spin and acceleration, the dimples, being cavities, produce lift to the ball.\n\nJan 02 04, 11:28 PM\n\nsequoianoir\n\nThe simple answer is to change the manner in which air flows around it and how it \"sticks\" to it.\nA spinning ball (of any sort including a very smooth one like a table tennis \"ping-pong\" ball) will change its flight though the air, generating \"lift\" with \"backspin\" or causing it to \"dip\" with \"topspin\".\nThe dimples specifically enhance and increase this effect. Additionally they lower the effect of drag and allow it to be hit further.\n\nThe dimples in golf balls, first introduced by the Spalding Company in 1908, can double the distance a golf ball can fly.\n\nJan 03 04, 8:40 AM\n\nsequoianoir\n\nThe reason why golf balls have dimples is a story of natural selection. Originally, golf balls were smooth; but golfers noticed that older balls that were beat up with nicks, bumps and slices in the cover seemed to fly farther. Golfers, being golfers, naturally gravitate toward anything that gives them an advantage on the golf course, so old, beat-up balls became standard issue.\n\nAt some point, an aerodynamicist must have looked at this problem and realized that the nicks and cuts were acting as \"turbulators\" -- they induce turbulence in the layer of air next to the ball (the \"boundary layer\"). In some situations, a turbulent boundary layer reduces drag"}

{"text": "How To Time The Release In A Golf Swing\n\nBy: Michael Bell\n\nBreak Studios Contributing Writer\n\nNeed to know how to time the release in a golf swing? Sometimes it can be a little tricky to time the release in a golf swing. Golfers might swing hard yet achieve minimal distance. When this is the case, it's may be because the timing of the release in a golf swing is off. But a simple drill can help golfers time the release in their swing, which can mean maximum distance when it counts most on the golf course. Here's how to time the release in a golf swing.\n\nPlace six to eight golf balls in the bottom of a headcover. This will add weight to the headcover.\n\nGrip the headcover. Take a normal grip at the neck of the headcover, just as you would when you address a golf ball. It could be any grip, overlap or interlock, among others. The important thing is not the grip, but what you are doing to help time the release in a golf swing.\n\nSwing. Take it back slow and swing smoothly down the ball line and through the hitting area. Feel the weight of the headcover whip through the ball, and how it is releasing. You'll notice it's heaviest when your arms are fully extended. Bingo! That is your optimal point to release the club in a golf swing.\n\nPractice. Now that you've learned how to time the release in a golf swing, practice where it counts, on the golf course. Golf is all about muscle memory, so get a good feel of how your forearms, wrists and hands felt when the weighted headcover swept through the hitting area during the practice sessions. If you can do that, then you can maximize your power."}

{"text": "BEST GOLF TIP EVER!\n\nBy Senior Staff Writer Ken Tonks\n\nThe \"best tip ever\". Wow, that sounds like something doesn't it? Better than the tip about not looking up until you hear the ball fall into the hole on short putts? Could it be that good? (I always thought that to be the dumbest tip myself. If you do miss, you have no more information on the next putt than you had on the one you just missed because you weren't watching! How dumb is that???\n\nAnyway, back to the best tip ever...\n\nJust send $19.95 and I'll send you my c.d.....just kidding! Here it is:\n\nThis move involves dropping the right elbow into your right side as your first move on the downswing. You want to bring your right elbow into your side so that you can actually feel it lightly touch your shirt. What this does is keep you on the inside path to the ball, preserves your wrist cock, and eliminates that over the top move that been causing all those banana balls and cursing fits you've been having all these years.\n\nWhat you are doing is dropping into the infamous \"slot\". Watch the pro's swing. They almost seem to \"drop\" a hair as they transition from the back swing to the downswing. The legs squat just a bit, and their is a slight pause as the club changes direction. At that pause is when you think \"bring that elbow down as I start the downswing. Down, NOT OUT!\n\nMost of us \"fire from the top\" in an effort to clobber the ball. It seems like the more powerful move, but it absolutely is not. Problem with this move is that it immediately starts un cocking your wrists, while throwing your arms away from your body. The result is an over the top, outside in swing, with most of the power spent long before you get to the ball. By keeping your elbow tucked into your right side, you automatically swing from the correct inside to inside path, and you'll maintain most of your wrist cock until the last minute. As Emerald would say, \"BAMM!\"\n\nTake your time on the downswing. Swing hard!, but let it progress. You're first move should be a little drop motion as your right elbow pulls down into your right side. Now that you're in \"the slot\", get ready to let her ride! Release the hands hard at impact and feel the resulting power. If you've never hit a shot from \"the slot\" before, you're in for a treat, and a good 20 or more yards off the tee.\n\nNot a bad tip huh?\n\nIf this works for you consider sending that $19.95 to your favorite charity for kids"}
{"text": "Any golfer knows and appreciates the fact that to improve your game and have a swing that puts your ball down the fairway like the professionals you have to work at it. One of the most important aspects of a good golf swing is to work on increasing golf swing speed to add more power, distance, and accuracy. This may be perhaps the greatest tool for lowering your handicap and improving your game of golf on an individual basis. So how do you increase the speed of your golf swing? Most experts and professionals agree that you must exercise and physically work to raise your golf swing speed.\n\nThe first thing to do is learn some exercises that will condition your body to create a better and more powerful swing. You must be sure to eliminate stiffness when your walk out on the course. Just raising your club above your head and shoulders and swinging the club from side to side is not enough to loosen up. Do exercises that involve a side to side motion and create power and speed with your shoulders, arms, and hands. Any exercises along these lines will help to develop speed for your personal swing. If you are interested in learning how to increase golf swing speed be prepared to work at it on a physical approach."}

{"text": "I assume that the \"three other players\" reference is for events that use one scorecard for the group to record scores in lieu of individual scorecards for each player.\n\nIMHO, the use of one scorecard for the round is the way to go for many reasons.\n\n1) A more efficient way to record scores during the round.\n\n2) Easier on the TD to transfer scores to the Event Scoreboard.\n\n3) It encourages players to turn in their round scores and more data is better at determinings round ratings. If a player's score is really that bad, it won't be used anyway. And with that, the player's score won't be used in their individual rating. So, the player with the bad round just needs to accept the fact that they didn't perform as expected and move on to the next round.\n\nFrom what I've seen, the players that willfully withheld thier round scores, did so to either protect the almighty \"1000+\" player rating (Pro), avoid seeing a sub 900 round rating (Am), or to avoid getting slack from their peers.\n\nRatings are just a number and a general representative of a player's performance for a given number a rounds (player rating) and a standard to use compare individual rounds (round ratings).\n\nRatings are a great tool to use in comparing performance levels of players (ratings) and courses (SSA) over a given amount time. Scores aren't a good representation of a player's performance level. Course layouts and conditions change over time. A score of 58 at Seatac Park isn't the same as a 58 at Lakewood."}

But \"anchoring\" of clubs will become \"illegal\" under the Rules of Golf as of Jan. 1, 2016, pending final approval of draft Rule 14-1b - Ban on Anchoring. Until that time, anchoring remains legal.)\n\nTo effectively use the belly putter you must select one that is fitted to your physique. It must have the correct length and lie angle to allow you to take a comfortable stance and get your eyes just over the inside edge of the ball. Below and on the following pages are some simple steps for fitting yourself for a belly putter.\n\nWhat You'll Need\nFor this do-it-yourself belly putter fitting, you'll need the help of a friend, plus a small mirror, your current putter, a ruler and a protractor or goniometer.\n\nWhat To Do\n1. Lay a mirror on the ground and use its center to represent the ball.\n\n2. Measure the length of your current putter (mine is 33 inches).\n\n3. Holding your putter and the ruler, bend your elbows slightly, and set them against either side of your rib cage (left photo above).\n\n4. Bow forward from the hips and take a comfortable putting stance with your knees slightly flexed and your forearms in line with the putter shaft (right photo above). When you are in the correct posture, your hands should hang under your shoulders.\n\n5. Maintain your posture and adjust distance from the mirror so your eyes appear in the middle."}

While it's possible that he'll be entitled to a court case, usually there is just a summary execution immediately after the event.

{"text": "June 27, 2011\n\nCause of the \"Yips\"\n\nThe Yips are a sudden twitch or jerk that strikes a golfer as he prepares to take a swing. Now, researches at the Mayo Clinic have looked into the cause of the yips and are closer to figuring out what causes that annoying jerk or twitch in some golfers. Dr. Charles Adler of Mayo Clinic will discuss his research.\n\nTed Simons: They're notorious among golfers. They can ruin a perfectly good round with one little twitch. They're the yips, and they can really mess up your mind and your golf game. Researchers at the Mayo Clinic have been looking into what causes the yips. Here to talk about the study is Dr. Charles Adler, a Mayo Clinic neurologist and researcher. Thanks for joining us.\n\nDr. Charles Adler: Thanks for having me.\n\nTed Simons: Lets defines terms here. What are the yips?\n\nDr. Charles Adler: Yips are people who putt or chip and get an involuntary movement. Usually they describe it as a twitch, a jerk or sometimes a tremor.\n\nTed Simons: You said putting and chipping. Some people think they have the yips was a driver, possible?\n\nDr. Charles Adler: I think possible, but traditionally, people talk about it mainly with putting and chipping.\n\nDr. Charles Adler: I think it's accurate in many golfers that performance anxiety and that's one of the cause of yips. Our research is geared at looking at whether everybody is more of a psychological or neurological type of yip. We believe there are a number of golfers who have a golfer's cramp, much like musician's cramp or writer's cramp. It's a neurologic disorder.\n\nTed Simons: So it's not the kind of thing if you're walking down the street, your hand goes like this. Only when you're holding a putter and -- why then?\n\nDr. Charles Adler: If you saw someone whose hand shook.\n\nTed Simons: Yes.\n\nDr. Charles Adler: Just as they're sitting here then you wouldn't be surprised if their hand shook when golfing.\n\nTed Simons: Yes.\n\nDr. Charles Adler: The research we're doing, people, like you said, don't have a movement disorder when they're just walking around and it's just during that task. We call it a task-specific movement dystonia or a task specific movement disorder. Again, musician's cramp, people who play the violin and people who write, and only when they're writing, no other activity, typing, only when writing do they get a twitch or involuntary movement of their hand.\n\nTed Simons: That suggests overuse. Do you think do you understand the musician with the cramp and the writing so much your hand freezes up? Overuse here in terms of putting.\n\nDr. Charles Adler: There's a lot of discussion about it being due to overuse. Nobody has proven whether these task specific dystonias are truly due to overuse. It may be a genetic predisposition. And in the setting of overuse, that's when they get it. And then we all write but don't all get writer's cramp. Many people play instruments and yet don't get a musician's cramp. Same with golf.\n\nTed Simons: Talk to us about the study. What you did and how the research was conducted.\n\nDr. Charles Adler: We did a study where we took 10 people who complained of the yips and 10 who didn't. We had them in the lab at Mayo clinic and we studied hand movements and forearm movement. This study was done at ASU at the practice green at Carson golf course with my colleagues both in Mayo and in ASU and studied 25 golfers who complained of yips and 25 golfers who did not. And we videotaped them and had surface EMG, which is an electrical recording device to look at movements of the muscles and contraction of the muscles. And then had their wear a glove which measured joint position at the fingers as well at the wrist. It also measure the rotation at the wrist.\n\nTed Simons: Did you find that they gripped tighter, change throughout the putting stroke? I'm trying to get this neurological situation down here. Because again, some folks think the yips -- I actually read this once, where a putting instructor thought that with the yips - when you're taking the putter back, you're thinking you're aiming too far in one direction and your mind says compensate, compensate, compensate. And by doing that you start poking at it.\n\nDr. Charles Adler: I have read that as well and can't say it's incorrect. In the research, we've done, we've identified a number of individuals that have an excessive amount of rotation around the wrists. Some have co-contractions, so their wrist flexors and extensors contract at the same time. People who don't complain about yips mainly do not have that. We think there's a percentage of people, 10, 15, 20 percent, maybe higher that have a neurologic cause as opposed to a performance anxiety or choking cause as you described.\n\nTed Simons: And it seems as though you don't hear about young people having the yips. Always the older guys and complaining and they've got the belly putter because they just can't do it. If it's neurological, why don't we see more young folks out there with this?\n\nDr. Charles Adler: This was followed in line with all of these other sort of movement disorders. They occur as one ages. Think about tremor, think about Parkinson's disease, think about people who have writer's cramps and musician's cramps. Similar pattern usually occurs in their 40s and 50s and maybe 60 in terms of the onset. So same thing here.\n\nTed Simons: What kind of treatment are we talking about? I know it's early in the study and this of course is looking at golf. But as for the golf aspect, what do these folks do?\n\nDr. Charles Adler: The first -- first of all, the study was not a treatment study. We didn't actually look at any treatment modality. That's the point of what I hope will be the next study. The first treatment option as with the other type of cramp, change your grip. Use a longer putter. People say doesn't that prove it's not neurologic? And the answer is no. If you have a writer's cramp patient, we often change the size of their pen and how they grip the pen to get them to compensate. Various oral medications can be tried and depending on the patient, there are a couple of other options. Toxin injections used for writer's and musician's cramp and there's even surgical intervention with deep brain stimulation surgery. I'm not saying that should be used on golfers.\n\nTed Simons: That's what I was going to say.\n\nDr. Charles Adler: There's one golfer who has had that. A professional golfer. That's something that would need a lot more study. But that's way down the line.\n\nTed Simons: Quickly, if someone has the yips, is that a concern, a health concern?\n\nTed Simons: A computer hacking group that's targeted the CIA and the U.S. senate turned its attention to Arizona last week. Lulz security, or Lulzsec, claimed responsibility for hacking into and stealing files from the state department of public safety's computer system. Here to talk about all of this is Ken Colburn, CEO of valley-based data doctors. Ken, it's always a pleasure.\n\nKen Colburn: Good to see you, Ted.\n\nTed Simons: When they say they hacked into the computer system, that's not correct.\n\nKen Colburn: DPS actual computer systems were never breached. What happened was a handful of I think seven to eight actual email accounts that belonged to officers were compromised. So there's a huge difference between the whole system getting hacked and these guys having their emails exploited.\n\nKen Colburn: That's true. Everything we've seen in the evidence - the forensic team went through the files to see \u2013 did it jive with what they were saying. And they're consistent with these being email attachments, primarily because each file's author, we can dig into the metadata to see who actually created the file. And it was a myriad of people unrelated to the people who got hacked, which is very consistent with you receiving emails attachments from others.\n\nTed Simons: Basically, talking about emails, this -- one of these, I didn't change my password enough? How did they get into these emails?\n\nKen Colburn: We don't know for sure. DPS might know, but they are obviously not yet discussing that. But one of things we saw was that the passwords were pretty weak and a weak password makes it real easy. We posted something on our facebook page to show you how easy it is to break into something with a weak password.\n\nTed Simons: What's a weak password?\n\nKen Colburn: Six characters, either all numbers or all letters. Takes about 10 minutes for the software that the hackers use to \"guess\". There's the dictionary attack where they can just try every word in the dictionary. If you use those common mistakes, they'll get into your accounts so fast it's not funny.\n\nTed Simons: These were rural officers \u2013 kind of out in the sticks who may not had the latest up-to-date computer equipment as well. Did they target these people? Find these people?\n\nKen Colburn: They're making it look like S.B. 1070 was a cause and everything what's happened. They've shut down and so many things have happened. From the beginning, I have said it's a cause taken up because of a hack. So inadvertently came across information and look what we have here and then it took up the sick S.B. 1070 cause because if it was hack based on a cause -- now was that the cause that drove the hack? They wouldn't have gone after the rural officers. They would've literally gone after the DPS system and would have seen a treasure trove of information being released.\n\nTed Simons: How do you inadvertently come across like this?\n\nKen Colburn: The hacking community, the way they take advantage and make use of computers all over the world is that they create what are called BOTnets. These are robot computers and unfortunately a lot of people watching this, they're unwittingly participating in these BOTnets right now because they sell for a trick that allowed a piece of software to sneak into their computer. And this person can use it along with 10,000 other pieces of computers that have all been compromised and say, at 2:00 in the morning, attack the PBS website. And that's what happened when PBS.org was taken down. It's a denial of service attack. It's a complexity. They have to compromise a bunch of average Joe computers, and this is my hypothesis, they ran across one or two DPS agents' computers and saw they were DPS agents and had these attachments and said, let's run with this.\n\nTed Simons: We keep hearing don't open attachments you're not familiar with and don't go to websites you're not familiar with. Because these things can infiltrate. If -- one of these officers simply open an attachment they shouldn't have or -- ?\n\nKen Colburn: It's quite likely, especially when you consider they're rural officers. I've contended that were probably compromised at home or on an unsecured computer they own or had access to. You think about the fact that email is so accessible and can be accessed from so many places. There's not enough time to talk about all the potential ways they were compromised. If they went into an internet caf\u00e9 that has key login software, or if they clicked on a file that allowed something to get in or keeping their security software up to date, there's a million things that can take you anywhere you want by clicking on a link.\n\nTed Simons: One employee who can check their work email from home, that person slip up there, a house of cards comes down?\n\nKen Colburn: It's possible. Depending on the access level they have. In this case, based on the evidence, because all they have are email attachments, they didn't get any further than those email attachments. If they had, they could have had this huge database, they're releasing all kinds of information from our organizations much more damaging. Fortunately for DPS it was mostly benign email attachments and certainly disconcerting files but nothing dramatic like a true break-in.\n\nTed Simons: These things raise the question: How protected is sensitive government information, how protected is my sensitive information?\nKen Colburn: Unfortunately, there's no such thing as a 100% secure system. Other than the really high end, nobody knows about military grade networks we don't have access to. When it comes to the public internet, it's not very secure and it's -- it behooves all of those folks that run websites, you know, this is a wakeup call, anyone could be the next target. Despite the claims of being political and what have you, they're just anarchists and primary hack for the adulation of their friends and Lulz -- doing it for the fun. That's the name of that organization. Fortunately, they've closed up shop, but it's not over.\n\nTed Simons: How difficult is it to find suspects? Do they leave -- if someone is coming into your system, you would think someone would leave a trail. They don't leave trails?\n\nKen Colburn: Not at all. There's a number of different ways where you can't get into the technical aspects but the movies where you see they take over a computer and this computer takes that computer -- that's the way they can blend things. They're going to take advantage of the folks I'm talking about out there that are infected and used as a zombie, using those computers to do the hacking and damage. It's real easy to be anonymous on the internet if you know what you're doing, unfortunately.\n\nTed Simons: Last question: Are we more at frisk our own P.C.s or someone else we exchange email with or our work? I mean where is the greatest risk?\n\nKen Colburn: The biggest problem everybody watching this has is themselves. The human being is the biggest security risk. Because all it takes is one trick email, one thing, no matter how well you've protected yourself, if you fall for a trick. A common one was, Ted, I can't believe you got caught on video doing this. You get an email, oh, my goodness, and you are just clicking around, you're not thinking about security. You're thinking, I got to see this video. When you get there, you have to update your video player, and -- boom! You've let them in.\n\nTed Simons: If someone wants your banks account number or social security, because you have to do this or the other. Red flag.\n\nKen Colburn: And teenage household with high speed internet. Highest risk group out there. And if you're a parent of a teenager, better do your homework.\n\nTed Simons: Ken, good stuff, good to see you.\n\nKen Colburn: Thank you, Ted.\n\nSupreme Court\n\nTed Simons: Good evening and welcome to \"Horizon.\" I'm Ted Simons. The U.S. Supreme Court today struck down a key part of Arizona's Clean Elections law. That's the law that provides public funding to help candidates run for office. Here to talk about how the high court ruled is attorney Dan Barr, a constitutional expert from the Phoenix law firm of Perkins-Cooey. Thanks for joining us\nDan Barr: Thanks for having me.\nTed Simons: What did the court rule and why did they decide in that fashion?\n\nDan Barr: Well, the court ruled exactly what people thought it was going to rule from the oral arguments back in March. You had five justices led by the chief justice, holding that the matching funds provision of the Clean Elections law violated the first amendment. The court was looking at it from the perspective of a candidate who refuses or declines to participate in the Clean Elections Public money. And saying that those candidates are faced with sort of a Hobson's choice, you reach a point where if you spend any more money on your campaign, that triggers matching funds from the state and by raising money for yourself, you're actually raising money for your opponent.\n\nTed Simons: And matching funds means if you and I are both running and you're private and I'm public, and I get to X. And what you spend beyond X. So what you spend beyond X I get? And the court said that's an infringement on your free speech rights?\n\nDan Barr: Infringement of free speech rights because I have the choice of if I spend the money then you get more money from the state up to a certain level, and I shouldn't be put to that choice. If I want to spend my own money on the campaign, I should be able to do that without fear that the state of Arizona is going to give you money and then allow you to run ads or do whatever that will harm my campaign.\n\nTed Simons: Basically says you would have to limit your free speech in order to not benefit my campaign?\n\nDan Barr: Exactly.\n\nTed Simons: Ok.\n\nDan Barr: Exactly.\n\nTed Simons: Is that -- is that -- does that make sense?\n\nDan Barr: Well, to the defense it doesn't make sense, Justice Kagan writing for the defense says wait, we're not forbidding anyone from saying anything. All that's happening are we have more speech. If someone wants to spend more money, great, but the publicly funded candidate will get to respond, get more speech. Chief Justice Roberts says, no, the state of Arizona is putting its thumb on the scale and the person who wants to speak more and spend his own money shouldn't be faced with the prospect of having then to combat other candidates. It's not just one candidate. The Supreme Court gives the example of what happened in the fourth district of Arizona. The fourth legislative district. Where you had one candidate running as a privately funded candidate against two -- two publicly funded where you get -- I forgot the term. The Multiplier Effect. In the multiplier effect - If I'm going to spend one dollar of my own money, the state is going to give one dollar to each of my opponents, therefore, increasing the opposition to me.\n\nTed Simons: If I get this correctly, what Justice Kagan was saying, this wasn't necessarily an infringement on free speech, its subsidizing speech and that's not the same as first amendment right or a first amendment damage, correct?\n\nDan Barr: Exactly. She went through a bunch of cases in the past where subsidizing speech is not a violation. You're actually promoting free speech.\n\nTed Simons: Independent Expenditure Groups were mentioned by Justice Roberts. Talk to us why Chief Justice Roberts said this would be a problem on speech rights on their accounts.\n\nDan Barr: Because the Independent Expenditure Group wants to, say, support your candidacy but put to a choice. If they say, I'm going to run an ad in favor of Ted Simons, then that will trigger the matching funds for candidates A and B who are running against him. So I have a choice. I can do that or instead of running an ad in favor of Ted Simons, I am going to run an ad supporting some position he's in favor of or I have a choice not to speak at all. And Chief Justice Roberts said when you're put to that choice that violates the first amendment. The independent expenditure group shouldn't be put to the choice of running an ad for Ted or for a cause he supports or not speaking at all.\n\nTed Simons: And there are limitations as well if the independent expenditure group doesn't want to donate to my ideas, whatever the situation is, that's limited. The matching funds to my opponent, those aren't limited?\n\nDan Barr: Correct.\n\nTed Simons:-- in how they're used?\n\nDan Barr: And chief justice Roberts also says, you know, if you're the beneficiary of an independent expenditure group, you may not want their help.\n\nTed Simons: Uh-huh.\n\nDan Barr: Ok. You may disagree with their views or view what they're doing is not assisting your campaign. The problem is with the matching funds, the state of Arizona would then give the amount the independent expenditure group to your opponent who could then use it directly for his benefit. So that goes, according to Chief Justice Robert's view, the benefit of your opponent and not you.\n\nTed Simons: I noticed in the dissent, Justice Kagan says it's a good and legitimate way to deal with the cancerous effect of corruption on campaigns and like Chief Justice Roberts said, maybe but that's not what we're dealing with. We're dealing with an infringement on free speech rights.\n\nDan Barr: And he addressed the rationales. Burdening a candidate's ability to spend his or her own money doesn't impact on corruption. If I spend my own money on my campaign, I'm not being corrupted by that.\n\nTed Simons: Uh-huh.\n\nDan Barr: He also noted that public financing does nothing to prevent politicians from taking bribes. Interesting, somebody commented today that many of the politicians caught up in the Fiesta Bowl scandal are publicly financed candidates.\n\nTed Simons: Mm.\n\nDan Barr: So Chief Justice Roberts was saying that the state hasn't really proven the matching funds help in combating public corruption.\n\nTed Simons: And according to Justice Kagan, and you mentioned this before we got on the air, did she refer to the Goldilocks rule?\n\nDan Barr: The system that the state of Arizona set up, the Goldilocks solution. That's when faced with public financing, you don't want to give too much to the candidate which would burden the state. And would be wasted money and you don't want to give too little because you don't have candidates participate. So the Goldilocks solution is where you're giving the just right amount. And Chief Justice Roberts said, the Goldilocks solution, whatever it is, can't be dependent on someone exercising their free speech rights.\n\nTed Simons: Last question: Obviously, Clean Elections survives the matching funds has been ruled unconstitutional and yet, if you and I are running and I'm a publicly funded candidate I can only go to X. You can go to X plus one. I can't go to X plus one at all.\n\nDan Barr: Or X plus 100.\n\nTed Simons: Yeah.\n\nDan Barr: Or X plus 1,000. So that's the current state of the law. You're going to get a lump sum from Clean Elections and you're stuck with that.\n\nTed Simons: What do you think as far as setting precedent for other laws, similar efforts around the country? Is this a biggy in terms of that?\n\nDan Barr: There are seven other states that have matching fund provisions like Arizona's and clearly they're laws are probably infirm now. But the future of public financing, the state is free -- public financing is that the state is free to give -- there's no Goldilocks solution. Going to have to figure out if the sum is adequate enough at the beginning of the campaign to make the candidate competitive."}

Do pros keep their putters for a long time?\n\nIf they're making putts they tend to keep them in the bag for a long time....Tiger used the same Titleist Scotty Cameron model with the Ping grip for well over 10 years until he recently started using the Nike Method. But if the putts aren't dropping they may change every week until something feels right....Vijay is a prefect example of this. He's changed his putter and putting style multiple times in the last 2 years. It's all mental, but you just have to keep searching until something \"feels\" right."}

{"text": "Thursday, March 31, 2011\n\nLOS ANGELES, California - What OVER THE TOP GOLF does is give amateur golfers a golf instruction method by which they are guaranteed, at the very least, to perform the most important part of the golf swing correctly. The role of your torso is to provide power through rotation and weight transfer. The roles of your other body parts, regardless of how much golf teachers emphasize wrist cocks, delayed hits and the like, are merely supplemental. Improper weight shift is a distance killer. Many excellent players have what could be considered bad golf grips but all great golfers use their torsos properly. At a minimum, after learning the OVER THE TOP GOLF method, this is something you will have in common with them - even if you are a 30 handicap.\n\nPick up any book about golf instruction. Online you can find even more places to learn about the golf swing. One common thread you'll find is an emphasis on weight transfer and the rotation of the body. It should be the basis of your golf swing and is the foundation of OVER THE TOP GOLF.\n\n writes \"The body's most important movement in the swing is torso rotation.\"\n\nMany golfers have serious swing flaws like an improper weight shift, for instance. In a conventional golf swing, as your body turns, the weight should transfer from your right side to your left side. If a golfer has a tendency to hang back on the right side, as many amateur players do, torso rotation is interrupted. Now you don't have to worry about it. Learn the OVER THE TOP GOLF swing and your problem is solved. Trust me - you will automatically transfer your weight properly. And you'll be absolutely amazed by the difference.\n\n\"It is interesting that, in analyzing the physics of a golf swing, we see that the arms and wrists play a somewhat passive role, and yet a powerful hit results. So where does the swing energy come from? It comes from the muscles in the torso and shoulders which swiftly rotate the golfer's arms and club through the swing.\"\n\nThe preceding quotation is from the highly technical article  in which the golf swing is analyzed, dissected and discussed in very specific detail. In addition to mathematical formulas that only Sir Isaac Newton could understand, there are many interesting theories explained in layman's terms. Well, not really but take a look for yourself. Remember folks, the optimal release angle to uncock your wrists is \u03b8o = 55-60\u00b0.\n\nThe article that you linked to was nothing short of amazing. Please don't ever let any of those mathematical thoughts creep into my head while I'm swinging a golf club. It was pretty much the exact opposite of what you taught me. Ridiculously complex vs. simply simple.\n\nGolf swing instruction online isn't quite mainstream but you guys are a growing business. Lots of competition though. Most amateur golfers dream of swinging like Tom Watson so they will buy his DVD. They aren't Tom Watson though. I'd prefer a more practical approach. Something I could actually use. Good luck"}
{"text": "How other players can influence your game\n\nMany players fail to recognize that disc golf is, in the final analysis, essentially a game played between him/herself and the course. If more people would grasp this, they would avoid a lot of mental pitfalls. However, although this is a basic truth, on a more obvious level the disc golfer is also competing directly against other people and thus is naturally interested in their games to some degree. The risk here is of emotional involvement in, rather that detached awareness of, the opponents' game. Many players, even at the pro level, have discovered that their own games can be adversely affected by emotional reactions to their opponents' play.\n\nThis happens because in disc golf a participant is not only a performer, but by necessity a spectator as well. And the way the player handles this second role can affect the efficiency of their own game as much as the way a disc golfer releases the disc.\n\nWhen the first player to tee off rips a 450 foot drive down the middle, the golfers who follow react in various ways. Many are threatened by such demonstrations of skill. They respond to the challenge by wanting to out-drive the person who has just thrown. Thus they immediately regress to the caveman situation of one man proving his superiority to another be some demonstration of brute strength. Their reaction is to throw with as much finesse as a Stone Age man smashing a club at a dinosaur. The result is almost always disastrous.\n\nOther players allow themselves to be overawed by their opponents' demonstrations of strength. Their minds flood with negative thoughts, their muscles turn to jelly, their knees become weak, and their nerves begin to unravel. As a result, when they step to center stage, they are so filled with doubts that their efforts become ineffective as those of the player who turns into a gorilla any time they are threatened by superior strength.\n\nAlthough these two reactions are diametrically opposite, the results are essentially the same: both players are victims of internal reactions to something that they have seen. Their emotional reaction to another's performance has devastating effects on their own game.\n\nObjectivity is spectatorship and is therefore another unique difficulty in disc golf. It is not easy to achieve, but is must be striven for. The successful player must not allow him/herself to identify emotionally with actions of other's performances, and the easiest ways to avoid doing so is to recognize that these actions cannot in any way directly influence your game. Emotional involvement with performance in any sport should be reserved for the stadium or the television. It's fine with Brett Farve to be emotional as you watch him complete a fifty-yard pass, because you're not expected to get up from the bleachers, or your couch, and do the same thing. However, when you see a person crush a long drive, and you're up next on the tee, you have to walk up the same stage and try and emulate their drive. Anytime you let your emotions rule how you do so, you're in trouble.\n\nThe better touring pro players solve this problem by watching their rivals with a detachment that allows them to derive, from what they see, certain specific physical information that can be helpful to their own games. For example, they watch to see the effect of the wind on the disc, the way and distance the disc skips upon landing, the conditions of the ground if the opponent uses a roller; and so on.\n\nThe trick is never to get into the habit of making judgments about your own game by comparing it to an opponent's game. That kind of emotional approach courts disaster by opening the mind to all kinds of negative feedback.\n\nYou need to be a member of Minnesota Frisbee Association to add comments!\n\n***For the benefit of myself (it will help determine future posts) and all readers would you please quickly take time to rate the blog 1-10 when you're done in the comments section.\n\n1-that sucked, 2- boring and not informative, 3-I didn't wate me time-but still pretty bad, 4- I get it, 5- It made sense, 6- I liked it, pretty cool- I can see how that'd help my game, 7- good use of my time- a couple helpful points, 8-useful good stuff, 9-very-very helpful 10-all inner demons are gone because of this brilliant piece of writing!"}

{"text": "I believe the principles of good sand play are pretty much the same for everyone. If you want to hit the ball higher, there's no arguing that you must either open the club-face or position the ball farther forward in your stance to increase your launch angle. I mean, there's no other sound way to obtain more height on the shot.\n\nThere are other principles that have more to do with strategy and club selection than with physics and swing mechanics. Every amateur (high handicappers especially) should obey the following rules at all times.\n\nFrom fairway bunkers, forget about using any club longer than a 4-iron unless the sand is moist and packed, with the ball perched in a perfect lie.\n\nAnother fairway bunker tip: Take at least one club more than you would from grass at the same distance.\n\nThe longer the shot, the lighter you should hold the club. That increases your ability to generate speed, and speed is necessary on every shot from sand.\n\nIf your lie is even a little dicey, position the ball at least an inch farther back in your stance than you would from a perfect lie. If the lie is bad, play it back even farther.\n\nFrom greenside bunkers, aim for the top of the flagstick - most misses from sand come up short rather than long, so give yourself the benefit of the doubt."}

{"text": "As energy levels decrease throughout a round of golf it can have a significant effect on your overall game play; decreasing physical performance, mental concentration, control, precision and accuracy. With this in mind it is of upmost importance that you start a round of golf with full carbohydrate stores, giving your brain and muscles a chance to perform at their best.\n\nWhile on a day-to-day basis you should be eating a good balanced diet containing 5 portions of fruit and vegetables, on 'game days' a higher percentage of calories should come from carbohydrates (about 60% to be exact) ensuring that you're keeping yourself fueled up. The majority of these carbohydrates should have a low Glycemic Index (GI), as they give a more constant energy release.\n\nWhilst it's vitally important that you fuel your brain and muscles with carbohydrates it's equally as important that you keep well hydrated - but not just with water. Perspiration contains vital nutrients and those need to be replenished if you're to maintain that energy 'balance'.\n\nThat's where a sports energy drink excels. Research showed that drinking 400 - 500 ml of sports energy drink before a round, followed by a further 200 ml at holes 6 and 12, improved putting performance (particularly over the last 6 holes) increased alertness and reduced fatigue."}
