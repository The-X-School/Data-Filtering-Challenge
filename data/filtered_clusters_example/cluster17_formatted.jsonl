A single fuel cell consists of an electrolyte sandwiched between an anode and a cathode.

The Gemini, Apollo and space shuttle program all used fuel cells to generate electricity and produce drinking water on-board by just bringing hydrogen fuel and oxygen with them.\n\nFuel Cell Principle\n\nIf an electrical voltage is applied on water, by placing two electrodes into the liquid and attaching a DC battery to them, the voltage induces a chemical reaction; hydrogen and oxygen is produced at each electrode:\n\nH2O + DC voltage \u00e8 H2 + O2\n\nIn 1839, Sir William Grove observed this process, known as hydrolysis, can also go backwards \u2013 reversible.Hydrogen will react at one electrode and oxygen at the other, producing water and DC electrical voltage between the electrodes.\n\nDuring reverse hydrolysis, hydrogen would act at one electrode and oxygen at the other, producing water, heat and electrical voltage (DC) between the electrodes.\n\nFuel (H2) + O2 + platinum catalyst \u00e8 H20 + DC voltage\n\nFuel Cell Characteristics\n\nOperates as a continuous battery \u2013 continuous fueling\n\nNever needs recharging\n\nBased on reverse hydrolysis \u2013 converts hydrogen and oxygen into water and electricity\n\nCurrent depends on electrode area\n\nVoltage depends on materials of construction, typically less than 1 volt.\n\nBalance of Plant Equipment\n\nPower-conditioning equipment needed are expensive\n\nFuel processing comprises a large part of cost and project development.\n\nCombined Heat and Power (CHP) is the simultaneous generation of electricity and steam (or heat) in a single power plant.

{"text": "It isn't often (like almost never) that a new technology with potential impact on the environment comes with its own natural solution. According to two papers published by scientists from Rice University (Texas, USA), this is the case with graphene oxide.\n\nGraphene, a form of carbon, can be simply described as a form of graphite (as in pencil lead) that exists in sheets or layers one atom thick. It has an incredible number of potential applications. For example, it can be used in making plastics (polymers), ceramics, reinforced metals, electronics, drug-delivery devices, hydrogen storage, and with modification as a semiconductor. However, most of these applications require mass production to be significant.\n\nOne of the principle forms of graphene is graphene oxide, which is mostly carbon with oxygen and a few atoms of hydrogen. Graphene oxide is an insulator, meaning it doesn't conduct electricity, but has many other properties that it shares with basic graphene. It is also potentially used as an intermediate form in the process of making graphene.\n\nThe long march from scientific discovery to a successful technology typically has a critical phase: Competitive mass production. It's one thing to make something in a lab, or even produce a number of prototypes; it's quite another to produce something in large numbers. It's common for products and technologies to fail because they couldn't be successfully mass produced \u2013 or even more commonly because they couldn't be produced cheaply enough to compete with other similar or alternative products. So it's important when a highly touted new technology, in this case the nanotechnology based on graphene, finds methods of mass production that have numerous advantages, including low cost.\n\nThe new process, described in the paper Improved Synthesis of Graphene Oxide published in the American Chemical Society (ACS) Nano, uses flakes of graphite, which is treated with potassium permanganate, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid. Though obviously very 'active' chemicals, they are inexpensive, well understood, and suited for mass production of graphene oxide. They also do not produce the kinds of explosive gas by-products common to other approaches.\n\nIn the opinion of James Tour, professor of chemistry at Rice and lead researcher for the graphene oxide production paper:\n\n\"Many companies have started to make graphene and graphene oxide, and I think they're going to be very hard pressed to come up with a cheaper procedure that's this efficient and as safe and environmentally friendly,\"\n\nThe 'environmentally friendly' element comes from a discovery described in the second paper also published in ACS Nano as Reduction of Graphene Oxide via Bacterial Respiration. Andreas L\u00fcttge, Rice professor of earth science and chemistry, had already been studying the effects of bacteria on carbon when James Tour came to him with idea that graphene oxide might become a prominent form of carbon nanotechnology. This would mean its widespread use and distribution throughout the environment. Was there any biological way of controlling graphene oxide?\n\nAs it turned out the answer was a comfortable 'yes.' Bacteria from the common bacteria genus Shewanella easily convert graphic oxide into simple graphene, which then arranges itself into graphite. Graphite is largely inert and harmless in the environment.\n\nThus graphene oxide, which apparently can be mass produced relatively easily and inexpensively, can find wide application in the knowledge that 'cleanup' can be accomplished by common naturally occurring bacteria. It's a neatly green package. Now it needs to go toward the implementation steps \u2013 all of this has been lab work \u2013 but the Rice studies were developed in partnership with a Houston based oil drilling company, which has plans for the commercial use of the graphene oxide."}

{"text": "Coal and solar cells may have more in common in the future than you think. In recent months there has been a burst of interest in Polymer Solar Cells thanks to research showing them able to reach efficiencies of over 10%. And, since this is a Coal Bin article, that means they are partially made from coal.\nBefore going into greater detail, here's a simple explanation of how a solar cell works. Photons in sunlight hit the solar panel and are absorbed by semiconducting materials, such as silicon.\n\nThen the electrons (negatively charged) are knocked loose from their atoms, allowing them to flow through the material to produce electricity. Due to the special composition of solar cells, the electrons are only allowed to move in a single direction. An array of solar cells converts solar energy into a usable amount of direct current (DC) electricity.\n\nTraditionally silicon has been used for solar cells because it has a high efficiency rate (20%+). The problem is that the most efficient solar cells require large crystals of silicon, which are more expensive to grow. Consequently, there has been a search for other, cheaper alternatives. These have included poly-crystalline silicon. However, researchers have begun to look at different materials. That's where coal comes in.\n\nThat's also where polymer solar cells come in. Compared to silicon-based devices, polymer solar cells are lightweight, potentially disposable, inexpensive to fabricate (sometimes using printed electronics), and flexible. They still have some problems like the fact that they tend to deteriorate in sunlight.\nHowever, depending on the polymer used, solar cells can be tailored to be especially efficient in absorbing certain parts of light spectrum. That means they could capture more of the energy from the sun than other types of solar cells.\n\nThe key to these cells are the types of polymers used. And, that is where coal comes in. Polymer solar cells use what are known as conducting polymers \u2013 they can conduct electricity. They can also act as semiconductors just like silicone.\n\nThis is a relatively new field and the discovery of conductive polymers earned its three discoverers the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2000. One such polymer is polyaniline. It is a plastic that is polymerized from aniline, which was discovered over 150 years ago and comes from coal tar. There are other polymers that are being considered that have their basis in coal based chemicals too.\n\nAlthough a solar cell that degrades in sunlight seems impractical, they may be ideal economically. If the cells are inexpensive and easy to manufacture, they might be ideal to power a while array of low power personal electronics. Since few digital gadgets last longer than a few years before being upgraded or becoming obsolete, a solar panel that doesn't last 20 years is unnecessary.\n\nNeedless to say, a plastic that can generate energy from the sun has great potential. One company Konarka has a product called Power Plastic that it claims can be used in umbrellas, curtains, and even buildings. Although the efficiency is less than traditional silicon cells (9%), the ability to \"tune\" the plastic to certain wavelengths means it is more efficient in low light conditions and even indoors.\n\nPolymer solar cells don't stop there. Since they are so flexible, there is research on turning them into a fiber that will allow woven solar panels that could be used in backpacks or even clothes.\n\nUnfortunately, the promise of solar cells has usually failed to live up to expectations. The biggest problem is that they can't produce the high levels of electricity necessary for modern living. However, we can take comfort in knowing that whether it's traditional coal powered electricity or the latest polymer solar cells, we still need coal to power our lives."}
{"text": "New Solar Panels Get Their Power From Light We Can't See\n\nThere is a lot of the light spectrum that doesn't register to the human eye (or to conventional solar panels). A new device which could go right on top of existing panels, helps get more of the energy from the sun.\n\nWhile the sun beats down a lot of light and energy on earth, we can only see a tiny percentage of it. All that light we can't see is the new frontier for solar power. Today's photovoltaics, like our eyes, are designed for the visible spectrum: a good chunk of the sun's energy passes by unnoticed (except as the occasional sunburn).\n\nBut that's inefficient since a standard solar cell will capture, and convert, only a fraction of the solar energy that reaches its surface. The near-infrared part of the solar spectrum--about one-third of what hits the panel--is essentially wasted. Capturing this energy, even at low efficiencies, could prove worthwhile by significantly boosting energy production, as long as the new panels are cheap to make.\n\nResearchers at MIT have now done that. Their first \"all-carbon\" solar cells, reported in Advance Materials this month, uses carbon instead of silicon as the primary material. The cells work by employing carbon nanotubes and C60--also known as buckyballs--to turn infrared light into an electric current.\n\nAffordable large-scale production of purified carbon nanotubes is only now becoming a scientific reality. But with further refinements, carbon-based infrared solar panels could spread throughout the industry (and on to many surfaces). Since the material is transparent to visible light, it can overlay conventional solar cells or other materials. \"It's very much a model system and other groups with help increase the efficiency,\" says Rishabh Jain, a graduate student and a lead author of the study.\n\nAnd MIT's carbon solar cells are not alone in their pursuit of infrared. Researchers have started harnessing such solar energy with dyes and spray-on nano-materials"}

Scientists at Brookhaven believe that their latest development could change all of that.\n\nThe catalyst they have created is capable of generating hydrogen gas.

This process is achieved without use of excessive amount of energy or heat production, making it safe and efficient. Once converted into a liquid state, hydrogen and carbon dioxide can be stored easily enough.

And maybe heading that league table of promising, but odd, green energy technologies is the idea of turning bacteria into batteries. That's something a team from the UK's University of East Anglia believes is closer, thanks to its new research. In a paper out in today's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, UEA scientists claim to have nailed the precise mechanisms by which 'rock-breathing' bacteria generate energy.\n\nThe UEA team, led by Dr Tom Clarke, worked in collaboration with scientists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, to assess what was going on on the cell surface of a bacterium known as Shewanella oneidensis. This is a member of a large group of rock-dwelling bacteria that have evolved to survive deep underground, using iron as a source of energy.\n\nRather than breathing using oxygen as most multi-celled animals do - a process known as respiration - the 'rock breathing' bacteria literally wire themselves into particles of iron, in a process of 'iron respiration'. It enables them to get by without oxygen, but it is the details of the mechanism - which involves pumping electrons from the bacteria into the iron - which most excites researchers.\n\nBecause the bacteria are able to generate electrical current by attaching to metallic particles, they could be hooked up to electrodes, so creating microbial fuel cells - also called 'bio-batteries'. These could be driven be something as widespread - and as bizarre - as animal or human waste.\n\nBut for these most natural of waste batteries to become a reality, scientists need to understand the mechanism by which the bacteria's tiny organic cell 'wires' work. And that's exactly what the team from UEA believe they have done, using x-ray crystallography to discover the detailed structure of the proteins involved.\n\n''This is an exciting advance in our understanding of how some bacterial species move electrons from the inside to the outside of a cell,'' said Clarke, ''Identifying the precise molecular structure of the key proteins involved in this process is a crucial step towards tapping into microbes as a viable future source of electricity.''\n\nAnd not only could these fascinating bacterial engines drive new approaches in power generation - they could also allow for the development of novel techniques for cleaning up toxic pollution, such as oil spills or radioactive material like uranium.

Exoelectrogens added an electrical potential from acetate oxidation and reduced the anode overpotential, while the reverse electrodialysis stack contributed 0.5\u20130.6 V at a salinity ratio (seawater:river water) of 50. The H2 production rate increased from 0.8 to 1.6 m3-H2/m3-anolyte/day for seawater and river water flow rates ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 mL/ min. H2 recovery, the ratio of electrons used for H2 evolution to electrons released by substrate oxidation, ranged from 72% to 86%. Energy efficiencies, calculated from changes in salinities and the loss of organic matter, were 58% to 64%. By using a relatively small reverse electrodialysis stack (11 membranes), only \u223c1% of the produced energy was needed for pumping water. Although Pt was used on the cathode in these tests, additional tests with a nonprecious metal catalyst (MoS2) demonstrated H2 production at a rate of 0.8 m3/m3/d and an energy efficiency of 51%. These results show that pure H2 gas can efficiently be produced from virtually limitless supplies of seawater and river water, and biodegradable organic matter.\n\nBy not requiring an external power source they are meaning that they don't need to apply a current across the cells to generate the hydrogen. There will still be a requirement to run pumps, cultivate, and maintain the organisms, etc.\n\nI didn't quite understand the sciencey bit. Where does the energy come from?Yes there will be extraction/containment/cultivation energy costs. The process is analogous to fermentation of sugar to alcohols, provide feedstock and the micro-organisms will produce the hydrogen; the output gas will need to be pumped and compressed. With development the process should be cheaper than current methods for hydrogen production, steam reforming requires fossil fuels and heat and electrolysis is very energy intensive.\nIt's a start, not a solutionPart of it could I suppose be easily linked to a large freshwater pump system containing degredable organic matter present in all large cities (ie, the sewer system)\nThe sewage would provide the energy for the bacteria to grow and produce H2.\nThe salt water is harder. For seaside cities this could quite conceivably be a process with a net energy gain, but I suspect that pumping seawater any real distance negates such a gain.\nOf course if treating sewage in seaside cities becomes an energy producer rather than consumer this would in the long run benefit any city hooked up to the same gridNothing here has shown what they eat.\n\nOf course they don't live on nothing Ben, the paper apparently suggests wastewater as the organic material source. The BBC link in the OP has a quote from the authors.\n\nBasically, when you dissolve something in water, energy is either used or released. So when you put two volumes of water with different concentration next to each other you get an energy gradient, and like any gradient it can be exploited to do work, at least in theory. It's essentially the same principle as two different metals producing a voltage when put together.\n\nFrom the Wiki article, it appears this principle is already being looked into as a means of producing electricity. This new research is instead looking at using it to produce hydrogen directly, without the inefficiencies that would be present from first making electricity and then using that for electrolysis. The main question is likely to be how efficient this method actually is, and whether it would actually be better than just producing electricity without the bacteria getting involved.\n\nOf course they don't live on nothing Ben, the paper apparently suggests wastewater as the organic material source. The BBC link in the OP has a quote from the authorsThere's a partial answer in the quoted abstract:\n\nQuote:\n\nBy using a relatively small reverse electrodialysis stack (11 membranes), only \u223c1% of the produced energy was needed for pumping water.\n\n__________________ Simple probability tells us that we should expect coincidences, and simple psychology tells us that we'll remember the ones we notice...\n\nPretty much. It's the same basic principle as putting salt on a slug to kill it, or why salt and sugar work as preservatives - water will tend to flow through a membrane from high concentration to low concentration, even when there are other pressures trying to stop it. The slug keeps its water inside just fine, but put salt on it and the osmotic pressure is enough to suck it out. The same sucking can be harnessed to produce electricity or, in this case, to directly produce hydrogen, or in other ways such as simply acting as a water pump.\n\nOk, so it ultimately runs on fresh water. Glad to hear we have an energy supply that uses an inexhaustible, infinite sourceQuote:\n\nBenBurchCity sewages wouldn't be the only domestic source, farm wastes, household organic wastes, heck all kinds of organic material is wasted by human civilisation and would be relatively easy to recover if sufficiently valued. I'm sure they'll expand potential biological agents using all kinds of neat byproducts as nutrient sources. Genetic engineering could provide some novel solutions too.\n\nThis is not the solution to our energy issues, and won't be for decades even if it can be appropriately scaled for large loads. That said, we could be looking at a large and untapped energy source and given the situation humanity finds itself in, it would be quite wise to invest in such ideasDon't get me wrong; I'm glad to hear that there is another source of energy that we can add to the mix in the future. We should be cautious not to assume that the magic bullet for our increasing energy demands has been foundA lot of sewage plants capture methane produced by anaerobic digesters and use it to power generators. In most cases, I don't believe this produces as much energy as the sewage plant uses."}

Microelectronics power a huge range of consumer goods, from greeting cards to hand-held computers.\n\n\"One could envisage being able to modify an existing semiconductor or microelectronics fabrication plant to produce fuel cells,\" Thompson said.\n\nThe high cost to build fuel cells is one of the biggest impediments to the commercialization of fuel cells, Thompson said. Lowering production cost is critical to being able to use the technology in real-world applications such as hand-held electronics, and eventually vehicles. Using the technology in cars also depends on lowering the cost.\n\nTraditionally, fuel cells are built similarly to a car, with pieces manufactured separately and then assembled. There is high variability and the process is costly and time consuming. But Thompson's research group is making proton exchange membrane fuel cells (which are the leading candidate to replace batteries in hand-held electronics and vehicles) using modern electronics microfabrication processes. Instead of assembling the separate parts, the fuels cells are made by \"growing\" layers upon layers, the same way we currently make microelectronic devices.\n\nUsing these lower-cost manufacturing methods, combined with less expensive materials, U-M scientists hope to reduce the cost of fuel cells from nearly $10,000 per kilowatt to less than $1,000 per kilowatt.\n\n\"At this lower cost, fuel cells would be competitive with lithium ion batteries, the power supply for many portable electronic devices including cell phones,\" Thompson said.\n\n\"Manufacturers should be able to reduce costs in the same way that costs for microelectronics have been reduced,\" he said.\n\n\"U-M research on using microfabrication to make fuel cells began about two-and-a-half years ago,\" Thompson said. \"The next step is to generate prototypes for third party evaluation. The first market will be for portable electronic devices, but the goal is to someday use fuel cells in automobiles.\"\n\nRelevant PhysicsForums postsCheaper clean-energy technologies could be made possible thanks to a new discovery.

{"text": "IBM develops promising contender for cheaper solar cells\n\nFeb 11, 2010 by Lin Edwards\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Solar cells could make fossil fuels virtually redundant if they were cheaper, but their use of rare elements and complex manufacturing processes makes them expensive. Now IBM Research has developed a prototype solar cell that solves both problems, using common, cheap elements and using an inexpensive manufacturing process. Their paper is published in the Advanced Materials journal.\n\nThe new photovoltaic cells are known as \"kesterite\" cells, which are produced using a printing technology in which a solution containing nanoparticles is spin-coated onto a glass substrate. According to IBM their efficiency is close to that of established solar cells.\n\nIBM researcher David Mitzi, who is also manager of the company's photovoltaic science and technology department, said they wanted to reduce the cost and use more abundant elements for thin-film photovoltaic cells. The current technology uses the rare elements indium and tellurium. Indium is in particularly short supply because it is also used in the manufacture of transparent transistors and is in high demand for flat panel display systems. By contrast IBM's kesterite cells uses the common elements tin (Sn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), selenium (Se), and sulfur (S).\n\nThe new solar cells are also cheaper to manufacture, using a \"printing\" technique that uses a hydrazine solution containing copper and tin with nanoparticles of zinc dispersed within it. The solution is then spin-coated and heat treated in the presence of selenium or sulfur vapor. This process is much cheaper than the traditional manufacturing process, which uses an expensive vacuum-based technique.\n\nA team at the Nagaoka National College of Technology in Japan produced a thin-film kesterite cell in 2009, which had an efficiency of 6.8 per cent. IBM's kesterite cell has increased the efficiency by 40 per cent. Mitzi said they are planning to increase the efficiency above 11 per cent, which is equal to or better than the traditional solar cells.\n\nSolar cells contribute under 0.1 per cent of the Earth's electricity supply at the moment, largely due to their expense and the rarity of their key elements. The IBM solar cell could change all of that. IBM will patent and license the technology and says it is open to partnerships with existing photovoltaic cell manufacturers to bring it to the market. little problem - hydrazine is extremely toxic, even in aqueous solution.\n\nFrom  Hydrazine is highly toxic and dangerously unstable with autoignition temperature 24-270 C. It means, it can be easily ignited even at room temperature or a bit higher.\n\nAlso wrom Wiki: \"On February 21, 2008, the United States government destroyed the disabled spy satellite USA 193 with a sea-launched missile, reportedly due to the potential danger of a hydrazine release if it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere intact\"\n\nThey even destroy satellites, containing hydrazine fuel, before they reach the Earth atmosphere. How can solar cell, containig such material, be called a \"green tech\"? Pb and Cd are a way less dangerous but they aren't used in modern electronics due to RoHS requirements (at least in EU).Do you understand anything about the manufacturing of semiconductors as is done today, all over the world, Zarp? Some of the chemical compounds located in fabrications are deadly at 1:1000000 concentrations to large amounts of people if dispersed into a local water supply.\n\nThey know what they're doing in these places. OSHA and other regulations make sure that containment and transportation of these chemicals happens in redundantly safe manners. You on the other hand, obviously have no clue.At the risk of sounding foolish, toxicity is overrated IMHO. Develop an effective containment plan and stick to it. Screen workers. Move forward.\n\nOr HF acids, sulphuric acid, pure arsenic, phosphorus, and the like used in ion implanters as dopants? I know those very well, I spent 20 years as an ion implant field service engineer. I'll take my chances with the hydrazine. Or how about the gold deposition process using cyanide?\n\nThanks for the interest in this work! If anyone would like to know more about the science behind this story (and it sounds like a lot of you might do!) we've set the original research paper as free to access; you can find it here: \n\n\"They even destroy satellites, containing hydrazine fuel, before they reach the Earth atmosphere.\"\n\nActually, the US destroyed the spy satellite because it was a BRAND-NEW SPY SATELLITE, not because it contained hydrazine. There was no way they could risk a foreign government getting their hands on any part of it...\n\nHydrazine is used in the on board power units of the F-16....how many hundreds of those would you say are scattered around the world these days? How often are you hearing horror tales of dozens, hundreds or thousands mained or killed by hydrazine accidents daily...oh thats right...it isnt happening that often is it...\n\nThat sattilite would have never reached ground with any hydrazine left...That could not have been the reason for destroying it...but was a convienent cover story wasnt it?\n\nPoint, hydrazine has it's dangers, but when used under proper conditions by trained personnel it presents minimal risk. Any good safety officer could set up the operation to minimize those risks and have approperate emergency response in place to deal with the situation when things go all pear shaped.\n\nWow, a exceptional achievement. With other manufacturers claiming $1 a watt soon, This may drive solar panels to $.5 a watt. I'll be energy self sufficient (as long as I have nano-technology to store energy doing the day).\n\nHydrazine is safely used in closed production cycle and most of residue will decompose during subsequent thermal treatment. In life environment hydrazine is oxidized rapidly to harmless nitrogen. In fact it's quite environmentally clean fuel and reducing agent, commonly used as oxygen scavenger in boiler feedwater to inhibit corrosion. A huge amount of hydrazine is used in semiconductor industry already and nobody cares about"}

The rumen is essentially a fermentation vat crawling with microorganisms where much of the food that a cow eats is temporarily held and is continuously churned until it can be completely digested. This liquid mass is what scientists call rumen fluid.\n\nThe researchers collected the fluid through a cannula, a surgically implanted tube that leads directly from the cow's hide into its rumen. The cow used in the study ate a normal diet.\n\nThe researchers filled each of two sterilized glass chambers with strained rumen fluid to create the microbial fuel cell. Each chamber was about a foot high and about 6 inches in diameter.\n\nThe chambers were separated by a special material that allowed protons to move from the negative (anode) chamber into the positive (cathode) chamber. This movement of protons, along with the movement of electrons across the resistor and wire that connects the two electrodes, creates electrical current.\n\nThe anode chamber was filled with rumen fluid and cellulose, which served as a food source for the microorganisms. Cellulose is plentiful on most farms, as harvesting usually leaves behind plenty of it in the form of crop residue in the fields.\n\nThe other chamber, the cathode, was filled with potassium ferricyanide, a chemical that acts as an oxidizing agent to round out the electrical circuit.\n\nTwo small pieces of plain graphite served as the fuel cell's electrodes (an electrode draws and emits electrical charge.) A piece of graphite was placed in each chamber. The researchers used a meter to measure the output of the fuel cell.\n\nThat output reached a consistent maximum of 0.58 volts. After about four days, the voltage fell to around 0.2 volts, at which time the researchers added fresh cellulose to bring the voltage back up to a higher level.\n\n\"While that's a very small amount of voltage, the results show that it is possible to create electricity from cow waste,\" Chris"}
{"text": "Methane-powered laptops may be closer than you think\n\nNov 17, 2010\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Making fuel cells practical and affordable will not happen overnight. It may, however, not take much longer.\n\nWith advances in nanostructured devices, lower operating temperatures, and the use of an abundant fuel source and cheaper materials, a group of researchers led by Shriram Ramanathan at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) are increasingly optimistic about the commercial viability of the technology.\n\nRamanathan, an expert and innovator in the development of solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), says they may, in fact, soon become the go-to technology for those on the go.\n\nElectrochemical fuel cells have long been viewed as a potential eco-friendly alternative to fossil fuels\u2014especially as most SOFCs leave behind little more than water as waste.\n\nThe obstacles to using SOFCs to charge laptops and phones or drive the next generation of cars and trucks have remained reliability, temperature, and cost.\n\nFuel cells operate by converting chemical energy (from hydrogen or a hydrocarbon fuel such as methane) into an electric current. Oxygen ions travel from the cathode through the electrolyte toward the anode, where they oxidize the fuel to produce a current of electrons back toward the cathode.\n\nThat may seem simple enough in principle, but until now, SOFCs have been more suited for the laboratory rather than the office or garage. In two studies appearing in the Journal of Power Sources this month, Ramanathan's team reported several critical advances in SOFC technology that may quicken their pace to market.\n\nIn the first paper, Ramanathan's group demonstrated stable and functional all-ceramic thin-film SOFCs that do not contain any platinum.\n\nIn thin-film SOFCs, the electrolyte is reduced to a hundredth or even a thousandth of its usual scale, using densely packed layers of special ceramic films, each just nanometers in thickness. These micro-SOFCs usually incorporate platinum electrodes, but they can be expensive and unreliable.\n\n\"If you use porous metal electrodes,\" explains Ramanathan, \"they tend to be inherently unstable over long periods of time. They start to agglomerate and create open circuits in the fuel cells.\"\n\nIn a second paper published this month, the team demonstrated a methane-fueled micro-SOFC operating at less than 500\u00b0 Celsius, a feat that is relatively rare in the field.\n\nTraditional SOFCs have been operating at about 800\u20131000\u00b0C, but such high temperatures are only practical for stationary power generation. In short, using them to power up a smartphone mid-commute is not feasible.\n\nIn recent years, materials scientists have been working to reduce the required operating temperature to about 300\u2013500\u00b0C, a range Ramanathan calls the \"sweet spot.\"\n\nMoreover, when fuel cells operate at lower temperatures, material reliability is less critical\u2014allowing, for example, the use of less expensive ceramics and metallic interconnects\u2014and the start-up time can be shorter.\n\n\"Low temperature is a holy grail in this field,\" says Ramanathan. \"If you can realize high-performance solid-oxide fuel cells that operate in the 300\u2013500\u00b0C range, you can use them in transportation vehicles and portable electronics, and with different types of fuels.\"\n\nThe use of methane, an abundant and cheap natural gas, in the team's SOFC was also of note. Until recently, hydrogen has been the primary fuel for SOFCs. Pure hydrogen, however, requires a greater amount of processing.\n\n\"It's expensive to make pure hydrogen,\" says Ramanathan, \"and that severely limits the range of applications.\"\n\nAs methane begins to take over as the fuel of choice, the advances in temperature, reliability, and affordability should continue to reinforce each other.\n\n\"Future research at SEAS will explore new types of catalysts for methane SOFCs, with the goal of identifying affordable, earth-abundant materials that can help lower the operating temperature even further,\" adds Ramanathan.\n\nFuel cell research at SEAS is funded by the same NSF grant that enabled the \"Robobees\" project led by Robert J. Wood, Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering. Wood and Ramanathan hope that micro-SOFCs will provide the tiny power source necessary to get the flying robots off the ground.\n\nRelated StoriesStacks of ceramic plates are capable of transforming fuels like natural gas into electricity using an electrochemical process.

In almost all applications (and certainly in electricity generation, but also in locomotion, and even heat when you use heat pumps) you find a factor of about 3 between both.\n\nThat means that the *electrical* capacity you need to replace, say 18 TW primary energy, usually turns more around 6 TWe.\n\nSo it is not right to say that we'd need 30 TW of *electricity* in 2050 (even taking on his numbers) - we'd need around 10 TW, if we would do everything with electricity (and if we don't, well, then we don't need that electric capacity).\n\nWhat potential do TED (thermo-electric devices) devices hold?\n(correct me if i'm wrong) -I realize that the efficiency is wretched; but what is so horrible about TEDs?

Come on mass production!!!\n\nwhy do you suppose Pickens wouldn't think TEDs weren't good enough to fund?\n\nNot much. TEDs, except for the radioactive ones, have like you said very poor efficiency. Not like 1 or 2% but like 0.01% if that. They are just not capable of producing large amounts of power given the resources required to make them work not to mention the cost of those resources. Would you rather pay $0.10/kwh for power from wind and solar or $8.00/kwh from a TED plant in a volcano?\n\nI should add that per the blogosphere the 20% panels are running $8/W, I don't have any other direct price information from those vendors. The panels driving the worldwide prices above are apparently ~10-12% efficient. Of course one would save on installation costs w/ the more efficient panels (less area required for a given power requirement).Well I know there is a huge amount of Natural Gas off of the coast of the Carolinas and Virginia. If the current prohibitions on drilling there were lifted, it would make a significant impact I think. Don't know if it would be enough to supply the entire US though."}

{"text": "Like it? Share it!\n\nOh graphene, you're the molecule I'd love to marry most, what with your magical and amazing properties that are constantly revealed. Among many other traits, graphene has now been shown to dramatically boost the efficiency of artificial photosynthesis. Next week, someone will publish a paper about how eating pure graphene will make you live forever as young and beautiful.\n\nWhen you're talking photosynthesis, artificial or not, there is an important part of the process called the photocatalyst. Essentially, this is exactly what it sounds like; it's a material that facilitates the fuel creation of the photosynthesis process without getting depleted in the actual process. In plants, the photocatalyst is chlorophyll. In labs it's a little trickier, but graphene may be the answer.\n\nBecause 46% of the total sunlight that hits the Earth is in the visible spectrum \u2014 as opposed to just 4% in the UV range \u2014 an artificial photocatalyst that gets its jollies from normal visible sunlight is optimal. In the past, scientists have tried graphene-semiconductor composites, but it turns out that these aren't the best option because they're bad at transferring their electrons, which sort of bottlenecks the whole process. You know what material is significantly better at that part? Just take a guess.\n\nAs it turns out, plain old graphene coupled with a little porphyrin enzyme is highly functional in the visible light spectrum and highly efficient overall, making it the best suited candidate for an artificial photocatalyst found so far.\n\nWhat it all comes down to is that with graphene in your artificial solar cells, you'll have a reasonably efficient way to take sunlight and carbon-dioxide, and turn it into formic acid \u2014 which is used in the plastic industry, and also as a kind of fuel for fuel cells. A paper on the research has yet to be published, but the researchers involved seem pretty excited about the findings so far. \"The photocatalyst-enzyme coupled system is one of the most ideal artificial photosynthesis systems that utilize solar energy for the synthesis of various chemicals and fuel,\" coauthor Jin-Ook Baeg told Phys.org."}

{"text": "The US DOE National Energy Technology Laboratory, NETL, is investigating the potential of producing hydrogen from coal in order to fuel the hydrogen economy. One concept under consideration is the use of a palladium-based membrane reactor in a coal gasification facility. The CO-rich gasifier effluent would be directed to the membrane reactor inlet, where it would be combined with high pressure steam. The CO and H2O would convert to CO2 and H2 via the water-gas shift reaction (WGSR). The H2 would dissociate into atoms at the palladium surface, diffuse through the palladium film, re-associate into H2 at the opposite palladium surface, and flow into the permeate stream. This removal of hydrogen from the gas-phase reaction mixture would enhance the conversion of CO to levels that would exceed conversion under comparable conditions in a conventional reactor (Enick et al., 2000). Because hydrogen alone would permeate a defect-free, dense palladium film and thereby drive the WGSR to essentially complete conversion, the retentate effluent would be a high pressure CO2-rich stream suitable for sequestration while the permeate effluent would be a high purity, low pressure hydrogen stream."}
{"text": "New small solid oxide fuel cell reaches record efficiency\n\nThe smaller system, developed at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, uses methane, the primary component of natural gas, as its fuel. The entire system was streamlined to make it more efficient and scalable by using PNNL-developed microchannel technology in combination with processes called external steam reforming and fuel recycling. PNNL's system includes fuel cell stacks developed earlier with the support of DOE's Solid State Energy Conversion Alliance.\n\n\"Solid oxide fuels cells are a promising technology for providing clean, efficient energy. But, until now, most people have focused on larger systems that produce 1 megawatt of power or more and can replace traditional power plants,\" said Vincent Sprenkle, a co-author on the paper and chief engineer of PNNL's solid oxide fuel cell development program. \"However, this research shows that smaller solid oxide fuel cells that generate between 1 and 100 kilowatts of power are a viable option for highly efficient, localized power generation.\"\n\nSprenkle and his co-authors had community-sized power generation in mind when they started working on their solid oxide fuel cell, also known as a SOFC. The pilot system they built generates about 2 kW of electricity, or how much power a typical American home consumes. The PNNL team designed its system so it can be scaled up to produce between 100 and 250 kW, which could provide power for about 50 to 100 American homes."}
{"text": "Solar photovoltaic cells based on nano-silicon have significantly less reflection than bulk silicon or a traditional PV cell. Specifically, while bulk silicon reflects over 30% of light across the spectrum (at normal incidence) and PV manufacturers are able to reduce this to 5-8% with anti-reflection coatings and surface texturing, nano-silicon can reflect less than 1% of incoming light. This leads to more of the light being absorbed in the solar cell and more electricity for the end-user.\n\nIn addition, while the effectivenes of most anti-reflection coatings declines at non-normal incidence, Bandgap's nano-silicon retains reflection below 4% for angles up to 70 degrees, yielding more KWh per KW installed than traditional silicon-based PV products."}
{"text": "Nanoparticles to help mop up more solar energy\n\nWashington: Using minute graphite particles 1,000 times smaller than the width of human hair, mechanical engineers hope to boost the efficiency and profitability of solar power plants.\n\nPhotovoltaic (PV) solar panels are popping up more and more on rooftops, but they`re not necessarily the best solar power solution. \"The big limitation of PV panels is that they can use only a fraction of the sunlight that hits them, and the rest just turns into heat,\" explains Robert Taylor, a graduate student in mechanical engineering at Arizona State University.\n\nAn alternative that can make use of all of the sunlight, including light PVs can`t use, is the solar thermal collector, reports the Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy.\n\nThe purpose of these collectors, which take the form of dishes, panels, evacuated tubes, towers and more, is to collect heat that can then be used to boil water to make steam, for example, which drives a turbine to create electricity. To further increase the efficiency of solar collectors, Taylor and his colleagues have mixed nanoparticles, a billionth of a metre in size, into the heat-transfer oils normally used in solar thermal power plants, according to an Arizona statement.\n\nThe researchers chose graphite nanoparticles, in part because they are black and therefore absorb light very well, making them efficient heat collectors.\n\nIn lab tests with small dish collectors, Taylor and his colleagues found that nanoparticles increased heat-collection efficiency by up to 10 percent.\n\n\"We estimate that this could mean up to $3.5 million dollars per year more revenue for a 100 megawatt solar power plant,\" he says.\n\nWhat`s more, Taylor adds, graphite nanoparticles \"are cheap\" - less than $1 per gram - with 100 grams of nanoparticles providing the same heat-collecting surface area as an entire football field."}
{"text": "Jan 04, 2011 by Lisa Zyga\n\nAfter printing solar cells on a piece of paper, researchers folded the paper into an airplane to demonstrate that it could still generate current. Image credit: Karen Gleason, MIT.\n\nTo demonstrate how a new fabrication technique can print solar cells on extremely thin, flexible materials, researchers from MIT have patterned solar cells onto ordinary toilet paper. While toilet paper may be an unlikely substrate for practical solar cell applications, it illustrates the versatility of the technique for low-cost printing on a wide variety of materials.\n\nKaren Gleason, a chemical engineering professor at MIT, along with graduate student Miles Barr and others, showed that the technique could be used to print solar cells on a variety of delicate materials. One example is rice paper, which is used to make spring rolls in restaurants and usually dissolves in wet processes. Since the researchers' technique is a dry, solvent-free process, the rice paper remains intact. The researchers also demonstrated the technique on plastic Saran wrap, which repels water and would normally be difficult to coat.\n\nThe new method, called oxidative chemical vapor deposition (oCVD), involves spraying a vapor of a monomer and an oxidizing agent onto a substrate. The monomer and oxidizing agent polymerize when they meet and form PEDOT plastic. The plastic itself is conductive, but the conductivity can be further increased up to 1,000 times by controlling the substrate temperature so that small nanopores form, which can be laced with highly conductive silver particles.\n\nThe printed solar cells can also withstand a great deal of bending and stretching with minimal effect on their properties. In tests, the researchers bent a printed plastic substrate to a radius of less than 5 mm more than 1,000 times, and found that its efficiency was still 99% of what is was before bending. The electrodes could also be bent and stretched, and still retained their conductivity. To further demonstrate the method's robustness, Barr folded a piece of paper printed with solar cells into a paper airplane, and showed that the device still generated a current.\n\nMIT Professor Karen K. Gleason explains how graduate student Miles Barr folds a solar cell into a paper airplane. The research is part of the Eni-MIT Solar Frontiers Center. Video credit: MIT.\n\nAs the researchers noted, paper is not typically considered a good substrate for photovoltaics because it's not transparent. However, the ability to print solar cells at low-cost on flexible, stretchable materials could be very useful for making solar cells more widespread. Since the technique can also be used to print other electronic devices besides solar cells, it could be used for novel applications such as printing electronics on fabric and other flexible displays.\n\nRelated StoriesThe development of new electronic applications like thin-film solar panels, wearable displays and non-invasive biomedical devices, which require significant deformation to copy body movements, has heightened the need for ...\n\nIMEC has realized a single-junction GaAs solar cell on a Ge substrate with a record conversion efficiency of 24.7%.

Annoy some neighborhood kids until they TP your house and bam - you've eliminated installation costs.\n\nIf you did put it on something flexible you could wrap many structures like lamp posts and electrical poles (though I do wish people would bury the electrical lines more often). Solarizing (is that a word) things like street lights - even if they need to be hooked up to the grid for backup - could reduce the losses caused by transmission.\n\nIf they ever get wind power to become economically sensible (able to pay for itself without massive subsidies, solve maintenance and storage issues) they could wrap the turbine poles for some extra power. Since the wind turbines seem to have a beneficial effect on crops there would be an added insentive for farmers to use them.\n\nSo this technology should allow solar cells to be printed onto a plastic film that could be applied to windows in buildings or homes, enabling power generation wherever there is a window.\n\n...or automobiles or geodesic domes as stated.\n\nThis could be extremely useful in hydroponic greenhouses, because in some locations they get too much sunlight and need screens. It would be nice to have the \"screen\" be build into some of the plastic in the form of these solar cells, and then use the electricity to power water pumps or something else.\n\nvideo showed less than a micro amp at full light. what is efficiency of light conversion?\n\nIt's hard to say since their light source could be tuned perfectly to the wavelength that their cells respond to best, or they could have just used some typical light source that doesn't posses the wavelength needed to fully excite the cell. Also, without the voltage or resistance of the circuit known, we can't calculate the power being generated. Finally, I don't know exactly how much of the surface was actual working solar cell, so it's hard to calculate the per area power generated. But if you imagine multiple square meters of this stuff, it adds up pretty quickly.\n\nSeems that the trade off is: the more efficient something is at converting light to electricity, the more opaque it becomes...\n\nOf course, because it needs to _capture_ the energy in order to convert it. Any photon that is captured does not pass through (and hence cannot be seen on the other side). Transparent solar cells would need to restrict themselves to the UV or IR parts of the spectrum (because we don't see these wavelengths we wouldn't notice when they're missing)\n\nThe most energy of our sun is, however, in the visible spectrum. (Naturally we evolved to make use of just this part because it allows us to see the most energy and hence gather the most information about our environment)"}
{"text": "Moulton45's comments below are interesting. This user assumes he has understood the science of electrochemistry and calorimetry after studying wikipedia for 4 days and that he can therefore conclude that the reported excess heat is due to simple measurement mistakes.\n\nWhat he hasn't explained though, is why his assumed measurement mistake only happens every now and then (excess heat is observed only sometimes).\n\nWhat he also hasn't understood is that if his explanation were correct (which isn't so), all previous electrochemistry experiments in the history of science would have had the same systematic experimental error. And Moulton45 has now uncovered it, well done, please collect your Nobel Prize for this significant advancement.\n\nThis is not about chemistry or energy, it's about politics and the power of billions of dollars and people in power with that money backing them every step of the way. This is basically 'free' energy or nearly free with very little amount of money needed to get a tremendous amount of energy. Just think what would happen to all the green energy research, the solar panel companies, the oil and gas, drilling, mining for coal, etc. etc... This would make all those industries come to a screaming halt as well as all the jobs and all the revenue, people would lose trillions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs. I believe this was debunked years ago by the people making large sums of money from these industries. It wasn't until they reproduced it in 27 labs at once and all came forward that they were successful because they can't go after 27 labs at once. And I'm guessing the experts debunking the scince were paid large sums of money to fight this. I've been a scientist for over a decade and I can tell you that most everything you know about science is incorrect, especially if it involves large amounts of money to any one party. Billions upon billions of dollars can push a lie so far that everything just takes it for granted that it's the truth. Politics and money distort science to the point where I don't believe anything I hear anymore. I'm surprised this made the media and I wouldn't be surprised if this was debunked, deleted, and banned from the main stream media. There's just too much money and power at risk.\n\nThe University of Idaho (Moscow, ID) have been developing D2O in larger quanties. This D2O is then sent by guarded vehicles to a small airport just west of the university in Washington state - flown to 3 stations in Alaska (Port Clarence, Attu, and one not specified) to continue the experiments. Small laboritories left from old WWII Coast Guard bases have been working dilligently (and Secretly) on this process thanks to the U.S. Government and a few private corporations that supply materials. These stations in Alaska often change temporarily to Hawaii and on to other Pacific islands where secrecy, again, can be easily maintained. Not even the highest government officials know about these bases since there is no interest nor government monies going into the experiments. The only direct involvement from the Government is the use of transporting materials, equipment, and personnel by military air and sea-going vessels. And since the materials and personnel are quite minimal, these movements are easily substantiated in budget or fiscal expenditures as \"routine.\"\n\nI am not a scientist, but I find this story very interesting, as I am very much into \"energy issues.\"\n\nCertainly the comments by Moulton45 are interesting, even though I don't have the background to really critque or even understand some of the terms he uses. But whether or not he and the other skeptics are correct is obviously beyond me.\n\nIt seems obvious to me though that one easily determine whether excess electrical energy is ultimately created by using a battery of a certain known amp-hour rating as the souce of electrical energy, and after heating water (or a refrigerant in an ORC process for a more efficient conversion) and turning a turbine to produce electricity, charge (if possible) several such virgin batteries with this electricity. This would be \"real world\" experiment -- not just one in lab conditions. Obviously if the water wasn't heated enough to produce the requisite electricity, then the virgin batteries wouldn't be charged (whether it is one battery, or a hundred or more).\n\nFocardi and Rossi recently held a public demonstration of a desktop-sized reactor that produces 11 kW of net power for extended periods of time. Both the fuel and residues are clean and free of radioactivity. The fuel is a nickel powder and a tiny amount of hydrogen. A gram of nickel generates 2000 kilowatt-hours in this prototype. On January 14, 2011 a public demonstration was held at the University of Bologna with about 50 attendees. The US press totally ignored this momentous event. Perhaps 60 Minutes should do an update on this story. The disaster in Japan makes it painfully clear that our current nuclear power, which was adapted from bomb technology, is a disastrous mistake. Focardi and Rossi plan to deliver a one million watt power station to a Greek company this October. A true \"black swan\" event, this technology will change the world.\n\nScott Pelley, when you were in McKubre's lab at SRI with your CBS News film crew, did it occur to you to slap a VU Meter (or a European style Peak Power Meter) across the terminals of his cell, to measure the AC (audio) power going into his cell?\n\nMcKubre might not bother to measure AC (audio) power, but the technicians at CBS surely know how to measure the peak-to-peak audio power using an ordinary VU Meter.\n\nIn McKubre's best results, he reports an excess power of about 500 to 1200 mW. My calculations, treating the AC (audio) power as a 2 volt peak-to-peak triangle wave, yield an audio power going into his cell of roughly 500 to 1800 Mw.\n\nIs this the missing input power that Michael Garwin suspects that McKubre left out of his model when he (McKubre) assumed there was only constant current DC power going into his cell?\n\nIt turns out that the missing correction for AC power doesn't depend on any capacitive load in the cell. The correction applies even to a pure resistive load, if the ohmic resistance is fluctuating (as it does when the cell is bubbling).\n\nIt's ironic that McKubre is funded by EPRI, the Electric Power Research Institute, which depends on funding from the electric power utilities, whose revenues depend on calculating AC power consumption correctly.\n\nMcKubre (like most researchers in CF) is using a precision constant current power supply. When the ohmic resistance of the cell fluctuates (as it does when it's bubbling), the constant current power supply has to adjust the drive voltage to maintain the constant current. In an ideal constant current power supply, this adjustment is instantaneous. But in a real power supply it takes a small but finite time for the power supply to adjust. The speed at which it adjusts is called the slew rate. But no matter how fast the slew rate, there is a transient in which the voltage and current are perturbed and ramp to a new value.\n\nIt turns out that the AC power from this transient isn't that hard to compute. It can be modeled as a linear ramp, which replaces the ideal square wave (instantaneous correction) with a sawtooth (or triangle wave). When you integrate the power over the rise or fall of the triangle wave, you get the AC power that McKubre left out of his model.\n\nI took the data from two of McKubre's experimental runs where he reports significant excess heat, and computed the AC power, assuming a peak-to-peak voltage fluctuation of 2 volts. I get AC power almost exactly equal to his anomalous excess heat.\n\nSo Michael Garwin was right. McKubre neglected to account for the AC power pumped into his cell when it's bubbling furiously and taxing the power supply to maintain a constant current as fast as it can.\n\nThere's a slew of AC electrical energy in that slew rate that McKubre neglected to account for.\n\nThere is yet another issue with these cells that seems applicable to all of them using an electrolyte driven by a constant current power supply.\n\nWhen the cells are fully loaded, and evolving D2 and O2 gas, there is some (variable) amount of gas that clings to the electrodes, forming an irregular thin layer of gassy foam separating the electrode from the electrolyte.\n\nA thin layer of dielectric material separating the electrode from the electrolyte introduces a phenomenon known as an electrochemical double layer. In effect, it turns the electrodes into double-layer capacitors, which can store energy the way an electronic flash does when it charges up.\n\nBecause McKubre and others are using a constant current power supply, the voltage into the cell fluctuates significantly once the bubbles start forming and wreaking havoc with the conductivity of the interface between the electrolyte and the electrodes. This fluctuating voltage drives an AC noise current into the cell, rapidly charging and discharging the double-layer capacitors formed by the presence of the thin layer of gas on the surface of the electrodes. This AC noise current is not included in McKubre's energy budget, but it appears to be large enough to account for the otherwise unexplained heat.\n\nIn other words, his cell is a large Electrolytic Capacitor with a Teflon dielectric.\n\nHere is a quick explanation from the Wikipedia article on Types of Capacitors:\n\n\"Electrolytic capacitors have a larger capacitance per unit volume than other types, making them valuable in relatively high-current and low-frequency electrical circuits, e.g. in power-supply filters or as coupling capacitors in audio amplifiers. High-capacity electrolytics, also known as supercapacitors or ultracapacitors, have applications similar to those of rechargeable batteries, e.g. in electrically powered vehicles.\"\n\n\"PTFE or Teflon is a higher performing and more expensive dielectric than other plastic dielectrics.\"\n\nIf the outer metal shell is grounded, and if the voltage of the LiOD electrolyte is time varying, electrical power will be conveyed through the Electrolytic Capacitor to ground.\n\nHow does McKubre model the electrical power drained away by the action of the Electrolytic Capacitor of the outer stainless steel shell of his cells"}
{"text": "French scientists have transformed the chemical energy generated by photosynthesis into electrical energy. They thus propose a new strategy to convert solar energy into electrical energy in an environmentally-friendly and renewable manner. The biofuel cell thus developed could also have medical applications. These findings have just been published in the journal Analytical Chemistry.\n\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which plants convert solar energy into chemical energy. In the presence of visible light, carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H20) are transformed into glucose and O2 during a complex series of chemical reactions. Researchers at the Centre de Recherche Paul Pascal (CNRS) developed a biofuel cell that functions using the products of photosynthesis (glucose and O2) and is made up of two enzyme-modified electrodes.\n\nThe cell was then inserted in a living plant, in this case a cactus. Once the electrodes, highly sensitive to O2 and glucose, had been implanted in the cactus leaf, the scientists succeeded in monitoring the real-time course of photosynthesis in vivo. They were able to observe an increase in electrical current when a desk lamp was switched on, and a reduction when it was switched off. During these experiments, the scientists were also able to make the first ever observation of the real-time course of glucose levels during photosynthesis. This method could offer a new means of better understanding the mechanisms of photosynthesis.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers showed that a biofuel cell inserted in a cactus leaf could generate power of 9 W per cm2. Because this yield was proportional to light intensity, stronger illumination accelerated the production of glucose and O2 (photosynthesis), so more fuel was available to operate the cell. In the future, this system could ultimately form the basis for a new strategy for the environmentally-friendly and renewable transformation of solar energy into electrical energy.\n\nAlongside these results, the initial objective of this work was to develop a biofuel cell for medical applications. This could then function autonomously under the skin (in vivo), drawing chemical energy from the oxygen-glucose couple that is naturally present in physiological fluids. It could thus provide power for implanted medical devices such as, for example, autonomous subcutaneous sensors to measure glucose levels in diabetic patients.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nLeading experts in photosynthesis research will discuss tomorrow how understanding the fundamental processes that plants use to turn light into energy is a key way of securing cheap, emission-free energy in the future.\n\nNew scientific discoveries are moving society toward the era of \"personalized solar energy,\" in which the focus of electricity production shifts from huge central generating stations to individuals in their ...\n\nScientists at Michigan State University have identified a new protein necessary for chloroplast development.

Indeed, the technology has the potential to provide an energy storage device ten times more powerful than even the latest batteries in hybrid cars -- while outliving the vehicle itself.\n\nThe new technology, developed at MIT's Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems, should improve ultracapacitors, by swapping in carbon nanotubes, thereby greatly increasing the surface area of electrodes and the ability to store energy.\n\nUltracapacitors, a souped-up version of the capacitors widely used in electronics, have been around for decades. They're well-known for being powerful, that is, able to quickly absorb and release electricity. But they can't store much energy, so their stored electricity is depleted in a matter of seconds. As a result, they've been limited to niche applications, such as providing quick bursts of power in some hybrid transit buses.\n\nNow researchers at MIT have found what they believe is a way to improve the endurance of ultracapacitors several-fold -- allowing the devices to retain the power and longevity advantages, while storing about as much energy as the batteries used in hybrids. The amount of energy ultracapacitors can hold is related to the surface area and conductivity of their electrodes. The researchers have increased surface area by \"more than an order of magnitude\" by using carbon nanotubes."}
{"text": "High-efficiency solar cells from III-V compound semiconductors\n\nAbstract Today's most efficient technology for the generation of electricity from solar radiation is the use of multi-junction solar cells made of III-V compound semiconductors. Efficiencies up to 39 % have already been reported under concentrated sunlight. These solar cells have initially been developed for powering satellites in space and are now starting to explore the terrestrial energy market through the use of photovoltaic concentrator systems. This opens a huge potential market for the application of compound semiconductor materials due to the large areas that are necessary to harvest sufficient amounts of energy from the sun. Concentrator systems using III-V solar cells have shown to be ecological and could play an important role for the sustainable energy generation of the future."}
{"text": "A flow battery is a rechargeable fuel cell in which electrolyte containing one or more dissolved electroactive species flows through an electrochemical cell that reversibly converts chemical energy directly to electricity. Additional electrolyte is stored externally, generally in tanks, and is usually pumped through the cell (or cells) of the reactor, although gravity feed systems are also known.[1] Flow batteries can be rapidly \"recharged\" by replacing the electrolyte liquid (in a similar way to refilling fuel tanks for internal combustion engines) while simultaneously recovering the spent material for re-energization.\n\nContents\n\nVarious classes of flow batteries exist including the redox (reduction-oxidation) flow battery, a reversible fuel cell in which all electroactive components are dissolved in the electrolyte. If one or more electroactive components are deposited as a solid layer the system is known as a hybrid flow battery;[2] that is, the electrochemical cell contains one batteryelectrode and one fuel cellelectrode. The main difference between these two types of flow batteries is that the energy of the redox flow battery, as with other fuel cells, is fully decoupled from the power, because the energy is related to the electrolyte volume (tank size) and the power to the electrode area (reactor size). The hybrid flow battery, similar to typical batteries, is limited in energy by the size of the battery electrode (reactor size).\n\nEnergy producing electrochemical cells are generally divided into two categories. Cells that can be discharged only, with irreversible electrochemical reactions, are termed primary cells, while rechargeable cells with reversible reactions are termed secondary cells[3] (see also primary and secondary batteries). Using this historical convention, a redox flow battery is better described as a secondary fuel cell or regenerative fuel cell, with the fundamental difference between batteries and fuel cells being whether energy is stored in a solid state electrode material (batteries) or in the electrolyte (fuel cells). This difference leads to the decoupling of energy and power in a fuel cell described above.\n\nRedox flow batteries, and to a lesser extent hybrid flow batteries, have the advantages of flexible layout (due to separation of the power and energy components), long cycle life (because there are no solid-solid phase transitions), quick response times, no need for \"equalisation\" charging (the over charging of a battery to ensure all cells have an equal charge) and no harmful emissions. Some types also offer easy state-of-charge determination (through voltage dependence on charge), low maintenance and tolerance to overcharge/ overdischarge.\n\nOn the negative side, flow batteries are rather complicated in comparison with standard batteries as they may require pumps, sensors, control units and secondary containment vessels. The energy densities vary considerably but are, in general, rather low compared to portable batteries, such as the Li-ion.\n\nUPS, where the battery is used if the main power fails to provide an uninterrupted supply.\n\npower conversion - because all cells share the same electrolyte/s. Therefore, the electrolyte/s may be charged using a given number of cells and discharged with a different number. Because the voltage of the battery is proportional to the number of cells used the battery can therefore act as a very powerful DC/DC converter. In addition, if the number of cells is continuously changed (on the input and/or output side) power conversion can also be AC/DC, AC/AC, or DC/AC with the frequency limited by that of the switching gear.[11]\n\nElectric vehicles - Because flow batteries can be rapidly \"recharged\" by replacing the electrolyte, they can be used for applications where the vehicle needs to take on energy as fast as a combustion engined vehicle.\n\nStand-alone power system - An example of this is the telecomms industry for use in cellphone base stations where there is no grid power available. The battery can be used alongside a solar or a wind power to compensate for their fluctuating power levels and alongside a generator to make the most efficient use of it to save fuel.[12]"}

{"text": "Recently, Boston College researchers observed the so-called \"hot electron\" effect in a solar cell for the first time, and then harvested the charges with ultra-thin solar cells.\n\nWhat does this mean for you and for me? The short answer is: improved solar panel efficiency.\n\nGenerally speaking, when UV light is captured in solar cells, it generates free electrons in a range of energy states. In order to capture the charges and convert them to renewable electricity, the electrons must reach the bottom of the conduction band. In the past, one of the biggest hurdles has been the fact that the highly energized \"hot\" electrons lose much of their energy to heat along the way.\n\nYou can see hot electrons in devices like semiconductors. Yet, the high kinetic energy can cause the electrons, also known as \"hot carriers,\" to degrade a device. For years, researchers have theorized about the benefits of harnessing hot electrons for solar power through so-called \"3rd generation\" devices.\n\nThin Solar is In\n\nScientists are now using ultra-thing solar cells (less than 30 nanometers thick) in a mechanism that can extract hot electrons before they cool. This may effectively open an \"escape hatch\" through which they typically don't travel.\n\nProfessor of Physics Krzysztof Kempa used the analogy of trying to heat a swimming pool with a pot of boiling water:\n\nDropHe noted:\n\n\"We have shrunk the size of the solar cell by making it thin. In doing so, we are bringing these hot electrons closer to the surface, so they can be collected more readily. These electrons have to be captured in less than a picosecond, which is less than one trillionth of a second.\"\n\nWith ultra-thin solar cells, an overall increase in efficiency of 3% can be expected with absorbers 1/50th as thick as conventional cells! The Boston College research team determined that the gains were the result of capturing hot electrons and an accompanying reduction in voltage-sapping heat. Currently, the film's efficiency is limited by the negligible light collection of ultra-thin junctions. However, by combining the film with new light-trapping technology \u2014 such as nanowire structures \u2013we could significantly increase efficiency in an ultra-thin hot electron solar cell technology"}
{"text": "Stick-on solar cells can go almost anywhere\n\nPosted December 21, 2012 - 07:05 by Ken Kola\n\nStanford engineers have developed new peel-and-stick solar panels that they say can be applied to almost any surface.\n\nUnlike standard thin-film solar cells, they don't require any direct fabrication on the final carrier substrate - a very important development. Thin-film photovoltaic cells are traditionally fixed on rigid silicon and glass substrates, greatly limiting their uses.\n\n\"Nonconventional or 'universal' substrates are difficult to use for photovoltaics because they typically have irregular surfaces and they don't do well with the thermal and chemical processing necessary to produce today's solar cells,\" says assistant professor of mechanical engineering Xiaolin Zheng.\n\n\"We got around these problems by developing this peel-and-stick process, which gives thin-film solar cells flexibility and attachment potential we've never seen before, and also reduces their general cost and weight.\"\n\nThe new process involves a unique silicon, silicon dioxide and metal sandwich. First, a 300-nanometer film of nickel is deposited on a silicon/silicon dioxide (Si/SiO2) wafer, and then thin-film solar cells are deposited on the nickel layer via standard fabrication techniques, and covered with a layer of protective polymer.\n\nA thermal release tape is then attached to the top of the thin-film solar cells to help them transfer off the production wafer and onto a new substrate.\n\nTo peel the solar cell from the wafer, the wafer's\n\nOnce the tape and solar cell are heated to 90\u00b0C for a few seconds, the cell can be applied to virtually any surface using double-sided tape or other adhesive.

And new developments at MIT mean it could happen in the next few years.\n\nEarlier this year, MIT professor Daniel Nocera made a discovery: By dipping a cobalt-and phosphate-coated artificial silicon leaf into a jar of water, he could effectively mimic photosynthesis and create power at an efficiency greater than today's\nsolar panels. Now two separate teams of MIT researchers have figured out how to combine a standard silicon solar cell with Nocera's cobalt phosphate catalyst--meaning a cheap, simple, artificial leaf is one step closer to reality.\n\nIn Nocera's vision of a photosynthesis-mimicking artificial leaf, a water-filled glass container would feature a solar cell with cobalt phosphate catalysts on both sides. The cell would be attached to a divider that separates the container into two sections. Upon exposure to the sun, the catalysts would generate hydrogen and oxygen bubble streams that could be combined to generate electricity.\n\nBoth teams of researchers have managed to produce functioning devices, but there is still plenty of work to be done to make sure that the device could continue performing for longer than a few days:\n\nRajeshwar Krishnan,\nDistinguished University Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the\nUniversity of Texas at Arlington, says it remains to be seen \"whether\nthis 'self-healing' catalyst would hold up to several hours of current\nflow \u2026 under rather harsh oxidative conditions.\" But he adds that these\npapers \"certainly move the science forward.\"\n\nNocera anticipates that the artificial leaf system will be ready in three years.

{"text": "Jun 21, 2011\n\nSolid oxide fuel cells can operate on a wide variety of fuels, and use hydrocarbons gases directly \u2013 without a separate reformer. The fuel cells rely on anodes made from nickel and a ceramic material known as yttria-stabilized zirconia. Until now, however, carbon-containing fuels such as coal gas or propane could quickly deactivate these Ni-YSZ anodes, clogging them with carbon deposits in a process known as \"coking\" \u2013 especially at lower operating temperatures.\n\nTo counter this problem, researchers have developed a technique for growing barium oxide nanostructures on the anodes. The structures adsorb moisture to initiate a water-based chemical reaction that oxidizes the carbon as it forms, keeping the nickel electrode surfaces clean even when carbon-containing fuels are used at low temperatures.\n\n\"This could ultimately be the cleanest, most efficient and cost-effective way of converting coal into electricity,\" said Meilin Liu, a Regents professor in the School of Materials Science and Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. \"And by providing an exhaust stream of pure carbon dioxide, this technique could also facilitate carbon sequestration without the separation and purification steps now required for conventional coal-burning power plants.\"\n\nThe water-mediated carbon removal technique was reported June 21 in the journal Nature Communications. The research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Basic Energy Sciences, through the HeteroFoaM Center, an Energy Frontier Research Center. The work also involved researchers from Brookhaven National Laboratory, the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\n\nConventional coal-fired electric generating facilities capture just a third of the energy available in the fuel they burn. Fuel cells can convert significantly more of the energy, approximately 50 percent. If gas turbines and fuel cells could be combined into hybrid systems, researchers believe they could capture as much as 80 percent of the energy, reducing the amount of coal needed to produce a given amount of energy, potentially cutting carbon emissions.\n\nBut that would only be possible if the fuel cells could run for long periods of time on coal gas, which now deactivates the anodes after as little as 30 minutes of operation.\n\nThe carbon removal system developed by the Georgia Tech-led team uses a vapor deposition process to apply barium oxide nanoparticles to the nickel-YSZ electrode. The particles, which range in size from 10 to 100 nanometers, form \"islands\" on the nickel that do not block the flow of electrons across the electrode surface.\n\nWhen water vapor introduced into the coal gas stream contacts the barium oxide, it is adsorbed and dissociates into protons and hydroxide (OH) ions. The hydroxide ions move to the nickel surface, where they combine with the carbon atoms being deposited there, forming the intermediate COH. The COH then dissociates into carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which are oxidized to power the fuel cell, ultimately producing carbon dioxide and water. About half of the carbon dioxide is then recirculated back to gasify the coal to coal gas to continue the process.\n\n\"We can continuously operate the fuel cell without the problem of carbon deposition,\" said Liu, who is also co-director of Georgia Tech's Center for Innovative Fuel Cell and Battery Technologies.\n\nThe researchers also evaluated the use of propane to power solid oxide fuel cells using the new anode system. Because oxidation of the hydrogen in the propane produces water, no additional water vapor had to be added, and the system operated successfully for a period of time similar to the coal gas system.\n\nSolid oxide fuel cells operate most efficiently at temperatures above 850 degrees Celsius, and much less carbon is deposited at higher temperatures. However, those operating temperatures require fabrication from special materials that are expensive \u2013 and prevent solid oxide fuel cells from being cost-effective for many applications.\n\nReducing the operating temperatures is a research goal, because dropping temperatures to 700 or 750 degrees Celsius would allow the use of much less expensive components for interconnects and other important components. However, until development of the self-cleaning process, reducing the operating temperature meant worsening the coking problem.\n\n\"Reducing the operating temperature significantly by eliminating the problem of carbon deposition could make these solid oxide fuel cells economically competitive,\" Liu said.\n\nFuel cells powered by coal gas still produce carbon dioxide, but in a much purer form than the stack gases leaving traditional coal-fired power plants. That would make capturing the carbon dioxide for sequestration less expensive by eliminating large-scale separation and purification steps, Liu noted.\n\nThe researchers have so far tested their process for a hundred hours, and saw no evidence of carbon build-up. A major challenge ahead is to test the long-term durability of the system for fuel cells that are designed to operate for as long as five years. Researchers must also study the potential impact of possible fuel contaminants on the new electrode.\n\nForming the barium oxide structures can be done as part of conventional anode fabrication processes, and would not require additional steps. The anodes produced in the technique are compatible with standard solid oxide fuel cell systems that are already being developed for commercial electricity generation, home power generation and automotive applications.\n\n\"We have started with state-of-the-art technology, and simply modified the surface of the electrode,\" said Mingfei Liu, a postdoctoral researcher in the Center. \"Because our electrode would be built on existing technology, there is a lower barrier for implementing it in conventional fuel cell systems.\"\n\nRelated Stories A new version of an environmentally friendly, energy efficient technology that could replace combustion engines in cars and batteries in mobile devices such as phones and laptops is being ...\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- A new type of natural-gas electric power plant proposed by MIT researchers could provide electricity with zero carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere, at costs comparable to or less thanA new chemical process for removing unwanted minerals from coal could lead to reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power stations.\nThere is already a way of burning coal in a cleaner, more efficient fasIf this holds up, then diesel electric locomotives can be converted to coal electric locomotives.

{"text": "images\n\nadditional resources\n\nMIT research signals a better way to harness waste heat\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 New MIT research points the way to a technology that might make it possible to harvest much of the wasted heat produced by everything from computer processor chips to car engines to electric powerplants, and turn it into usable electricity.\n\nMore than half of the energy consumed worldwide is wasted, most of it in the form of excess heat. This new technology would allow conversion of waste heat into electricity with an efficiency several times greater than existing devices. That kind of waste-energy harvesting might, for example, lead to cellphones with double the talk time, laptop computers that can operate twice as long before needing to be plugged in, or power plants that put out more electricity for a given amount of fuel.\n\nTheory says that conversion of heat into electricity can never exceed a specific value called the Carnot Limit, based on a 19th-century formula for determining the maximum efficiency that any device can achieve in converting heat into work. But current commercial thermoelectric devices only achieve about one-tenth of that limit, says Peter Hagelstein, associate professor of electrical engineering. In experiments involving a different new technology, thermal diodes, Hagelstein worked with Yan Kucherov, a consultant for the Naval Research Laboratory, and coworkers to demonstrate efficiency as high as 40 percent of the Carnot Limit. The calculations show that this new kind of system could ultimately reach as much as 90 percent of that ceiling.\n\nHow they did it: Hagelstein and his team started from scratch rather than trying to improve the performance of existing devices. They carried out their analysis using a very simple system in which power was generated by a single quantum-dot device \u2014 a type of semiconductor in which the electrons and holes, which carry the electrical charges in the device, are very tightly confined in all three dimensions. By controlling all aspects of the device, they hoped to better understand how to design the ideal thermal-to-electric converter.\n\nHagelstein says that with present systems it's possible to efficiently convert heat into electricity, but with very little power. It's also possible to get plenty of electrical power \u2014 what is known as high-throughput power \u2014 from a less efficient, and therefore larger and more expensive system. \"It's a tradeoff. You either get high efficiency or high throughput,\" says Hagelstein. But the team found that using their new system, it would be possible to get both at once, he says. Next steps: The new technology depends on quantum dot devices, a specialized kind of chip in which charged particles are very narrowly confined to a very small region. Such devices are under development, but still a few years away from commercial availability."}

But it has been hyped so much recently that it is often seen as the answer to all our energy problems so we don't need to worry about potentially catastrophic global oil shortages.\n\nDon't bet on it.\n\nThere are nightmares associated with the acquisition and distribution of hydrogen that could kill this dream in its infancy. Despite the fact that hydrogen is found just about everywhere, it doesn't travel alone. And separating it from other elements, such as oxygen, requires processes that also use energy.\n\nAnd where does that energy normally come from? It is produced by burning fossil fuels \u2014 the stuff we're trying to get away from \u2014 in processes that use more energy than the extracted hydrogen is likely to produce. That's called a net energy loser, and until someone solves that problem hydrogen power isn't going to go anywhere.\n\nWhat If \u2026\n\nYet, there is a glimmer of hope. Researchers around the globe are fine tuning a \"breakthrough,\" if we dare use that overworked word, that came out of Japan a quarter of a century ago. It just may be possible to get all the hydrogen we need by using ordinary sunlight to drive something called \"artificial photosynthesis.\"\n\nKenichi Honda and Akira Fujishima were researching photochemical processes at the University of Tokyo in the late 1960s when they made a remarkable discovery. They hooked an electrode coated with titanium dioxide to another electrode coated with platinum and exposed it to sunlight.\n\nIn a process that is similar to photosynthesis, by which living cells use sunlight to grow, the researchers were able to split water into its two components, hydrogen and oxygen. Honda and Fujishima announced their findings in what has been called a \"milestone paper\" in 1971, for which they recently received the 2004 Japan Prize for their pioneering work.\n\nEver since then scientists and engineers around the world have been trying to build upon that early research and create machines that can carry out artificial photosynthesis and produce hydrogen efficiently enough to make it worth the effort. If we're going to switch to a hydrogen economy we're going to need lots of the stuff, and we can't pave the planet with solar collectors to get it.\n\nIt seems to be one of those situations where all the right pieces are there, but putting them together has been a real challenge.\n\nTitanium dioxide, for example, is readily available. It's probably in the toothpaste you used this morning. It's found in beach sand, and certain rocks, and it's widely used as a whitening agent in everything from paint to cosmetics.\n\nAnd of course there's no shortage of water. So all you need is sunshine, and where can you find a lot of that? How about Australia?"}

Well, sort of - in 1930, Einstein and his former student Leo Szilard designed a refrigerator that required no electricity and had no moving parts. However, as refrigerator technology became more efficient, Einstein's design was nearly forgotten.\n\nNow, Malcolm McCulloch, an electrical engineer at Oxford, is trying to bring Einstein's refrigerator back. McCulloch explains that the design is environmentally friendly and could prove especially useful in developing countries, where demand for cooling appliances is quickly increasing.\n\nMcCulloch's team has recently built a prototype of Einstein and Szilard's refrigerator. Instead of compressing man-made greenhouse gases called freons, as typical refrigerators do, the prototype uses pressurized gas to keep items cold. The refrigerator just requires a way to heat the liquids, and McCulloch has been working on developing a solar energy system to meet this requirement.\n\nThe refrigerator is based on the idea that liquids boil at low temperatures when the surrounding air pressure is low.\n\n\"If you go to the top of Mount Everest, water boils at a much lower temperature than it does when you\u00b4re at sea level, and that\u00b4s because the pressure is much lower up there,\" McCulloch said.\n\nIn their refrigerator prototype, the scientists filled a flask with liquid butane (which is also commonly sold as a liquid in cigarette lighters and as a gas for cooking). Then the scientists introduced a new vapor to decrease the air pressure, which decreases the liquid boiling temperature, causing the butane to boil. As the butane boils, it takes energy from the surroundings, and lowers the temperature inside the refrigerator.\n\nAlthough Einstein and Szilard\u00b4s original design was not as efficient as the freon refrigerators that replaced them, McCulloch plans to improve the design by using different kinds of gases. He predicts these improvements could quadruple the refrigerator\u00b4s efficiency.\n\nThe fact that the refrigerator has no moving parts could also be advantageous, he explains, as it would require minimal maintenance and so could be particularly useful in rural areas.\n\nMcCulloch emphasizes that the refrigerator is still just a prototype, but he hopes to one day commercialize it. The work is part of his team's three-year project to develop robust appliances that can be used in locations without electricityCheck out this article about the Zeer_Pot - an invention by Mohammed Bah Abba, a teacher from Nigeria. It keeps food fresh without electricity, using wet sand and evaporative cooling: \n\nThis is similar to the gas adsorption refrigerator. These use ammonia, water and hydrogen. It seems the Einstein version replaces the hydrogen with butane. In either case, the partial pressure of hydrogen is much higher on the evaporator side than the condensor side. This reduces the partial pressure of ammonia, causing it to boil. The key to the operation is the hydrogen (or butane) is not soluable in water, so it can't cross a water trap boundary. Here's a link that explains all this:\n\n\nI have done a lot of research on this topic; the Einstein cycle is scientifically different from the adsorption cycle. The Einstein cycle uses the ammonia to make the butane evaporate, and condense due to partial pressure. This is the complete opposite of the adsorption cycle. The Einstein cycle is reversible like the compression cycle ware the adsorption cycle is not"}

The heat produced by the combustion will then push electrons along the tube, creating an electrical current.\n\n\"The energy produced by this novel system puts out energy, in proportion to its weight, which is about 100 times greater than an equivalent weight of a lithium-ion battery. (Strano said) the phenomenon \"\u2026opens up a new area of energy research, which is rare.\"\n\nDitto\n\nBecause this is such a new discovery, Stano said in an MIT press release, it's hard to predict exactly what the practical applications will be. But he suggested that one possible application would be in enabling new kinds of ultra-small electronic devices\u2014for example, devices the size of grains of rice, perhaps with sensors or treatment devices that could be injected into the body.

Compared to many other methods of storing energy, especially fossil fuels, batteries aren't very energy dense\u2014that is, a 1-pound battery stores far less energy than is contained in a pound of gasoline. That wouldn't be so bad if the energy in a battery were easy to replenish\u2014your Tesla might still go only a couple hundred miles on a single charge, but if you could fully recharge it in five minutes rather than several hours, the low capacity wouldn't bother you as much.\n\nScientists have spent decades trying to create the perfect battery\u2014a battery with great energy density or, at least, one that doesn't take so long to charge. If we could somehow make this perfect battery, pretty much every gadget you use, from your phone to your laptop to your future electric car, would be amazing, or just less annoying than they are today. The perfect battery might also help with some other important stuff: climate change, oil wars, pollution, etc.\n\nOne approach for improving the battery is to forget about the battery and instead improve capacitors. A capacitor, like a battery, is a device that stores electrical energy. But capacitors charge and discharge their energy an order of magnitude faster than batteries. So if your phone contained a capacitor rather than a battery, you'd charge it up in a few seconds rather than an hour. But capacitors have a big downside\u2014they're even less energy dense than batteries. You can't run a phone off a capacitor unless you wanted a phone bigger than a breadbox. But what if you could make a dense capacitor, one that stored a lot of energy but also charged and discharged very quickly? Over the past few years, researchers at several companies and institutions around the world have been racing to do just that.\n\nThey're in hot pursuit of the perfect \"supercapacitor,\" a kind of capacitor that stores energy using carbon electrodes that are immersed in an electrolyte solution. Until recently, though, supercapacitors have been expensive to produce, and their energy densities have fallen far short of what's theoretically possible. One of the most promising ways of creating supercaps uses graphene\u2014a much-celebrated substance composed of a one-atom layer of carbon\u2014but producing graphene cheaply at scale has proved elusive.\n\nThen something unexpectedly amazing happened. Maher El-Kady, a graduate student in chemist Richard Kaner's lab at UCLA, wondered what would happen if he placed a sheet of graphite oxide\u2014an abundant carbon compound\u2014under a laser. And not just any laser, but a really inexpensive one, something that millions of people around the world already have\u2014a DVD burner containing a technology called LightScribe, which is used for etching labels and designs on your mixtapes. As El-Kady, Kamer, and their colleagues described in a paper published last year in Science, the simple trick produced very high-quality sheets of graphene, very quickly, and at low cost. (via Graphene supercapacitors: Small, cheap, energy-dense replacements for batteries. - Slate Magazine)\n\nMetabolic pathways are extremely complex, but here I will give a snapshot of a cross section of the pathway for Vitamin B12. At the center of the molecule there is a cobalt atom which is first converted to Co3+ and then to Co+ by flavoprotein reductase enzymes. Co+ is a very strong nucleophile: read, it has a very strong attraction for positive charges. It thus attacks the number five carbon on ATP causing a reaction which forms 5'-deoxyadenosyl-cobalamin. This active form of the vitamin can be used in other metabolic pathways for a plethora of things.\n\nIt should be noted that Vitamin B12 does not occur commonly in nature but can be converted through the above pathway into an active molecule which can then be run through other metabolic pathways to be used in biological systems.\n\nThe standard model describes all of the known particles of matter and how they are affected by 3 particular forces (I will explain these 3 forces later). To start, I'm going to assume that I have to explain everything from scratch so sorry if you already know\u2026\n\nOkay. Today is one of the really rare days when I'm going to talk about my country's own history and politics.\n\nThe Gwangju massacre, also known as the Gwangju uprising or Gwangju democratization movement, was an event where citizens rose up against Chun Doo Hwan's dictatorship and took control of the city. This was later crushed by the South Korean army, leading to massive civilian deaths. This damaged Chun Doo Hwan's popularity and ultimately led to other democratization movements in June, which later overthrew the government.\n\nI'd like to say that this is what people like Hyosung are making fun of when they say shit like \"democratization\" in the wrong context.\n\nI'd like to say that this is a traumatic event still for Koreans from Gwangju even to today, and that today, the current politician, Park Geun Hye, refused a song called \"\uc784\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud589\uc9c4\uace1\" which is a song that symbolizes the movement, to be played at the memorial."}

The computing power, as well as the multi-purpose abilities of modern-day phones is nothing short of amazing.

Sony has just come up with a battery that does the same thing: feed it shredded paper or cardboard, and it produces enough electricity to run an MP3 player.\n\nWhat Sony has come up with (actually, they've been refining it for years now) is a thin sheet of material called a \"bio-battery.\" The basic design uses an enzyme to break down sugar and turn it into hydrogen ions and electrons, creating an electric current and water. Bio-batteries like these can run on all kinds of things, from soda to fruit juice, but the problem is that all of these sugary liquids are just so tasty, and given the choice, most people can't help just drinking their battery power and not powering their batteries with it.\n\nOkay, so yeah, that's not the problem at all.\n\nStill, it would be a lot more useful to power a battery with something that's not as tasty or useful as fruit juice, which is why Sony has added another enzyme into the mix that can break down cellulose into sugar. Cellulose is made of long chains of glucose (sugar), and it forms the cell walls of most green plants. Cardboard and paper are both made of cellulose, but breaking those glucose chains down into usable bits is tough to do. The human digestion can't do it, but termites can, and so can Sony's pet enzymes.\n\nAll it takes to power this bio-battery, then, is a bunch of chopped up cardboard immersed in a solution of water and different types of enzymes. The first enzyme breaks the cellulose in the cardboard into glucose, which the second enzyme then eats to produce electricity. It's basically a little digestive tract that eats used paper products and poops out electrons and water, without relying on any heavy metals or chemicals or anything.

{"text": "Closed loop thermochemical energy storage system using ammonia\n\nIf solar energy is to become a major contributor to our energy supply, means to store it have to be found. One promising method is \"closed loop thermochemical energy storage using ammonia\".\n\nIn this system, ammonia (NH3) is dissociated in an energy storing (endothermic) chemical reactor as it absorbs solar thermal energy. At a later time and place, the reaction products hydrogen (H2) and nitrogen (N2) react in an energy releasing (exothermic) reactor to resynthesise ammonia.\n\n2 NH3< + head N2 + 3 H2\n\nA fixed amount of reactants (ammonia, nitrogen and hydrogen) are contained in a closed loop, and pass alternately between energy storing and energy releasing reactors with provision for storage of reactants in between. Because the solar energy is stored in a chemical form at ambient temperature, there are zero energy losses in the store regardless of the length of time that the reactants remain in storage. The reactors are packed with standard commercial catalyst materials to promote both reactions. Counter-flow heat exchangers transfer heat between in-going and out-going reactants at each reactor to use the energy most effectively.\n\nFeeding the reactors with pure reactants is possible through the natural separation of reactants and products in the storage system: at the pressures applied, ammonia condenses.\n\nBy ensuring that the stuff leaving each reactor transfers its own thermal energy (sensible heat) to the stuff going in \u2013 using heat exchangers \u2013 most of the solar energy is stored in the change in composition of the chemicals which are kept at ambient temperature.\n\nAdvantages\n\nApart from the ability of the ammonia system to allow for continuous energy supply on a 24-hour basis, other advantages, that are not necessarily shared by other solar thermochemical or photochemical systems, make this process unique:\n\nA high energy storage density, by volume and mass.\nThe reactions are easy to control and to reverse and there are no unwanted side reactions.\n\nAll constituents involved are environmentally benign.\nThere exists a history of industrial application with the associated available expertise and hardware.\n\nA readily achievable turning temperature of 400 \u00b0C to 500 \u00b0C (depending on the pressure). This helps to reduce thermal losses from dish receivers, avoids some high temperature materials limitations, and allows lower quality (and hence cheaper) dish optics to be used.\n\nAll reactants for transport and handling are in the fluid phase, which provides a convenient means of energy transport without thermal loss. This is an important point, particularly if large arrays of paraboloidal dishes are being considered as the method for solar energy collection.\n\nAt ambient temperature the ammonia component of reactant mixtures condenses to form a liquid, whilst the nitrogen and hydrogen remains as a gas. This means that only one storage vessel is required for reactants and products.\n\nProduction of ammonia is one of the world's largest chemical process industries, with in excess of 100 million tonnes produced annually and about 90,500 tonnes produced in Australia in 2004, the bulk of which is used for fertilizers (~90%). The industry has a 100 year history of operation."}
{"text": "Self-Charging Power Cell Stores What it Generates\n\nFor most energy systems currently in use, the energy is generated in by one device and stored by another, like a solar cell and a battery. While this approach has worked well for a very long time, requiring two separate systems can increase the size and complexity of devices. Now researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have created a hybrid energy device that generates and stores electrical energy on its own.\n\nBatteries store energy by creating ions at the electrodes. At the anode the ions are negatively charged, while the cathode has positively charged ions. This charge differential makes the electrons want to flow from the anode to the cathode, as soon as there is an electrical connection. (There is also a salt bridge that connects the solutions the anode and cathode are in, to maintain equilibrium between the solutions.) In the hybrid cell the researchers made, a piezoelectric membrane creates an electric field which drives lithium ions toward the anode, to create the differential and chemically store the energy. Piezoelectric materials connect electrical and mechanical forces, so physically deforming the membrane, by stepping on it for example, will charge the cell.\n\nCurrently the hybrid cells the researchers built have a storage capacity of just 0.036 millamp-hours, which is not very much, but it can be, the researchers theorize, five times more efficient than modern methods of converting mechanical energy to chemical energy that require two devices. The researchers believe they can increase the efficiency even more though by replacing the steel shell currently used with something that absorbs less mechanical energy."}

{"text": "Semiconductor uses solar power to take H2 from water\n\nIn what is being touted as ''artificial photosynthesis,'' researchers at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) have devised a technique for coating a cuprous oxide semiconductor so that it can use energy from the sun to take hydrogen from water.\n\nAdriana Paracchino and Elijah Thimsen have engineered photoelectrochemical cells that, when exposed to sunlight, can provide the current needed to drive the chemical reactions that separate hydrogen gas (H2) from water.\n\nAt the simplest level, imagine a piece of something, say a spoon, in a glass of water out in the sun. The idea is that the sunlight will hit the spoon which will in turn cause a reaction so that the water molecules will be split, producing hydrogen (H2 gas, a useful way to store energy that can easily be used as fuel) and oxygen.\n\nBut of course in real life it isn't that simple. That hypothetical illustration will, in reality, just cause the water to evaporate.\n\nSo the ''spoon'' needs to be a special spoon that can use energy from the sun that will, instead of making the water molecules evaporate, make the water molecules split - that is, undergo a chemical reaction. This chemical reaction can be achieved using an electric current.\n\nCuprous oxide (Cu2O), can be used to make that special spoon. It is commonly used in paint and fungicide, and is one of the most studied semiconductors around. It has been known to be photosensitive since 1904. It is also inexpensive and abundant, perfect for a potential silver bullet (errr- silver spoon) for the energy crisis.\n\nHowever, when Cu2O isexposed to water and light, it breaks down and loses it's ability to act as the magic spoon. So Paracchino and Thimsen covered Cu2O with atom-thin layers of zinc oxide and titanium oxide using a technique called atomic layer deposition (ALD) that is commonly used for making memory chips for laptop computers and other electronic devices.\n\nWith the protective layer in place, the Cu2O can harness solar energy and convert it to an electric current that can drive the chemical reactions to make H2 separate from water.\n\nPretty cool. The research ''Highly active oxide photocathode for photoelectrochemical water reduction'' is published in the May issue of Nature Materials. News report interpreting the paper say that the next step is to improve the the electrical properties of the protective layer. They also note that the materials used are widely available and the techniques can easily be scaled up for mass production.\n\nIf this alternative energy technology can be made to work on a large scale soon, it could be the answer to the nuclear energy dilemma"}
{"text": "Progress toward Artificial Photosynthesis?\n\nMar 09, 2007 just like that.\n\nA team headed by Markus Antonietti at the Max Planck Institute for Colloids and Interfaces has now taken an important step toward this goal. As described in the journal Angewandte Chemie, they have successfully activated CO2 for use in a chemical reaction by using a special new type of metal-free catalyst: graphitic carbon nitride.\n\n\"Chemical activation of carbon dioxide, meaning its cleavage in a chemical reaction,\" explain chemists Goettmann, Thomas and Antonietti, \" is one of the biggest challenges in synthetic chemistry.\" The bonds in this molecule are very stable, so a lot of energy is needed to split them. To date, only a few special metal catalysts are known to be capable of breaking the C\u2013O bonds in CO2.\n\nIn contrast to most previous approaches, Antonietti's team worked with metal-free catalysts, turning toward plants for inspiration. Photosynthesis in modern green plants involves an important intermediate step: the bonding of CO2 to nitrogen atoms to form carbamates.\n\nThe German researchers thus also experimented with nitrogen-rich catalysts with structures that allow them to form carbamates. Their new class of catalysts is made of flat, graphite-like layers. The individual layers consist of ring systems involving carbon and nitrogen atoms. This porous material, called graphitic carbon nitride, is very heat-stable and, although it enters into many chemical interactions, it is so stable that it nearly always re-forms\u2014an\n\nFrom a purely formal point of view, this reaction cleaves the CO2 into an oxygen diradical and CO. However, like photosynthesis, the reaction seems to occur by way of carbamates: In the first step, CO2 binds to individual free amino groups present in the carbon nitride. It then oxidizes the benzene to phenol, and in the end the highly desirable CO separates from the catalyst. \"This could make novel, previously unknown chemistry of CO2 accessible,\" hopes Antonietti. \"It may even be the first step in artificial photosynthesis.\"\n\nRelevant PhysicsForums posts\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Global production of phosphorus fertiliser could peak and decline later this century, causing shortages and price spikes that jeopardise world food production, five major scientific societies warn today (March"}

More particularly, an aspect of an embodiment of the\ninvention relates to use of solar receivers focusing solar power on a\nunit containing a chemical reactor to heat gas up to temperatures such,\nas 1500 degrees Celsius or lower as an upper temperature limit, in order\nto form a hydrocarbon fuel, such as methanol, and possibly drive a\nBrayton turbine engine.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0004]Carbon dioxide may be put to use in beneficial applications such as\ngeneration of a hydrocarbon fuel including methanol and gasoline.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0005]In general, various methods, apparatuses, and systems are described\nto use products from a solar assisted Reverse-water-gas-shift reaction\n(RWGS) the hydrogen molecules from the water splitter or\nthe RWGS reaction and the resultant stabilized carbon monoxide molecules\nfrom the RWGS reaction in the hydrocarbon fuel synthesis process to\ncreate a liquid hydrocarbon fuel.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0006]The drawings refer to embodiments of the invention in which:\n\n[0007]FIG. 1 illustrates an embodiment of a solar assisted process to\ncreate a liquid fuel;\n\n[0013]While the invention is subject to various modifications and\nalternative forms, specific embodiments thereof have been shown by way of\nexample in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. The\ninvention should be understood to not be limited to the particular forms\ndisclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all\nmodifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit\nand scope of the invention.\n\nDETAILED DISCUSSION\n\n[0014]In the following description, numerous specific details are set\nforth, such as examples of named components, connections, types of\ncatalyst, etc., in order to provide a thorough understanding of the\npresent invention. It will be apparent, however, to one of ordinary skill\nin the art that the present invention may be practiced without these\nspecific details. In other instances, well known components or methods\nhave not been described in detail but rather in a block diagram in order\nto avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention. Further specific\nnumeric references such as first portion of gas, may be made. However,\nthe specific numeric reference should not be interpreted as a literal\nsequential order but rather interpreted that the first portion of gas is\ndifferent than a second portion of gas. Thus, the specific details set\nforth are merely exemplary. The specific details may be varied from and\nstill be contemplated to be within the spirit and scope of the present\ninvention.\n\n[0015]In general, a method, apparatus, and system are described in which\nproducts from a solar assisted reverse-water-gas-shift reaction are used\nin a hydrocarbon fuel synthesis process to create a liquid hydrocarbon\nfuel. An array of heliostats focuses solar energy to a\nsolar-energy-to-gas-heat-exchanger to heat the carbon dioxide gas. A\nwater splitter with one or more electrolysis cells splits water molecules\ninto hydrogen molecules and oxygen molecules via the addition of the\nsolar energy also directed from either 1) the same array of heliostats\nvia a beam splitter off a common receiving tower redirecting a portion of\nthe electromagnetic spectrum, 2) a separate heliostat field dedicated for\nthe water splitter, or 3) from its own parabolic trough. A chemical\nreactor chamber mixes the heated carbon dioxide gas with all or just a\nportion of the hydrogen molecules generated from the water splitter in a\nreverse-water-gas-shift reaction to produce resultant carbon monoxide. A\nhydrocarbon liquid fuel synthesis reactor receives and uses the hydrogen\nmolecules and the resultant stabilized carbon monoxide molecules from the\nreverse-water-gas-shift reaction in the hydrocarbon fuel synthesis\nprocess to create a liquid hydrocarbon fuel.\n\n[0016]Essentially, two main embodiments, as well as a couple of other\nembodiments, are described.\n\n[0017]The first solar assisted embodiment has all of the moles of hydrogen\ngenerated from the water splitter being heated up and run through the\nreverse water gas shift reaction. The heated hydrogen gas, carbon dioxide\ngas, and resultant carbon monoxide will then be cooled by exchanging\ntheir energy to preheat the feed gases. The unconsumed hydrogen from the\nRWGS is routed in whole to the fuel synthesis process and during the\nrouting is used in a recuperator to preheat new feed gases for the RWGS\nreaction.\n\n[0018]The second solar assisted embodiment merely heats up a portion of\nthe moles of hydrogen generated from the water splitter and then sends\nthe other portion of the non-superheated moles of hydrogen to the fuel\nsynthesis process. The unconsumed hydrogen from the RWGS along with any\nunconsumed carbon dioxide may be recycled back into the RWGS to preheat\nnew feed gases for the RWGS reaction. Therefore, merely the heated carbon\nmonoxide from the RWGS needs to be cooled enough to be sent to the fuel\nsynthesis process while the non-superheated moles of hydrogen may already\nbe close to the right temperature.\n\n[0019]In both of these embodiments, more moles of hydrogen are supplied to\nthe RWGS reaction than is needed for equilibrium in order to overdrive\nthe reaction to maximize the carbon monoxide production. In both of these\nembodiments, a variety of solar receivers can be used to direct the solar\nenergy and a variety of electrolysis cells may be used to generate\nhydrogen. In both embodiments, a small percentage of the carbon dioxide\nmay be sent along with the carbon monoxide and hydrogen to the fuel\nsynthesis process. The small percentage, such as between 0.1% to 3% by\nvolume of carbon dioxide, helps the fuel synthesis process.\n\n[0020]Thus, the water splitting process and the reverse-water-gas-shift\nreaction process produce synthesis gas (a gas combination including\ncarbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2)) via the addition of solar energy.\nThe resultant synthesis gas from the RWGS reaction may be used to create\nany number of hydrocarbon liquid fuels, such as methanol, ethanol, diesel\nfuel, gasoline and crude oil.\n\n[0021]The Sun's energy may be concentrated by solar receivers, via one or\nmore arrays of heliostats, a parabolic trough or dish, etc., to provide\nthe energy needed for the chemical transformations to occur in the RWGS\nunit and be concentrated via one of the three example methods above for\nthe H2O splitting process. The Sun's energy may be also coupled to a\nprocess for driving a Brayton turbine engine or photovoltaic solar cells\nfor generating electricity.\n\nOperation of the Reactor\n\n[0022]FIG. 1 illustrates solar assisted processes of water splitting and a\nRWGS reaction to supply a synthesis gas to a liquid fuel synthesis\nprocess to create a liquid fuel. Water is supplied to a water (H2O)\nsplitter 02 that uses the energy of the sun to disassociate the H2O into\nH2 and O2 molecules. The produced hydrogen gas is supplied to the RWGS\nunit 04. The RWGS unit 04 also receives a supply of carbon dioxide (CO2).\nThe RWGS unit 04 heats both the hydrogen and carbon dioxide with the\nenergy of the Sun and then uses the heated gases in a RWGS reaction to\nproduce synthesis gas. The synthesis gas from the RWGS reaction may be\nused in a recuperator 05 to preheat the incoming feed gases of hydrogen\nand carbon dioxide. The synthesis gas is supplied to a liquid fuel\nsynthesizer 08. The liquid fuel synthesizer 08 converts the synthesis gas\nto liquid fuel. The liquid fuel synthesizer 08 may produce fuel and have\nleft over carbon dioxide, and any imbalance of carbon monoxide or\nhydrogen left from the synthesis process. All three of these gases can be\nrecycled back to the CO2 recirculation point back into the RWGS unit 04.\n\n[0024]Referring to FIG. 1a, a water splitter 102a that uses one or more\nelectrolysis cells 180, including photoelectrolysis cells, high\ntemperature electrolysis cells, and similar cells, can be used to supply\nhydrogen gas into a unit 104 that generates synthesis gas for a fuel\nproduction unit 108 to generate a hydrocarbon liquid fuel, such as\nmethanol.\n\n[0025]The RWGS unit 104 may also contain sections such as a\nsolar-energy-to-gas-heat-exchanger 122, a chemical reactor 106a, a H2 gas\nsupply line 124, which can be supplied by the water splitter or other H2\nsources, the carbon dioxide gas supply line 126, and other gas supply\nlines 128, a quenching unit 130, a heat recuperator 105a, and other\nsimilar components. This solar assisted embodiment may have substantially\nall of the moles of hydrogen generated from the water splitter 102a being\nheated up and run through the RWGS reaction in the chemical reaction\nchamber 106a.\n\n[0026]Referring to FIG. 1b, the unit 104 may also include a H2\nrecirculation loop 110, a carbon monoxide (CO) recirculation loop 112,\nand a carbon dioxide recirculation loop 114 and could be either discrete\nloops or combined. The RWGS unit 104 may also contain sections such as a\nwater condenser/separator 120, and other similar components. The Sun's\nenergy may also be stored within the RWGS unit 104 in a storage unit 116\nfor continued operations at night, or may be stored directly in a solar\nreceiver. The RWGS unit 104 may also have an alternative supply of energy\n118 for supplemental power or primary power in times of inadequate solar\npower or maintenance. This solar assisted embodiment may merely heat up a\nportion of the moles of hydrogen generated from the water splitter 102b\nin the RWGS reaction and send the remaining portion of the\nnon-superheated moles directly to the fuel synthesis process 108.\n\n[0027]In both of these solar assisted embodiments, more moles of hydrogen\nare supplied to the RWGS reaction than needed for equilibrium in order to\noverdrive the reaction to maximize the carbon monoxide production.\n\n[0028]The Chemical Operation may be Summed:\n\n[0029]1. Water (H2O) is split into Hydrogen (H2) molecules and Oxygen (O2)\nmolecules (2 H2O+energy\u2192H2+O2) via the addition of solar power in\ncombination with standard H2O cleaving techniques, water splitting with a\nTitanium based alloy, high temperature electrolysis, or other similar\ntechniques. The water splitter 102 may be a tower mounted device that\ncontains clear tubes, such as quartz or borosilicate, that are filled\nwith water in the form of gas or liquid reacting with the titanium.\nAnother example form the water splitter 102 may take is a parabolic\ntrough system.\n\n[0030]2. The carbon dioxide gas is heated by the solar receivers, such as\nheliostats 134, directing the rays of the Sun to the\nsolar-energy-to-gas-heat-exchanger 122 to a steady state temperature\nbetween 200-1000 degrees Celsius as the gas exits the heat exchanger area\n122. Complete conversion of carbon dioxide may occur around 900 degrees\nCelsius without a catalyst. The hot carbon dioxide gas is mixed with the\nother gases for the reverse-water-gas-shift reaction. However, in an\nembodiment, the carbon dioxide is heated by the Sun to the steady state\ntemperature at the same time while the hydrogen is being heated up. A\ntemperature, such as 1500 degrees Celsius (C.) or lower, may be\nestablished as an upper temperature limit for the reverse-water-gas-shift\nreaction. Also, both the carbon dioxide gas, from the CO2 supply 126 in a\nfirst outer pipe 176, and the feed hydrogen gas, from the H2 supply 124\nin a second outer pipe 175, may be additionally pre-heated using the\nenergy of the recycled gases and/or waste gases exiting the RWGS reactor\n106 in one or more inner pipes 170 located in the recuperator 105.\n\n[0031]3. Next, the solar-assisted endothermic RWGS produces the resultant\ncarbon monoxide molecules for the synthesis gas. The heated carbon\ndioxide and hydrogen mixture may be supplied to a Nickel alloy RWGS\nreactor 106, such as an Inconel 600\u00ae reactor, Ni/Al2O3 reactor, etc.\nIn the RWGS reaction, the heated CO2, from step 2 above, is combined with\nthe hydrogen molecules, from step 1 above, in a ratio such as one mole of\ncarbon dioxide per three moles of hydrogen, in potentially the presence\nof a catalyst, plus the heat from the Sun to yield in the reaction at\nleast produced carbon monoxide plus water plus unconsumed two moles of\nhydrogen. The flow rate of each gas, hydrogen and heated carbon dioxide,\nmay be controlled to maximize the yield of carbon monoxide produced based\nupon the supplied hydrogen.\n\n[0032]4. A portion of the exit gases from the RWGS reactor chamber may\nthen be immediately cooled/quenched by the quencher 130 to stabilize or\notherwise capture at least the carbon monoxide molecule. The resultant\ncarbon monoxide plus 1) the unconsumed hydrogen molecules from the RWGS\nreaction or 2) the non-superheated hydrogen supplied directly from the\nwater splitter 102 are used in the methanol synthesis step (5) below.\nReferring to FIG. 1b, 2/3rds of the hydrogen generated is supplied\ndirectly from the water splitter 102b to the fuel production unit 108\nwhile the other portion of the hydrogen, such as the remaining third, is\nmainly consumed in the RWGS reaction in reactor 106b and any unconsumed\nhydrogen is recycled back into the RWGS synthesis gas production of step\n3. Accordingly, the heated carbon dioxide gas and hydrogen gas would be\nseparated from the resultant carbon monoxide and water.\n\n[0033]In an embodiment, substantially all of the moles of hydrogen\nmolecules 1) generated from the water splitter 102a and 2) passed through\nthe chemical reactor chamber 106a, which are not consumed in the reverse\nwater gas shift reaction are sent with the resultant carbon monoxide from\nthe reverse water gas shift reaction and between 0.1% to 3% by volume of\ncarbon dioxide in the inner pipe 170 to the hydrocarbon fuel synthesis\n108 process to create the liquid hydrocarbon fuel.\n\n[0034]5. Thru standard chemical processes, either on-site or off-site,\nhydrocarbon fuel synthesis occurs. A properly blended form of synthesis\ngas that includes (at least two moles of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and\ncarbon dioxide) reacts with a catalyst to yield >CH3OH \u0394rH\n(methanol)+heat, or another desired hydrocarbon fuel.\n\n[0036]Referring to FIG. 1a, as discussed in step 4, there can be three\nmoles of hydrogen for every one mole of carbon dioxide initially, and\nthen one mole of hydrogen is compromised to make carbon monoxide.\nHowever, all three moles of hydrogen may be mixed with or heated by waste\ncarbon dioxide gas before doing the RWGS. The elevated temperature makes\nit easier to move the reaction toward completion. Accordingly, as\ndiscussed in step 2, the recuperator 105a plumbs pipes to the feed gases\ninput ports 124, 126 and exhaust gases output ports from the quencher\n130. The recuperator 105a passes the exhaust gases from the chemical\nreaction chamber 106a in an inner pipe 170 in order to pre-heat the feed\ncarbon dioxide and hydrogen gases passed through a larger outer pipe\ncarrying the feed carbon dioxide and hydrogen gases. The pipes 175 and\n176 for the feed carbon dioxide and hydrogen gases may be combined or\nkept separate during this pre-heating process.\n\n[0038]Similarly, the recuperator 105a cools the unconsumed portions of the\ncarbon dioxide gas and the hydrogen molecules from the reverse water gas\nshift reaction and the resultant carbon monoxide and water molecules to\npreheat at least the hydrogen molecules from the water splitter and the\nfeed carbon dioxide.\n\n[0039]The cooled hydrogen molecules, the carbon monoxide, and a small\npercentage of the carbon dioxide from the reverse water gas shift\nreaction are sent to the hydrocarbon fuel synthesis process to create a\nliquid hydrocarbon fuel.\n\n[0040]Gas flow in the recuperator 105a is in the direction of the\ntemperature gradient of the heat-exchanging surface. This minimizes\nentropy production in the process. Thus, the feed gas flow starts flowing\nalong the inner pipe at its relative lowest temperature area and flows\nalong the inner pipe 170 to the recuperator's 105a relative highest\ntemperature area. Filters in the recuperator 105a remove a portion of the\ncarbon dioxide once it has given up a majority of its heat to the feed\ngases. The condenser 120 couples to the recuperator 105a at its cooler\nend portion to remove the water gases from the produced synthesis gas.\nAlso, the filtered out carbon dioxide can be recycled back in with new\nfeed carbon dioxide feed gas 126.\n\n[0041]Thus, the reverse water gas shift reaction can be driven to maximize\nproduction of carbon monoxide for a subsequent exothermic reaction in the\ngeneration of methanol as the hydrocarbon fuel, by, supplying at least\nfifty percent more moles of heated hydrogen molecules relative to an\namount of carbon dioxide present in the chemical reactor chamber 106 than\nnecessary to achieve equilibrium in the reverse water gas shift reaction\nto force maximum production of the resultant carbon monoxide.\n\n[0042]Referring to FIG. 1b, as discussed in step 4, the chemical reactor\nchamber 106b mixes the heated carbon dioxide gas with a first portion of\nthe hydrogen molecules from the water splitter 102b in the form of gas in\nthe reverse water gas shift reaction in order to produce resultant carbon\nmonoxide and water molecules. One or more filters 127 then separate out\nthe heated unconsumed carbon dioxide gas and hydrogen gas from the\nresultant carbon monoxide and water produced in the reverse water gas\nshift reaction. One or more recycle pipes 110, 112, 114 recycle both the\nseparated out carbon dioxide back to the\nsolar-energy-to-gas-heat-exchanger area 122 and recycle at least a\nportion of the separated out hydrogen gas back to the into the\nhydrogen-carbon dioxide mixing area.\n\n[0043]Thus, the reverse water gas shift reaction is driven to maximize\nproduction of carbon monoxide for the subsequent exothermic reaction in\nthe generation of the hydrocarbon fuel, including methanol, by\noverloading an initial amount of hydrogen molecules relative to an amount\nof carbon dioxide present in the chemical reactor chamber during the\nreverse water gas shift reaction. The excess hydrogen from the initial\nbatch (and subsequent batches) is both continuously recycled to 1)\npreheat incoming feed gases as well as 2) ensure that RWGS reaction is\noverdriven with hydrogen molecules. However, in this embodiment, the\nremainder of the hydrogen produced from the water splitter 102b is sent\ndirectly to the fuel production 108 eliminating a need to cool the\nhydrogen gas for the fuel synthesis process.\n\n[0044]The quenching unit 130 immediately cools at least a portion of exit\ngases from the chemical reactor chamber 106 in which the\nreverse-water-gas-shift reaction occurs, in order to stabilize at least\nthe carbon monoxide molecule and potentially the carbon monoxide\nmolecules in the exit gases. In an embodiment, the quenching unit 130 is\na heat exchanger placed immediately downstream of the chemical reactor\n106 to cool the gas below degrees 700 Celsius, where radicals involved in\nthe back reaction are favored, and the heat exchanger moves the resultant\ncarbon monoxide away from a catalyst located in the chemical reactor 106,\nwhich then also raises an activation energy of the carbon monoxide to\nrevert back to carbon dioxide.\n\n[0045]The RWGS unit 104 has a gas supply output to supply at least the\nresultant stabilized carbon monoxide molecules from the\nreverse-water-gas-shift reaction to a hydrocarbon liquid fuel synthesis\nreactor 108. The hydrocarbon liquid fuel synthesis reactor 108 also\nreceives and uses a second portion of the hydrogen molecules from the\nwater splitter 102 and the resultant stabilized carbon monoxide molecules\nfrom the reverse-water-gas-shift reaction in the hydrocarbon fuel\nsynthesis process to create the liquid hydrocarbon fuel. For example, a\nmethanol synthesis reactor may mix a second portion of the hydrogen\nmolecules from the water splitter and the resultant stabilized carbon\nmonoxide molecules from the reverse-water-gas-shift reaction in a\nmethanol synthesis process to create methanol.\n\n[0046]In an embodiment, the carbon dioxide in step 2 may be heated high\nenough such as 900 Celsius to 2300 degrees Celsius for solar assisted\nreduction of carbon dioxide to occur. The heated carbon dioxide is\nreduced to carbon monoxide molecules and oxygen molecules. The oxygen\nfrom the carbon dioxide reduction and the water splitting may be cooled\nand stored as a liquid fuel or a portion may be used as a catalyst in the\nRWGS discussed later. This process will cause a lot of waste heat for use\nin other processes such as the synthesis gas generation and the heated\ncarbon dioxide may also be used as an energy source to drive a Brayton\nturbine engine 132.\n\n[0047]As shown in figure la, there may be a first field of heliostat\narrays and a discrete second field of heliostat arrays. The first array\nof heliostats 143 focuses the Sun's rays from their mirrors onto a dish\non a first tower portion of the water splitter 102 which is coated with\nan optical filter to pass a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum\nincluding the UV ray range from the Sun towards into the water splitter\n102 at around 20-50 sun concentration units. The water splitter 102 is\nlocated within the first tower and the visible light and UV rays pass\nthrough the optical filter. A second array of heliostats 147 focuses the\nSun's rays from their mirrors onto a dish on a second tower that contains\nthe solar-energy-to-gas-heat-exchanger 122. These power tower systems use\nan array of large individually tracking mirrors, known as heliostats. The\nheliostats use a two axis tracking of the sun to focus light rays onto a\ncentral receiver mounted near the top of a tower. Very high temperatures\nup to 1500\u00b0 Celsius can be achieved at concentration ratios around\n1500\u00d7 sun concentration units.\n\n[0048]Alternatively, the heliostats may focus their rays on a single dish\non the single tower which is coated with an optical beam splitter for\nbeam splitting to direct a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum\nincluding the UV ray range from the Sun's rays towards the water splitter\nat around 20-50 sun concentration units while directing the remaining\noptical spectrum to the RWGS unit using around 800-1200 sun concentration\nunits. The water splitter may be located within the tower and the visible\nlight and UV rays pass through the beam splitter and the beam splitter\nreflects the other wavelengths to the solar-energy-to-gas-heat-exchanger.\n\n[0049]Instead of a second field of heliostat arrays 143 there may be\nanother solar receiver such as a parabolic trough. As discussed in step\n1, water may be split in hydrogen molecules and oxygen molecules in the\nwater splitter 124 via the addition of solar power in combination with\nstandard water cleaving techniques, water splitting with titanium, or\nother similar techniques. In an embodiment, the water splitter 124 via\nthe addition of solar power from the heliostats 134 or parabolic trough\nmay use photo catalytic splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen in an\nelectrolysis cell. For example, Titanium oxide nanotubes coated with\ntungsten oxide can be prepared to harvest hydrogen and oxygen with solar\nlight. The tungsten trioxide coatings on the nanotubes can significantly\nenhance the visible spectrum absorption of the titanium dioxide nanotube\narray, as well as their solar-spectrum induced photocurrents. The\ncatalytic Titanium dioxide materials use sunlight to split water on the\nspot50]FIGS. 2a and 2b illustrate perspective views of embodiments of a\nparabolic trough system used with the water splitter.\n\n[0051]In an embodiment, the parabolic trough 243 contains a set of\nparabolic mirrors 251. Each mirror 251 connects to a tracking actuator\n253 to rotate that mirror in both the azimuth and elevation axis. Each\nparabolic mirror 251 reflects sunlight upwards in a frame of the\nparabolic trough at a focal line of the parabolic trough onto small areas\nof an associated light receiver 255 that contains glass or similar clear\ntubes coated with a titanium based element or compound catalyst in an\nelectrolyte. The light receiver 255 and frame in the parabolic trough may\nbe tilted at a slight upward angle to allow disassociated gases of\nhydrogen and oxygen from the water splitting process to naturally float\nupward and be collected/harvest for future use.\n\n[0052]An electronic controller 261 couples to the tracking actuator 253\nand feedback limit switches 259 to controlled positioning of each mirror\nto concentrate the sun's rays on the light receiver 255.\n\n[0053]The mirror 251 can be held in its parabolic shape by stamped tab\nribs 257 at either end of the mirror. The ribs 257 are trimmed just above\nthe stamped tabs so that they cause minimal shading, and fixed from below\nto receiver support brackets.\n\n[0054]FIG. 3 illustrates a top down view of an embodiment of a parabolic\ntrough system used with the water splitter. The exterior casing of the\nframe of the parabolic trough is cut away in this view to reveal the\nlight receivers 355 and tubes forming the electrolysis cells located in\neach light receiver 355.\n\n[0055]As discussed, the parabolic trough 343 can use multiple mirrors 351.\nEach mirror has two axis of rotation frame construction and couples to\nthe tracking actuator. In this embodiment, the long trough of the\nparabolic trough 343 is composed of multiple individual mirrors connected\ntogether to form the trough and a series of the associated light\nreceivers 355 are ganged together in a frame of the parabolic trough 343.\nThus, all of the TiO2 tubes can be in the same frame containing light\nreceivers that can be put at a slight upward incline to assist in\ncollection of hydrogen and oxygen gases by the bubbles of gas traveling\nup the incline.\n\n[0056]The parabolic-trough water-splitter has one or more light receivers\nwith tubes that use titanium based catalyst, which form the electrolysis\ncells that receive UV rays and visible light from the mirrors to split\nwater into hydrogen and oxygen via the titanium based catalyst that\nabsorbs both the UV rays and a portion of the visible light directed from\nthe heliostats. One electrode draws the hydrogen gas and the other\nelectrode draws the oxygen gas.\n\n[0057]In an embodiment, the parabolic trough concentrator uses two-axis\ntracking, and aluminum reflectors with the use of anti-corrosive\nadditives on the reflectors.\n\n[0058]Referring to FIGS. 2a and 2b, the parabolic trough concentrator's\ntwo-axis tracking system may be based on a `daisy wheel` arrangement. The\nmirrors are supported by metal frames, which in turn are mounted on a\n2-axis tracking mechanical structure. The tracking system reliably and\naccurately tracks the sun. Each mirror may rotate in both the azimuth\n(side to side) axis of rotation as well as the elevation (top to bottom)\nrotation. The azimuth tracking is achieved by rotation on a ring mounted\nflush to a ground. The second elevation axis of rotation was along the\nedge of the mirror, allowing each trough to roll to the correct elevation\nzenith angle. A microprocessor electronic controller cooperating with a\nlinear actuator positions the troughs pointing towards the sun, even\nduring cloudy weather. The troughs `roll` from east to west each day and\nthe long central support tilts the troughs to adjust for seasonal\nvariation. This is called `two-axis` tracking. The microprocessor\npositions a linear actuator and reads encoders for feedback in order to\nmove the mirrors a precise amount. The linear actuator causes rotation of\nthe main beam through cables and a pulley. Stepper motors can be an\nalternative to the linear actuator.\n\n[0059]Parabolic trough tracking and calibration requirements are lower\nthan for a heliostat array. Power output can be increased by 40% compared\nto fixed array, by tracking the Sun along the north-south and the\neast-west axes.\n\n[0060]Referring to FIG. 3, the front surface of the reflective mirror\nportion of the parabolic trough (or tower dish) may be formed by a\nreflective metal such as aluminum and chrome, which are actually better\nat reflecting lower electromagnetic spectrum rays, such as UV rays, than\ntypical glass mirrors which absorb a greater percentage of waves in this\nportion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Further, a coating may be\nstretched across either the mirror and/or the aperture of the light\nreceiver in which the sun's rays are being focused into in order to\nassist in controlling the passing or deflecting different wavelength\nbands in the electromagnetic spectrum. An essentially transparent polymer\nor acrylic, such as ETFE, may also be placed across or adhered to the\nsurface of the mirrors, which is transparent in the electromagnetic\nwavelength bands of desire, in order to protect the mirror from\nenvironmental damage such as acid rain, chipping etc. Thus, a polymer or\nacrylic coating on top of the front surface of the reflective metal\nmirror, which is optically transmissive in passing wavelength bands in\nthe electromagnetic spectrum below infra red is on top of the front\nsurface of the reflective mirror to maximize the amount of Sun being\nconcentrated into the light receivers in the desired UV and visible light\nspectrum while limiting generation of waste heat, and the hydrogen\nsplitting via tubes with a titanium based catalyst in the light receiver\nto occur at 50-80 degrees low temperature, 30-50 sun concentration units.\n\n[0061]Note, electromagnetic radiation can be classified by wavelength into\nradio, microwave, infrared, the visible region we perceive as visible\nlight, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays.\n\n[0062]The polymer or acrylic coating on top of the front surface of the\nreflective metal mirror can be highly scratch resistant and resistant to\nsignificant deterioration. Each mirror can deliver a concentration ratio\nof about 20 to 1.\n\n[0063]The temperature of the process in the light receiver can be\ncontrolled with passive heat sinks such as aluminum fins or active\ncooling flow of air/water to the receiver. In an embodiment, each solar\nlight receiver has an integrated passive heat sink to maintain the cells\nat a moderate temperature.\n\n[0064]Referring to FIG. 1, the water splitter generates commercial\nquantities of hydrogen gas on site as a feed gas to produce both\nsynthesis gas in a reverse-water-gas-shift reaction and then combined\nwith resultant carbon monoxide from the RWGS to produce a hydrocarbon\nliquid fuel. The hydrogen gas generated on site as a feed gas is\ngenerated on site via a low/zero carbon emission process. The water\nsplitter can generate hydrogen gas from water splitting with titanium or\nhigh temperature water splitting via electrolysis and the electrical\npower for the water splitting is generated via a Brayton engine or\nphotovoltaic electrical power generation mechanism. This also allows the\nhydrocarbon liquid fuel to be generated in geographic areas not located\nnear the public utility grid.\n\n[0065]Electrolysis cells 180 consisting of dye-sensitized solar cells\nusing a TiO2 thin film electrode may also be used to harvest hydrogen and\noxygen with solar light.\n\n[0066]The catalytic Titanium dioxide materials use sunlight to split water\non the spot67]A titanium di-silicide catalyst can also be used with focused\nsunlight to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The heliostats supply\nthe energy to drive the water to hydrogen and oxygen. Titania is used to\ncapture energy from sunlight. The absorbed energy releases electrons,\nwhich split water to make hydrogen. The Titania material may be strained\nso that its atoms are slightly pressed together or pulled apart to alter\nthe material's electronic properties. In an embodiment, a coating of\nTitania may be physically stretched and deposited on dome-like\nnanostructures that cause the atoms to be slightly pulled apart. The TiO2\nmay be physically stressed by creating a substrate with ripples in the\nsubstrate that have a visible light wavelength spacing and when the TiO2\nthin film is stretched over the rippled substrate, the TiO2 essentially\ninherits a stressed band gap to absorb visible light. By pulling the\natoms apart, less energy is required to knock the electrons out of orbit.\nThus, light with lower energy can be used to split water, which means\nboth visible light and ultraviolet light can be used. Similarly, when\ndopants are added in the dye sensitized solar cells, the coating of\nTitania absorbs a greater spectrum of light waves than in its native\nunstressed state.\n\n[0068]Generally, electromagnetic radiation is classified by wavelength\ninto radio, microwave, infrared, the visible region we perceive as light,\nultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays. EM radiation with a wavelength\nbetween approximately 400 nm and 700 nm is detected by the human eye and\nperceived as visible light. Ultraviolet (shorter than 400 nm to about 1\nnm) are also sometimes referred to as light. Being very energetic, UV\nrays can break chemical bonds, making molecules unusually reactive or\nionizing them, in general changing their mutual behavior.\n\n[0069]Note, the strain on the atoms also affects the way that electrons\nmove through the material. Too much strain, and the electrons tend to be\nreabsorbed by the material before they split water. Thus, a balance\nbetween absorbing more sunlight and allowing the electrons to move freely\nout of the material is attempted to be achieved with the strain applied.\nOverall, the Titania (TiO2) can be stressed to lengthen the band gap by\nmechanical and/or chemical means.\n\n[0070]FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional drawing of a photoelectrolysis cell\ndevice for dissociation and production of hydrogen gas from an aqueous\nsolution when illuminated. The water splitter may contain a\nphotoelectrolysis cell device 580. The photoelectrolysis cell 580 employs\nan electrode made of a titanium-based element or compound with a\nstress-induced band-gap shifted and broadened to be active at light\nwavelengths more prevalent in sunlight. The photoelectrolysis cell device\nmay include some or all of the following: a first working electrode that\nhas thin layers of adhesion and/or conductivity promoting materials and a\nTitania semiconductor photocatalyst coated on top of the rippled surface\nof a polycarbonate substrate(s) 585, housing, aqueous electrolyte,\nseparation membrane 586, second electrode 588, bias voltage source 590,\ntanks for collecting and storing the hydrogen gas 592 and oxygen gas 594.\nAn enlarged view of the rippled surface of a polycarbonate substrate(s)\n585 with the Titania semiconductor photocatalyst coated on top is shown\nat the top of FIG. 5.\n\n[0071]The rays of solar energy from the solar receivers 534 illuminate the\npolycarbonate substrate that also comprises one side of the cell. The\npolycarbonate 585 has a distal surface that has been embossed with\nripples, and coated with Titania. Nanoscale ripples are present in the\nsubstrate 585 such that stress is induced in the thin film of Titania by\nforming local high-stress bending radii.\n\n[0072]A high stress-bending radius depends on the two materials involved,\nspecifically these materials Young's moduli, and how the covering layer\nis formed relative to the ripple/wave on the other layer. Titania in an\nunstressed state has a maximum band gap of about 3.4 eV, and a more\ntypical band gap of about 3.2 eV. The bandgap of Titania thin film being\nstressed is a shifted and broadened to a bandgap of 3.0 eV or lower. The\nTitania semiconductor film 585 has a native bandgap that does not support\nspontaneous photoelectrolysis of water in visible light wavelengths\npresent in sunlight.\n\n[0073]The electrode contains a substrate that has surface ripples with a\nsub-visible-light-wavelength spatial period that causes stress in the\ntitanium based element or compound semiconductor thin film on the\nsubstrate 585 and thereby shifts the bandgap of the titanium based\nelement or compound to support spontaneous photoelectrolysis of water in\nvisible light. The shift in the band gap increases the absorption of\nphotons and light beyond ultra-violet and well into the visible, abundant\npart of the solar spectrum. (=the bandgap of Titania is too large to\nabsorb in the visible region. The substrate 585 has surface ripples with\na sub-visible-light spatial pitch and hence the thin film stretched over\nthe substrate inherits these ripples with a sub-visible-light spatial\npitch. The pitches among the linear irregularities or recesses in the\nripples in the thin film are not necessary uniform but stay within the\nrange on the substrate. The substrate 585 has surface ripples in a\nwaveform shape that have a spacing/pitch between 20 nm to 350 nm. Note\nvisible light at the low end is waves greater than 400 nm. Thus, the\nsubstrate 585 has ripples on a surface thereof, the ripples having a\nspatial period smaller than a light wavelength in the visible spectrum.\nThe semiconductor film can be grown onto the rippled substrate 585. The\nripples are substantially cylindrical, hemispherical, or sinusoidal in\nprofile and shape (=sinusoidal). Thus, the semiconductor thin film is\nstressed to shift the bandgap therein to support spontaneous\nphotoelectrolysis of water in visible light.\n\n[0074]The second half of the cell is provided by membrane 586, which may\nalso be polycarbonate but can be other materials as well. The second\nelectrode 588 is aluminum, platinum, or aluminized thin film coating on a\nsubstrate, for example. An aqueous electrolyte, such as seawater,\nsulfuric acid, etc, is in contact with the semiconductor film. A\nseparator membrane allows the hydrogen and oxygen gasses released in\nphotoelectrolysis to be collected separately. Further, this controls the\namount of dissolved oxygen that is present in the water, to make the\nphotoelectrolysis reaction more efficient and predictable.\n\n[0075]Upon exposure of the semiconductor Titania film to an aqueous\nsolution and illumination of the semiconductor film with sunlight, the\nsemiconductor film will split the aqueous solution into hydrogen and\noxygen. Gaseous oxygen collects at the semiconductor Titania electrode\ncathode 585 and gaseous hydrogen collects at the conducting anode 588,\nwith the membrane 586 preventing their recombining. The Titania electrode\ncan also be formed to be an anode rather than a cathode. An optional bias\nvoltage source 590 is shown connected to the electrodes to adjust the\nelectric potential for best electrolysis efficiency, but a\nredox-mediating electrolyte can also be used to reduce hole/electron\nrecombination if necessary. Each gas displaces water and collects at the\ntop of the two outer tubes, where it can be drawn off with a stopcock.\nReservoirs 592 and 594 collect the separated hydrogen and oxygen gases.\nThe titania-coated substrates can be stacked in layers to increase the\ntotal absorption of the UV and visible light over a given illumination\narea. The shape of the ripples can be concave or convex or a mix of both.\n\n[0076]The stress-induced bandgap-shifted semiconductor may have its stress\nis induced by some or all of the following ways: controlling the shape of\nand thickness of said semiconductor thin film; tuning the film coating\nparameters to optimize stress; forming nanoscale ripples in the substrate\nto cause local high-stress bending radii; controlling the pitch and depth\nof said ripples; controlling the mismatch in Young's modulus between the\ncoating and the substrate; inducing photon stress by self-focusing of the\nillumination; inducing electron stress by adding a layer such as gold in\ncontact with the semiconductor and in between the semiconductor and the\nsubstrate.\n\n[0077]The stress-induced bandgap-shifted semiconductor may include\nmaterials such as titanium, Titania, compounds of Titania, and doped\nTitania. The bandgap of the known chemically-inert photocatalyst titania\n(TiO2) is shifted and broadened to be active at wavelengths more\nprevalent in sunlight and artificial light by inducing and managing\nsufficiently high stress in titania by vacuum coating a thin film of\ntitania onto a substrate, preferably of a different Young's modulus, with\nbending ripples on the surface of a spatial radius similar to the film\nthickness. The rippled coating also serves to self-focus and concentrate\nthe incident light required for the process, increase photocatalytic\nsurface area, and prevent delamination of the film from the substrate.\nThe electrical activity so induced in the band-shifted Titania\nsubsequently by visible light is applied to photoelectrolysis (hydrogen\nproduction from water and light).\n\n[0078]When tensile stress is applied to or caused in a semiconductor, the\ninter-atomic spacing increases directly. An increased inter-atomic\nspacing decreases the potential seen by the electrons in the material,\nwhich in turn reduces the size of the energy bandgap. The same effect\noccurs with increased temperature, because the amplitude of the atomic\nvibrations increases with the increased thermal energy, thereby causing\nincreased inter-atomic spacing. The stress can be carefully controlled to\nachieve the desired bandgap shift, and further managed to prevent\ndelamination, by introducing periodic three-dimensional nano-scale\nsurface features into or onto the substrate. These features act as a\ntemplate such that the film that is grown onto the template takes on a\nsimilar shape. The Titania film grown onto the polycarbonate template has\na three dimensional sinusoid surface, much like an egg carton, with a\nspatial period of 300 nanometers (nm) or 0.3 microns.\n\n[0079]Note, the photoelectrolysis cell device for dissociation and\nproduction of hydrogen gas from an aqueous solution when illuminated\ncould also could substitute chemically induced stress via dopants and use\na dye sensitive solar cell. The cell uses a semi conductive metal oxide\nlayer on a conductive substrate, sensitized by at least one chromophoric\nsubstance. The nanocrystalline semi conductive metal oxide, in particular\nTiO2, is in polycrystalline form with a granulometry of the order of\nseveral nanometers, for example 10 to 50 nanometers. A chromophoric\nsubstance, often called photosensitizer or photosensitizing dye, forms a\nsubstantially monomolecular layer attached to the semi conductive metal\noxide layer. The chromophoric substance may be bound to the metal oxide\nlayer by means of anchoring groups like carboxylate or phosphonate or\ncyano groups or chelating groups with conducting character like oxymes,\ndioxymes, hydroxyquinolines, salicylates and keto-enolates. Several\ntransition metal complexes, in particular ruthenium complexes, but also\nosmium or iron complexes, with heterocyclic ligands like bidentate,\ntridentate or polydentate polypyridil compounds, have been shown to be\nefficient photosensitizing dyes.\n\n[0080]The photo-catalytic nano-crystalline thin films may even include use\nof iron oxide-based materials.\n\n[0081]Further, the photoelectrolysis cell device for dissociation and\nproduction of hydrogen gas from an aqueous solution when illuminated\ncould also be a thin film semiconductor device with multiple junctions.\nThe semiconductor includes a substrate; a solid-state semiconductor layer\ndisposed on the substrate; a photoactive semiconductor top layer further\ncomprising a photo electrochemical electrode junction; and an interface\nlayer disposed between the solid-state semiconductor layer and the\nphotoactive semiconductor top layer. The multiple junctions create more\ncurrent or electrons available to react with a liquid electrolyte. A\nsurface of the photoactive semiconductor top layer is exposed to both a\nsource of light such as the sun and to the liquid electrolyte.\n\n[0082]Another method to generate hydrogen via the addition of solar energy\nis high-temperature electrolysis. The water splitter contains a\nhigh-temperature, 280-320 degree Celsius, electrolysis cell device for\nwater electrolysis to decompose water (H2O) into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen\ngas (H2) due to an electric current being passed through the water with\nmost of the energy causing the high temperature above 280 degrees Celsius\nsupplied as heat from the Sun, which is cheaper than electricity, and\nbecause the electrolysis reaction is more efficient at higher\ntemperatures. An electrical power source is connected to two electrodes\nto pass the electricity and the oxygen gas gathers at a first electrode\nand the hydrogen gas gathers at a second electrode. The electrolysis cell\ndevice functions similar to the catalyst cell discussed above. The\nhydrogen gas gathers at the cathode (the negatively charged electrode,\nwhere electrons are pumped into the water), and the oxygen gas gathers at\nthe anode (the positively charged electrode). The generated amount of\nhydrogen is twice the amount of oxygen, and both are proportional to the\ntotal electrical charge that was sent through the water. Electrolysis of\nwater is sped up dramatically by adding an electrolyte (such as a salt,\nan acid or a base).\n\n[0083]In the water at the negatively charged cathode, a reduction reaction\ntakes place, with electrons (e-) from the cathode being given to hydrogen\ncat ions to form hydrogen gas (the half reaction balanced with acid):\n\n[0084]Cathode (reduction): 2H+(aq)+2e-\u2192H2(g).\n\n[0085]At the positively charged anode, an oxidation reaction occurs,\ngenerating oxygen gas and giving electrons to the anode to complete the\ncircuit:\n\n[0086]Anode (oxidation): 2H2O(l)\u2192O2(g)+4H+(aq)+4e-.\n\n[0087]The same half reactions can also be balanced with base as listed\nbelow. Not all half reactions must be balanced with acid or base. Many do\nlike the oxidation or reduction of water listed here. To add half\nreactions they must both be balanced with either acid or base.\n\n[0088]Cathode (reduction): 2H2O(l)+2e-\u2192H2(g)+2OH-(aq);\n\n[0089]Anode (oxidation): 4OH-(aq)\u2192O2(g)+2H2O(l)+4e-;\n\n[0090]Combining either half reaction pair yields the same overall\ndecomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen:\n\n[0091]Overall reaction: 2H2O(l)\u21922H2(g)+O2(g).\n\n[0092]The number of electrons pushed through the water is twice the number\nof generated hydrogen molecules and four times the number of generated\noxygen molecules. If a water-soluble electrolyte is added, the\nconductivity of the water rises considerably. The electrolyte\ndisassociates into cat ions and anions; the anions rush towards the anode\nand neutralize the buildup of positively charged H+ there; similarly, the\ncat ions rush towards the cathode and neutralize the buildup of\nnegatively charged OH- there. This allows the continued flow of\nelectricity.\n\n[0093]Care should be taken in choosing an electrolyte, since an anion from\nthe electrolyte is in competition with the hydroxide ions to give up an\nelectron. An electrolyte anion with less standard electrode potential\nthan hydroxide will be oxidized instead of the hydroxide, and no oxygen\ngas will be produced. A cat ion with a greater standard electrode\npotential than a hydrogen ion will be reduced in its stead, and no\nhydrogen gas will be produced.\n\n[0094]The following cat ions have lower electrode potential than H+ and\nare therefore suitable for use as electrolyte cat ions: Li+, Rb+, K+,\nCs+, Ba2+, Sr2+, Ca2+, Na+, and Mg2+. Sodium and lithium are frequently\nused, as they form inexpensive, soluble salts.\n\n[0095]If an acid is used as the electrolyte, the cat ion is H+, and there\nis no competitor for the H+ created by disassociating water. The most\ncommonly used anion is sulfate (SO42-), as it is very difficult to\noxidize, with the standard potential for oxidation of this ion to the\nperoxydisulfate ion being -0.22 volts.\n\n[0096]Strong acids such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and strong bases such as\npotassium hydroxide (KOH), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) are frequently\nused as electrolytes.\n\n[0097]Solar photovoltaic cells are used to convert solar energy directly\ninto electricity and may be used as the voltage source for the Ti based\nand high temperature based electrolysis cell devices discussed above. The\nsolar cells maybe based on the photovoltaic (PV) effect in which light\nfalling on a two layer semi-conductor device produces a photovoltage or\npotential difference between the layers. The solar photovoltaic cells can\nbe used as a voltage source for the photoelectrolysis cell device that\nemploys an electrode made of a titanium based element or compound with a\nstress-induced band-gap.\n\n[0098]In an embodiment, the carbon dioxide in step 2 may be heated high\nenough such as 900 Celsius to 2300 Celsius for solar assisted reduction\nof carbon dioxide to occur and the heated carbon dioxide is reduced to\ncarbon monoxide molecules and oxygen molecules. The oxygen from the\ncarbon dioxide reduction and the water splitting may be cooled and stored\nas a liquid fuel or a portion may be used as a catalyst discussed later.\nThis process will cause a lot of waste heat for use in other processes\nsuch as the synthesis gas generation and the heated carbon dioxide may be\nused to drive a Brayton engine, which supplies the voltage source for the\nTi based and high temperature based electrolysis cell devices discussed\nabove\n\n[0099]After the carbon dioxide is converted to carbon monoxide and water\nby the reverse-water-gas-shift reaction in the RWGS reactor, the exiting\nwater from that chemical transformation is removed by the condenser 120\nbefore the methanol is synthesized. With the elimination of water by\nRWGS, the purge gas volume is minimized as the recycle gas volume\ndecreased. Because of the minimum purge gas loss by the pretreatment of\nRWGS reactor 106, the overall methanol yield may be increased. Also, the\nremoval of water vapor from the reactor 106 via the condenser 120 can\ndrive the equilibrium of the RWGS reaction to the right to increase the\nyield of carbon monoxide produced per inputted heated carbon dioxide. The\ncondensed water from the condenser 120 can be recycled to the water\nsplitter 102. The condenser 120 for water removal could either be a\ndesiccant bed or cooling condensing apparatus.\n\n[0100]On cloudy days, use an alternative heat source to keep the hydrogen\nfeedstock coming in or large storage tanks may be used to keep the flow\nof hydrogen feedstock steady to the RWGS unit. This minimizes the\ntransient start up and shut down operations on the RWGS unit.\n\n[0102]In block 402, the process uses solar receivers, such as heliostats,\nto focus the solar energy power of the Sun on a unit containing a\nchemical reactor to heat gas to provide energy needed for chemical\ntransformations to occur.\n\n[0103]In block 404, the process splits water molecules into hydrogen\nmolecules and oxygen molecules via 1) the addition of the solar power\ndirected from the solar receivers (heliostats, parabolic trough, etc.)\nand 2) use of a titanium based catalyst in the water splitting process\nthat absorbs at least the UV rays directed from the solar receivers or a\nhigh-temperature electrolysis that absorbs rays directed from the solar\nreceivers.\n\n[0104]In block 406, the process heats a solar-energy-to-gas-heat-exchanger\nand the carbon dioxide gas via the addition of solar power directed from\nthe solar receivers and potentially pre-heating the feed gases with\nrecycled and/or waste gas.\n\n[0105]In block 408, the process mixes the heated carbon dioxide gas with a\nfirst portion of the hydrogen gas from the water splitting process in the\nsolar-assisted endothermic reverse-water-gas-shift-reaction to produce\nresultant carbon monoxide and water molecules.\n\n[0106]In block 410, the process drives the RWGS reaction to maximize the\nproduction of carbon monoxide for the subsequent exothermic reaction in\nthe generation of a hydrocarbon fuel including methanol. As discussed\nabove, one of the ways would be to remove water vapor from the chemical\nreactor chamber in which the reverse water gas shift reaction occurs and\noverload the input of carbon dioxide for maximum hydrogen consumption.\nAnother method is to overload an amount of moles of heated hydrogen\nmolecules relative to an amount of carbon dioxide present in the chemical\nreactor chamber than necessary to achieve equilibrium in the reverse\nwater gas shift reaction to force maximum production of the resultant\ncarbon monoxide.\n\n[0107]In block 412, the process separates the heated carbon dioxide gas\nand hydrogen gas from the resultant carbon monoxide and water molecules\nand recycles these back to RWGS step 408 or the preheating step 406.\nAlternatively, the process uses all four of the above chemical compounds\nto initially preheat feed gases and then removes the water and some of\nthe now cooled carbon dioxide gas in order to create the synthesis gas\nsent to the Hydrocarbon Fuel synthesis process in step 418.\n\n[0108]Thus, the process recycles the separated out carbon dioxide after\nits been used in the recuperator back to the\nsolar-energy-to-gas-heat-exchanger area. The process may also recycle\nnone of the hydrogen if it is all being sent through the RWGS reaction\nand then the unconsumed hydrogen is sent onto the fuel process. The\nprocess may recycle a portion of the unconsumed hydrogen gas if that\nportion is being used to initially overload the hydrogen concentration\nand then recycled to preheat feed gas and reused in the RWGS reaction.\n\n[0109]In block 416, the process quenches a portion of the exit gases from\na chemical reactor chamber in which the reverse water gas shift reaction\noccurs, to stabilize at least the carbon monoxide molecule.\n\n[0110]In block 418, the process mixes the hydrogen molecules from the\nwater splitting process or RWGS reaction and the resultant carbon\nmonoxide from the reverse water gas shift reaction in hydrocarbon fuel\nsynthesis process to create a liquid hydrocarbon fuel. The process may\nmix all of the unconsumed hydrogen molecules, the resultant carbon\nmonoxide and a small percentage of the unconsumed carbon dioxide from the\nreverse-water-gas-shift reaction in hydrocarbon fuel synthesis process to\ncreate a liquid hydrocarbon fuel. The process also may mix a remaining\nportion of the hydrogen molecules from the water splitting process and\nthe resultant carbon monoxide from the reverse-water-gas-shift reaction\nin hydrocarbon fuel synthesis process to create a liquid hydrocarbon\nfuel.\n\n[0111]In block 420, the carbon dioxide may be heated high enough such as\n900 Celsius to 2100 Celsius for solar reduction of carbon dioxide to\noccur and the heated carbon dioxide is reduced to carbon monoxide and\noxygen. The intense solar energy from a well-focused heliostat array\nsuper-heats and dissociates the carbon dioxide. Some of the carbon\ndioxide becomes carbon monoxide and oxygen. Then the reaction is\n\"quenched\" by fast cooling, preserving the products from back-reaction\n(recombination). Thus, the dissociation reaction can be cooled to prevent\nback-reaction. The resulting mix of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and\noxygen gas is separated into its three components. The carbon dioxide is\nrecycled back into the process. The oxygen can be used for many valuable\npurposes. The carbon monoxide, an energy-rich molecule, carries the\ncaptured solar energy in its bonds. Waste heat from the process generates\nhigh quality steam to potentially turn an electricity-producing turbine.\n\n[0112]In block 422, the small mirrors in heliostats array are used to heat\nthe carbon dioxide gas. A technique that allows the mirrors to be\ncalibrated in groups is used. The smaller mirrors require less support\nstructure since the wind loads are much lower. Also, by spacing the\nmirrors in a regular pattern, the support structure carrying the\nheliostats can be a standardized frame easily installed in the field. The\nmirrored arrays use this carriage linkage to tie them together and\ncommunally use a shared camera tracking system and periodic calibration.\n\n[0113]As discussed, the process allows for a high enough volume of hot\ncarbon dioxide gas for commercial quantities of carbon monoxide for\nhydrocarbon based fuel generation, such as via methanol synthesis, and\nmay even allow for a higher volume of hot gas for operation of the\nBrayton cycle turbine engine.\n\nOperation of the Brayton Cycle Turbine Engine\n\n[0114]The Brayton cycle turbine engine 132 receives a portion of the\ncarbon dioxide gas from the solar-energy-to-gas-heat-exchanger. The high\nquality heat from the carbon dioxide gas is transferred from the carbon\ndioxide gas to steam to run a turbine portion of the turbine engine that\ngenerates electricity. The heated carbon dioxide gas is heated to a\nsteady state temperature between 800 and 1000 degrees Celsius. The\nquantity of excess heat is used to generate power through the traditional\nBrayton cycle, using microturbine-generators.\n\n[0115]Thus, the Brayton engine 132 is driven with gas heated from the\nsolar energy and that same solar energy is a heat source for the\ntransforming carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide in the RWGS. The Brayton\nengine 132 is configured with a higher throughput, lower entropy\nproduction design, which is more advantageous for heating at up to 900 C.\nThe same solar energy is doing twice the work, resulting in much more\nefficient power production. The Brayton turbine engine 132 unit can\nproduce electrical power.\n\n[0116]In one embodiment, the software used to facilitate the processes\ndiscussed above can be embodied onto a machine-readable medium. A\nmachine-readable medium includes any mechanism that provides (e.g.,\nstores and/or transmits) information in a form readable by a machine\n(e.g., a computer). For example, a machine-readable medium includes read\nonly memory (ROM); random access memory (RAM); magnetic disk storage\nmedia; optical storage media; flash memory devices; Digital VideoDisc\n(DVD's), EPROMs, EEPROMs, FLASH memory, magnetic or optical cards, or any\ntype of media suitable for storing electronic instructions. The software\nmay be written in any number of programming languages such as C, etc.\n\n[0117]While some specific embodiments of the invention have been shown the\ninvention is not to be limited to these embodiments. For example, most\nfunctions performed by electronic hardware components may be duplicated\nby software emulation. Thus, a software program written to accomplish\nthose same functions may emulate the functionality of the hardware\ncomponents in input-output circuitry. The reverse-water-gas-shift-reactor\nand the methanol synthesis reactor can be part of two separate units\nlocated in relatively close proximity of each other, such as both being\non the same production facility site. The hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and\ncarbon dioxide recirculation loops may be combined. For example, the\nhydrogen, carbon monoxide may be combined when sent to the methanol\nsynthesis reactor. The hydrogen and carbon dioxide may be combined when\nrecirculated back to the RWGS process. The system may use two or more\ndiscrete solar-energy-to-gas-heat-exchangers. The array of heliostats may\nbe formed in two or more sets of heliostats. The solar energy receiver\nmay be heliostats or other devices such as solar collector mirrors,\nparabolic troughs, or any number of other apparatus to focus the rays of\nthe sun. The invention is to be understood as not limited by the specific\nembodiments described herein, but only by scope of the appended claims."}
{"text": "Scientists Split Water for Less; Cheap Hydrogen on the Way\n\nHydrogen fuel is often touted as the future of automobiles, but it suffers from one very troubling problem: actually getting hydrogen is exceedingly difficult. But scientists might have finally managed to create a nanomaterial capable of breaking water down into hydrogen and oxygen using common, easily obtained metals.\n\nWater does not like to be broken apart. We can do it, but the two most common methods either release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere or requires platinum, a rare earth metal that there just isn't that much of on this planet.\n\nLiquid water and ice structures\n\nPlatinum acts as a catalyst for the water. When a current is run through it, hydrogen can be liberated from the atomic structure that holds it in place. It is also very rare. The new nanomaterial, meanwhile, can do it using only common metals. It uses nickel, using an arrangement that makes the nickel act similarly to how platinum does. That makes the entire process cheaper and less energy intensive.\n\nThe breakthrough is thanks to the US Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory. They developed a novel electrocatalyst that can break apart water with very little energy. Actually, the scientists who developed the material were surprised at just how efficient the entire process was. Said the scientist who originally conceived of the idea behind the material, Brookhaven Lab chemist Kotaro Sasaki:\n\n\"We wanted to design an optimal catalyst with high activity and low costs that could generate hydrogen as a high-density, clean energy source. We discovered this exciting compound that actually outperformed our expectations.\"\n\nHydrogen is an ideal energy source. It is readily available in water, one of the most plentiful compounds on our planet. But in order to make hydrogen fuel worthwhile, the energy that goes into liberating it from the water has to be as low as possible. Before this nanomaterial, the return on energy investment has been nearly 1 to 1. This material could change everything."}

{"text": "Tapping New Sources of Energy\n\nChemistry Professor Brian Dyer is researching that possibility, through his work at the intersection of chemistry, physics and biology. \"I'm really into blurring the lines between traditional disciplines,\" he says.\n\nFormerly with the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, Dyer joined Emory this summer to help unite the University's multi-disciplinary research into renewable energy sources. \"The need for renewable energy is one of the key problems of our time,\" Dyer says, \"and Emory is well-positioned to really make an impact in this area.\"\n\nDyer uses laser spectroscopy to study how light can interact with materials. Early in his career, he began working with proteins that can do photochemistry, drawing his inspiration from natural photosynthesis.\n\n\"Ultimately, plants are taking light and storing it as chemical energy,\" Dyer explains. \"The elegance of some of these reactions is astounding. It's an incredibly complex process, done with a series of proteins that are highly optimized for a specific function, such as light harvesting and water oxidation. The proteins are like tiny machines. A good analogy is an internal combustion engine, where you actually have integrated, working parts.\"\n\nArtificial photosynthesis In recent years, science and industry have started searching for ways to develop systems of artificial photosynthesis, to help solve the energy shortage and reduce carbon emissions. So far, man's attempts at tapping the sun's power have fallen far short of Mother Nature's.\n\nWhile living in Los Alamos, located at 7,500 feet above sea level on the Pajarito Plateau, Dyer installed solar panels on his family home. \"I wanted to understand the issues of solar energy at the practical level of a home owner,\" he says. Even with 320 days a year of New Mexico sunshine, he found conventional solar panels to be inefficient and not cost effective.\n\n\"An even bigger problem is the batteries required to store the intermittent solar flux,\" Dyer says. \"Their storage capacity is limited and their lifetime is short. They also contain hazardous chemicals, like lead and sulfuric acid.\"\n\nMimicking Mother Nature Dyer is focused on solving this solar energy storage problem. He wants to covert solar energy to fuel, using a particular protein to develop a photocatalyst for solar hydrogen production \u2014 which brings up the swamp bugs.\n\nA type of anaerobic bacteria that lives deep in the mud of swamps, where there is little oxygen, survives by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. While humans need to use expensive systems to perform this process on a large scale, the bacteria does it naturally by generating the protein hydrogenase \u2014 the most efficient catalyst known for making hydrogen.\n\nBy studying the biological system, Dyer hopes to find ways to adapt the microbial catalysis of hydrogenase so that it can be harnessed for solar hydrogen production.\n\n\"You can trick bugs to make lots of certain kinds of proteins, like a little factory,\" Dyer explains. \"It's called 'directed evolution,' where you push bacteria a certain way, forcing it to adapt and to produce an evolved protein that has the properties you need.\"\n\nHis goal is to generate hydrogenase in a form that allows the protein to bind to quantum dots, which are good at absorbing light and could provide the energy to drive the reaction.\n\n\"We envision producing hydrogen in a photochemically driven process, where the electrons and protons needed to produce the hydrogen are furnished by water,\" Dyer explains. \"You could then burn the hydrogen as fuel and get water back. It would be a perfectly clean cycle.\"\n\nRenewable energy center At Emory, Dyer is teamed with other scientists in his experiments, including Tim Lian, William Henry Emerson Professor of Chemistry and a leader in quantum dot technology, and Stefan Lutz, an associate professor of biomolecular chemistry who specializes in protein engineering.\n\nDyer will also serve as the director of a renewable energy center on campus, to launch this fall. The aim is to further integrate ongoing energy research among chemists, physicists, biologists and computer scientists.\n\n\"The energy field has suffered from 30 years of people saying that the search for more energy is an engineering problem,\" Dyer says. \"Actually, it's primarily a science problem. Emory has a good track record of bringing together interdisciplinary teams, and tremendous strengths in the bio-sciences, as well as the physical sciences. Most of the advances in renewable energy are going to be made at that interface.\""}

{"text": "Put on Your Walking Shoes, Generate Some Power\n\nIt has become clear that we need to figure out greener, renewable sources of energy. Well, what if we could produce our own damned power? Walking's about as carectomy-friendly as it gets. Below are some concepts in the works that will allow us to crank out some electricity while keeping healthy, happy, and pollution-free out on our strolls.\n\nWe featured NanoSonic Inc's piezoelectric backpack concept in an earlier article. In a nutshell, the The power such a device generates isn't huge: about 45.6 milliwatts of power while walking. However, it's enough to power an LED headlamp or an ipod and it's \"free power\" in the sense that there's no extra effort required by the walker.\n\nResearchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology are taking the piezoelectric idea one step further; they're embedding nanotechnology fibers into fabric and making power-generating duds. Simply by moving around and jostling the clothing, the wearer is cranking out power.\n\nZhong Lin Wang and colleagues at the Georgia Institute of Technology covered individual fibers of fabric with nanowires made of zinc oxide. These wires are 50 nanometers in diameter, 1,800 times thinner than a human hair.\n\nAlternating fibers are coated with gold. As one strand of the fabric is stretched against another, the nanowires on one fiber rub against the gold-coated ones on the other, like the teeth of two bottle brushes. The resulting tension and pressure generate a piezoelectric charge that is captured by the gold and can be fed into a circuit.\n\nThe allure of the idea is that it doesn't take unusual movement to generate usable electricity. Pretty much anything someone does while wearing a piezoelectric shirt would be productive.\n\nOur friends at EcoGeek recently ran a story on a \"knee dynamo\" that harnesses energy directly from the walking motion.\n\nFrom EcoGeek:\n\nIt actually uses the energy of the leg swinging forward at the beginning of the stride to generate the power.\n\nThis energy would otherwise need to be counteracted by the leg muscles to keep the leg from jarring the knee. This way, the dynamo can actually produce more power than the extra energy the wearer spends to use the device. Think of it like regenerative breaking in hybrid cars. Every time you take a step, your thigh has to both speed up and slow down your lower leg. This thing just helps your leg slow itself down, and captures some of that energy. There's an excellent video of the thing in action at BBC news, I suggest you check it out.\n\nNot quite \"free power,\" as there's still a little extra effort required by the user. However, the energy gained is greater the extra energy expended. Sounds a bit like perpetual motion \u2013 as long as you keep walking!\n\nOr, perhaps the next step in self-contained power is to carry mini-solar panels around with us. Computer bags and backpacks with solar panels have been around for a while. Well, why not dispense with the luggage and put the panels right on our bods? Groovy Green recently featured a stylish little number from Studio 5050 made up of solar-cell-packing tiles. Somewhere in the scanty outfit is a USB interface to charge your accessories on the go.\n\nAs Hank Green of EcoGeek said, \"..if I can't power my own iPod 15 years from now, I give up on this planet\u2026thanks to these guys for getting this technology another step (or half-stride) closer to reality.\"\n\nIt would be interesting to see this debate taking place again today. Given that the Census Bureau has found there are more people living in poverty in suburbs than in cities I think it would be difficult to defend the idea that everyone wants to live there. Apparently people with money are choosing cities and exurbs.\n\nI don't have the official reference off hand but here's a quote from a Brookings report: [quote]In 1999 large cities and their suburbs had nearly equal numbers of poor individuals, but by 2005 the suburban poor outnumbered their city counterparts by at least 1 million.[/quote][url]\n\nThe saddest part is that people who can ill afford cars in the first place feel more need for them and often can only afford older, lower mileage, higher emission vehicles, compounding their problems.\n\nInterestingly enough, some of the earliest \"suburbs\" were areas outside of a city's center made accessible by new train lines being built. This raises an interesting idea\u2013what if developers were required to provide a portion of funding for mass transit access to areas being newly developed?"}

{"text": "Posted\nby\nSoulskillon Monday March 28, 2011 @08:05PM from the make-like-a-tree-and-catalyze-the-electrolysis-of-water dept.\n\nsciencehabit was one of several readers to tip news of a sunlight-harvesting artificial leaf, writing:\n\"Nearly all the energy we use on this planet starts out as sunlight that plants use to knit chemical bonds. Now, for the first time, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have created a potentially cheap, practical artificial leaf that does much the same thing\u2014providing a vast source of energy that's easy to tap. The new device is a silicon wafer about the shape and size of a playing card coated on either side with two different catalysts. The silicon absorbs sunlight and passes that energy to the catalysts to split water into molecules of hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is a fuel that can be either burned or used in a fuel cell to create electricity, reforming water in either case. This means that in theory, anyone with access to water can use it to create a cheap, clean, and available source of fuel.\"\n\nThere's only so much insolation to harvest. If this is cheaper and higher efficiency than existing solar cells, then great. Based on the article, it's only 5.5% efficient, so meh. But even if it were 100% efficient, it's not some magical free energy machine, and never can be. While it's true that \"nearly all the energy we use on this planet starts out as sunlight\", a lot of that energy arrived at earth several millenia ago. In the long run, we're going to need to either use less energy (preferably by making things more efficient, not making do with fewer things) and/or get some near-unlimited fuel source, like fusion.\n\nYup, I linked to a page claiming to \"debunk\" this \"myth\" on the basis it would take a solar panel the size of Georgia to power the whole earth. Big deal! Vastly more land is consumed by agriculture. Just reclaiming all the space on rooftops, roadways, and parking lots for solar would account for a lot of that, puttng power generation right where it's needed.\n\nAnd then there's there's the 2/3 of the earth covered by water nobody is making much use of. If cheap solar devices can produce hydrogen, it can be shipped long distances efficiently.\n\nAs you have discovered, the economics are precisely the key to solar energy. The power density (Watts/m^2) is unimportant, except for installations with unique constraints (e.g. spacecraft). For terrestrial applications, Watts/$ is the most interesting term.\n\nSimilarly, for economic reasons, I don't think electrolysis (or H2) is likely to succeed on a wide scale. The dirty secret of the H2 \"economy\" is that the hydrogen fuel cell cycle has a round trip efficiency of about 25%. A fuel cell is effectively a battery, and we already have substantially better batteries at a tiny fraction of the cost.\n\nPeople keep claiming that something the size of Georgia is a sane amount of the earth's surface to cover. You know that agricultural land isn't completely covered with manufactured material, right? Even if it were, how is doubling the human footprint on the planet reasonable? That article really is a successful debunking.\n\nI'm completely for solar energy research, and it can totally make sense for some applications, and why not cover an otherwise unused roof when solar cells are cheap enough. But you just have to look at the energy densities of various energy sources to understand that nukes are it. Nukes are much more sustainable than anything that requires to cover 0.01% or more of the earth's surface with anything manufactured. Nukes aren't perfect, but they're by far the most sustainable, safest, cheapest source of energy, if we could ever act rationally as a species.\n\nI mean, energy density ( isn't the whole story, but even the most pedestrian nuke fuel is four orders of magnitude denser than the most exotic chemical fuel. Five would be a realistic comparison, and then another order of magnitude for more refined fuel, and then another three orders of magnitude when fast breeders become really practical. We're talking about eight orders of magnitude denser energy!\n\nUranium isn't cheap to mine, but it almost doesn't matter, and silicon is not so cheap to refine, either.\n\nSo, I'm no expert, and I'm happy to hear some detailed arguments refuting my back-of-the-envelope ones. But even the most cursory glance at the issue from an engineering perspective says nukes are quite safe enough to be the most sustainable form of energy, even if you use TMI technology and just blow up a nuke plant every 10 years. The energy density, and therefor logistical considerations, are just ridiculously lopsided.\n\nAgain, I'm all for developing everything, and I'm working hard on residential-scale solar myself as a hobby. But basic physics says there will not be a fairytale ending for solar, wind, biofuels, or fossil fuels. Certainly, there will be local niches where each of these will be the right tool for the job, but at the planetary scale, we can do better than evolution. We have harnessed the power of the atom. WTF is wrong with us."}

However, scientists report difficulty incorporating these enzymes into electrical devices because the enzymes do not form good electrical connections with fuel cell components. Currently, precious metals, such as platinum, are typically needed to perform this catalysis.\n\nThe researchers combined hydrogenase enzymes with carbon nanotubes, submicroscopic strands of pure carbon that are excellent electrical conductors.

{"text": "Energy storage and generation systems\n\nAbstract: ThisHERS) and hydrogen oxidation reactions (HORs) in the same system. This disclosure further relates to energy storage and generation systems having low cost, fast response time, and acceptable life and performance\n\n2. Discussion of the Background Art\n\nThere are several technologies for energy storage and generation. These technologies can be divided into three subgroups: mechanical including pumped hydro, compressed air, fly wheels, and the like; electrical including super capacitors, super conducting magnets, and the like; and electrochemical including batteries, flow batteries, hydrogen storage, and the like. The current technology of electrochemical storage and generation is either expensive or inefficient or both. Generally, batteries can store and supply power at high efficiency, but are limited in capacity (total energy). Also, flow batteries are limited in power density and response time.\n\nFuel cells are often described as continuously operating batteries or as electrochemical engines. A typical fuel cell consists of two electrodes, an anode and a cathode, and a membrane interposed between the anode and cathode. Fuel cells operate by converting fuel combustion energy, such as hydrogen, to electrical power through an electrochemical process. It does so by harnessing the electrons released from controlled oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions occurring at the surface of a catalyst dispersed on the electrodes.\n\nRegenerative fuel cells typically operate in harsh environments that can have an adverse effect on catalyst activity in the fuel cell. An important issue connected to catalyst activity in regenerative fuel cells that utilize, for example, a halogen acid electrolyte, is poisoning of the hydrogen catalyst by the halides. The membrane cannot completely prevent electrolyte crossover from one side of the cell to the other. For example, in a hydrogen tri-bromide fuel cell (HTBFC), bromides, e.g., tri-bromide, diffuse to the hydrogen electrode and poison the catalyst. Despite the fact that hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction is fast and its overpotential is rather low compared to other voltage losses in the regenerative cell, in halogen ion-containing solutions, the catalyst is severely poisoned, and this raises the overpotential of the hydrogen electrode in the regenerative fuel cell.\n\nAcceptance of energy storage and generation technologies depends on their cycle life and performance capability. In particular, with regard to regenerative fuel cells, they can be run, in addition to the direct mode, in the reversible mode, consuming electricity and the products of the direct reaction in order to produce the reactants of the direct reaction. For regenerative fuel cell such as hydrogen/bromine fuel cells, an important factor limiting its cycle life and efficiency is the degradation of the operating fuel cell materials. These materials are exposed to a highly corrosive bromine electrolyte for long periods of time at elevated temperature.\n\nEnergy storage and generation devices are needed for wide application with regenerative energy sources. Such storage and generation devices are useful in matching a varying energy supply to a varying energy demand.\n\nA need exists for energy storage and generation systems that exhibit operational stability in harsh environments, e.g., both charging and discharging reactions in a regenerative fuel cell in the presence of a halogen ion or a mixture of halogen ions. Also, a need exists for energy storage and generation systems that are capable of conducting both hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) and hydrogen oxidation reactions (HORs) in the same system. It would be desirable in the art to provide energy storage and generation systems having low cost, e.g., low cost electrolytes, fast response time, and acceptable life and performance.\n\nThe present disclosure provides many advantages, which shall become apparent as described below.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThis disclosure generally in part to an energy storage and generation system comprising at least one vessel suitable for holding an electrolyte, at least one vessel suitable for holding a gas, also relates in part to a energy storage and generation system comprising at least one vessel suitable for holding an electrolyte, at least one vessel suitable for holding a gas, and one or more stacks of regenerative fuel cells comprising a solution or electrolyte compartment, a gas compartment and a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) disposed between the solution or electrolyte compartment and the gas compartment.

The energy storage and generation systems can achieve high power for fuel cell technology\u2014up to 1.5 W/cm2 (at 80\u00b0 C.), while achieving low cost storage price due to the implementation of low cost electrolytes. The energy storage and generation systems of this disclosure also exhibit fast response time.\n\nThe energy storage and generation systems of this disclosure include an electrolyte circulation loop which comprises one or more valves, one or more pumps, and optionally a pressure equalizing line. The energy storage and generation systems of this disclosure also include a gas circulation loop which comprises one or more valves, one or more pumps, a gas purifier, a liquid absorber, a gas circulation ejector, and optionally a gas compressor.\n\nThe energy storage and generation systems of this disclosure can include a management system. The management system may be any suitable controller device, such as a computer or microprocessor, and preferably contains logic circuitry which decides how to operate the various valves, pumps, circulation loops, and the like.\n\nFIG. 1 illustrates a process block diagram of the energy storage and generation system of this disclosure. The system is divided into two sides, i.e., an electrolyte side 10 and a gas, i.e., hydrogen, side 15. The fuel cell stacks 20 are located between the reactants. The electrolyte side 10 consists of electrolyte tank 25 and an electrolyte circulation pump 30. The pump 30 circulates the liquid electrolyte through the fuel cell stack 20 during energy storage stage and during energy generation stage. The hydrogen side 15 consists of a hydrogen tank 35, hydrogen circulation ejector 40, hydrogen purifier 45 for treatment of hydrogen exiting the fuel cell stack 20, liquid absorber 50 for separation of draft droplets from the hydrogen leaving the fuel cell stack 20, and an optional hydrogen compressor 55 for compressing hydrogen into the tank 35.\n\nThe general operation principle of the regenerative fuel cell system can be described with respect to the energy storage stage (both electrolyte line and hydrogen line) and energy generation stage (both electrolyte line and hydrogen line).\n\nWith regard to the electrolyte line of the energy storage stage, electrolyte flows from the electrolyte tank 25 into the fuel cell stacks 20 and is oxidized. Electrolyte from the fuel cell stacks 20 is taken up by the electrolyte pump 30 and pumped back into the electrolyte tank 25.\n\nWith regard to the hydrogen line of the energy storage stage, hydrogen is produced in the fuel cell stacks 20 and thereafter flows into the hydrogen purifier 45. Traces of liquid inside the hydrogen stream are absorbed in the liquid absorber 50. The hydrogen is then optionally compressed by a compressor 55 to facilitate compressing of hydrogen into tank 35.\n\nWith regard to the electrolyte line of the energy generation stage, electrolyte flows from the electrolyte tank 25 into the fuel cell stacks 20 and is reduced. Electrolyte from the fuel cell stacks 20 is taken up by the electrolyte pump 30 and pumped back into the electrolyte tank 25.\n\nWith regard to the hydrogen line of the energy generation stage, hydrogen from the tank 35 flows through the hydrogen circulation ejector 40 and then to the fuel cell stacks 20. Hydrogen is oxidized inside of the fuel cell stacks 20. Any excess hydrogen (not reacted) exits the fuel cell stacks 20 and flows to the hydrogen purifier 45. Traces of liquid inside the hydrogen stream are absorbed in the liquid absorber 50. The hydrogen is then optionally compressed by a compressor 55 to facilitate compressing of hydrogen into tank 35.\n\nThe electrolytes useful in the energy storage and generation systems of this disclosure comprise a halogen acid, a mixture of halogen acids, an iron salt and conjugated acid thereof, or a mixture of iron salts and conjugated acids thereof. The gas useful in the energy storage and generation systems of this disclosure comprises hydrogen.\n\nIn halogen\u2014hydrogen regenerative fuel cells, the electrolyte consists of a halogen acid or a mixture of halogen acids. On charging (electrolysis mode) the halogen molecule, tri-atom and penta-atom complex ions form (depending on the type of the acid used and its concentration) at the halogen positive electrode.\n\nFor example, when a high concentration of HBr is used, the oxidation products are: Br\u2212 as the major product, a small concentration of Br5\u2212 ions, and a small concentration of dissolved bromine molecules. When using mixture of halogen acids, a mixture of complexes can be formed such as for example: ClBr2\u2212, Br2I\u2212 and IBr2\u2212.\n\nThese ions and the dissolved halogen molecule are the oxidation compounds that, on discharge accept electrons from the positive electrode and turn back into the halogen acid (HX). The particular halogen acid to be used in the energy storage and generation systems of this disclosure depends on the end-use application. For example, HCl has a high vapor pressure in comparison to HBr and HI, but the hydrogen chlorine cell has higher voltage. A passive acid (i.e., a acid that does not take part in the cell reactions) such as phosphoric acid can be added to increase electrolyte viscosity. This reduces halide complex ions crossing over to the hydrogen electrode with minor effect on proton conductivity. Other passive acids include sulfuric acid or trifluoromethanesulfuric acid that can be added to increase electrolyte conductivity.\n\nFor example, in a hydrogen\u2014tribromide regenerative fuel cell, the hydrogen-tribromide fuel cells and electrolyzers consist of a bromine electrode and a hydrogen electrode with a proton-conducting membrane between them. All cell components, especially the electrodes, must be capable of resisting corrosion by bromine and hydrobromic acid.\n\nThe hydrogen\u2014tribromide regenerative fuel cell reaction (discharge) is given by equation 1:\n\nH2+Br22HBr [1]\n\nFrom the reversible cell voltage given by the Nernst equation as shown in equation 2, it can be seen that the hydrogen-bromine cell voltage decreases with increasing HBr activity, and increases with H2 pressure and Br2 activity.\n\nThe formation of bromine complexes reduces Eo by less than 0.1 V. The experimental output circuit voltage (OCV) values at room temperature for a fully-charged regenerative hydrogen-bromine fuel cell based on nano-porous proton conducting membrane (NP-PCM) containing 3-7M HBr are about 1V.\n\nBromine is highly soluble in aqueous electrolytes. The solubility of bromine in water increases in the presence of bromides as a result of the formation of complex ions like Br3\u2212 and Br5\u2212. For example, the solubility of bromine in 1M HBr at 25\u00b0 C. is 1.495 mole/liter, while in 3.1M NaBr it is 6.83M (partly due to the formation of higher complexes like Br5\u2212). The color of the solution is yellow at low bromine (or tribromide) concentration and deep red at high bromine (or tribromide) concentrations. The molar absorptivity of bromine gas at 405 nm is 162 and that for aqueous bromine solution at 393 nm is 164.\n\nThe formation of tribromide ion in the presence of bromine and bromide is a fast reaction given by equation 3:\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction at 25\u00b0 C. is 17. As a result, in practical fuel cells and electrolyzers containing 3 to 7M HBr, most of the bromine is present as tribromide ions (and some as pentabromide ions) and the concentration of free bromine is low. For example, at 25\u00b0 C. in a solution of 3M HBr and 1M Br2, the concentrations of Br3\u2212 and Br2 (ignoring the formation of pentabromide ions which further reduces the bromine concentration) are 0.97 M and 0.03 M respectively.\n\nIn the hydrogen-bromine fuel cell, there are two major parallel reactions at the bromine electrode (equations 4 and 5):\n\nSince, in practical fuel cells with high HBr concentration, the concentration of free bromine is much smaller than that of the tribromide ion, it is expected that the reaction in equation 4 prevails. In this (and similar) regenerative fuel cells, the oxidizing species such as Br3\u2014 and Br2 crossover to the hydrogen electrode and reduce regenerative fuel cell performance. This can be reduced by using a selective membrane such as nanoporous proton conducting membrane which reduces this crossover significantly. In order to reduce the bromine (Br2) concentration, or to increase its molecular size, organic compounds such as N-ethylpyrrolidinium bromide, N-methylpyrrolidinium bromide, N-chloroethylpyrrolidinium bromide, N-chloromethylpyrrolidinium bromide, and others can be used at low concentrations to complex. However, it is necessary to pick organic compounds that do not interfere with the hydrogen electrode. Also, the additives concentration should be low enough to avoid phase separation.\n\nIn iron\u2014hydrogen regenerative fuel cells, the electrolyte consists of an iron salt and the conjugated acid or a mixture of different iron salts their conjugated acids to achieve multiple iron ligands. The charge transfer process in Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox couple is an inner sphere process, therefore the charge transfer kinetics is highly dependent on the nature of the iron complex and its electrochemical characteristics. In the presence of different ligands, Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions can take a form of free ions or complexes in the solution, hence presenting a challenge in choosing the optimal electrolyte composition and the optimal operation conditions for each composition. The cell reaction is given in equation 6a for a monoprotic acid and equation 6b for diprotic acid.\n\nH2+FeX3FeX2+HX [6a]\n\nH2+Fe2(X)3FeX+H2X [6b]\n\nIllustrative iron salts and conjugated acids useful in the energy storage and generation systems of this disclosure include:\n\nYou can also Monitor Keywords and Search for tracking patents relating to this Energy storage and generation storage and generation systems or other areas of interest. ###"}

{"text": "Snails: Eat, Kill, use as a battery?\n\nThe view of many is that snails are either something to eat, something you accidentally squash underfoot, or a pest to keep at bay by pouring lines of salt in front of your garden flowers. However, a team of researchers at Ben-Gurion University, Israel, envision a potentially different future for your garden pest.\n\nHow about using a gastropod as a source of fuel?\n\nThe study, 'Implanted Biofuel Cell Operating in a Living Snail' has been published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. As grim as it may sound, and as Chemistry World pointed out, by using the kind of technology suggested in the film The Matrix, the researchers managed to implant a biofuel cell into a living land snail in order to generate electricity.\n\nEach cell is made from carbon nanotude 'paper', modified with enzymes that produce sugar. As the snail fed or relaxed, some of the glucose generated found its way into the fuel cell \u2014 therefore generating an electrical output.\n\nThe 'electric' snail was able to continually renew these glucose levels consumed by biocatalytic electrodes, and maintain this kind of energy generation for long periods of time.\n\nBy using such a small organism, the maximum power output achieved from the biofuel cells was only 7.45\u00b5W, so even for a low-consumption device it would take a substantial amount of snails to power.\n\n \u2014 where electricity is generated by the 'host' itself rather than an external source.\n\nImplantable biofuel cells have been suggested as a means to sustainably power devices operating in living organisms, but there are few examples currently available, especially in the cases of abiotic and enzyme-based biofuel cells operating in animals.\n\nThe team reports that the snail with the implanted biofuel cell was able to continue living naturally without detrimental effects caused by the implant, and the success of this experiment shows there may be a way to power electrical devices through a 'host' in the future\n\nSnails as batteries\n\nSo does this mean that in the future we could have a basment full of snails, rather than a roof full of solar panels. The thought of living of the lives of other creatures makes humans sound like leaches, although in monitary terms I suppose there are already plenty out there.\n\nIt does sound a little like the Matrix\n\nMy first thought, even before I read the article was that it sounded like the way the machines harvested energy in The Matrix. But after reading the piece, and realizing we all generate electricity to live, the idea of using our own built-in power to run our own \"accessories\" is a breakthrough. It would be great to see electronic implants not requiring invasive surgery to simply change out a battery.\n\nLet's 'Matrix' a bit more on that\n\nIt says in the article \"...some of the glucose generated found its way into the fuel cell ??? therefore generating an electrical output.\" So, if I understand this right, then this is an invention that could help diabetics. Place some of that nanostuff in a diabetic's nose and he/she can power their iPod by eating candy. Great!\n\nCould we do that with politicians?\n\nIf people werent so tetchy about artificial genomes,\n\nthis kind of research wouldnt be so contentious.\n\nI mean breeding snails to use as a power source, quoted as being too small to be of any real use... Whats the point? The money and thought would be better aimed at growing a biological battery based on lower life redesigned to do the job, and also less likely to upset the fanatics and animal-lovers - The research is going ahead anyway, as is artificially sequenced life.\n\nThe technology to print nanostructures to grow the cells in is here, now, why are they still poking wires into animals?\n\nRe-Read\n\nOK people, to keep you from having to read it over again, here's your answer taken from the article: \" ??? where electricity is generated by the ???host??? itself rather than an external source.\"\n\nThanks, I got that.\n\nI'm not taken in by the matrix thing either, I did say battery. My point was that if they are going to do any research into using living tissue to generate electricity - be it for powering a city or a medical device - it'd best be based on artificially designed cells for ethical as well as technical reasons, biocompatibility and efficiency being two that spring to mind. I have no problem with sticking electrodes into people (they can ***** if it sparks) but animal research is getting old rather fast"}
{"text": "Latest News\n\nNorth / South America\n\nResearchers at George Washington University have invented a solar-powered process that makes lime from limestone without emitting any carbon dioxide and demonstrated it in a proof-of-concept device. The researchers estimate that the process could cost less than the conventional one.\n\nThe new process could eliminate a major global source of carbon dioxide emissions. Lime is used to make cement, purify iron, treat soil, and produce glass, paper, sugar, and other things. Cement production alone emits 5 to 6 percent of total man-made greenhouse gases, and most of that comes from producing lime.\n\nRather than simply heating up limestone until it releases carbon dioxide, as in the conventional method, the process uses a combination of heat and electrolysis, which produces lime, oxygen, and either carbon or carbon monoxide, depending on the temperatures used. The researchers built a device that includes three Fresnel lenses for concentrating sunlight. Two of those heat a mixture of lithium carbonate and limestone (calcium carbonate). The third focuses light on a high-efficiency solar cell, which provides the electricity needed to electrolyze the carbonate mixture. High temperatures reduce the amount of electricity needed and cause the lime to precipitate out of the mixture, making it easy to separate.\n\nThe device works only when it's sunny, and intermittent operation isn't ideal for an industrial process.

News story originally written on August 8, 2008\n\nTwo scientists have discovered a simple and inexpensive way to obtain pure oxygen from water using a small amount of electricity. This discovery may become an important new green-energy source.\n\nDaniel Nocera, a chemistry professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a graduate student named Matthew Kanan made this discovery in a chemistry lab. To produce oxygen, they added a few chemicals (cobalt and phosphate) to neutral water and then inserted a conductive-glass electrode. As soon as they applied a current, a dark film began to form on the electrode from which tiny pockets of oxygen began to appear, eventually building into a stream of bubbles.\n\nAfter analyzing the electrode, Nocera and Kanan concluded that a cobalt-phosphate mixture, possibly combined with phosphate, had deposited as a film. They believe the film is what helps break apart the water molecules to create oxygen gas. The protons (hydrogen nuclei) released from the process pick up electrons and convert back into hydrogen at a partner electrode.\n\nOxygen and hydrogen are energy-rich fuels. This new technique could be a cheap energy source for people to use when the Sun goes down. While this might not be available as a home-based energy source for about ten more years, this discovery is a major step forward.Electricity and magnetism are two very important topics in the science of physics.

They say the new method should lower the cost of such cells by reducing the waste and breakage of the brittle semiconductor.\n\nThe expensive solar cells now are used mainly on spacecraft, but with the improved wafer-slicing method, \"the idea is to make germanium-based, high-efficiency solar cells for uses where cost now is a factor,\" particularly for solar power on Earth, says Eberhard \"Ebbe\" Bamberg, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering. \"You want to do it on your roof.\"\n\nDinesh Rakwal, a doctoral student in mechanical engineering, adds: \"We're coming up with a more efficient way of making germanium wafers for solar cells to reduce the cost and weight of these solar cells and make them defect-free.\"\n\nBamberg and Rakwal are publishing their findings in the Journal of Materials Processing Technology. Their study has been accepted, and a final version will be published online late this month or in early October, and in print in 2009.\n\nBrass-coated, steel-wire saws now are used to slice round wafers of germanium from cylindrical single-crystal ingots. But the brittle chemical element cracks easily, requiring broken pieces to be recycled, and the width of the saws means a significant amount of germanium is lost during the cutting process. The sawing method was developed for silicon wafers, which are roughly 100 times stronger.\n\nThe new method for slicing solar cell wafers known as wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM) wastes less germanium and produces more wafers by cutting even thinner wafers with less waste and cracking.

{"text": "Michael Gratzel, a chemistry professor from the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, in Switzerland and Peng Wang, a professor at the Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences have recently been able to create new, efficient dye-sensitized solar cells called Gratzel cells. The new cells use nonvolatile electrolytes, achieving, for the first time, a level of efficiency close to conventional thin-film solar cell technology.\n\n\u2020\n\nMichael Gratzel\n(Credit: EPFL)\n\nGratzel cells, named after their inventor, Michael Gratzel, have long been considered a promising technology for reducing the cost of solar power. Potentially cheaper to make than conventional solar cells, Gratzel cells can be printed quickly. The cell's full potential hasn't yet been realized because in order to achieve efficiency levels high enough to compete with conventional solar cells, it is necessary to use volatile electrolytes which need to be carefully sealed inside the cells, an expensive and unreliable step in the manufacturing process.\n\n\u2020\n\nHowever, in a recent development, Gratzel and Wang have made efficient solar cells that use nonvolatile electrolytes, achieving an efficiency level equivalent to conventional solar cells. Additionally, the solar cells remained stable when exposed to light and high temperatures for 1,000 hours, \"pushing the technology close to over the '10 percent hump,' which is where a thin-film technology needs to be to be economically competitive,\" says Tonio Buonassisi, a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT.\n\n\u2020\n\nOne of the electrolytes used in the new solar cells is called ionic fluid - a fluid largely made up of ions and often composed of salts that have low melting temperatures. An ionic fluid can be used with plastic electrodes, which would allow for solar cells that are both efficient and flexible, and therefore could be incorporated into clothing, awnings, and covers for cars. The ionic fluid was mixed with a new dye which absorbs light far better than the conventional dye. Because the dye absorbs light so well, the thickness of the active material in the solar cell can be cut in half, which makes it easier for electrons to escape the solar cell and reach an external circuit, in turn increasing efficiency.\n\n\u2020\n\nWhen the researchers tried pairing the new dye with a nonvolatile solvent-based electrolyte they reached slightly higher efficiencies. The downside is that the electrolyte is not quite as stable as an ionic liquid, and it can't be used with plastic.\n\n\u2020\n\nThe dye-sensitized solar cells can be used for applications such as recharging cell phones, especially in countries with unreliable electricity, as well as doubling as the facade on buildings.

Scott, in a statement. \"Microbial fuel cells coupled with extremely low-power electronics and a low energy requirement for mobility addresses gaps in power technology applicable to all robotic systems, especially planetary robotics.\"\n\nThe Office of Naval Research has been exploring the use of microbes in fuel cells for a number of years, primarily for sensing equipment used to monitor ocean environments. In 2010, the Navy showcased a group of microbial fuel cell projects at a Pentagon Earth Day event including one that tracks the location of sea turtles feeding near seaports, in order to avoid collisions with ships or construction projects.\n\nAs research chemist Dr. Leonard Tender of the Naval Research Laboratory explained in a press statement for that earlier event:\n\n\"We work on the intersection of microbiology and electrochemistry,\" Tender said. \"The most fascinating aspect of the program is how these micro-organisms function and the mechanisms by which they take fuel, metabolize it and generate electrical current.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the new planetary rover is being designed to run on the Geobacter species discovered in 1987, when Dr. Derek Lovely of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst found it dwelling in the mud in the Potomac River near Washington D.C. It is a type of bacteria that thrives in anaerobic (oxygen-free) environments \u2014 perfect for space travel and other environments hostile to human life.\n\nAnaerobic bacteria are commonly used in wastewater treatment to break down organic material rapidly and efficiently. As they digest the nutrients in wastewater, the bacteria produce energy in the form of methane gas, so their application to other forms of energy production is a natural next step.\n\nGeobacters are of particular interest because they can transfer electrons outside of the cell and move them over relatively long distances through filaments called microbial nanowires. In other words, they can generate electricity directly from common, inexpensive feedstocks, including vinegar. The microrover project is focused on a Geobacter called G. sulfurreducens.\n\nBecause of their energy density, Geobacters have the potential to enable the production of a fuel cell with less mass but greater efficiency than the next best thing, a lithium-ion battery.\n\nHowever, the microrover concept is still in the initial research stages and the team will have to overcome some foundational obstacles inherent in current microbial fuel cell technology, which relies on bulky pumping systems.\n\nAs for the Navy's interest in space travel, that derives from its entwined mission with the U.S. Air Force, overarched by the relationship between NASA and the U.S. military. As a precursor to space travel, the Office of Naval Research broke a record for a manned, high-altitude balloon flight in the 1950's.\n\nThe microrover project was funded through a research grant from the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program, which is an incubator for \"high risk-high payoff ideas\" similar to DARPA, the military research agency that engendered the Internet among other things. NIAC was initiated during the Clinton Administration as the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts. That program was shelved toward the end of the Bush administration but was revived in its current form under President Obama."}

You'll get double the benefits by doing this science fair project\u2014learn about science and learn how to help the environment at the same time.\n\nObjective\n\nIn this science project, you will learn how a fuel cell works and compare its efficiency to that of an internal combustion engine.\n\nCredits\n\nMichelle Maranowski, PhD, Science Buddies\n\nShare your story with Science Buddies!\n\nIntroduction\n\nA fuel cell is an electrochemical device that converts the energy in chemicals into electricity. A battery is also an electrochemical device that converts chemical energy into electricity, but there is a limited supply of chemicals in a battery, so eventually the chemicals are all consumed and the battery no longer supplies electricity. In a fuel cell, however, the chemicals can be replenished, so the fuel cell can continue to produce electricity.\n\nIn a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) the fuel used is hydrogen and the byproduct of the PEMFC is clean water. The standard method of creating electricity is by burning fossil fuels which can be harmful to our environment. A big advantage of fuel cells is that they do not create pollution. In addition, the fuel cell has no moving parts so it doesn't break down like an internal combustion engine can. This means that there could be fewer breakdowns for a car that uses a fuel cell, compared to a car with a standard internal combustion engine.\n\nThe fuel cell was first demonstrated by William Grove in 1839. The first thing that Grove did was to pass a current through water and separate water into its components: hydrogen and oxygen. This process is called electrolysis. He then wondered if electrolysis could be reversed. The answer was yes. When the hydrogen and oxygen recombined, an electric current was produced. While William Grove invented an interesting device, the fuel cell remained a lab curiosity for many years due to the expense of making one, as well as other complexities. Finally, in the 1930s, Francis Thomas Bacon developed an alkali electrolyte fuel cell, which was eventually used in NASA's Apollo missions.\n\nThe fuel cell is made up of five parts: the anode, a catalyst layer, an electrolyte layer, another catalyst layer, and finally, the cathode. Fuel, such as hydrogen gas in the case of a PEMFC, enters the system at the anode. The hydrogen gas then reacts with the catalyst layer, ionizes, and is separated into hydrogen ions and electrons, as shown here:\n\n2H2 \u2192\n4H+ + 4e-\n\nIn the dissolution reaction above, two hydrogen molecules are ionized into four positively charged hydrogen ions and four negatively charged electrons. As described above, this reaction is called electrolysis. The electrons move externally out of the PEMFC into the cathode. This is because the electrolyte, the layer sandwiched between the anode and the cathode, allows only positive H+ ions to pass through. The electrons that move out of the fuel cell (electricity) are used to power loads such as lights or motors. At the same time, oxygen gas comes into the fuel cell at the cathode. The oxygen, electrons, and hydrogen ions react at the cathode catalyst and create water, as shown in the reaction below:\n\nO2 + 4e- + 4H+\n\u2192 2H2O\n\nFigure 1.\nThis is a schematic of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The two catalyst layers are between the anode and the electrolyte, and the electrolyte and the cathode.\n(U.S. Department of Energy, 2007.)\n\nThe second reaction shown above is typical of a PEMFC using hydrogen gas as the fuel. There are several different types of fuel cells, each with advantages and disadvantages. Some of the advantages of the PEMFC are that they start up rapidly and are compact and lightweight. One major disadvantage is that the electrolyte is required to be saturated with water for optimal operation.\n\nFuel cells are used in many industries, including consumer electronics, telecommunications, and transportation. Several cities have buses that are powered by fuel cells instead of by internal combustion engines, which are powered by gasoline.\n\nFigure 2.\nThis is a zero-emission bus. (U.S. Department of Energy, 2007.)\n\nIn this science fair project you will accomplish two things. You will help the environment and learn about this area of science by investigating the efficiency of the PEMFC. The thermal efficiency of the standard internal combustion engine is much less than 40%.

Basic help can be found in the\nElectronics Primer. However, if you do not have experience in putting together\nelectrical circuits you may find it helpful to have someone who can answer questions\nand help you troubleshoot if your project is not working. A science teacher or parent\nmay be a good resource. If you need to find another mentor, try asking a local electrician,\nelectrical engineer, or person whose hobbies involve building things like model\nairplanes, trains, or cars. You may also need to work your way up to this project\nby starting with an electronics project that has a lower level of difficulty.\n\nFuel Cell Setup\n\nOpen the fuel cell kit and make sure that you have all of the pieces described in the operating instructions manual. Read through the manual to confirm that you have all of the pieces and to understand how your fuel cell operates.\n\nIncluded in the kit will be an \"RFC,\" which stands for reversible fuel cell. This means that the cell can be used to electrolyze water and as a fuel cell that creates power.\n\nThe top of the fuel cell has a sticker that shows which side is the hydrogen side and which is the oxygen side. The bottom of the fuel cell has a plastic stand that allows the fuel cell to sit upright.\n\nThe first step is to hydrate the electrolyte material. Take the syringe and suck water into it by placing the tip of the syringe into the distilled water and pulling the plunger. Suck about 4 milliliters (mL) into the syringe.\n\nTake the protective tubing off of the cell. Take an extra piece of short tubing (included in the kit) and push it onto the bottom inlet on the hydrogen side of the fuel cell. The fuel cell is labeled on top with a sticker for convenience.\n\nNow push the syringe onto the tubing and slowly inject the distilled water into the fuel cell. After 2-3 seconds you will see water coming out from the top inlet.\n\nTake the short tubing off of the bottom inlet on the hydrogen side and connect it to the bottom inlet of the oxygen side. Repeat steps 4 and 6.\n\nTo obtain the best operation of the fuel cell, the electrolyte needs to be hydrated, but the fuel cell should not be full of water. Remove excess water from the cell. Use the empty syringe to push and pull the excess water from the fuel cell. You can also tap the fuel cell gently.\n\nOnce the excess water has been removed from the fuel cell, plug the top inlets on both the hydrogen side and the oxygen side. Construct plugs using the short pieces of tubing, along with the included clips. Open one of the clips and then slide the tubing through the clip almost all the way to the end. Close the clip. This squeezes the end of the tubing shut. Plugging the top inlets prevents the electrolyzed gases from escaping. See Figure 3. Once this is completed, the unit is ready for electrolysis.\n\nFigure 3. Shown are the short tubing and clips for constructing the plugs.\n\nElectrolysis\n\nThe first step to using this unit as a fuel cell is to electrolyze water. This creates the fuel. Caution: Hydrogen is flammable, so keep the fuel cell and hydrogen storage tank away from sparks.\n\nConnect the hydrogen and oxygen storage tanks exactly as described in the operating instructions manual. Fill both outer cylinders with distilled water up to the \"0\" mark.\n\nConnect the long tubing piece to the inlet of the inner cylinder. Make sure that the little notch on the bottom of the inner cylinder of the tank is not blocked by the rim of the outer cylinder of the tank. Also confirm that the inner cylinder is seated tightly inside of the outer cylinder. Write down the water level in your lab notebook in a data table.\n\nConnect the hydrogen storage tank, via the tubing, to the bottom inlet on the hydrogen side and the oxygen storage tank to the bottom inlet of the oxygen side. Make sure that the tubing is tightly sealed on both inlets.\n\nInsert the 3 AA batteries into the empty battery pack. Make sure to connect the batteries in the correct polarity. There is a diagram on the inside of the pack that you can follow.\n\nNow get the timer, digital multimeter, and resistor ready for measurement. Be sure to put on your safety goggles. If you are using more than one resistor, then twist all of the metal leads on one end of the resistors together and the leads on the other end of the resistors together. See Figure 5 for how the resistors should look. Take your multimeter and measure the value of the resistor or combination of resistors. Read the multimeter instruction manual to learn how to measure resistance. Note the resistance down in your lab notebook.\n\nTake the black alligator cable and clip one end to the black wire from the battery pack. Clip the other end to the black connection of the fuel cell. Clip the red cable to the red wire from the battery pack and the other end of the alligator cable to the resistor. Use the third alligator cable to clip to the other end of the resistor. Finally, clip the other end of the third alligator cable to the red connection of the fuel cell. The resistor is in series with the battery pack and will allow you to measure the current being supplied to the fuel cell. See Figure 4 for a diagram of the circuit.\n\nAs soon as you clip the red alligator cable to the red connection of the fuel cell, the distilled water will start to electrolyze into hydrogen and oxygen. Prior to doing this, make sure that the timer is ready. Have your helper be responsible for the timer. Clip the cable onto the fuel cell and start timing the electrolysis. Figure 5 shows the fuel cell in electrolysis mode.\n\nYou will see evidence of electrolysis when the level of the distilled water in the inner cylinder decreases. Hydrogen gas is pushing the water out. You can see the amount of hydrogen created by reading the change in water level from step 2. Note this down in your lab notebook.\n\nUsing the multimeter, determine the voltage drop across the fuel cell. This is the input voltage. Measure across the fuel cell's red and black terminals. Read the document Using a Multimeter in the Science Buddies Science Fair Project Guide to learn how to use a digital multimeter to measure voltage. Record the data in your lab notebook. Having your helper help keep track of the time, take a measurement 10 seconds after electrolysis starts. Then take three additional voltage measurements; one after 30 seconds, one after 1 minute and then after 1.5 minutes. Record the data in your lab notebook. Average the voltage measurements to obtain the average input voltage.\n\nUsing the multimeter, determine the current that is being supplied to the fuel cell. This is the input current. Measure the voltage drop across the resistor. Record the data in your lab notebook. Measure the voltage drop across the resistor each time that you measure the input voltage to the fuel cell. Once you know the voltage drop across the resistor and the value of the resistor you can use Ohm's law to calculate the input current. Simply divide the voltage drop across the resistor (in volts) by the value of the resistor (in ohms). The units of measure for current is amperes. Record the data in your lab notebook. Average the current measurements to obtain the average input current.\n\nTime the electrolysis until the hydrogen tank is full. You will know that you have filled the hydrogen tank when all of the water in the inner cylinder has been displaced and you see the water bubbling. Stop the timer and record the time in your lab notebook. Continue electrolyzing oxygen. Once you see the oxygen tank bubbling, wait for an additional 15 seconds. This will clear out any additional water in the fuel cell. The fuel cell operates at its best when there is no extra water in the fuel cell. Disconnect the battery pack from the fuel cell.\n\nCalculate the energy to electrolyze hydrogen. Energy is the amount of power expended in an amount of time. Electrical power is defined in Equation 1 and Energy is defined in Equation 2. Equation 3 is derived by substituting 'power' in Equation 2 with the definition of 'power' from Equation 1.\n\nUsing equation 3, calculate the energy necessary to electrolyze water into hydrogen and oxygen and record the value in your lab notebook. Please notice that in equation 3 you are calculating the input energy using the average current. The accurate way to calculate the input energy is to first integrate the current over the time it took to electrolyze, and then multiply that by the average voltage However, for the purpose of this science fair project, you can estimate the integral by averaging the current.\n\nt is the time taken in seconds to electrolyze a full storage tank of hydrogen.\n\nFigure 4. This is a diagram of the circuit for this project.\n\nFigure 5. (a) This is the battery connection for electrolysis mode. (b) Several resistors connected together to make a smaller resistance.\n\nCreating Energy\n\nConnect a load to the fuel cell. Included in the kit is a small motor. This will be the load.\n\nGet the timer and digital multimeter ready.\n\nConnect the motor in the same way as the battery pack. Connect the motor to the fuel cell in the correct way, as follows. Take the black alligator cable and clip one end to the black wire from the motor. Clip the other end to the black connector on the fuel cell. Take the red alligator cable and clip one end to the red wire of the motor. Clip the other end to the resistor. Take the third cable and clip it to the other end of the resistor. Finally, clip the free end of the third cable to the red connector on the fuel cell. Immediately start timing the fuel cell mode. The resistor is in series with the motor and will allow you to measure the current the fuel cell is supplying to the motor.\n\nAs soon as the connection is made from the fuel cell to the motor, the post on the motor will start rotating. It will make a whirring sound. To make the motor action more visible you can attach a propeller or blade onto the motor's post.\n\nFigure 6. This is the fuel cell supplying voltage to the motor.\n\nAs the reaction of the fuel cell continues, the hydrogen in the storage tank is being consumed. You will see water re-entering the inner cylinder.\n\nUsing the multimeter, measure the voltage being supplied by the fuel cell to the motor, after the motor settles down. Have your helper help you keep track of the time. Measure the voltage across the fuel cell terminals. Take three additional measurements after 2 minutes, after 5 minutes, and after 8 minutes, then average the voltage data. This is the output voltage. Record the data in your lab notebook.\n\nUsing the multimeter, measure the current being supplied by the fuel cell to the motor right after you take the voltage measurement. Measure the voltage across the measurement resistor. Use Ohm's law to calculate the current. Take three additional measurements\u2014after 2 minutes, after 5 minutes, and after 8 minutes\u2014then average the current data. This is the output current. Record the data in your lab notebook.\n\nStop the timer as soon as the motor stops running. You will know when the motor stops running when you stop hearing the whirring sound. Record the time in your lab notebook.\n\nUse Equation 4 to calculate the output energy.\n\nEquation 4:\n\nOutput Energy\n\n=\n\n(Average Current Supplied by FC) \u00d7 (Average Voltage Supplied by FC) \u00d7 (Running Time of Motor)\n\nE\n\n=\n\n(I)(V)(t)\n\nE is the output energy in joules (J).\n\nI is the average current supplied by the fuel cell, in amperes (A).\n\nV is the average voltage supplied by the fuel cell, in volts (V).\n\nt is the time the motor runs in seconds.\n\nWith the input energy and the output energy, calculate the efficiency of the fuel cell for every trial with Equation 5. Record this number in your lab notebook.\n\nEquation 5:\n\nEfficiency =\n\nOutput Energy Input Energy\n\nRepeat this experiment at least two more times, starting from \"Fuel Cell Startup\" through \"Creating Energy.\" Prior to every trial, gently take the inner cylinder out of the outer cylinder for both the hydrogen and oxygen storage tanks. Disconnect the storage tanks from the fuel cell. Unplug the top inlets on the fuel cell. Gently shake the fuel cell to remove any excess water. Take a short length of tubing and attach it to the bottom inlet of the hydrogen side. Use the syringe to blow air into the fuel cell. This will move any excess gases out of the fuel cell. Stagnant gases in the fuel cell will affect efficiency. Repeat on the oxygen side.\n\nPlot the efficiency of the fuel cell. Compare it to the efficiency of a standard internal combustion engine. Label the x-axis Trial and the y-axis Efficiency.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nShare your story with Science Buddies!\n\nVariations\n\nHow does temperature affect the efficiency of the fuel cell? After electrolyzing water, try placing the fuel cell in the butter compartment of your refrigerator for 30 minutes and then repeating the \"Creating Energy\" steps of the project. Never freeze the fuel cell. Freezing the fuel cell will damage it. Try placing the fuel cell on a warm window sill or using a hair dryer to heat up the fuel cell.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\nIf you are having trouble with this project, please read the FAQ below. You may find the answer to your question.\n\nQ: I can't find a low enough resistor to do this project. How can I make one from 1-Ohm resistors?\n\nA:\nThere are two basic ways to connect resistors; in series or in parallel. A series connection of resistors is shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Resistors connected in a series configuration.\n\nIn the series configuration, the total resistance is a sum of the individual resistances.

If you can't find a resistor of\nthis value, then simply put together 3 1-Ohm resistors in parallel.Fuel Cell Engineer\n\nMost of the world's energy comes from fossil fuels. However, the amount of fossil fuels is finite, and many people are concerned about where our energy will come from in the future. We can turn to alternative, renewable sources of fuel, such as our sun (solar energy) and the winds (wind energy). But what happens when the sun doesn't shine or the winds don't blow? Would we be stuck? Well, that is where the fuel cell comes in. A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that generates electricity through a reaction between a fuel, like hydrogen, and an oxidant, like oxygen. This reaction produces few greenhouse gas emissions other than water or water vapor. The job of the fuel cell engineer is to design new fuel cell technology that improves the reliability, functionality, and efficiency of the fuel cell.

When the eel decides to use is electric charge for hunting or defense, it opens a flow of positively charged sodium ions over the electrocytes, which attracts and conducts the electric charge within the cells to discharge points. This process is what a research team in Maryland (USA) set out to reproduce.\n\nDavid LaVan of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Maryland and his colleagues wanted to study the operation of living cell membranes and their proteins. They began by experimenting on artificial \"protocells\". These, like real cells, were surrounded by membranes made of fatty molecules. Proteins \"floating\" in the membranes would let only certain ions pass. Using this system, the researchers realised that they might be able to copy the eel's electricity-generation mechanism.\n\nThe team fused two protocells together, so that they shared part of their respective membranes. They then added a dilute concentration of potassium chloride to one protocell and a more concentrated solution to the other. The difference in concentrations of potassium and chloride ions would normally cause ions to move from the less concentrated protocell to the more concentrated one. In this case, however, the membrane between the protocells was too thick to permit much of this kind of movement.\n\nNext, Dr LaVan and his colleagues installed a protein called alpha-hemolysin into the protocell membrane. This functioned as a selective bridge, permitting the passage of positively charged sodium ions, but not negatively charged chloride ions. As the selected ions moved in one direction, electrons (which are negatively charged) flowed in the opposite direction. To make use of this electrical current, the team connected tiny electrodes to the protocells.\n\nThe lab results were encouraging, producing a useable and sustainable current. Of course, this is lab work \u2013 a long way from practical testing, and even longer from commercial application. It is indicative, however, of the many approaches being taken to one of the most stubborn and important requirements for new technology \u2013 the better battery."}

{"text": "8 March 2010\n\nSilicon Microwires: A Powerful Lesson in Technology Strategy\n\nAs the world's supplies of conventional energy sources run lower and the problems of greenhouse gas emissions have become better known, the business opportunities for alternative energy sources have skyrocketed.\n\nThe challenge with many of those opportunities, however, is that they often have significant environmental costs of their own that must be dealt with. As a well-known example, nuclear power, however clean it might be able to operate provided all safeguards are considered, still leaves a mass of nuclear waste to dispose of in the long term. As another example, the battery systems of hybrid cars may present toxic disposal problems at end of their lives \u2014 and become a costly accumulation as adoption rates for these kind of vehicles increase.\n\nThough these examples are fairly obvious, one of the surprises to many who begin to investigate the full lifecycle issues with many so-called \"green\" or \"low carbon footprint\" technologies is how dirty some of those really are, especially as compared to the amount of energy they can provide.\n\nAs one recent study looking at alternative energy in the U.K. recently noted, if you consider full lifecycle carbon footprint implications (including all emissions from initial manufacturing and/or harvesting of raw materials all the way to eventual waste disposal), direction combustion of grass (for bioreactor energy) contributed almost 80 grams CO2 per kWh of energy eventually delivered. On the other end of the spectrum, Nuclear Energy produced only around 5 grams CO2 per kWh of energy.\n\nPerhaps those numbers aren't a surprise, but one that certainly will be to me is that current Photovoltaic Cell technology is actually fairly high in carbon footprint, with some 58 grams of CO2 produced per kWh of energy for installations based in the U.K. (The reference to the U.K. location is because total energy produced by solar cells is a function of how much sunlight is available for the cells to receive.) Comparatively, then, using a so-called \"clean\" solar cell produces almost 75% of the CO2 that burning grass in biomass reactors would produce.\n\nWhy are the Photovoltaic numbers so high? Because it takes a great deal of energy to produce solar cells in the first place. Once produced, the carbon emissions are lower, but the carbon footprint is already established and the damage is done.\n\nTo improve on this, many companies and research facilities have investigated the making of ultra thin film Photocell technology, which of course lowers both costs and overall carbon footprint. According to the Department of Energy, conventional single-crystal silicon cells produce approximately 10 X the energy required to produce them. Multicrystalline silicon can produce between 12 X and 16 X the energy required to produce them, depending on whether or not they are in a ribbon form.\n\nThose are mportant steps forward, but perhaps one of the most exciting of recent strategic innovations in this field is the one recently announced by graduate student Michael Kelzenberg and other materials scientists at CalTech in the February 14th issue of Nature Materials. (See also the related Scientific American article about the same work.) Their system reforms silicon into vertical \"microwires\" of crystalline structures (shown in the attached picture here). These microwires, which also include embedded nanoparticles of aluminum oxide to reflect more light inside (and therefore increase the efficiency of the systems), capture as much as 85% of the available solar spectrum while requiring only around 1% of the silicon conventional wafers would need.\n\nThis is of course only an early result and will take some time before moving from the lab to production reality. It is, however, an example of how asking the right strategic question of precisely the right group of people can make the biggest possible business impact. We look forward to hearing how this breakthrough innovation develops over the next few years. It will likely make a major difference in all of our lives \u2014 and make this part of \"Green Technology\" even greener than ever before"}

It worked.\n\nIntermittent tasks Since the researchers don't want to load down a bug with a heavy fuel cell and impair its ability to move, they envision storing the energy up in a battery, then using that energy to perform tasks such as power sensors.\n\nOne potential application is to equip social insects such as bees or ants with sensors tuned to detect a dangerous chemical and send them out to the environment.\n\nPeriodically, the sensor would turn on and broadcast its finding, shutting down between broadcasts to allow the battery time to recharge.\n\nOperating at 0.2 volts is enough power to send a message a few inches, according to Scherson, far enough that a message could be sent down a line of ants spying on a top-secret meeting in a park.\n\nTo get there, the researchers need to shrink their fuel cells so they can be fully implanted, find long-lasting materials to make them with so they don't breakdown inside the bugs' bodies, and build the signal transmitters"}
{"text": "A Battery Made From Bugs\n\nMicrobe queen Angela Belcher and a team of MIT researchers have devised a battery in which viruses built the cathode and anode, which potentially will cut costs and the use of chemicals.\n\nMichael Kanellos: March 31, 2009\n\nIn the future, your car could be built with viruses.\n\nScientists at MIT have concocted a lithium-ion battery in which the cathode and the anode, the positive and negative electrodes that swap charges, were partly put together by genetically modified viruses. It works as follows. The viruses are genetically engineered to secrete specific proteins. In turn, these proteins react to other chemicals in their environment to form structures.\n\nFor the cathode, the viruses were able to first attract and bind iron phosphate and then carbon nanotubes to create a network of conductive material. For the anode, the viruses attracted cobalt oxide and then gold particles to form a nanowire. The anode was developed three years ago, but the cathode and whole battery is new. Building the cathode was more difficult because cathodes need to conduct electricity rapidly. The carbon nanotubes, which conduct electricity faster than metals, help in this regard.\n\nThe prototype battery is a coin battery, but conceivably cell and larger batteries for powering cars could be made from this process. Right now, it can go at least 100 charges before performance tapers off, but that number will increase.\n\nThe idea behind industrial bioengineering is that viruses, bacteria and other microorganisms are really microscopic chemical factories. They eat, and through the metabolic process, subsequently secrete things. Wine, cheese, beer and antibiotics are, in that light, really the waste product of selectively fed and bred microbes. Microbes also work in dank environments, can be produced en masse and disposed of after a long work week. Try doing that to your new college hires.\n\nVarious green companies are tinkering with ways to use bugs on the factory floor as a way to replace energy-intensive processes (like cooking chemicals at high temperatures to produce other compounds) or noxious, fossil fuel based substances. Genomatica, for instance, has devised organisms that can produce chemicals like methyl ethyl ketone (see Genomatica: Microbe-Made Chemicals Could Save Empty Ethanol Plants). Several companies want to make ethanol or synthetic petroleum from bugs. More often than not, these researchers use genetically modified forms of e coli because its genome and ways to modify it are well understood. Many call it the workhorse of biotech.\n\nThe leader on the project is Angela Belcher, the Germeshausen Professor of Materials Science and Engineering and Biological Engineering. Belcher has been one of the leading scientists in exploring ways to exploit microbes and been the recipient of several awards. Some of her work has included devising organisms that secrete chemicals that can help bind insulating layers inside semiconductors or organisms that can detect weak points and stress lines in things like airplane wings. Cambrios Technologies was spun out a few years ago to commercialize some of her inventions. (She got into the field by wondering why abalones can produce hard shells out of what is essentially chalk.)\n\nOthers working on the battery include professor Gerbrand Ceder and graduate students Yun Jung Lee and Hyunjung Yi. Those two were the lead authors on a paper published in Science on the battery.\n\nWhen will cars rely on virus batteries? It could take time. Scaling microorganism production will take time and quite a bit of testing. Carbon nanotube production will also have to be improved. Now, nanotubes are often bought by the gram.\n\nThe team will also look at ways of developing lithium batteries with slightly different cathode chemistries which could be capable of storing more power."}

{"text": "Chemical energy is stored and released by the making and breaking of bonds between atoms. It is typically released when bonds are formed, and it is required to break them. Sometimes, however, compounds can be formed that store energy and release it later by undergoing chemical reactions, or rearranging themselves into molecules that, together, have less energy. These compounds can be created by natural processes, and by man. It is also possible to produce electricity chemically. There are many examples of chemical energy in action, both natural and man-made, including photosynthesis, respiration, combustion, explosives and batteries.\n\nChemical Reactions\n\nA chemical reaction will take place when the atoms involved can reach a lower energy state by rearranging themselves in a different way. For example, two hydrogen molecules can combine with one of oxygen to produce two water molecules. Some energy \u2014 such as a naked flame or spark \u2014 is required to break the bonds within the existing molecules, but much more is released by the formation of the new bonds. The hydrogen and oxygen molecules can be regarded as storing energy that can be released under the right circumstances. The opposite reaction, splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen, takes a great deal of energy, which is why water is very stable.\n\nPhotosynthesis\n\nUnder the right circumstances, it is possible to create molecules that can store a lot of energy, but this must first be supplied from somewhere. One of the best examples of chemical energy storage is photosynthesis by green plants. In this case, sunlight provides the power to combine carbon dioxide from the atmosphere with water to produce sugar molecules, which the plant uses as food. Since sugar has more energy than carbon dioxide and water, they cannot combine directly. Photosynthesis, however, is a complex process that creates the sugar indirectly in a series of steps, using the power of the Sun.\n\nRespiration\n\nCellular respiration can be viewed as the opposite of photosynthesis. When a person or other animal eats plant material, the sugar molecules are broken down, producing carbon dioxide and water. Since these, together, have less energy than the sugar, some is released. This is stored in a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by adding a phosphate group to another molecule called adenosine diphosphate (ADP). It can be released again, when required, by the removal of this phosphate group; although some energy is required to do this, much more is released by the new bonds that the unattached phosphate group forms.\n\nCombustion and Fuels\n\nOne of the most familiar examples of chemical energy is combustion. This is usually a reaction in which carbon and hydrogen in organic substances, such as wood or oil, combine with oxygen in the air to produce carbon dioxide, water, light and heat. It can also involve other elements, however. Combustion drives the motor car, powers the majority of electricity generating stations, and provides heat and cooking facilities for many homes.\n\nThe fuels used for combustion processes can be regarded as chemical stores of energy, much of which has ultimately come from the Sun. Coal, oil and natural gas come from the remains of ancient plants and animals that got their energy from photosynthesis or by eating plants that did so. These organic materials became buried in mud and silt, eventually forming the deposits that are exploited today.\n\nExplosives\n\nThese substances are also energy stores. Their molecules consist of atoms that can rearrange themselves into other molecules that have far less energy, and when this happens, the difference is released as light and heat. Modern explosives are typically nitrated organic compounds, which means that they are carbon-hydrogen compounds that have had nitrogen-oxygen groups added to them. This is usually a relatively unstable formation: with quite a small stimulus, the existing bonds will break, and the atoms will regroup into molecules with much lower energy, such as carbon dioxide, water and nitrogen. The light and heat released, combined with the extremely fast transformation of a solid or liquid into gases, produces a violent explosion.\n\nBatteries: Electricity from Chemicals\n\nChemical reactions can also be used to produce electricity. Atoms of some elements can easily give out electrons, while others like to gain electrons. Batteries exploit this fact by arranging two different elements or compounds in such a way that electrons can flow from one to the other when they are connected in a circuit, forming an electric current. A wide variety of different substances can be used to convert chemical energy to electricity in this way, and so there are many different types of battery that can be used to power phones, small computers, and electric circuitry in cars, among other things.\n\nDiscuss this Article\n\nclintflint Post 8\n\n@pastanaga - Wind turbines aren't perfect though. They aren't welcome in many areas because of the noise pollution they generate and they take up a lot of space.\n\nI think that some of our energy is going to come from a compromise between types of renewable energy and current non-renewable energy sources.

GM's HyWire is the first drive-by-wire car to be based on a fuel cell.\n\nSimilarly, Toshiba's DMFC is the first fuel cell to be small enough to potentially replace laptop batteries. The technology uses water produced by the fuel cell to dilute the methanol to the 3-6 per cent concentration required for the electricity generating reaction.

Because they are more resistant to impurities than other fuel cell types, scientists believe that they could even be capable of internal reforming of coal, assuming they can be made resistant to impurities such as sulfur and particulates that result from converting coal, a dirtier fossil fuel source than many others, into hydrogen. Alternatively, because MCFCs require CO2 be delivered to the cathode along with the oxidizer, they can be used to electrochemically separate carbon dioxide from the flue gas of other fossil fuel power plants for sequestration.\n\nThe primary disadvantage of current MCFC technology is durability. The high temperatures at which these cells operate and the corrosive electrolyte used accelerate component breakdown and corrosion, decreasing cell life. Scientists are currently exploring corrosion-resistant materials for components as well as fuel cell designs that increase cell life without decreasing performance.\n\nContents\n\nThe German company MTU Friedrichshafen presented an MCFC at the Hannover Fair in 2006. The unit weighs 2 tonnes and can produce 240 kW of electric power from various gaseous fuels, including biogas. If fueled by fuels that contain carbon such as natural gas, the exhaust will contain CO2 but will be reduced by up to 50% compared to diesel engines running on marine bunker fuel.[1] The exhaust temperature is 400 \u00b0C, hot enough to be used for many industrial processes. Another possibility is to make more electric power via a steam turbine. Depending on feed gas type, the electric efficiency is between 12% and 19%. A steam turbine can increase the efficiency by up to 24%. The unit can be used for cogeneration."}

{"text": "PARIS (AFP) \u2014 Think of an electric car that can accelerate swiftly to cruising speed, laptop computers that can recharge in a couple of minutes rather than hours and a generation of super-miniature mobile phones.\n\nThat's the vision sketched on Wednesday by a pair of scientists in the United States, unveiling an invention that they say could lead to a smaller, lighter and more power-packed lithium battery than anything available today.\n\nCurrent batteries made of lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) are good at storing large amounts of electricity but stumble at releasing it.\n\nThey are better at dispensing the power in a steady flow than at discharging it or gaining it in a sudden burst.\n\nAs a result, electric cars perform best when travelling along the motorway at a constant speed rather than when they are accelerating, and their batteries take hours to recharge when they run down.\n\nUntil now, the finger of blame has pointed at charged lithium atoms. These ions, along with electrons, move too sluggishly through the battery material before arriving at the terminal to deliver their charge -- or so it was thought.\n\nBut a pair of materials experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) say the problem lies not with the ions but rather at how the ions gain access to nano-scale tunnels that riddle the material and transport the electrons to their destination.\n\nTheir solution was a lithium phosphate coating that, like a system of feeder roads, nudges the ions towards the tunnels. The ions then zip instantly down the tunnel entrance and to the terminal.\n\nA small cellphone battery can be recharged in just 10 seconds thanks to the improved ion flow, they report in the British journal Nature.\n\nIn theory, a large battery that would be used to power a plug-in hybrid electric car could be recharged in just five minutes, compared to up to six or eight hours at present. But this would only be possible if a beefed-up electricity supply were available.\n\nUnlike other battery materials, the tweaked LiFePO4 does not degrade as much when repeatedly charged and recharged. This opens the way to smaller and lighter batteries, which will not need such heft to deliver the same power, MIT said in a press release.\n\nThe invention, which was supported by US government funds, has already been licensed by two companies, MIT said.\n\nBecause the material involved is not new -- the difference is the way it is made -- \"the work could make it into the marketplace within two to three years,\" it said.\n\nThe invention is the latest claimed advance in the quest to replace conventional electro-chemical batteries, which are heavy, lack energy density and take time to recharge.\n\nResearch in this field ranges from updated lithium-ion technology to hydrogen batteries and combinations of a battery with so-called ultracapacitors that harness exotic materials such as barium titanate to deliver a jolt."}
{"text": "Aug 19, 2005\n\nWith gasoline prices hovering at $3 per gallon, probably few Americans need convincing that another energy crisis is imminent. But what precisely is to be done about our future energy needs is still a puzzle. There's talk about a \"hydrogen economy,\" but hydrogen itself poses some formidable challenges.\n\nThe key challenge is, of course, how to make the hydrogen in the first place. The best and cheapest methods currently available involve burning coal or natural gas, which means more greenhouse gases and more pollution. Adopting the cheapest method by using natural gas would merely result in replacing our dependence on foreign oil with a dependence on foreign gas.\n\n\"Clearly, one clean way to get hydrogen is by splitting water with sunlight,\" says Harry Gray, who is the Beckman Professor of Chemistry at the California Institute of Technology.\n\nGray is involved with several other Caltech and MIT chemists in a research program they call \"Powering the Planet.\" The broadest goal of the project is to \"pursue efficient, economical ways to store solar energy in the form of chemical bonds,\" according to the National Science Foundation (NSF). With a new seed grant from the NSF and the possibility for additional funding after the initial three-year period, the Caltech group says they now have the wherewithal to try out some novel ideas to produce energy cheaply and cleanly.\n\n\"Presently, this country spends more money in 10 minutes at the gas pump than it puts into a year of solar-energy research,\" says Nathan S. Lewis, the Argyros Professor and professor of chemistry. \"But the sun provides more energy to the planet in an hour than all the fossil energy consumed worldwide in a year.\"\n\nThe reason that Gray and Lewis advocate the use of solar energy is that no other renewable resource has enough practical potential to provide the world with the energy that it needs. But the sun sets every night, and so use of solar energy on a large scale will necessarily require storing the energy for use upon society's demand, day or night, summer or winter, rain or shine.\n\nAs for non-renewable resources, nuclear power plants would do the job, but 10,000 new ones would have to be built. In other words, one new nuclear plant would have to come on-line every other day somewhere in the world for the next 50 years.\n\nThe devices used in a simple experiment in the high school chemistry lab to make hydrogen by electrolysis are not currently the cheapest ones to use for mass production. In fact, the tabletop device that breaks water into hydrogen and oxygen is perfectly clean (in other words, no carbon emissions), but it requires a platinum catalyst. And platinum has been selling all year for more than $800 per ounce.\n\nThe solution? Find something cheaper than platinum to act as a catalyst. There are other problems, but this is one that the Caltech group is starting to address. In a research article now in press, Associate Professor of Chemistry Jonas Peters and his colleagues demonstrate a way that cobalt can be used for catalysis of hydrogen formation from water.\n\n\"This is a good first example for us,\" says Peters. \"A key goal is to try to replace the current state-of-the-art platinum catalyst, which is extremely expensive, with something like cobalt, or even better, iron or nickel. We have to find a way to cheaply make solar-derived fuel if we are to ever really enable widespread use of solar energy as society's main power source.\"\n\n\"It's also a good example because it shows that the NSF grant will get us working together,\" adds Gray. \"This and other research results will involve the joint use of students and postdocs, rather than individual groups going it alone.\"\n\nIn addition to the lab work, the Caltech chemists also have plans to involve other entities outside campus--both for practical and educational reasons. One proposal is to fit out a school so that it will run entirely on solar energy. The initial conversion would likely be done with existing solar panels, but the facility would also serve to provide the researchers with a fairly large-scale \"lab\" where they can test out new ideas.\n\n\"We'd build it so that we could troubleshoot solar converters we're working on,\" explains Gray.\n\nThe ultimate lab goal is to have a \"dream machine with no wires in it,\" Gray says. \"We visualize a solar machine with boundary layers, where water comes in, hydrogen goes out one side, and oxygen goes out the other.\"\n\nSuch a machine will require a lot of work and a number of innovations and breakthroughs, but Lewis says the future of the planet depends on moving away from fossil fuels.\n\n\"If somebody doesn't figure this out, and fast, we're toast, both literally and practically, due to a growing dependence on foreign oil combined with the increasing projections of global warming.\"\n\nThe NSF grant was formally announced August 11 as a means of funding a new group of chemical bonding centers that will allow research teams to pursue problems in a manner \"that's flexible, tolerant of risk, and open to thinking far outside the box.\" The initial funding to the Caltech and MIT group for the \"Powering the Planet\" initiative is $1.5 million for three years, with the possibility of $2 to $3 million per year thereafter if the work of the center appears promising.\n\nIn addition to Gray, Lewis, and Peters, the other Caltech personnel include Jay Winkler and Bruce Brunschwig, both chemists at Caltech's Beckman Institute. The two faculty members from MIT involved in the initiative are Dan Nocera and Kit Cummins.\n\nJonas Peters's paper will appear in an upcoming issue of the journal Chemical Communications. In addition to Peters and Lewis, the other authors are Brunschwig, Xile Hu, a postdoctoral researcher in chemistry at Caltech, and Brandi Cossairt, a Caltech undergraduate.If nanoscience were television, we'd be in the 1950s.

{"text": "Fuel cell\n\nFrom GAWDAwiki\n\nA PEM fuel cell (Polymer Electrolyte Membrane) is an electrochemical device that combines hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity, with water and heat as its by-product. As long as fuel is supplied, the fuel cell will continue to generate power. Since the conversion of the fuel to energy takes place via an electrochemical process (not combustion) the process is clean, quiet and highly efficient--two to three times more efficient than fuel burning.[1]\n\nOf course there are other types of fuel cells besides PEM, including direct methanol, alkaline, phosphoric acid, molten carbonate and solid oxide. Fuel cells are currently being used in the transportation industry, as main or backup power for homes or companies and to power small electronic devices."}

Many aspects of typography translate only awkwardly to HTML.\nPlease use the page image\nas the authoritative form to ensure accuracy.\n\nCatalysis Looks to the Future\n\nSOLID-STATE HIGH-TEMPERATURE FUEL CELLS\n\nAn anonymous wit once paraphrased the three laws of thermodynamics thus: First, you can never win, you can only break even. Second, you can never break even. Third, you can't get out of the game. The second law limits the efficiency of a fossil-fuel-fired power plant\u2014only a fraction (typically less than 40%) of the chemical energy released by burning the fuel is converted to electricity. The balance is dissipated in various unavoidable ways\u2014as friction between moving parts, as waste heat up smokestacks and cooling towers, and so forth. Fuel cells, however, translate chemical energy directly into electrical energy without any mechanical or thermal intermediaries. Fuel cells can have efficiencies as high as 90%, depending on their applications. With such high efficiencies, power plants based on fuel cell technology would consume much less fossil fuel and emit proportionally fewer pollutants than would conventional power plants.\n\nAll fuels burn by reacting with oxygen to release energy, and the key to a fuel cell's efficiency lies in using catalysts to control that reaction. There are a number of different types of fuel cells. One promising variety is the high-temperature, solid-state fuel cell (Figure 3.3), which is essentially a barrier made of ceramic, typically zirconium oxide doped with traces of yttrium oxide, whose structure conducts oxygen ions (negatively charged oxygen atoms). On one side of the barrier\u2014the fuel cell's negative terminal\u2014the fuel, typically a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas created by gasifying coal or steam-refining natural gas, reacts catalytically with oxygen ions to liberate water, carbon dioxide, and electrons. The electrons go out over the wire as an electric current. On the other side of the barrier\u2014the positive terminal\u2014the electrons returning through the wire are catalytically added to molecules of oxygen from the atmosphere to create more oxygen ions that diffuse through the barrier and perpetuate the cycle. The yttria-doped zirconia fuel cell typically operates at around 1000\u00b0 C.\n\nSo what are we waiting for? Why aren't power plants based on fuel cells? Unfortunately, several technological hurdles must be overcome before this catalytic technology can be a commercial success. A worldwide effort has been under way for more than two decades to clear these hurdles, which include devising ways to keep the catalyst from breaking down at such high temperatures, avoiding cracks and leaks in the ceramic structure, and designing a ceramic that conducts enough oxygen ions through a sufficiently small volume to make the size of the equipment economical. Some current efforts are focused on so-called cross-flow monolithic designs in which a solid ceramic block is laced with sets of fuel channels perpendicular to, and alternating with, sets of air channels. This design provides a high interior surface area upon which reactions can occur and thus occupies a very compact volume per unit of energy generated."}

It's a battery with tanks of electrolytes that effectively let the battery store more energy than normal batteries. The electrolytes flow or circulate through the system. The larger the tanks, the more electricity it can store.\n\nFlow batteries won't appear in watches or MP3 players any day soon. They are too big, Winter explained. The batteries are for bulk energy storage and will serve as backup or emergency power sources. An individual flow battery can provide backup power for 8 to 16 hours and store several kilowatts of power. The electricity is discharged during peak demand periods.\n\nDeeya claims its batteries are 3 times less expensive than lead acid batteries, which were around when Calvin Coolidge still strode the earth, and 10 to 20 times cheaper than lithium ion batteries. \"They are cheaply made out of plastic. They are low maintenance,\" said Rick Winter, an executive at Deeya last fall.\n\nEnergy storage is the big kahuna in the\ngreen tech market (along with clean coal.) Demand for both these technologies is huge.\nCar makers, utilities, industrial sites, solar homes, and wind power companies all want better batteries and other devices for storing energy. Unfortunately, it's also a difficult problem.\n\nHence, a lot of money is flowing into companies like Deeya, Boston-Power (notebook and later plug-in hybrid batteries), and General Compression (compresses air for later use)."}

{"text": "Record-breaking solar cells are tailored to their location\n\nThe burning hot sun at the equator is a far cry from the weak sunlight that reaches higher latitudes. To make the most of such different conditions you need specially tailored solar cells, according to UK firm Quantasol.\n\nSo the company has come up with a new solar cell design that can be tuned to the light at a particular latitude, and in the process broken a 21-year-old efficiency record for one type of solar cell.\n\nSemiconductor materials such as gallium arsenide (GaAs) are more efficient at converting light to electricity than the cheaper silicon cells most common today. First used in space, GaAs solar cells are beginning to find uses on Earth too.\n\nBut the uniform light conditions in space aren't matched on the ground. The atmosphere acts as a filter, so the light reaching Earth varies from place to place and with changing atmospheric conditions.\n\nTuned in\n\nQuantasol has now created GaAs solar cells that can be tuned to the prevailing light conditions of a particular place, to get the most out of the cells wherever they are.\n\nTo do that, the firm added indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) in layers just a few nanometres, called quantum wells. Like the GaAs that makes up the rest of the cell, they can absorb light to produce electric current. But they do so at very specific frequencies.\n\nThe wells can be tuned to absorb light at the frequencies that are most common in a particular place but aren't absorbed well by GaAs. Over time this strategy should extract more energy than an off-the-shelf solar cell.\n\nWorld record\n\nAfter the quantum wells have been tuned, the GaAs solar cell absorbs more of the incoming light than previous devices. The peak efficiency of the new cell is 28.3 per cent when exposed to light 500 times as strong as normal sunlight, a figure that has been confirmed by the Fraunhofer Institute of Solar Energy in Germany.\n\nThat may only be one-tenth of a percentage point higher than the previous world-record holder, but it's the first advance in 21 years.\n\nCommercial silicon solar cells are much cheaper than GaAs, but have an efficiency of just 10 to 12 per cent and are also bulkier. The Quantasol device can cope with much brighter light without becoming overloaded, making it possible to use a very small solar cell to absorb light collected by a system of cheap lenses and mirrors.\n\nBut more important than the peak efficiency is that the new cells can generate more electrical energy over the course of days and weeks, says Kevin Arthur, Quantasol CEO.\n\n\"The commercial market doesn't just want high efficiency, they want the device to be optimised to the environment,\" he says. \"In the past we measured performance in dollars per watt. Now it's cents per kilowatt-hour that's more3 Square Meters A Practical Minimum\n\nI wouldn't anticipate that those quantum wells will be around very long when the device is exposed to 500x ambient noon sunlight.\n\nThese devices will need to be cooled of course, and you have optical losses on the lense surfaces, so optimistcally 20% efficiency in practical terms. Maybe 15%.\n\nStill, 20% efficiency corresponds to roughly 300 watts per square meter. Say 1KW for every three square meters. So it would require 9 or so square meters of these devices to power my home with it's current energy consumption.\n\nMoving to a natural gas flash water heater would reduce that to about 6 square meters.\n\nMore efficient standby power for the electrical devices in this home would reduce the requirement to about 4.6 square meters\n\nBetter insulation on the refrigerator, and I'm down to 4 square meters.\n\nOLED lighting, and I'm down to 3.5 square meters.\n\nA Low power PC and OLED monitor, and I'm down to 3 square meters.\n\nAt that point, it starts to get hard to reduce the number of panels further.\n\n3 Square Meters A Practical Minimum\n\nThu Jul 02 10:07:36 BST 2009 by Mike\n\nI would use solar-thermal panels to heat my water, which would reduce the area required by a good amount. This combined with 10 sq meters of solar panels, a wind turbine (site permitting), a Li-Ion battery storage system, good insulation and efficient applicances would be the basis of an (almost) self sufficient system. My house uses an average of 600W through the day, but this can jump to over 8KW, if I put the kettle on at the same time as say, the electric oven and other cooking appliances.\n\nThe idea being that the solar cells/wind turbine produce much more electricity than the house requires during the day, which is stored in the Li-ion batteries. At night, the batteries / wind turbine supply the power. If the load exceeds the capacity of the system, (say a 8KW peak for a few minutes) power is then drawn from the grid.\n\n3 Square Meters A Practical Minimum\n\nThu Jul 02 16:52:43 BST 2009 by Vendicar Decarian\n\nYour total electrical energy consumption is around 30% higher than mine at the moment.

(Gas), that will reduce consumption by another 25%.\n\nAt that point PV generation begins to become more practical.\n\nFor me, the next thing is to prep the house for passive solar heating.\n\nWInd generation is not practical in my area.

Credit: California Institute of Technology\n\nThe researchers say one of the most exciting things about the discovery is its versatility. \"We are not dictating to the user what the energy infrastructure should be,\" Haile said. \"We are making solar energy easy to use by putting it into a form that our industry is used to seeing and making it available on demand.\"\n\nDoing the two-step\n\nScientists have long known how to convert water and carbon dioxide into hydrogen and carbon monoxide. But to do it cheaply and efficiently enough to make the process affordable on a wide scale has been the issue. Part of the problem was the need for expensive and rare elements, such as platinum or iridium, to act as catalysts that encourage the conversion to happen.\n\nSo Haile and her team took a novel approach; they tried ceria, a material used in the walls of self-cleaning ovens. Ceria is the oxidized or \"rust\" form of the element cerium, which is more abundant, and therefore cheaper, than other metals that could do the same job.\n\nThe new method requires two steps, the first at high temperature using concentrated heat from the sun (about 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit), and the second at a much lower temperature.\n\nHaile describes the process this way, \"If we heat ceria up, the material 'naturally' releases some oxygen from its structure. If we then cool it back down, those oxygen vacancies want to be refilled. In other words, the ceria 'exhales' oxygen at high temperature and then 'inhales' it back when the temperature is lowered.\"\n\nTo make fuel, the second step requires the presence of water and carbon dioxide gases. \"At lower temperatures, the cerium, the hydrogen and the carbon all want the oxygen, but the cerium wants it most,\" Haile said. \"So the oxygen vacancies in the ceria are filled by stripping oxygen from H2O and CO2, leaving H2 and CO.\"\n\nAn international collaboration\n\nHaile and her Caltech team, supported by an award from the National Science Foundation, recently published a paper describing the breakthrough in the journal Science. For this project, they collaborated with researchers led by Aldo Steinfeld, a renewable energy technology professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, also called ETH Z\u00fcrich, in Switzerland. Steinfeld also leads the Solar Technology Laboratory at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.\n\nThe ETH-Caltech solar fuel reactor uses concentrated heat from the sun to create fuel from water and carbon dioxide. Credit: California Institute of Technology (Caltech) Jointly owned by California Institute of Technology and ETH Zurich\n\nTwo pieces of equipment were needed for the experiment. The first piece, built at Caltech, is a reactor \"just a bit smaller than a gallon-jug,\" Haile said. The reactor is basically a cylindrical container lined with ceria that has input and output lines for the gases.\n\nThe second piece is a solar concentrator, which is the most difficult part to build. The concentrator is basically a set of giant curved mirrors that gather sunlight from a wide area. For this experiment, the researchers were able to use an existing solar concentrator located at the Paul Scherrer Institute.\n\nThe Caltech scientists took their reactor to Switzerland and attached it to the bottom of the concentrator, allowing the sunlight to heat up the ceria inside. Then they piped steam and carbon dioxide into the reactor and measured the hydrogen and carbon monoxide gases flowing out.\n\nCheaper and more efficient\n\nHow far reaching could this new technology be and how much oil, gas or coal could it replace?\n\n\"The abundance of cerium means that this approach could have a significant impact on our national energy budget,\" Haile said. Because cerium is 100,000 times more abundant than the precious metal platinum, she said, the cost would be many orders of magnitude smaller.\n\nFor this experiment, the efficiency of the reactor at converting sunlight to usable energy measured just under one percent, which Haile said is comparable to other methods. However, this was a first cut, aimed at simply proving that the process is practical and could be done economically.\n\nBefore bringing the technology to market, Haile said, the reactor design needs to be much tighter to get better efficiency.\n\n\"As a second step, it will be important to develop materials with even better characteristics than ceria,\" she added.\n\n\"Ideally, one wants a material with a smaller temperature swing required as this will also increase efficiency,\" Haile said. \"In addition, if both the high and low temperatures can be lowered, the overall system lifetime will be improved. Better materials could result in a better process.\"\n\nRelated StoriesResearchers at the California Institute of Technology have discovered that ceria (or cerium dioxide) is an excellent catalyst for fuel cell anodes.

{"text": "Low-cost solar cell problem solved\n\nResearchers in the United States have solved 20-year-old problem with a low-cost solar cell. The Gr\u00e4tzel cell was cheap to produce, but it had a major problem, it leaked and so was not commercially viable.\n\nNow, scientists at Northwestern University have developed a new stable version that does not leak, has no toxic parts but is still cost-effective.\n\nUntil now, the Gr\u00e4tzel cell contained a dye-sensitive electrolyte that was created from an organic liquid that was liable to seep and corrode the solar cell.\n\nThe chemist used a new electrolyte material that begins as a liquid but finishes as a solid, making the solar cell inherently stable. The new thin CsSnI3 compound consists of tin, cesium and iodine.\n\nProfessor Kanatzidis explains, \"The Gr\u00e4tzel cell is like having the concept for the light bulb but not having the tungsten wire or carbon material. We created a robust novel material that makes the Gr\u00e4tzel cell concept work better. Our material is solid, not liquid, so it should not leak or corrode.\"\n\nAmong the researcher team was postdoctoral Fellow In Chung and graduate student Byunghong Lee who helped develop the new solar cells and make performance gains of around 1% a month.\n\nThe full research paper: All-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells with high efficiency, about the improved and long-lasting solar cell were published in the Nature journal. Its main authors are Professor Kanatzidis, the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Chemistry from the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, and Professor Chang, who specialises in materials science and engineering at the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science. Jiaqing He, from Northwestern, is the other author.\n\nProfessor Chang says the solar cell could be developed to be better performing and more efficient than it is now. It currently has a high of 10.2%, which compared with a 12% maximum performance of the original Gr\u00e4tzel cell. Today's silicon solar cells can convert around 20% of sunlight.\n\nThe new solar cell uses nanoparticle titanium dioxide n-type and CsSnI3 p-type semiconductors with a single layer dye molecule forming the junction between them.\n\nProfessor Chang says, \"We have millions and millions of nanoparticles, which gives us a huge effective surface area, and we coat all the particles with light-absorbing dye.\"\n\nA single solar cell is half a centimetre by half a centimetre and around 10 microns thick. The dye-coated nanoparticles are packed in and Kanatzidis' liquid flows around them. In a similar way to the way paint reacts, the solvent evaporates and a solid mass is left. The dye that absorbs the sun and converts photon into electricity is between the two semiconductors.\n\nThe nanoparticles are around 20 nanometers in diameter, which boosts the surface area and allows enough space between the particles for the liquid to flow through and set.\n\nProfessor Chang says this is just the start of developing the technology and there are many other applications in solar cell technology that could be improved. The next stage is to build a large array (row) of the solar cells.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy, The National Science Foundation and the Initiative backed the research for Energy and Sustainability at Northwestern"}

PNNL's Michael Henderson and colleagues added nitrogen to different forms of titanium dioxide known as anatase and rutile, and tested how well the nitrogen-doped metal oxides performed. The team measured how a test molecule decomposed as a stand-in for half of the water-splitting reaction -- the \"oxidation\" half of an oxidation-reduction reaction. While both metal oxides decomposed the test molecule under UV, only anatase could break it down in visible light, surprising the researchers.

Its capacity is nearly four times higher than that of a conventional battery and it can power a typical laptop computer for eight to sixteen hours.\n\nThe unit features a device that extracts hydrogen from a methanol and sends the hydrogen to the main fuel cell. Casio has been working with Akira Igarashi, an engineering professor at Kogakuin University, and has succeeded in making the device as small as a 500 yen coin so that the entire unit would fit into a laptop. Casio overcame the problem of extreme heat, caused by the device that extracts the hydrogen, by wrapping the unit in a heatproof case, among other methods.\n\nFuel cells that use methanol are also under development, but require pumps to handle liquid methanol, making the entire unit to large to fit into a laptop. Under current law, methanol is treated as a dangerous substance because it is flammable; this makes it difficult for manufactures and causes them to take excessive safety measures.\n\nGovernment regulators, including the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, are considering deregulation as early as 2007 so that fuel cells may be able to then be used widely. Casio hopes to bring its fuel cell to the market after the deregulation occurs."}

{"text": "MICROORGANISMS in the seafloor may soon be producing an unlimited supply of electricity to power equipment such as sensors and sonar beacons. It comes from a fuel cell developed with funding from the US Department of Defense, which taps into a natural voltage gradient at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nBugs living in seawater, or on the top layer of seafloor sediments, use oxygen to break down organic matter, releasing energy as they go. Those that live further down where there is no oxygen, have to rely on other chemicals, such as nitrates and sulphates.\n\nThese different reactions create an electrical potential difference, just like the voltage between opposite electrodes of a battery.

{"text": "Some people are happy to learn simply for the sake of learning. Megan Burger would rather use her education to create cutting-edge inventions with important uses.\n\nThat's exactly what the 18-year-old has done. At this year's Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) in Phoenix, Ariz., the high school senior from The Woodlands, Texas, was one of several students who investigated fuel-cell technology. Her work might eventually help make Earth a cleaner place.\n\nFuel cells power this car, which runs on hydrogen.\n\nU.S. Department of Energy\n\nFuel cells generate electricity through chemical reactions between hydrogen and oxygen. The process is an efficient way to produce energy with no toxic waste.\n\nFuel cells already power spacecraft and a few cars. In the future, experts suggest, they will also be used in homes and other buildings and even in devices such as laptops and cell phones.\n\nThe technology has \"the potential to transform the [U.S.] energy industry,\" Megan says.\n\nStill, there are problems. Even though there's more hydrogen in the universe than any other element, it's difficult to gather and store.\n\nOn Earth, most hydrogen is attached to oxygen (as in water molecules, which contain two atoms of hydrogen for every atom of oxygen) or to other atoms, and energy is required to separate them. That's an issue if the point is to generate energy without the pollution produced by burning gasoline, oil, coal, and other fuels used today, which might be needed to free up hydrogen.\n\nStronger, safer\n\nFor her project, Megan wanted to create a fuel cell that would be stronger and safer than those now available.\n\nFirst, she did a lot of background reading, using books and the Internet, just to understand the basics of such a complicated topic. \"I had to do a lot of research,\" she says.\n\nMegan Burger and her fuel cell project.\n\nEmily Sohn\n\nOne of the first things Megan learned is that a fuel cell has three main parts that fit together like a sandwich. The \"bread\" on one side is called an anode. The other slice of \"bread\" is called a cathode. The \"meat\" squished between the cathode and the anode is called an electrolyte. There are lots of different types of fuel cells, which differ mainly in the kinds of electrolytes they use.\n\nIn her experiments, Megan worked with a type of fuel cell called a solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC), which has a solid electrolyte. SOFCs, which are stronger and safer than liquid versions, are used today in power plants, and engineers are looking for ways to use them in laptops and cell phones, Megan says. The downside is that they require high temperatures\u2014around 1,000 degrees Celsius\u2014to work. This limits where the fuel cells can be used.\n\n\"I thought maybe I could make them operate at lower temperatures,\" Megan says.\n\nAs hydrogen and oxygen flow through a fuel cell, they generate electricity and produce water. The fuel cell's core is an electrical sandwich that consists of an anode, an electrolyte, and a cathode.\n\nU.S. Department of Energy\n\nFor 2 years, Megan experimented with various electrolyte materials to lower the temperature at which an SOFC operates. Eventually, she ended up with solid pellets of a material called bismuth strontium barium oxide. No one had ever used this material before in a fuel cell, she says. Her tests showed that a fuel cell based on that material would be able to operate at a mere 650 degrees Celsius.\n\n\"That's already 350 degrees less than before,\" Megan says. \"It gives me hope that we can have another step down.\"\n\nHer research continues. In the meantime, she has already learned more than she ever expected to learn\u2014and not just about fuel cells.\n\n\"One of the biggest lessons is perseverance,\" she says. \"If you want to find something exciting, you have to keep trying, no matter how many things around you are breaking, exploding, or not working. Thousands of things that people call failures are still things you can learn from.\"\n\nCold start\n\nISEF participant Wade Miller learned some important lessons from his fuel cell project, too. And like Megan, Wade didn't know where he was going to end up when he began.\n\n\"It was really confusing when I first started learning about it,\" says Wade, a 17-year-old senior from Albert Lea, Minn. Still, the concept was exciting enough to keep him going.\n\nWade Miller holds his fuel-cell-powered toy vehicle.\n\nEmily Sohn\n\nBecause Wade lives in Minnesota, a state with hot summers and cold winters, he wanted to test a fuel cell's ability to withstand temperature extremes. His main goal was to figure out whether cars powered by fuel cells might some day be practical where he lives.\n\nUnlike Megan, Wade used a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell. These types of fuel cells work at relatively low temperatures, and they use sheet-like electrolytes that resemble plastic wrap.\n\nTo test efficiency at various temperatures, Wade built a toy car and attached a PEM fuel cell to it. That way, he could measure how much energy the cell produced. He tested the system under heat lamps at 80 degrees F, indoors at 65 degrees F, outdoors at 27 degrees F, and in the school's freezer at \u201310 degrees F.\n\nWade had predicted that the fuel cell would work best at higher temperatures. Instead, it produced the most electricity at \u201310 degrees F.\n\nPolymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells use sheets of plastic as electrolytes. The cathode and anode are typically made from carbon, with a layer of platinum, which serves as a catalyst to speed up the separation of electrons from hydrogen atoms.\n\nU.S. Department of Energy\n\n\"I ended up proving myself completely wrong,\" he says. \"If you start a car in Minnesota when it's really cold, it takes a while for the engine to turn over. I thought the fuel cell would do the same. But I guess not.\"\n\nIn the end, Wade concluded that fuel-cell-powered cars would run just fine in Minnesota. Still, he predicts, it'll be another 10 or 15 years before we actually see them on the streets.\n\n\"This is probably something we will deal with in the future,\" he says. \"It's a good thing to get into. We will be seeing this in the news.\"\n\nAnd today's young scientists are already on the case. As usual, taking a walk around the exhibition hall at this year's ISEF was like taking a walk into the future."}

{"text": "In what Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers say is a revolutionary leap that could transform solar power from a marginal, boutique alternative into a mainstream energy source, the researchers report they have discovered a way to store energy for use when the sun doesn't shine, thereby overcoming a major barrier to large-scale solar power.\n\nMIT reminded that until now, solar power has been a daytime-only energy source, because storing extra solar energy for later use is prohibitively expensive and grossly inefficient, but its researchers have come upon a simple, inexpensive, highly efficient process for storing solar energy that requires nothing but abundant, non-toxic natural materials, inspired by the photosynthesis performed by plants.\n\n\"This is the nirvana of what we've been talking about for years. Solar power has always been a limited, far-off solution. Now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon,\" noted MIT's Daniel Nocera, (pictured left) the Henry Dreyfus Professor of Energy at MIT and senior author of a paper describing the work in the July 31 issue of Science, in a statement.\n\nNocera and Matthew Kanan, a postdoctoral fellow in Nocera's lab developed a process that will allow the sun's energy to be used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen gases, which later may be recombined inside a fuel cell, creating carbon-free electricity to power houses or electric cars, day or night.\n\nThe key component in the process is a catalyst -- cobalt metal, phosphate and an electrode, placed in water -- that produces oxygen gas from water, while another catalyst produces hydrogen gas. When electricity -- whether from a photovoltaic cell, a wind turbine or any other source -- runs through the electrode, the cobalt and phosphate form a thin film on the electrode, and oxygen gas is produced, the researchers explained.\n\nCombined with another catalyst, such as platinum, that can produce hydrogen gas from water, the system can duplicate the water splitting reaction that occurs during photosynthesis.\n\nThe new catalyst works at room temperature, in neutral pH water, and is easy to set up, Nocera said. \"That's why I know this is going to work. It's so easy to implement,\" he said.\n\nNocera also said that sunlight has the greatest potential of any power source to solve the world's energy problems, since in one hour, enough sunlight strikes the Earth to provide the entire planet's energy needs for one year.\n\n\"This is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind. The importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem,\" added James Barber, a leader in the study of photosynthesis, the Ernst Chain Professor of Biochemistry at Imperial College London, and who called the discovery a \"giant leap\" toward generating clean, carbon-free energy on a massive scale.\n\nWhile this is a good start, the currently available electrolyzers that split water with electricity and are often used industrially, are not suited for artificial photosynthesis because they are very expensive and require a highly basic (non-benign) environment that has little to do with the conditions under which photosynthesis operates, Nocera said.\n\nAs such, more engineering work needs to be done to integrate the new scientific discovery into existing photovoltaic systems, but Nocera is confident that such systems will become a reality.\n\n\"This is just the beginning. The scientific community is really going to run with this,\" he added.\n\nNocera hopes that within 10 years homeowners will be able to power their homes in daylight through photovoltaic cells, while using excess solar energy to produce hydrogen and oxygen to power their own household fuel cell. Electricity-by-wire from a central source could be a thing of the past.\n\nThe project is part of the MIT Energy Initiative, a program designed to help transform the global energy system to meet the needs of the future and to help build a bridge to that future by improving today's energy systems."}
