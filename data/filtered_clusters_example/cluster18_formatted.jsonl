How does one balance safety and the pursuit of the unknown? What is worth the risk? To answer these questions, we've invited two National Geographic explorers for whom risk-taking is just a part of the job. Joining us for this conversation will be deep-sea cave diver Kenny Broad and high-altitude archaeologist Constanza Ceruti.\n\nWe'll also spend an hour talking about National Geographic magazine's October cover story on the teenage brain:\n\nTo many adults, teenagers are a mystery. It's difficult to understand why they act the way they do, why they take the risks they do. Scientists have tried for centuries to figure it out. Now some scientists think they have an explanation \u2014 evolution. Studies suggest that teenagers are highly adaptive \u2014 wired almost perfectly for the job of moving into adulthood from the safety of home to the complicated world they will inherit. David Dobbs, author of the cover story on the teenage brain in the October issue of National Geographic, will talk with scientists in the field \u2014 and listeners around the world \u2014 to discuss how the adolescent brain may be wired for risk.\n\nIn a final segment, Neal will also speak with Juan Jose Valdes, creator of a new map of Cuba, National Geographic's most comprehensive one since 1906.\n\nIf you would like to join us in the studio audience, please send an email to talk@npr.org with your name and the number of tickets you'd like to reserve.

And when they run\u2014or, better, hop\u2014they do so with astounding efficiency, a process aided by the joints in their hind limbs and in their tails.

This rabbit king, Nuralagus rex, thus weighed in at about six times the size of the common European rabbit today, but was even larger than its mainland cousin of the time, thereby illustrating what biologists call the \"island rule\" in mammals: on islands, big animals get smaller and small animals get bigger.

{"text": "Tuesday, 21 December 2010\n\nI don't know if you have heard this, but science just got real. Recently, a bacteria was found in a salty lake that defies everything modern science has ever thought possible. This bacteria can substitute one of the six previously \"essential\" elements needed for life to exist. This is HUGE NEWS!\n\nThe bacteria uses Arsenic, a poison, in place of phosphorus to live. Until now, scientists claimed that for life to exist on Earth, the life form in question has to use either carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur or phosphorus to exist. No example has EVER been found that defies this rule of biochemistry. I know what you're thinking, \"Who gives a shit?\" Well, this little discovery has opened a whole bunch of new questions as to what can be possible.\n\nFor one, this life form indicates that life could have begun and ended many more times than we thought possible. Some speculate that this bacteria has been around before Earth had oxygen!\n\nThink of it like this, if our ancestry can be traced back through a tree of life, this bacteria indicates a whole different species of tree. Life can exist outside our known understanding, also exciting news for alien enthusiasts everywhere.\n\nIf this bacteria can use such a harsh element to live, who knows how many planets and moons it can exist on. Previously we all thought life could only exist if the planet had water, an atmosphere, was the right distance from a star, etc. This shatters that notion, making it now possible for life to exist in some of the most inhospitable places in the Universe.\n\nImagine a world where these arsenic based life forms can thrive (a place radically different than our planet). What happens when they start to grow larger and more complex?\n\nRelated Posts\n\nComments (17)\n\nI remember learning about the things that are essential for life in high school and wondering how the hell anyone can know for SURE that absolutely every living thing in the universe requires X, Y and Z to exist. It never made sense to me. I think this is an awesome discovery. It gets us out of our ignorant little we-know-it-all boxes. We don't know shit, in the spectrum of things.\n\nVery interesting, this pretty much confirms my notions that life probably does exist on other planets...I've always thought it was possible for other lifeforms to exist and thrive under different conditions.\n\nOkay, so I love that you're so excited about this, because I love nerd-talk. It's the best, and the most fun.\n\nI have no disagreement with how exciting this is, I just think that there's a lot of things that we don't know, so how is this a shocker? The only thing that bothers me about science: why do we need to know every fucking thing in the universe? And this is coming from a person that prizes knowledge. But seriously...the past's the past. And if there's no evidence to support it besides a bacteria...no meaning of a schedule or a drawing or a new bone to suggest anything (by all of these I'm saying there's no significance to it other than the fact that there was something before what we already knew (which is SO shocking because we're so effing fantastic, right?))...than whoopdy-doo. Ya know?\n\n@Kelsicus@xanga - Whoopdy do indeed. It seems the more we know, the less we know in this instance. It amazes me the amount of money that is spent on simple \"knowledge\" that gets us no closer to knowing exactly what it is we want to know.\n\n@raiderjester@xanga - I think true wisdom is best summed up by Socrates: It's knowing that you know nothing. Because you can't know everything. Knowledge is too vast. No one can know that much. It's about learning mostly.\n\nA chemist from the Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution in Gainesville, Florida, who works on alternative forms of DNA, is sceptical that the bacteria really do contain arsenic. \"I doubt these results,\" he says, since in order to measure the modified DNA it has to be put into a water-containing gel, which would rapidly dissolve any arsenate molecules. Any hypothesis that arsenate might replace phosphate in biomolecules must take this into account, he says."}

It's called the Anomalocaris, which aptly translates from scientific lingo to the appropriate name: \"strange shrimp.\" While scientists have previously found that this prehistoric shrimp's teeth-things may not have been that sharp, it does, apparently, have excellent vision. Specifically, it's \"a gigantic primordial shrimp with pin-sharp vision,\" New Scientist informs, which complement its \"formidable grasping claws, which allowed it to grab its prey and pull it into its mouth.\" Pretty scary indeed for, as one science press release writer wrote, a glorified \"shrimp from hell.\" [New Scientist, University of Adelaide]\n\nSo, how's the latest climate change conference going over in Durban, South Africa?

It's what inexplicably links humanity together. But, today, we're informed by new research finding that people can be more exclusive with their yawning habits. It's not just for every random stranger that we'll contagiously catch the urge to yawn--\"You're more likely to reciprocate yawns that originate from people you are close to than from a stranger,\" The Atlantic informs. Which makes sense. This new study was concocted by a University of Pisa team that watched a whole bunch of participants yawn for a year.

Not only are there approximately a bajillion different kinds, but we also haven't completely nailed down how they actually produce an antidepressant effect. However, a new study from a group of researchers at Columbia University suggests there may be a link between antidepressants and a similarly confusing group of brain areas called the default mode network (DMN).\n\nThe study, published in February in JAMA Psychiatry, first used functional-connectivity MRI to show that patients with dysthymia show a higher baseline level of activity in their DMN. Then, after 10 weeks with either duloxetine or placebo, the patients' brain activity was measured again. Patients who had received the antidepressant showed brain activity in the DMN more like control subjects than those patients who just got the placebo. The authors conclude that antidepressant treatments \"normalize\" activity in the DMN.\n\nBut there are a couple problems here. First, what exactly is the default mode network? Well, it's a group of brain areas that \"lights up\" in brain imaging between tasks. It's sometimes used to describe the brain's resting state. But it also can be selectively activated when subjects are given self-directed tasks (like asking a participant \"what did you buy at the store?\" rather than \"what did your roommate buy at the store?\"). And while previous studies have shown that DMN activity is higher in depressed patients than in control subjects, what that means in terms of therapy (pharmacological or otherwise) has yet to be understood.\n\nSecond, brain imaging is always, by necessity, nothing more than correlated with behavior. Which makes it pretty difficult to draw any giant conclusions here. And third, possibly most importantly, the authors did not see any correlation between improvement of dysthymia symptoms and DMN activity. That's right. Even though they'd like us to believe DMN activation plays a crucial role in depression and antidepressants, they really only found half that story. And it's a really muddled story to begin with.\n\nSo, what exactly are we supposed to do with this?

And in people who already have seasonal allergies to pollen, oral allergy syndrome (OAS) causes the body to confuse those otherwise harmless apple proteins for the birch pollen ones.

{"text": "Worms have been found living at depths in the Earth where it was previously thought animals could not survive.Discovered in South African mines, the roundworms can survive in the stifling 48C (118F) water that seeps between cracks 1.3km beneath the Earth's crust.The find has surprised scientists who, until now, believed only single-celled bacteria thrived at these depths.Writing in the journal Nature, the team says this is the deepest-living \"multi-cellular\" organism known to science.The researchers found two species of worm. One is a new species to science, which the scientists have named Halicephalobus mephisto after Faust's Lord of the Underworld.The other is a previously known roundworm known as Plectus aquatilis.\n\nEnds: Dr Borgonie believes that worms already have some of the \"attributes necessary\" to survive at these great depths.

If you want to submit your own Fortean 5s email it to Oll Lewis at fortean5s@gmail.com. Today's Fortean Five is compiled by Dr Chris Clark. Chris will be familiar to you as an explorer and mainstay of CFZ expeditions and as an expedition coordinator. Take it away Chris:\n\nMultiple Suns\n\nThe appearance of two suns in the sky sounds more than merely Fortean; rather something from the Book of Revelations, one of the signs and wonders that announce the Second Coming, a dire event that follows the opening of one of the seven seals. It is understandable then that in March this year the appearance of two suns over a part of China caused some Internet excitement.\n\nThis very rare effect involves the appearance of a second image of the sun, of very similar size and brightness, typically one or two degrees away, and commonly when the sun is just above the horizon. The image may be alongside the true sun or above it; sometimes there is more than one false sun (up to nine have been reported), and there have also been sightings of multiple images of the moon and even one of the planet Venus. Minnaert, in his book Light and Colour in the Open Air, doubted its reality in the early editions, but was forced to change his mind when drawings and photographs became available. Corliss, in the Rare Halos, Mirages, Anomalous Rainbows\u2026 Catalog cites a number of reports, most observed at sea, and involving altitudes of the sun and moon above the horizon as high as 25\u00b0.\n\nIt should be stressed that this does not refer to the 'sun dogs' or 'mock suns', caused by reflections of the sun from ice crystals. This is a fairly common effect (I have seen it twice) and easily identified: the sun dogs appear, usually as a pair with one on each side of the sun, as part of a bright ring at an angle of 22\u00b0 around the sun.\n\nLogically, if two suns are seen at one place, we might expect no sun to be visible at another, but this, if it happens, has never been reported. Presumably multiple images of the sun or moon must be the consequence of some abnormal refraction effect, of the sort that produces mirages, Fata Morgana, and the curious 'looming' effect that can make islands out at sea appear large and close when seen from the shore. Nevertheless it is extraordinarily hard to see how as many as nine clear and distinct images can be generated; perhaps the abrupt density changes associated with cold fronts, or the pattern of convection cells that can form in warm weather, may cause multiple paths. Certainly the experts consulted about the China sighting were baffled, and I know of not a single paper on the subject.\n\nThe Tunguska Event\n\nIn June 1908 a colossal explosion took place in a very remote region of Siberia. The exact power of the explosion, which blew down trees over an 80-square-mile area, is impossible to establish, but it seems to have been in the 5 to 30 megaton range. It must have taken months for the news to reach Moscow; the Tsarist government took no action, and it was not until 1927, when the chaos of World War I, the Bolshevik Revolution and the Civil War had died down, that an expedition was sent. Although the site was still devastated, with fallen trees pointing away from the site of the blast, there was no sign of any impact crater, and the damage seems to have been done by a massive airburst.\n\nMany ideas, some of them rather wild, have been put forward to explain the nature of the blast: an antimatter meteorite; a quantum black hole; even an alien spaceship blowing up on landing! However, the discovery of tiny particles of iron with a high proportion of nickel in the soil and the fallen trees suggested a meteorite; the discovery of traces of iridium, a heavy metal very rare on earth but often found in meteors, strengthened this. Nevertheless, it was not obvious why a solid stone meteor should explode at high altitude instead of reaching the ground and forming a crater, and there were suggestions that a comet, or at least a fragment of one, could be responsible. Now that we understand that many asteroids are merely loose aggregations of pebbles held together by a weak gravitational attraction the meteor idea becomes more plausible; calculations show that even a solid stony object can be broken up by high pressures in the atmosphere before it reaches the ground. On the other hand, the observation of a bright column of light in the sky for ten minutes before the explosion suggests that a detached fragment of the object hit the Earth first: the Shoemaker-Levy comet that hit Jupiter was preceded by similar fragments pulled off by tidal stresses. The high metal concentration is also hard to square with a stony meteorite, and it may be that a comet, or the nucleus of one, is still a possibility.\n\nIt is worth noting one more thing: if the object had arrived five hours later it would have hit the outskirts of St Petersburg. And if it had impacted during one of the more fractious periods of the Cold War instead of 1908\u2026.\n\nThe Moving Coffins of Barbados\n\nIn 2007, on our way back from searching for giant anacondas in Guyana, the CFZ team made a stopover in Barbados. While we there we inspected the tomb of the Chase family in Christ Church graveyard, famous for its 'creeping coffins'. In the early nineteenth century several members of the family were buried here. The first two burials, in 1807 and 1808, happened without incident. However, when the tomb, built out of large cemented blocks, was opened for a third burial in 1812 it was found that the two coffins, encased in lead, had been flung against the wall. There was no disturbance to the dust on the floor. The coffins were replaced and the third burial took place. The fourth burial, that of plantation owner Thomas Chase who had purchased the tomb for his family, was only a month later, but the same disorder was seen; from then on, whenever the vault was opened for another burial, the coffins were found in state of disarray. In 1819 the Governor of Barbados himself checked for secret entrances, placed seals on the vault and scattered sand on the floor to detect intrusion; yet when he checked nine months later the coffins had moved again, and there was no sign of footprints. After this the Governor ordered the tomb to be emptied and the coffins reburied: they have apparently been content to remain where they are ever since. It is hard to imagine any explanation, short of an elaborate conspiracy, to explain this one.\n\nBall Lightning\n\nIn the town of Khabarovsk (USSR), in the summer of 1978, a ball of orange light about 1.5 m diameter appeared over a local cinema and was observed for a full minute as it descended to the street, When it finally exploded it caused a crater 1.5 m across and 20-25 cm deep. The estimated energy release was about one billion Joules, or enough to completely evaporate half a ton of water. This is the most spectacular example of ball lightning so far observed, but very far from the only one. A paper published in 1993 gave examples of over 3200 distinct sightings.\n\nThe cause remains a complete mystery, though it engaged the interest of (among many others), the famous Russian physicist and Nobel Prize winner Peter Kapitza. The same paper mentions a discussion in a Soviet technical journal which produced 138 different explanations! Since most sightings are associated with thunderstorms, an explanation in terms of plasma physics has always been preferred (and I can certainly produce something that looks like ball lightning, though it presumably isn't, in my microwave oven using nothing more than a candle). Since wiring was damaged up to 150 m from the explosion in the Khabarovsk case this would suggest an electromagnetic pulse, but there is no explanation of how the air can remain ionised for the long (10 \u2013 60 seconds) duration of ball lightning, instead of the milliseconds typical of plasmas. Other causes suggested include antimatter, a fractal state of matter called an aerogel, and even the elusive Dirac magnetic monopole. The recent discovery of positron annihilation gamma radiation in the aftermath of violent lightning strikes suggests that antimatter can actually be created: so if you do see ball lightning, treat it with respect.\n\nThe Annemarie Schneider Poltergeist\n\nThe paranormal is a huge disappointment to those who, like me, would like to believe. Telepathy retreats ever further into a statistical limbo of analysis and meta-analysis (as Rutherford said \"If your experiment needs statistics, you ought to have done a better experiment\"). Psychokinesis scarcely ever occurs under properly controlled conditions; certainly I have never heard of anyone being barred from Las Vegas casinos for winning vast sums at the craps tables using their PK powers. Precognition seems to be as bogus as every other form of prophecy; Soal, who spent years investigating it, was reduced in the end to cheating out of sheer frustration. As for teleportation, which Charles Fort seems to have invented as a joke, there is not even bad evidence that anyone ever teleported or ever will.\n\nOut of the vast pile of debris that constitutes the paranormal library, one phenomenon seems to remain standing: poltergeists. There are far too many accounts to even list, but one in particular stands out : the Rosenheim poltergeist or, since all the effects were associated with one adolescent girl (as they so often are), perhaps it should be called the Annemarie Schneider poltergeist. The events centred round the office of a Bavarian lawyer called Sigmund Adam. They began in 1967 with a series of telephone calls, at a rate sometimes of several per minute, apparently made from the office. The calls continued when all the telephones were locked, only Adam himself holding the key. There were a range of electrical problems, involving exploding light bulbs, blown fuses and lights that went on and off by themselves. The power company and the telephone company could find no problems with the equipment. Objects began to move, apparently of their own accord. When a paranormal investigator and two physicists were brought in they noted that the events only occurred when a young secretary, Annemarie Schneider, was present. Schneider apparently had just come out of a difficult relationship, and anyone who attended the talk 'Sex and the Single Poltergeist' at the last Unconvention will remember the link between poltergeist activity and sexual tensions in adolescents. The case became internationally famous: I remember reading about it in the British newspapers at the time. Despite the attention of journalists, police and investigators the effects continued, and did not end until Schneider herself left. It is worth noting that no-one claimed to have seen her faking anything. Unfortunately no illusionists or magicians seem to have checked on her, so the possibility of fraud by an attention-seeking neurotic remains, but it would be remarkable if a teenage girl could have replicated the sort of effects associated with skilled mediums who are allowed to set the terms under which they work.\n\nOliver is away at the LAPIS Conference, at which he will be videoing bits and bobs for CFZtv as well as speaking himself.

{"text": "Amino Acids, Sugars, Chirality, and Dinosaurs from Space\n\nA new paper from noted American chemist Ronald Breslow was recently accepted by the Journal of the American Chemical Society. It's titled, \"Evidence for the Likely Origin of Homochirality in Amino Acids, Sugars, and Nucleosides on Prebiotic Earth,\" but you may know it better as \"the one study that says 'advanced' dinosaurs could rule other planets.\"\n\nThis is a tad confusing, because the paper itselfwasn't about dinosaurs at all. It centered on chirality, a property of an object, organism, or molecule which means that the object is not identical to its mirror image. Human hands are a good example of chirality. Your left hand can never be perfectly superimposed upon your right. In fact, this example is so ideal that chemists and molecular biologists dub chiral molecules as having either \"left-handed\" or \"right-handed\" chirality.\n\nNoted in the paper, sugars and amino acids -- two of the major building blocks of life -- are homochiral, which means they all vastly follow either right-handedness or left-handedness. Sugars tend to be right-handed (D-sugars), while amino acids tend to be left-handed (L-amino acids).\n\nBreslow's primary goal with the paper was to postulate on how this homochirality came about on Earth. He argued that meteorites carrying organic material struck the Earth almost four billion years ago and thus seeded life with left-handed amino acids and right-handed sugars.\n\nThough thoroughly fascinating, the paper probably wouldn't have garnered much attention from the media. Chirality simply doesn't quite captivate a mainstream audience. But you know what does? Super-intelligent advanced dinosaurs from space! In the paper's conclusion, Breslow states:\n\n\"An implication from this work is that elsewhere in the universe there\ncould be life forms based on D-amino acids and L-sugars. Such life forms\ncould well be advanced versions of dinosaurs, if mammals did not have\nthe good fortune to have the dinosaurs wiped out by an asteroidal\ncollision, as on Earth. We would be better off not meeting them.\" (added emphasis)\n\nThis conclusion spawned a headline arms race across the internet on Wednesday. A few of my favorites: \"Scientists Say Intelligent Dinosaurs Could Rule Other Planets.\" \"Dinosaurs from Space!\" \"Dinosaurs: This is the greatest closing paragraph to a scientific paper ever.\"\n\nThe last headline gets at the point I'd like to make with this post. Breslow's conclusion was only mildly connected to the paper's primary focus and a tad overstated. This may not be kosher with some, but frankly, I'm okay with it. Embellishment like that, though slightly misleading, makes science fun and accessible to the masses. If Joe Schmoe -- while aimlessly surfing the web -- gets drawn in by a headline touting \"space dinos,\" reads the article and learns a little about chirality and the origins of life, then no harm has been done. It might even inspire Joe to become a molecular biologist!\n\nNow, of course, scientists should use restraint when crafting attention-grabbing conclusions. If the researchers who conducted the study, \"Roles of the Drosophila SK Channel (dSK) in Courtship Memory\" ended by stating that fruit flies with slightly altered genetics could TAKE OVER THE WORLD, well, that's not okay. That's just crazy talk."}

{"text": "Apropos of Dayo's earlier post on superbugs, the tiny microbes often referred to as \"extremophiles\" that scientists are studying for their crafty energy-processing skills, comes this piece from the Washington Post, which places the bugs at the nexus of another modern scientific challenge: the search for extraterrestrial life. The connection between biogeologists like Indiana University's Lisa Pratt and planet-hunters like Paul Butler seems obvious: if biogeologists are able to discover bacteria thriving on the radioactive decay of nearby rocks, without exposure to sunlight for millions of years, or microbes living in 120,000 year old ice in Greenland, who's to say there aren't similar critters in Mars's frozen soil, in Titan's hydrocarbon lakes, or in the vast sea believed to be underneath Europa's crust of ice?\n\nAstrobiology, a relatively new field of study, has the scientists who study extremophiles at the fore in the search for alien life. Admittedly, the chance of discovering another life form is by no means imminent. Astrobiology became a formal NASA program in the mid-1990s, spurred by the discovery of a meteorite from Mars that scientists initially believed to contain fossil remains. Those claims are now generally believed to be false, but that hasn't stopped the field from growing. And why not? The area of study has such potentially sexy ramifications.\n\n1 comments\n\n\"Sexy\" is in the eye of the beholder.\n\nMy late father, a NASA engineer, had this to say about declining interest in (and funding for) the space program in the 70s and 80s: \"They needed to find just one palm tree and under it just one brown-skinned maiden, but instead all they found was a lot of cold rocks.\"\n\nExtraterestrial extremophiles would be a step up from cold rocks but still far short of brown- or blue-skinned maidens on the continuum of sexy."}

{"text": "Lenticular clouds over Washington: Moist air forced to flow upward around mountain tops can create lenticular clouds. Water droplets condense from moist air cooled below the dew point, and clouds are opaque groups of water droplets. Waves in the air that would normally be seen horizontally can then be seen vertically, by the different levels where clouds form. On some days the city of Seattle, Washington, USA, is treated to an unusual sky show when lenticular clouds form near Mt. Rainier, a large mountain that looms just under 100 kilometers southeast of the city.\n\nThese magnificent and slightly terrifying creatures are tardigrades\u2014stocky organisms less than 1mm long, also known as \"water bears\". They're found all over the world, from deserts to the Arctic, but they always need water to perform necessary biological processes. However, if their habitats dry up or they're exposed to physical or chemical extremes, they can enter a state of total metabolic shutdown called anhydrobiosis, and survive in this state for years\u2014then, when conditions are right again, they can just spring back to life. Anhydrobiosis involves processes at molecular and physiological levels, but basically, when cells become stressed through dehydration, 'bioprotectors' are formed to protect the cell's important molecules and minimise cell damage. Tardigrades are nicknamed the hardiest creatures on Earth, and they appear to be just as hardy above it, too. In 2007, an experiment launched them into a 10-day orbit, and proved that they can survive exposure to the sub-zero temperatures, intense radiation, and oxygen-deprived vacuum of space. Now they're part of Project Biokis, a program sponsored by the Italian Space Agency that aims to study creatures like tardigrades and develop techniques to protect other organisms\u2014humans especially\u2014from the extreme conditions of space."}

Edited by S. Holly Stocking, it's an anthology that can stand on its own, or serve as reading for a journalism class. Here's a description of the book from the publisher's web site:\n\nScience writing poses specific challenges: Science writers must engage their audiences while also explaining unfamiliar scientific concepts and processes. Further, they must illuminate arcane research methods and statistics andI'll be giving a talk at the Museum of Science in Boston on Saturday, April 17. It's the keynote address at the annual meeting of the Massachusetts Academy of Science. I'm going to talk about spangled dinosaurs, how scientists are splashing colors all over the history of life, and what all that color can tell us about evolution.\n\nMy talk is just one part of an all-day celebration of science for all ages. (The entire Zimmer clan will be in attendance.) For information on registration and tickets, visit the meeting web site.\n\nThere's a certain kind of headline I have become sick of: \"Scientists Have Sequenced the Genome of Species X!\"\n\nFifteen years ago, things were different. In 1995, scientists published the first complete genome of a free-living organisms ever\u2013that of a nasty germ called Haemophilus influenzae. Bear in mind, this was in the dark ages of the twentieth century, when a scientist might spend a decade trying to decipher the sequence of a single gene.\n\nAnd then, with a giant thwomp, a team of scientists dropped not just one gene, but 1740 genes, spelled out across 1.8 million base pairs of DNA. At the core of the paper was an image of the entire genome, a kaleidoscopic wheel marking all the genes that it takes to be H. influenzae. It had a hypnotizing effect, like a genomic mandala. Looking at it, you knew that biology would never be the same.\n\nLooking over that paper today, I'm struck by what a catalog it is. The authors listed every gene and sorted them by their likely function. They didn't find a lot of big surprises about H. influenzae itself. It had genes for metabolism, they reported, and genes for attaching to host cells, and for sensing the environment. But scientists already knew that. What was remarkable was the simple fact that scientists could now sequence so much DNA in so little time.\n\nThen came more microbes. Then, ten years ago this coming June, came a rough draft of the human genome. Then finished drafts of other animals: chickens, mice, flies, worms. Flowers, truffles, and malaria-causing parasites. They came faster and faster, cheaper and cheaper. The acceleration now means that the simple accomplishment of sequencing a genome is no longer news.\n\nOn Wednesday I caught a talk at Yale by Jonathan Rothberg, a scientist who invented \"next-generation sequencing\" in 2005. By sequencing vast numbers of DNA fragments at once, the new technology made it possible to get a genome's sequence far faster than earlier methods. Rothberg's company, 454, got bought up by Roche, leaving him without a lot to do. So he came up with a new machine: a genome sequencer about the size of a desktop printer that can knock out complete genomes with high accuracy in a matter of hours. Rothberg has been unveiling details of the machine over the past few weeks. To convince his audience that the machine actually works, he flashed another mandala wheel\u2013the 4.7 million base pairs of E. coli.\n\nI recalled when the first E. coli genome was published in 1997. It was the result of years of work by 17 co-authors, an event celebrated in newspapers. Now Rothberg just threw up a quick slide of the germ's genome just to show what he could do in a matter of hours. And I have to say that the sight of yet another circular map of a genome, on its own, no longer gave me a thrill. It's a bit like someone waving you over to a telescope and saying, \"Look! I found a star!\"\n\nWhat remains truly exciting is the kind of research starts after the genomes are sequenced: discovering what genes do, mapping out the networks in which genes cooperate, and reconstructing the deep history of life. Thanks to the hundreds of genomes of microbes scientists can now compare, for example, they can see how the history of life is, in some ways, more like a web than a tree. Insights like these are newsworthy. The sequencing of those genomes, on its own, is not.\n\nAnd yet my email inbox still gets overwhelmed with press releases about the next new genome sequence. The press releases typically read like this:\n\n\"Scientists have sequenced the genome of species X. Their research, published today in the Journal of Terribly Important Studies, will lead to new insights about this important species. Maybe it will even cure cancer or eliminate world hunger!\"\n\nAnd then those press releases give rise to news articles. Here are dozens of pieces that came out over the past couple days, describing the freshly-sequenced genome of the zebra finch. What did the scientists actually learn about zebra finches through this exercise? The articles typically referred to 800 genes involved in the birds learning how to sing. Of course, nobody seriously would expect them to use just one or two genes for something so complex, so this was no big surprise. The articles also mentioned that a lot of the genes were similar to human language genes. This is not really news, either. For the most part, the articles look to the future\u2013to experiments that scientists will be able to do on zebra finches, in the hopes of learning about human speech. But that's not news of an achievement\u2013that's a promise.\n\nPerhaps press release writers and journalists are still operating on the assumption that any new genome is news. But that assumption has been wrong for years now. Let's wait to see what scientists actually discover in those marvelous mandalas.\n\n[Update: Thanks to Jonathan Eisen for coining the easy-t0-remember acronym for my current disorder: YAGS. That goes into my personal lexicon right away.]\n\nThis morning, during my daily graze of news and commentary, I've come across some fairly excellent science-themed April Fool's jokes. But it will take an exceptional hoax to mount a serious challenge to what is arguably the finest science-themed April Fool's joke of all time, which today celebrates its fifteenth anniversary: the tale of the hotheaded naked ice borer.\n\nThen-Discover-senior-editor, now-contributing-editor, and forever-all-around-good-guy Tim Folger concocted an article detailing the mystery of penguins vanishing from sight, and the discovery of a thermally endowed rodent that melted the ice under their feet and dragged them into their frozen tunnels.\n\nIn fairness to the fooled, science is often so bizarre, it's not always easy to distinguish the reality from the hoax. (And fortunately, this morning's good news about science writer's Simon Singh's victory against chiropractors and the ridiculous libel laws of England is no joke.) So far, here the ones I've encountered that have made me smile\u2026add you own in the comment thread.\n\nCorey writes, \"I got this tattoo as an homage to the pain of my graduate work. It's a model of fulvic acid which is a representation of natural organic matter in the soil. I work with this molecule for my grad work and I figured I might as well get it etched into my skin so I can look at it and say, 'Well, at least it hurt less than grad school at Cornell.'\"\n\nMost of life on Earth is a mystery to us. The bulk of biomass on the planet is made up of microbes. By some estimates, there may be 150 million species of bacteria, but scientists have only formally named a few thousand of them. One of the big causes of this ignorance is that scientists don't know how to raise microbe colonies. If you scoop up some dirt and stick it under a microscope, you'll see lots of different microbes living happily there. If you mash up all the DNA in that mud and read its sequence, you'll discover an astonishing diversity of genes belonging to those microbes\u2013thousands in a single spoon of soil. But now try to rear those microbes in a lab. When scientists try, they generally fail. A tiny fraction of one percent of microbe species will grow under ordinary conditions in Petri dish.\n\nThis staggering difficulty is the reason why E. coli and a few other species became the laboratory darlings of biologists during the 1900s. As I write in Microcosm, E. coli will happily explode in a flask full of broth. As a result, a lot of what we know about life we know from E. coli. Certainly a lot of those lessons hold true for any species\u2013genes encoded in DNA, DNA used to produce RNA and proteins, a genetic code, and so on. But there are a lot of microbes that are very unlike E. coli. Even in our gut, for example, E. coli is just a minor player in an ecosystem made up of hundreds or thousands of species. Yet we know relatively little about its neighbors.\n\nOne reason for the trouble we have in raising microbes is that the environment we like is not the environment a lot of them like. If you are feeding on minerals in boiling water at the bottom of the ocean, it's possible that you might find life in a luke-warm flask in an oxygen-rich atmosphere at sea-level air pressure unbearable\u2013perhaps even toxic.\n\nBut the physical surroundings of microbes can't account for all the trouble they pose for would-be microbial zoo-keepers. If you scoop up some wet sand from a pleasant beach, you will still be hard-pressed to get more than a few species to grow in the lab.\n\nTo coax bacteria to grow, microbiologists have been upgrading their Petri dishes. They have been building cages that mimic the natural habitat of the bacteria, and in some cases taking their chambers out of the lab and putting them in the environments where the bacteria live.\n\nThese semi-wild chambers have brought scientists more success, and they've also helped scientists figure out why the microbes are so hard to grow in the first place. Along with the right physical conditions, microbes need to live alongside the right microbes.\n\nIn the new issue of Chemistry and Biology, a team of scientists\u2013led by Anthony D'Onofrio, a post-doc in the laboratory of Kim Lewis at Northeastern University, and Jason Crawford in the lab of Jon Clardy at Harvard\u2013report a striking success in cultivating bacteria that were previously impossible to cultivate. They made their discovery while studying some bacteria that live on a beach near Boston. Some of the bacteria, while unable to grow on their own in a Petri dish, grew if they were near certain other species. Perhaps, the scientists speculated, the hard-to-grow bacteria depended on something the other species made.\n\nThe scientists tested different molecules made by bacteria to see if any of them were fostering the growth. They eventually figured out that the responsible molecule was something known as a siderophore. Some species of bacteria make siderophores as a way to get their minimal daily required does of iron. Iron is essential for the growth of cells, but in many environments free iron is in short supply. So bacteria make iron-trapping molecules\u2013siderophores\u2013and release them through special channels. The siderophores drift around, and sometimes manage to snag iron atoms. They fold up around the iron, assuming a shape that allows them to slip through other channels back into the bacteria. Once inside, they open up again and set their iron free.\n\nIt turns out that a lot of species on the beaches around Boston\u2013and presumably in a lot of other places in the world\u2013don't make their own siderophores. Instead, they rely on other species to produce siderophores, and once those molecules swallow up the iron, the bacteria that don't make siderophores snatch them up. The scientists found that with different kinds of siderophores made by different species of bacteria, they could suddenly get a lot of microbes to grow.\n\nDiscoveries like these are exciting both in a practical and intellectual way. We've already harvested lots of valuable molecules from microbes, such as antibiotics and gene-copying enzymes. If scientists can raise lots of new species of microbes, they may be able to find new molecules. But the result is fascinating in itself. Apparently, a lot of microbial species depend on the kindness of strangers. And apparently, there are bacteria out there that are churning out siderophores despite the fact that other species are slurping up the iron they forage. If that was all there was to the story, this would not be a situation that could last long. The cheaters would thrive by skipping the effort of making siderophores, and eventually there wouldn't be enough honest bacteria left to keep all the microbes supplied with their iron. It's likely, instead, that the cheaters are not cheaters at all, but rather have services of their own to offer the microbial community.\n\nAnd so the reason that we know so little about life on Earth may be that we have yet to figure out the complicated social life of microbes.\n\nToday Discover gains two new bloggers: Razib Khan and Ed Yong.

{"text": "Science and Society\n\nBig Myths of Everyday Science\n\n1 of 26\n\nThe myth: Food that you drop on the floor is OK to eat if you pick it up within five seconds (a.k.a. the \"Five Second Rule\"). The reality: Germs are on the floor, and if food lands on the germs, they will stick to the food immediately. This is especially true in the kitchen, where bacteria such as salmonella thrive. Seen here is a salmonella culture, so ask yourself: Do you want to eat that?Image Credit: AP Photo/Elaine Thompson\n\nThe myth: Acids will burn your skin, and even disfigure you. The reality: Hundreds of different acids exist, and most of them aren't strong enough to damage your skin. Vinegar and citric acid are two weak acids that we consume frequently. However, some acids are corrosive. Hydrochloric, nitric and sulfuric acids can damage skin -- like that of the woman in this picture, who was burned by sulfuric acid from batteries -- but not all acids will do so.Image Credit: Paula Bronstein/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: Brain cells don't regenerate. The reality: The reason people believe this myth is that scientists thought for a long time that complex brains would be disrupted by new cell growth. In 1998, however, scientists in Sweden and at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif., discovered that brain cells can regenerate. The learning and memory center of the brain can create new cells. Even better news is that Steve Stice, a University of Georgia stem cell researcher, discovered a process to create replicas of human embryonic stem cells that can morph into brain cells. Shown above are stem cells from a tank in his lab in Athens, Ga., Tuesday, March 13, 2007.Image Credit: AP Photo/John Bazemore\n\nThe myth: A penny dropped from a tall building can kill someone on the ground. The reality: While people may think a penny dropped from the Empire State Building would pick up enough speed to kill a person on the ground, this just isn't true. The non-aerodynamic nature of a penny, as well as its relatively small mass, keeps this from happening. A person on the ground would most certainly feel a sting from the impact, but the penny wouldn't kill.Image Credit: Michel Porro/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: Lightning doesn't strike the same place twice. The reality: Lightning can absolutely strike the same place twice. In fact, it's actually quite common -- the Empire State Building is struck by lightning about 25 times per year, for example. Lightning favors tall buildings and trees, but in a large field, lightning is likely to strike the tallest object several times before it moves sufficiently far away to find another tall target. Above, multiple bolts of lightning strike the ground in the desert north of Scottsdale, Ariz., during a late evening storm.Image Credit: AP Photo/Scott Troyanos\n\nThe myth: There's no gravity in space. The reality: Yes, there is a lot of gravity in space. So much, in fact, that gravity is what causes stars to orbit the center of a galaxy, Earth to orbit the sun and a satellite to orbit the Earth. The reason that astronauts seem to be weightless in space is that they are orbiting Earth; they're falling towards it, but moving sufficiently sideways to miss it. In short, they're falling but never landing. At orbit height, about 250 miles (402 kilometers) above Earth, gravity is only reduced by 10 percent.Image Credit: NASA/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: There is a dark side of the moon. The reality: The dark side of the moon only exists as a Pink Floyd album. The sun illuminates every part of the moon at some point. There is, however, a side of the moon that is never visible from Earth. This is caused by tidal locking, which causes the moon to take just as long to rotate around its own axis as it does to revolve around Earth. We always see the same side of the moon, but the other side isn't always dark -- when we have a crescent moon, sunlight mostly illuminates the side we don't see.Image Credit: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: Evolution means getting better, or going from \"lower\" to \"higher.\" The reality: Though natural selection weeds out less advantageous genes from the gene pool, imperfect organisms often survive. Mosses, fungi, sharks and crayfish, among others, have remained basically unchanged over long periods of time. Other species have changed a lot, and not always in ways that seem like obvious improvements. Evolving to be more \"fit\" doesn't necessarily mean a species makes \"progress\" -- it just means it is more likely to survive and reproduce in its environment.Image Credit: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: Humans explode in the vacuum of space. The reality: This comes from science fiction movies, not real life. Humans can survive brief encounters with empty space as long as they fully exhale beforehand. This keeps the lungs from bursting, which would send air into the bloodstream. Without oxygen, however, the person will pass into unconsciousness and die from asphyxiation. This is one reason why space suits are so important: They let us breathe in the vacuum of space.Image Credit: Buyenlarge/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: Synthetic chemicals are dangerous. The reality: Many chemicals made in laboratories and factories are exactly the same as those found in nature, and very few synthetic products are as toxic as natural substances. Some natural chemicals are fatal. Cyanide is a natural substance, and it's fatal at a dose of 10,000 mcg. Botulism is natural, but a thimbleful could kill half the people in a city. Even common plants like poison oak and poison ivy are dangerous. On the other hand, the majority of prescription drugs are synthetic, and they've helped dramatically increase life expectancy.Image Credit: David McNew/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: We only use 10 percent of our brains. The reality: If this is true, why is it that damaging almost any part of the brain inhibits some vital cognitive or regulatory function? Variations of this myth state that each of us only uses 10 or 20 percent of our dearest organ, but in fact, imaging technologies like fMRI reveal that we use most or all of our brains in one way or another. What is certainly true is that we all fall short of our maximum intellectual potential in the way we live our lives -- which is probably the metaphorical origin of this pseudo-factoid.Image Credit: Charles Hewitt/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: Going out in chilly weather causes you to catch cold. The reality: A cold is caused by a viral infection of the respiratory system. Viruses don't magically appear in your body because you went out to get the mail without your scarf and mittens. Most of the time, we contract viruses when we come into close contact with other people who are already infected, which means you're putting yourself at greater risk for disease by staying inside by the fire with your friends and family than you would if you wandered off into the icy woods all alone.Image Credit: Rob Penn/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: Studies show vaccines cause autism. The reality: There is no salient evidence linking childhood vaccines to autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This myth has a clearer origin than most: A 1998 paper in the respected medical journal The Lancet seemed to indicate that the common MMR vaccine could lead to the development of ASD. Not only was this study later retracted and denounced by the journal, but many characterized it as a work of outright scientific fraud, in which researchers had tampered with the data to fit the desired conclusions. Despite this retraction, many parents have remained wary of vaccines. While there's no conclusive proof that vaccines do not cause ASD, no significant research stands to show that it does.Image Credit: iStockphoto/Thinkstock\n\nThe myth: Rubber tires protect a car from lightning. The reality: The tires have nothing to do with it. If you're unlucky enough to be caught out in a thunderstorm, it is certainly safer to be inside a car than outside. Cars provide fairly strong fortification against lightning strikes, but not for the reason you'd think. When lightning strikes an automobile, it's actually the car's metal exterior frame that protects the passengers, acting as a conductor and passing the electrical current right along to the ground. This is the reason that a convertible, no matter how rubber its tires are, can't protect you like a hardtop vehicle.Image Credit: AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez\n\nThe myth: Sugar makes children hyperactive. The reality: Let them eat cake! Researchers have found no substantial link between the consumption of sugar and hyperactivity. A meta-analysis published by the Journal of the American Medical Association found that over 16 qualified studies, researchers could identify no significant correlation between sugar intake and cognitive performance or behavior. Of course, there are plenty of well-established links between sugar intake and obesity (as well as other problems), so parents should still know when to take away the cotton candy.Image Credit: Paul Conrath/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: The Big Bang theory explains how the universe was created or began to exist. The reality: The Big Bang theory extrapolates from our observations about the present universe that the early universe underwent a massive, rapid expansion that has continued to this day. Some people have interpreted the data to postulate that time, space, matter and energy had a beginning in the finite past, but the central value of the Big Bang theory is the explanation of the early expansion of the universe -- not how the universe came into being.Image Credit: Courtesy NASA\n\nThe myth: The Earth is closer to the sun in summer. The reality: It's just not. In fact, the exact opposite is true for people who live above the equator: The Earth is closest to the sun in January, which is a winter month in the Northern Hemisphere. Of course, for people in the Southern Hemisphere, January's the best time to hit the beach and enjoy a cool glass of lemonade in the afternoon. So what causes the seasons if not distance to the sun? It's the tilt of the Earth's axis. The Earth wobbles as it rotates. Thus, your summer months are the time when your part of the globe receives the most direct sunlight, and winter months are the time when the sun's rays reach you at an oblique angle. Image Credit: NASA\n\nThe myth: Albert Einstein flunked his math classes in school. The reality: Einstein, by all accounts, was always good at math. Other versions of this myth allege that Einstein was an all-around poor student. There's no evidence for this; in fact, remaining records indicate that the young Albert did very well in his classes and received high marks. It's a wonderful excuse for underachieving kids to feed their parents: \"Even Einstein got D's!\" Unfortunately, you can take no refuge in the idea of a slacker Einstein -- so study up.Image Credit: Central Press/Stringer/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: Humans evolved from chimpanzees. The reality: You are not looking at your distant grandfather -- you're looking at your distant cousin. Humans and chimpanzees evolved from the same common ancestor. Human beings share at least 95 percent of their DNA with chimpanzees, and studies of comparative anatomy and comparative genetics can show us really how much our bodies have in common with those of our hairy relatives. The reason for the similarity is that we have a common ancestor; the reason for the difference is that our genetic paths diverged at some point in the past, and we evolved different characteristics in the intervening years.Image Credit: Gerry Ellis/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: Antibiotics kill viruses. The reality: Antibiotics are wonderful little targeted poisons that help your body kill bacteria -- that's bacteria, not viruses. Furthermore, you can't exactly \"kill\" a virus at all, since a virus is not really alive to begin with. When a disgusting flu or cold sets in, we all wish we could take a pill to chase it away. Unfortunately, you can't battle the germs that cause cold and flu this way, and in many cases, taking antibiotics for a viral infection could make the problem worse. Stick to your doctor's advice and only take antibiotics when he or she specifically prescribes them.Image Credit: Courtesy Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: A full moon makes people go nuts. The reality: You're only especially liable to commit murders on a full moon if you're a werewolf. For centuries, nearly all cultures have ascribed mystical powers and otherworldly influence to the bright, round face of a full moon. In fact, the English words \"lunacy\" and \"lunatic\" come from the word \"lunar\" -- having to do with the moon. But despite the general consent of human mythology, this notion is not borne out by science, and multiple investigations have found no substantial link between the phases of the moon and murder, aggression, insanity, vandalism of national monuments, prank phone calls, or human sacrifice rituals.Image Credit: Getty Images\n\nThe myth: A penny placed on a railroad track can derail a train. The reality: Get real. Freight trains weigh many thousands of tons. This would be kind of like saying you could capsize a barge with a firecracker. The U.S. Federal Railroad Administration has no record of a coin wrecking a train, though larger obstructions like cars and rocks have caused deadly derailments, so locomotives are by no means invincible. And for that matter, neither are you -- while pennies don't derail trains, plenty of people have themselves been hit by trains or otherwise killed while trying to flatten pennies on railroad tracks. If you really want to smash a penny flat, take it to one of those machines in the gift shop. Image Credit: Roland Magunia/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: Bats are blind. The reality: Bats see just fine, thank you very much. Bats like Chiroderma villosum (shown above) have eyes, and their eyes work. It's as simple as that. So what's the origin of this myth? Like dogs, bats rely heavily on other senses like hearing and smell. In fact, using a hyper-advanced sound-based system called echolocation, bats are able to maintain their bearings while flying at night and to hunt nearly invisible prey in the dark. It may be the fact that these creatures are unfazed by darkness that has led people to assume their eyes are vestigial.Image Credit: Oxford Scientific/Getty Images\n\nThe myth: The Coriolis effect is what determines the clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of water in a flushed toilet. The reality: Sadly, this is one of the rare instances in which Lisa Simpson gets the science wrong. In the sixth-season Simpsons episode \"Bart vs. Australia,\" Lisa educates her brother on the Coriolis effect, which she claims causes water to drain counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern. This is not really true. The Coriolis effect is the name for an inertial force that determines the trajectory of objects moving within a rotating frame of reference. For example, it helps us understand how the rotation of the Earth affects the movement of weather patterns. The amount of water in your toilet is too small to be affected by Coriolis.\nNow that you've seen our Big Myths of Everyday Science Pictures, check out our 10 Science Principles You See in Action Every Day.Image Credit: Courtesy China Photos/Getty Images"}

{"text": "Sensational Science in the Popular Press: Can Anyone Get it Right?\n\nThis month for \"Sensational Science\" I decided to resist my go-to sensational blogs and look around some popular press (OK, TV). How popular? I'm talking ABC, FOX, BBC, etc. It doesn't get more popular than that. But before I get into some of the misleading headlines these giants dole out, I want to take a moment to reflect on the prominence of science news in the most popular of presses: the websites of these TV organizations. For lack of a better order, I'll go alphabetical.\n\nThe ABC News page does not have the word \"science\" anywhere on it. Instead you must choose either \"Tech\" or \"Health\".\n\nThe BBC however, has a link to their \"Science\" section in three places: very top, very bottom, and smack in the middle of the page. And their science section is quite good (pretend I used a British accept for \"quite good\"!)\n\nCBS is just like ABC, although once you click on \"Tech\" they start talking about \"Sci/Tech\" which is better than nothing. I think.\n\nCNN also has the \"Health\" or \"Tech\" options from their homepage, with no science. Although, in searching the homepage for any mention of the word \"science\" I came across the headline: \"Science behind 'teh intarwebs'\". I literally couldn't bring myself to read the article, so let me know if it is any good.\n\nFOX has a \"SciTech\" link from their homepage, and that section has multiple sub-sections about different science and tech fields. In contrast, the \"Tech\" sections on the other broadcasters' sites focus on technology, the internet, gadgets, etc. instead of the natural sciences.\n\nFinally, NBC (in this case MSNBC) has a \"Tech & Science\" link at the top of their page and when you roll over it this crazy menu drops down and you can choose \"Science\" or other science and tech related sub-sections.\n\nOf course, that's not to say the quality there is great- two of the MSNBC top science stories were about mythical beasts: one about the Yeti and one about the kraken. And in their \"Tech\" beat CNN reports the BlackBerry outage has impacted almost every planet. If the other planets NEVER have BlackBerry can you really count it as an outage?\n\nIs that really science? Or is that really what scientific news has boiled down to? Either lumping it in with \"tech\" or not giving it much coverage at all. Plus, as I'll show below, even the coverage science gets is pretty weak.\n\nWhy it's misleading: The headline and opening paragraph of this article imply eating fruits and veggies can \"have an effect on genes linked to heart disease.\" Really? What you EAT can alter your genetic material? The article goes on to state \"that eating fruits and vegetables may actually change a gene variant, called 9p21, that is one of the strongest predictors for heart disease.\" That seemed far out to me, and of course that's not what the actual study suggests. Instead, the direct quote from the actual researcher notes: \"We found that in people with this high-risk gene who consumed a diet rich in vegetables and fruits, their risk came down to that of people who don't have that gene.\" That makes more sense, what you eat isn't going to change your genes. Whew!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWhy it's misleading: The reporting isn't too far off, but the author of the article interviews \"a co-author of the study, which pointedly does not use the word \"cloning\" to describe the results.\" In this way, the impression is given that they really did cloning, but are too nervous to bring up such a controversial topic. In reality, it is probably more likely that the researcher didn't call it cloning, because it isn't really cloning. They didn't create an exact genetic copy- they knew they had extra chromosomes in their cell lines. They were abnormal. They were close to making a clone, and it might be easier to explain it that way to lay people but call it what it is, and don't call it what it isn't! If they're able to use this technique without ending up with extra genetic material, then it would be a clone. How would you write that new story? \"Scientists who cloned are able to actually clone?\"\n\n.\n\n.\n\nNick Fahrenkopf is a Ph.D. candidate studying nanobiosciences- applying physics and engineering concepts and techniques to biological and medical problems.

M. mycoides are parasitic bacteria that live in cattle and goats, causing lung disease. You can see the plasma membrane surrounding the cell, but Mycoplasma, like animal cells and unlike most bacteria, are distinguished by the lack of a cell wall. This means they are immune to antibiotics like penicillin which target cell walls. M. pneumoniae is a species that causes disease in humans.\n\nMycoplasmas are interesting because they're the smallest self-replicating organisms that exist. Since mycoplasmas represent nature's most minimal self-reproductive machinery, their study could help define the essential nature of biological life itself.

You can view many of the photos on Flickr or at the Library of Congress.\n\nIn case you missed it, the New Yorker published a great, but terrifying look into science's sordid past this last December. Operation Delirium and High Anxiety: LSD in the Cold War detail the US army's experiments in mind control and chemical warfare during the cold war, centered around Edgewood Arsenal, in Maryland.\n\nThe efforts were led by Colonel James S. Ketchum, who wanted to develop a more humane approach to war: the enemy was not to be killed, only incapacitated using various chemical agents. Never mind that those agents might well be nerve gas, and the mechanism of incapacitation extreme mental or physiological stress. His best bet for such an incapacitating agent was BZ, an anticholinergic drug like scopolamine or atropine which causes delirium. (These drugs work by blocking the transmission of the important neurotransmitter acetylcholine.) At one point Ketchum's team resorted to building \"an entire Hollywood-style set in the form of a makeshift communications outpost.\" Soldiers were placed on the outpost and dosed with either placebo or varying doses of BZ. Then Ketchum set about trying to fuck with their heads in any way he could think of:\n\nTwo hundred phony tactical messages, warnings of chemical attacks, and intelligence were fed to the men in the room. At one point, Ketchum and the others ran out of script. \"In an urgent brainstorming session, we put our heads together and came up with an agonizingly improvised scenario,\" he recalled in his memoir. \"We told the military communicators to start sending new intelligence to the group inside the room\u2014in a simple code. The messages informed the men that enemy forces were planning to move a train loaded with chemical weapons along a certain route.\" Eventually, Ketchum and the technicians resorted to gibberish, using poker terms, referring to \"the dealer\" and a \"full house,\" as the BZ-addled soldiers struggled to interpret their code.\n\nKetchum was flanked by Dr. Van Murray Sim, who founded the Edgewood program on psychochemicals in 1956. Sim's grand idea was the use of LSD-25 to loosen the tongue of what might today be euphemistically called \"enemy combatants,\" or if that didn't work, make them so mad that they'd tell any secrets they had just to escape the torture. Maybe it was cruel, but surely, the logic went, the Communists were doing the same, and the US could not afford compassion. Besides, Sim figured, if he was willing to test the chemicals on himself first and he was fine, surely he could test them on others.\n\nOne chilling story is that of Private James Thornwell. Throwing informed consent to the wind, Sim theorized that expectations about a drug's effect would influence the intoxication, and so it was vital that the subjects did not know what they were given, or even that they were given anything. When word got around about the kind of experiments going on at Edgewood, Sim was forced to relocate his experiments to Europe and, eventually, to Asia. James Thornwell was the only African-American working at an American military-communications station in France. After a falling out with his superior, Thornwell was accused of stealing classified documents. After three months of torturous interrogations, Thornwell insisting on his innocence, he was released\u2014not to freedom, but into the hands of Sim's special investigators, who repeatedly dosed an already half-mad man with LSD without his knowledge. Thornwell never recovered. The experiment was deemed a success.\n\nIt wasn't only the military who were carelessly experimenting on humans. Under the innocuous-sounding title Effect of some Indolealkylines in Man, a 1959 medical paper details some rather cruel experiments. Ostensibly, the scientists set out to study the effects of a psychedelic snuff used across Central and South America. Failing to achieve any effect from the snuff, they isolated two pure chemical compounds for further study. They were n,n-DMT, a powerful psychedelic also found in the traditional brew ayahuasca, and bufotenine, a chemical cousin of the neurotransmitter serotonin. These chemicals were injected intravenously into schizophrenic patients.\n\nHere is a description of one of the experiments:\n\nIn several subjects who had more than 10 mg of bufotenine injected quickly, there was intense salivation. The present subject could easily have drowned in her own saliva, and she had to be turned on her side. (\u2026) Responsiveness returned at about 23 minutes, at which time the patient was entirely lucid and, in response to a query related to a preinjection question, spoke of a long-repressed memory from the age of three years, when she came into the bathroom and saw her mother die of a uterine hemorrhage.\n\nBut this revelation \"had no therapeutic consequence.\"\n\nIn further experiments, we read, three patients\u2014as if they were patients undergoing treatment, not guinea pigs for mad scientists\u2014were injected bufotenine after receiving reserpine or chlorpromazine (both antipsychotic drugs). \"Each of these injections almost proved fatal in small amounts.\" After one subject almost died, they repeated the experiment two more times just to make sure. It's the same absurd logic which prompted Sim's LSD researchers to respond to adverse reactions by doubling the dose in the next trial.\n\nThe LSD trials were suspended in 1963, but the Edgewood experiments continued into the 1970s.\n\nThe media are abuzz with news of an experiment that manages to create negative absolute temperature. Phys.org:\n\nIn order to bring water to the boil, energy needs to be added to the water. During heating up, the water molecules increase their kinetic energy over time and move faster on average. Yet, the individual molecules possess different kinetic energies \u2013 from very slow to very fast. In thermal equilibrium, low-energy states are more likely than high-energy states, i.e. only a few particles move really fast. In physics, this distribution is called Boltzmann distribution. Physicists around Ulrich Schneider and Immanuel Bloch have now realized a gas in which this distribution is exactly inverted: Many particles possess large energies and only a few have small energies. This inversion of the energy distribution means that the particles have assumed a negative absolute temperature.\n\nThe Boltzmann distribution can be illustrated with balls that are distributed on a hilly landscape, which provides both a lower and upper bound for the potential energy of the balls. At positive temperatures (left figure), as they are common in everyday life, most balls lie in the valley around minimum potential energy. They barely move and therefore also possess minimum kinetic energy. States with small total energy are therefore more likely than those with large total energy \u2013 the usual Boltzmann distribution. At infinite temperature (central figure) the balls spread evenly over low and high energies in an identical landscape. Here, all energy states are equally probable. At negative temperatures (right figure), however, most balls wander on top of the hill, at the upper limit of potential energy. Also their kinetic energy is maximal. Energy states with large total energy are occupied more than those with small total energy \u2013 the Boltzmann distribution is inverted.\n\nThis large study published earlier this year and involving tracking more than 400,000 participants over twelve years looked at the correlation between coffee drinking and mortality. It found that, all else being equal, there is an inverse correlation between coffee drinking and mortality, or, in other words, people who drink a lot of coffee died less often:\n\nIn this large, prospective U.S. cohort study, we observed a dose-dependent inverse association between coffee drinking and total mortality, after adjusting for potential confounders (smoking status in particular). As compared with men who did not drink coffee, men who drank 6 or more cups of coffee per day had a 10% lower risk of death, whereas women in this category of consumption had a 15% lower risk. Similar associations were observed whether participants drank predominantly caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee.\n\nHowever, all else is rarely equal. The study also found that coffee drinkers were more likely to have other habits, particularly smoking, that correlate with higher mortality. When not correcting for these factors, coffee drinkers were a bit more likely to die. In other words, coffee appears to be good for your health, but if you drink a lot of coffee, statistically you're more likely to have other, unhealthy habits that increase mortality.\n\nSome of the more interesting things that passed through these pages in 2012.\n\nThe Brocken Spectre is an optical phenomenon in which the observer's shadow appears to be magnified on clouds or fog below.\n\nPsychedelics are back in science. After decades of little research due to drug hysteria, scientists have started exploring the therapeutic potential of psychedelics and similar drugs again. Here is the New York Times reporting on a promising study of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD.\n\nOn February 9, 1913, a unique procession of meteors was observed from North America. This meteor shower may have been the breakup of a short-lived, small second moon.\n\nRare earth metals are important for a number of modern technologies. China has a near-monopoly on the world's supply, and they're prepared to use it for political gain.\n\nSome people might point out that \"conformations\" and \"configurations\" are also concepts in organic chemistry that mean much the same thing, and that this post is a thinly disguised effort to teach concepts in organic chemistry through a discussion of cats. Horseshit. This is 100% cat content here people! This is a cat blog.\n\nSometimes, the ways science goes wrong are as interesting as the ways it goes right. Nowadays, it seems uncommon for major discoveries which have been accepted by the scientific establishment for centuries to be proven completely wrong; they are more likely to be incrementally improved upon. Newtonian physics wasn't wrong, it just wasn't as right as Einstein's relativity (which is to say, in most everyday situations, the two are indistinguishable, but Newton goes wrong in border cases he had no way to test, or even conceive of). But in the early days of modern science, some theories were put forth and widely accepted which turned out to be not only less than complete, but spectacularly wrong. One of my favorites is the phlogiston theory of combustion, which turned out to be the exact opposite of correct.\n\nAnother is the theory of preformationism. It holds that living beings are not assembled from parts, but that their form has actually existed since creation. Human beings come from homunculi, from the Latin for \"little man\": in other words, humans grow from tiny versions of themselves which are identical in form to an adult. Even after Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, pioneer in microscopy, in 1677 discovered sperm cells, some scientists continued to hold that there must be tiny humans inside each cell (illustrated above). There was even scientific debate about whether the homunculi resided inside the ovum or the sperm cell. Today, this sounds like a \"how many angels can dance on the head of a pin?\" type of question.\n\nOf course, one consequence of such a theory would be that humanity has a predetermined lifespan. After all, if humans nest inside each other like Russian dolls, at some point, the chain must end. A single sperm cell cannot contain an infinite amount of tinier humans with even tinier sperm cells with tinier humans.\n\nI'm going to do something I don't usually do on this blog and recommend some science-minded fiction. Notice that I don't say \"science fiction\". A lot of sci-fi is indistinguishable from fantasy, introducing impossible premises and then ignoring them when convenient, applying them when the plot requires. Science-minded fiction, on the other hand, would be fiction that takes false or impossible premises and then works out, in logical fashion, what the consequences would be.\n\nOne of my favorite authors of such fiction is Ted Chiang. He is not a very prolific author, but almost everything he publishes is gold. Every year he publishes a story, he earns at least a nomination for a Hugo or Nebula award. You should check out his collection of short stories, Stories of Your Life and Others. In that book, there is a story called Seventy-Two Letters, which imagines a world where Jewish mysticism and the preformation theory are true. Division by Zero is a story about a mathematician who discovers that mathematics is inconsistent. The title story is perhaps the best one in the collection, dealing with the now discredited Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and some other stuff I'm not going to spoil. If this sort of thing interests you, do check it out. Most of the stories in the collection have been available online at one time or another, so you might be able to find them if you're cheap or impatient.\n\nIf you ever need to write an academic smackdown, let this document be your guide. Lyle Campbell, an expert in historical linguistics, basically destroys any sort of argument that we can know anything about the earliest human language.\n\nLanguage, presumably, evolved once. Logically, then, there should be a most recent common ancestor of all natural languages in the world. Linguists have a procedure called the comparative method by which they can figure out which languages are related, how they are related, and by which they can make reasonable reconstructions of the theoretical, unattested proto-languages that form the root of a language family. As you might expect, it hinges on side-by-side comparisons of languages. (Fun fact: one of the founders of historical linguistics and the comparative method is Jacob Grimm, most famous as one half of the folklore-collecting Brothers Grimm. Grimm's Law, a set of systematic sound changes in the history of Germanic languages, is named after him.)\n\nMost famously, linguists have reconstructed Proto-Indo-European, the unattested ancestor of languages as varied as Sanskrit, English, Latin and Russian. This language is believed to have been spoken some five or six thousand years ago. But humans are believed to have reached Australia by 50,000 years ago, so the common ancestor of all human languages would be at least ten times as old as Proto-Indo-European.\n\nSome people have attempted to use a comparative approach to reconstruct this language, but Campbell shows again and again how this approach yields results that are no better than chance. Basically, what defenders of \"Proto-World\" do is try to find words that mean roughly the same thing in different language families and which look roughly the same, but both the semantic and the phonetic constraints they use are extremely liberal. One of their defining examples is *tik, a root which supposedly meant \"finger\". Although Campbell doesn't say so in that many words, it's essentially wishful thinking. You find what you want to find, because, as Campbell demonstrates, it's extremely easy to find false correlations. Not to mention that if there is a common ancestor of all human languages, from what we know about how languages change over time, we would expect that every single word in every single language would have changed so much as to be unrecognizable over the past fifty thousand years.\n\nIn the end, says Campbell, we will never know much of anything about the earliest human languages unless we invent a time machine. There simply isn't any written material going back far enough, and there isn't enough information in present-day languages to reconstruct their oldest ancestors. The only thing we can know for sure about the earliest human language is that it would have obeyed certain universals\u2014the particulars of which are a subject of acedemic debate\u2014which all present-day human languages obey, but that is only by definition, because anything that came before that would not be what we today define as human language.\n\nIt's rare that we run into a scientific question that is fundamentally impossible to answer, but this is one of them. The information required to answer it simply doesn't exist. It's just one of those things, which is sad, because I, for one, find the emergence of language\u2014one of the defining features which distinguish humans from other animals\u2014to be extremely fascinating."}

Each one is half as wide as a grain of salt. Taste cells, which appear here as red and green, bunch together to form the taste buds. The red cells taste sour things. It's not clear yet what the green cells taste. Courtesy of Thomas Finger\n\nIt was an exciting day when Thomas Finger looked inside the nose of a small black mouse. Finger had borrowed the animal from another scientist. It was not your average mouse.\n\nThe mouse's genes had been changed so that the taste buds on its tongue turned green when you shined light on them \u2014 like a secret message written in secret ink.\n\nBut no one had ever looked inside its nose. When Finger finally did look there with a microscope, he saw thousands of green cells dotting the soft pink lining. \"It was like looking at little green stars at night,\" says Finger, who is a neurobiologist at the Rocky Mountain Taste and Smell Center at the University of Colorado in Denver. (A neurobiologist studies how the nervous system develops and functions.)\n\nSeeing that green starry sky was Finger's first glimpse of a new world. If he and other scientists are right, we don't taste things just on our tongues. Other parts of our body can also taste things \u2014 our nose, our stomach, even our lungs!\n\nYou might think of taste as something that you experience when you put chocolate in your mouth \u2014 or chicken soup, or salt. But for you to taste chocolate or chicken soup, special cells on your tongue have to tell the brain that they detected chemicals that are in the food. We have at least five kinds of these chemical-detecting cells (commonly called taste cells) on our tongues: cells that detect salt, sweet compounds, sour things, bitter things and savory things like meat or broth.\n\nYou might call these five things the primary colors of your mouth. The unique taste of every food is made up of some combination of salt, sweet, sour, bitter or savory, just as you can make any color of paint by mixing together bits of red, yellow and blue.\n\nIt's these chemical-sensing cells that scientists are now finding all over the body.\n\n\"I'll bet you that in terms of total number of cells,\" says Finger, \"there are more [taste cells] outside the mouth than inside the mouth.\"\n\nThis gives us clues about other functions the sense of taste has in our bodies. It could also help scientists find new treatments for certain diseases.\n\nFish skin: more than a feeling\n\nIt's an exciting time for scientists who study taste. Finger spent 30 years working toward this big moment. Some of the first clues came from fish. Back in the 1960s, scientists looking at fish skin under microscopes discovered that the outside of a fish's slippery body is dotted with thousands of funny cells shaped like bowling pins. Those funny cells look just like the chemical-detecting cells on your tongue. At the time, no one was sure what those bowling-pin cells on fish skin did. But years later, scientists found that they actually can taste. When food chemicals were sprinkled onto the fish skin, those cells sent a message to the fish brain \u2014 just like the cells on your tongue tell your brain when you taste food.\n\nNosey tasters: Taste cells on the inside of the nose of a genetically engineered mouse appear green under the microscope. Those taste cells talk to the treelike branches of nerve cells, which are red in this picture. Credit: Thomas Finger\n\nFor fish, being able to taste things all over their body comes in handy. Some fish called searobins use this to find their next meal. When searobins poke their pointy fins into the mud on the seafloor, they can \"taste\" the worms they're looking to eat. Other fish called rocklings use these cells to sense the presence of larger fish that might want to eat them.\n\nIn these cases, the buried worms and big fish leak small amounts of chemicals into the water and mud. Taste cells on the skin of searobins and rocklings detect the chemicals (sort of the way you might be able to taste what's in the bathwater after your filthy little brother sat in the tub for a while).\n\nAs Finger studied searobins, goldfish and other wet critters, he began to wonder whether land animals like cats, mice and people could also sense taste outside of their tongues. \"Why wouldn't it be a good idea?\" he asks. \"The more information you get from your environment, the better off you are.\"\n\nPeeling mud\n\nBut finding taste cells on land animals wasn't easy. Unlike fishes', their skin is covered in a dry crust of dead cells, like the layer of cracked mud that forms as a water puddle dries. A taste cell hidden under that crust wouldn't function. It needs to come into contact with chemicals in the outside world in order to detect them. So Finger decided to look at the wetter, fishier parts of our body. He started his search deep inside the nose.\n\nThat's when he borrowed the mouse with the green taste buds \u2014 and found those green, bowling pin-shaped cells inside its nose. The cells were scattered instead of being clumped together, as they are in the tongue. But one thing was for sure: Those cells could taste.\n\nWhen Finger tested them, the cells contained the same special proteins, called receptors, that your tongue uses to detect chemicals in food. Different kinds of receptors detect different kinds of chemicals \u2014 like sugars, sour things and so on. Those in the mouse's nose specialized in detecting bitter chemicals.\n\nSince Finger's discovery of this in 2003, other scientists have found bitter-sensing taste cells inside the hundreds of branching tunnels that move air through the lungs of animals.\n\nSome scientists have also found taste cells along the path that food travels through a person's body \u2014 a journey of at least 12 hours. From the stomach, where food is first digested, those taste cells can be found all of the way to the large intestine at the lower end. Some in your gut taste bitter things, others scout for sweet sugars.\n\n(Not) tasting your poop\n\n\"There is an enormous number of these cells in the lower gut,\" notes Enrique Rozengurt, a biologist at UCLA (the University of California campus in Los Angeles) whose team first found taste cells in the gut in 2002. \"Why do you have all of these receptors?\" asks Rozengurt. \"There are some very profound possibilities.\"\n\nIt might seem like a really bad idea to have taste cells beyond the tongue. In your nose, wouldn't you taste salty buggers? And wouldn't you also taste the brown gooey stuff in your large intestine \u2014 which is pretty much just poop waiting to be excreted? If we have taste cells inside our body, shouldn't we be tasting nasty stuff all day long?\n\nNo, says Finger. What you experience when your body \"tastes\" something depends on what part of your brain the taste cells are talking to.\n\nWhen you put a bitter pill in your mouth, the cells on your tongue talk to a part of your brain called the insular cortex. This part of your brain is part of your moment-to-moment thoughts. It gets the message from your tongue \u2014 bitter! And yuck! Immediately, your face scrunches up. You want to spit the pill out.\n\nYour inner worm\n\nBut when cells in the gut detect something bitter, they send a little telegram to a deeper, older part of the brain. Scientists call it the nucleus of the solitary tract, but you might well think of it as your inner worm.\n\nThis part of the brain takes care of simple things that a mindless worm would do: pushing food through the gut, digesting it and pooping it out. You don't have to think about those things. They just happen.\n\nFin tasters: This mud-dwelling fish, called a searobin, has taste cells on its pointy front fins. It sticks those fins into the mud in order to feel around \u2014 or you might say, taste around \u2014 for worms that it wants to eat. Credit: Thomas Finger\n\nWhen your brain's inner worm senses the arrival of something bitter in the intestines, it tells your brain: Stop. You've eaten something bad. Get rid of it \u2014 quickly! You may suddenly feel sick, throw up, or have diarrhea. And these things happen without any conscious decisionmaking on your part.\n\nThe world is full of bad things like poisonous plants and spoiled foods. These are things that bitter-taste cells in your digestive system scout for. Says Rozengurt, they \"are there to defend us against all of these harmful substances.\"\n\nBitter sneeze\n\nBitter-detection cells in your nose and lungs protect you in kind of the same way. Bad bacteria sometimes enter your nose or lungs.They cause infections that can make it hard to breathe. Bitter-taste cells sound an internal alarm when they detect chemicals that the bad bacteria squirt out.\n\nThat alarm signals your body to sneeze or cough the bad stuff out. Bitter-taste cells can also trigger a process that tells white blood cells to attack the unwelcome germs.\n\nIt makes sense that you'd want to get rid of nasty, bitter-tasting stuff. But your stomach and intestines also have cells that detect sweet sugars. And they send out very different messages.\n\nIt's one thing to taste sugary pancakes and syrup in your mouth, but what about along the rest of the 30 feet that your breakfast travels through the stomach and intestines?\n\nThose other parts of your body also need to know when something sweet has arrived, says Robert Margolskee of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. Cells scattered up and down your gut act as a tracking system to let your body know when the sugary food arrives at each location. \"It starts things going further down in the digestive tract to digest those things,\" says Margolskee.\n\nScientists have some evidence that the gut also contains taste cells that detect meaty, savory chemicals. Like the sweet-taste cells, these probably also alert different parts of the gut to what's coming.\n\nTaste medicines\n\nMargolskee lent Finger those green-tongued mice in 2001. In 2009, Margolskee discovered that sugar-detecting cells of the intestine squirt out a messenger substance, called a hormone, that prepares the intestine to soak up sugars. Those hormones also let another part of the body, called the pancreas, know that sugar is on its way. The pancreas oozes out its own hormone \u2014 called insulin \u2014 that tells other parts of the body, from the muscles to the brain, to prepare for that sugar.\n\nMaking drugs that affect the gut's taste cells could help treat a common disease called diabetes. In diabetes, the rest of the body appears almost deaf to the insulin message that the pancreas sends out. So the muscles and brain don't take in much of the sugar, a major source of energy, from the blood. A drug that \"turns up the sound in these gut taste cells,\" says Margolskee, might help the gut and the pancreas more effectively shout out to the rest of the body that sugar is coming \u2014 and to get ready.\n\nSome people have another problem called irritable bowel syndrome. Here, food oozes through their intestines too quickly or too slowly, causing painful traffic jams. Drugs that tickle the bitter-detecting cells might help the intestine push food through more quickly and smoothly, reducing belly aches.\n\nJust this past November, scientists made a more surprising discovery: Bitter-tasting cells in the lungs might one day help doctors treat a disease called asthma.\n\nPeople with asthma have trouble breathing because the airways in their lungs close up. Now scientists have found that some bitter substances actually open those airways. And these substances do it better than one medicine that doctors frequently use to treat asthma.\n\nIt's was only the latest surprise. People who study taste outside the mouth expect more will keep on coming.\n\nUntil recently, says Rozengurt, a universe of taste sensors existed \"that we were vaguely aware of, but we didn't have any clues of how to study. Now we do.\"\n\nPOWER WORDS\n\nasthma A disease characterized by a difficulty in breathing, and by wheezing, coughing and constricted airways.\n\ngut The intestine.\n\nhormone A molecule the body produces to serve as a messenger to help the body in its basic functions.\n\ninsulin A protein hormone that helps the body get energy from fats and carbohydrates.\n\npancreas A gland behind the stomach that serves several functions, including releasing molecules that help with digestion and releasing insulin.\n\nThe village of Kuujjuaq, in northern Canada, is home to about 2,100 people.\n\nOrbitale/Wikimedia Commons\n\nNo roads lead to Kuujjuaq. You can only get to this village, high in the Canadian Arctic, by boat or plane. The trees here are stunted and small, but the bears grow big. The 500 kids who live in Kuujjuaq (pronounced KOO-joo-ak) have unusual chores: they help their parents catch fish and hunt caribou to eat. This place might seem far away from the big problems of big cities, like water pollution and air pollution. But even here, people can't escape those problems. Pretty little Kuujjuaq, with its blue skies and crystal clear waters, also has an invisible pollution problem that rivals any city.\n\nToxic chemicals have a surprising way of finding their way up here to the Arctic. They are gushed out of factories and cities thousands of miles away, and they travel to the Arctic like birds flying north for the summer. The birds go back home, but the chemicals stay.\n\nEveryone in Kuujjuaq has the chemicals in their bodies. No one knows their full effects, but they may hurt children in a slow and silent way. They could cause babies to get sick a little more often. And they might even cause kids to do worse in school.\n\nNo one would have dreamed that people in such a clean and beautiful place could be hurt by pollution from thousands of miles away. Then, in 1989, some scientists made a discovery.\n\nPOPs around the world\n\nEric Dewailly, a doctor at Laval University in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, was studying chemicals called persistent organic pollutants, or POPs. These are chemicals that can hang around for a long time in people's bodies or in the environment.\n\nDewailly and his team tested people in the cities of southern Qu\u00e9bec (near the border with the United States) to see how much of these chemicals were in their bodies. Dewailly's team wanted to compare this group with people in the Arctic. They reasoned that people in the Arctic lived far from pollution, and so would probably have lower levels of POPs in their bodies.\n\nSo the scientists went up to Nunavik, the remote, northern part of Qu\u00e9bec which includes Kuujjuaq and 13 other native Inuit villages. When they tested people in Nunavik they were surprised. People there had five to ten times as much of these chemicals in their bodies as people living in polluted cities. Some of the chemicals came from as far away as Russia!\n\nScientists now understand why this happens. The POPs include hundreds of different chemicals. Some are used in electronic gadgets like TVs, or in the lights and electrical wiring of buildings. Some are used in paints or for making windows waterproof. Others are sprayed onto crops as pesticides. But POPs have one thing in common: They like to evaporate. Just as a puddle of water dries on a hot summer sidewalk, POPs turn slowly into vapor and drift into the air. Winds can carry them thousands of miles.\n\nPOPs travel in the air until they reach a cold place. Have you noticed that on a hot day, a glass of lemonade with ice cubes in it collects little drops of water on the outside? This is because water vapor, which is a gas in the air, \"condenses\" onto the cold glass and forms those droplets\u2014the opposite of evaporating or drying. The same thing happens with POPs, says Knut Breivik, an environmental chemist at the Norwegian Institute of Air Research in the city of Kjeller.\n\n\"Things tend to evaporate in warmer regions and condense when it gets colder,\" says Breivik. So when winds carry POPs into the Arctic or Antarctic parts of the world, cold temperatures cause them to condense onto plants or rocks or snow or oceans. And then they stay where they landed and build up over time.\n\n10 million tons\n\nOver the years, more than 10 million tons of POPs have probably floated through the skies to the Arctic. If those chemicals were piled on an area the size of a football field, the pile would rise 700 meters in the air\u2014higher than the tallest building on Earth.\n\nSince the chemicals are spread over the entire Arctic instead of a football field, there's actually only a small amount in any one place. A swimming pool filled with Arctic Ocean water might contain only a single tiny raindrop of POPs. But these chemicals have a nasty habit of collecting inside animals and people, so even a little bit in the environment can end up causing problems.\n\nPOPs tend to stick to the oils and fats in living things, so tiny ocean animals like plankton soak them up, just like a shirt soaks up a drop of spaghetti sauce. Those plankton are eaten by larger animals, which in turn are eaten by even larger animals.\n\nEvery time one animal eats another, more POPs enter the larger animal's body. Animals can't digest POPs. They take them in the front, but never poop or pee them out the back end. So the POPs collect and collect. The biggest animals, like sea birds, seals, and whales, have the most POPs in their bodies. And these animals are eaten by native Inuit people, who have lived and hunted in Nunavik and other parts of the Arctic for thousands of years.\n\nTwo teaspoons\n\nBy the time a boy growing up in Kuujjuaq turns five years old, he may have collected one or two little rain drops' worth of POP chemicals in his body. That doesn't sound like much\u2014but it's thousands of times more concentrated than these chemicals are in sea water. In fact, that little boy has as much of these chemicals in his 20-kilogram body as there would be in two and a half million kilograms of sea water\u2014in other words, enough sea water to fill an Olympic swimming pool! Scientists are trying to understand how the chemicals affect kids.\n\nKids in Kuujjuaq play and joke around.\n\nAndr\u00e9 Perron/Wikimedia Commons\n\nDewailly's team has made many trips back to Nunavik to study the problem of POPs. In 1992 and 2004, they sailed in a ship to all 14 villages along the coast of Nunavik, including Kuujjuaq. The ship stopped at each village, and doctors took blood samples and examined people. They measured POPs in hundreds of newborn babies. Blood samples were taken again when the babies turned one year old. And these babies were studied for years as they grew, to find out how the POPs in their bodies affected them over time.\n\nThese studies have shown that POP chemicals affect the health of children in small but worrying ways. For one thing, these chemicals can weaken children's immune systems, says Pierre Ayotte, a toxicologist who works with Dewailly at Laval University. \"Then you're less able to fight disease,\" he says. Babies with the most POPs in their bodies had more ear infections and more infections in their lungs\u2014not minor infections like colds or flu, but serious ones that affect breathing and can sometimes send you to the hospital.\n\nLong division\n\nThese chemicals might even affect how well kids do in school. When the babies were 1 year old, the Laval University scientists gave them some tests. They tested how well the babies used their hands. They also tested how well the babies paid attention and learned when they were shown new toys. All of these tests were videotaped, and scientists carefully studied the videos afterward. What they saw surprised them.\n\nBabies with high POPs levels weren't quite as coordinated with their hands as other babies. They also didn't pay attention quite as well when they were being shown new toys\u2014they often stared away at other things. And during several hours of tests, these babies became upset and cried more often.\n\nThese were small differences. You wouldn't notice them unless you watched the babies closely. But when the same babies were tested again at the age of 5, the ones with high POPs still did a little worse.\n\n\"At later ages you're still at a disadvantage,\" says Gina Muckle, a psychologist on the Laval University team that traveled to Nunavik to test the children. Muckle thinks that even small changes can affect how children do in school as they get older. They could affect how a child responds when taught something hard, like long division\u2014whether they meet the challenge with a positive attitude, or get upset and discouraged. Or they could affect how a child responds to the stress of going to a new school\u2014how well they make new friends, and whether they still do well in class during those awkward times. Little differences, over the years, could add up. \"Those effects,\" says Muckle, \"are likely to be a real disadvantage overall during the life of the person.\"\n\nStill trickling\n\nNo one was happy to learn that POP chemicals were hurting people in the Arctic. But finding out about the problem gave the Inuit a chance to do something about it. In the 1990s, the United Nations held a meeting, called the Stockholm Convention, to discuss banning many POP chemicals. The Inuit sent people to the United Nations to tell how POPs had affected them. Since 1998, 140 countries have agreed to stop making many POP chemicals. As a result, levels of POPs in the Arctic are falling.\n\nBut it will take a long time for the problem to go away. For one thing, buildings around the world still contain many tons of POPs in their paint and wiring. Every day, a little bit of those chemicals turns into vapor and drifts outside. Eventually, it reaches the Arctic.\n\nResearcher S\u00e9bastien Roy tests the quality of a lake's water during the 2004 Nunavik Health Survey.\n\nIsabelle Dubois/NRBHSS\n\nSoil also contains huge amounts of POP chemicals\u2014and the hot blast of a forest fire can send them into the air, just as a hot blow drier causes water to evaporate from your hair. Breivik found that major fires in 2004 and 2006 caused large amounts of POPs to go into the air and reach the Arctic. Many of these chemicals last for 100 years or longer.\n\nLikely suspects\n\nThe other problem is that while hundreds of POP chemicals are known, there are probably others that scientists still don't know about. \"There are new compounds that are ending up in remote areas,\" says Frank Wania, an environmental chemist at the University of Toronto in Scarborough.\n\nMany POPs contain the element chlorine. But in the last few years, scientists like Wania have been surprised to find that two families of manmade chemicals, which contain the elements fluorine or bromine, have found their way into the Arctic. \"We failed to recognize [them] until they were already accumulating in the Arctic,\" says Wania\u2014meaning that large amounts of them were turning up in seals, birds and people. By the time the chemicals were discovered and banned, the damage was done.\n\nScientists want to get ahead of the problem. Wania has surveyed 100,000 industrial chemicals. He was looking for chemicals\u2014you could call them \"hoppers,\" \"fliers\" and \"swimmers\"\u2014which might reach the Arctic. Out of those chemicals, he found 120 likely suspects that he plans to look at more closely.\n\nAll of this might seem like a lot of effort. But many scientists think it's the right thing to do. It comes down to one question, says Muckle\u2014whether we want children to be able to grow and learn to their full potential. \"The environmental contaminants are certainly an issue,\" she says. \"As a society we need to take that into account.\" LiangFocusXiaogan Liang works with the \"focused ion beam\" instrument in the clean room.

The dark color comes from oil left behind by bacteria and animals that lived over 500 million years ago. The white color comes from salt left behind by the sea.\n\nPetroleum Development Oman\n\nGordon Love walked past the warm waters of the Arabian Sea as they lapped on a white sandy beach in the country of Oman. He entered a metal warehouse and walked past row after row of hallways lined with sliding metal doors. Some of these doors concealed an important piece of history.\n\nLove, a geochemist now at the University of California, Riverside, had come to the Middle East to work for an oil company for a couple of weeks. But this trip would also give him a rare chance to look at rocks from deep inside the Earth. It would lead him and his partners to a major new discovery about early life on our planet.\n\nBehind each one of the warehouse's metal doors lay a cylinder of stone about the width and length of a baseball bat. You might call this warehouse a library of both rocks and history. These cylinders of stone \u2014 called cores \u2014 were drilled from the flat and dusty deserts of Oman by people looking for oil. The stone cores were lifted out of drill holes that reach three miles underground. Those drill holes pierced through layer after layer of petrified mud, which contained once-living material that turned into rock over time. This mud collected over millions of years on an ancient sea bed. You can see the layers as stripes of gray, white and brown stone in the cores. If you stacked these cores end to end they would run for miles \u2014 and they would tell the history of this ancient sea now buried beneath the desert.\n\nLove entered a room where dozens of sections of core were laid out on tables. He could tell from the brown color of the stone that it still contained tiny bits of oil. That brown stone was just what he was looking for.\n\nScientist Gordon Love looked at molecular fossils in rocks as deep as 3 miles underground, similar to the dark ones shown here in the desert of Oman.\n\nDavid Fike, Washington University\n\nMolecular fossils\n\nOil doesn't just fuel cars, trucks and airplanes. It also contains a record of the past. Oil contains chemical traces of things that lived hundreds of millions of years ago. Scientists call these chemicals \"molecular fossils.\" They can exist even when more obvious fossils, like the imprints of leaves or seashells pressed into rocks, do not survive the extreme heat and pressure of being buried deep in the Earth.\n\nBy studying the molecular fossils in the cores lifted from drill holes, Love and his colleague, Roger Summons of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), have found evidence of animals that lived as long as 751 million years ago.\n\n\"At present it's the oldest fossil evidence for animals,\" says Love. In fact, it's up to 176 million years older than any other animal fossils that scientists have found.\n\nThis 550 million-year-old fossil from Australia may be the oldest fossil imprint of a sponge.\n\nJames Gehling, South Australia Museum in Adelaide\n\nThe animals that Love found may have been some of the first on Earth. Human eyes have never seen these animals and have never even seen the faint shapes that they left pressed between rocks. The tortures of the deep Earth have long since erased those shapes. But by studying the invisible molecular fossils left behind by these animals, Love and Summons can not only tell that these creatures lived \u2014 they can actually make some guesses about what they looked like.\n\nGreasy black tar\n\nOil forms over millions of years as dead plants, animals and bacteria are buried beneath sand or mud and decompose deep underground. Most of the grease seeps out of rocks and drains into spaces underground where it collects in large pools \u2014 the places where oil companies like to aim their drills. This oil in Oman is the oldest oil that companies have ever tried to drill out of the ground and turn into gasoline. This oil came from bacteria, algae and other critters that lived in an ocean over 500 million years ago.\n\nThe kind of molecular fossil left behind depends on the kind of organism decomposing. Bacterial molecular fossils look different from those fossils left behind by animals, for example. By studying such fossils, Summons and Love hoped to find out what kinds of things were living in the ocean when the rocks formed.\n\nThis adult sponge, about the size of a fist, was found in ankle-deep water in the Great Barrier Reef off Australia's coast.\n\nSally Leys, University of Alberta, Edmonton)\n\nIn the warehouse that day, Love sawed some marble-sized chunks of rock out of the cores. The rock was as hard as cement. He took his little pieces of rock back to Summons' lab in Cambridge, and crushed them into dust. He cooked the dust in acid until he was left with a glob of greasy black tar \u2014 the remains of ancient dead things.\n\nLove spent another two weeks purifying, or removing unwanted material from, this tar until he held in his hand a test tube of colorless liquid. That liquid contained the molecular fossils that he and Summons wanted to analyze. The molecular fossils were invisible to the eye. A person might not even taste the small amounts of them in the tube. But Love could detect the fossils using a refrigerator-sized machine called a GC-MS, or gas chromatograph mass spectrometer.\n\nLove loaded a few drops of the liquid into the GC-MS and watched the computer screen as the machine analyzed the dozens of chemicals.\n\nShown is the larva, or young, of the same species of sponge pictured as an adult. About the size of a grain of salt, this tiny creature was seen through an electron microscope.\n\nSally Leys, University of Alberta, Edmonton)\n\nBlobby sponges\n\nIf you've ever been in a hospital or seen a hospital show on TV, then maybe you've seen the bright line that moves across a heart monitor, tracing out jagged peaks and dips every time a person's heart beats. Love saw something like this as he watched the GC-MS analyze the molecular fossils. A line running across the computer screen traced out a sharp spike every time the machine detected another chemical.\n\nAs Love sat and watched, one of those spikes grabbed his attention: It stood for a chemical called 24-isopropylcholestane, or 24-ipc. Love had seen 24-ipc in rocks before \u2014 it's a well-known chemical \u2014 but seeing it in these old rocks from Oman was a big deal.\n\nScientists consider 24-ipc to be a molecular fossil that comes from animals called sea sponges. Scientists have looked at various animals, fungi and bacteria that live on Earth today to see which chemicals they produce. Researchers have found that sponges produce large amounts of a chemical closely related to 24-ipc. During heating, such as that deep inside the Earth, this chemical slowly changes into 24-ipc. \"Sponges are the only organisms that produce it in any significant quantities,\" says Love.\n\nSea sponges are cigar- or balloon-shaped animals that sit on the seafloor. They eat by filtering bacteria and other tiny organisms out of the water. You wouldn't exactly call sea sponges smart. They have no brains, no eyes, no legs and no fins. They're some of the simplest animals on Earth. Some biologists think sponges were the first animals to evolve, or develop from simpler, single-celled organisms through a process of gradual change over millions of years. So when Love saw 24-ipc in the oil from these old rocks, he knew it was important.\n\nThe oldest known sea sponge fossils that you can see with the naked eye are cup-shaped imprints found in 550-million-year-old rocks. Scientists have also seen blobby imprints, like round, quilted pillows, in rocks as old as 575 million years. (Though some scientists believe that many of these older animal fossils aren't related to modern animals.) Researchers think these imprints were probably made by some kind of animal \u2014 although the blobs are so strange, they don't know what kind of animal. But the molecular sponge fossils that Love had just found were much older than any of those shapes in the rocks. Judging from the age of the rocks from Oman he tested, these sea sponges are at least 635 million years old, and maybe as much as 751 million years old.\n\nA big disagreement\n\nThese findings by Love, Summons, David Fike of Washington University in St. Louis, and nine other scientists will be published on February 5 in a major scientific journal called Nature. Their discovery has a lot of people excited. These new molecular fossils may help to solve a big disagreement about the earliest animals on Earth.\n\nIn other studies, biologists have compared the DNA, a molecule that holds an organism's genetic information, of different animals alive today, such as sponges, clams, insects, worms, mice and humans. Scientists have done this in order to estimate how long ago the first animals lived. These \"molecular clock\" calculations say that the first animals evolved somewhere between 650 and 950 million years ago. And yet the oldest fossil imprints of animals are only 575 million years old.\n\nThat disagreement between the dates from the fossil imprints and the dates from the molecular clocks caused some scientists to wonder whether the molecular clock calculations were wrong. But by showing molecular fossils of animals maybe as old as 751 million years, Summons and Love's new findings have something to say about that disagreement. \"I think this new work is both important and believable,\" says Andrew Knoll, a paleontologist who studies early fossils at Harvard University. \"This goes a long way toward reconciling the geologic record with molecular clock estimates.\"\n\nSwimming in the early oceans\n\nIt makes sense that the first animals might have been sponges or something like them. All animals, whether they live in water or on land, need to breathe oxygen; without it, they suffocate. But 600 or 700 million years ago the Earth hadn't yet filled up with oxygen the way it has today. The oceans probably contained oxygen in their shallowest parts, but the deeper waters likely contained hardly any oxygen.\n\nThis is one reason why it makes sense that sponges are the first animals, says Kevin Peterson of Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. \"Sponges have exceedingly low metabolism,\" he says, meaning that some kinds of sponges consume oxygen slowly compared to other animals, and so such sponges can tolerate lower levels of oxygen.\n\nEven if these ancient animals were closely related to modern-day sponges, Knoll isn't willing to say whether these early animals actually looked like the same big cigar-shaped sponges that we see in our oceans today.\n\nIt's true that adult sponges are big balloons which sit on the sea floor and suck food out of the water. But young sponges, called larvae, look very different. They are tiny \u2014 about the size of a grain of sand. And rather than sitting on the ocean bottom, they swim through the water by whipping around tiny oars on their body that look like hairs.\n\nThe animals that Love detected could have looked more like tiny larvae than big adult sponges. \"If you had been swimming in the same ocean, you might not have noticed them,\" says Knoll."}

{"text": "Fifth development, Martian water, the DNA time machine, cosmology and epigenetics. The original articles are now behind a paywall; they won't be reproduced here, but their gist is present. I'll try to put them in context and specifically within the Impact Areas of SciTechStory.\n\nWhen I was a kid (a few decades ago), my parents took me to Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming, USA). I remember marveling at many things, not the least of which were the brilliant colors in and near the pools of very hot water \u2013 oranges, yellows, greens \u2013 in all hues. I wondered aloud what made the colors and I was told the common wisdom of the day that most of the colors were from minerals dissolved in the water, except maybe some green, which was from algae. There were probably a few biologists of the time who suspected the presence of bacteria in these pools, but it was generally agreed that bacteria couldn't live in the heat of these waters.\n\nThe concept of the thermophile, heat loving microorganisms, was probably first used in 1879 and promptly put on the mental back-shelf by almost all biologists. While it was accepted that some forms of plant life (algae) could tolerate higher temperatures (between 60 and 80 degrees Celsius, 140-180 degrees Fahrenheit), it just didn't seem likely that any form of animal life could survive. This 'intuition' was generally frozen into many scientists' thinking in the form of a bias.\n\nThat bias persisted until research in the 1980's and 90's showed that not only could bacteria live \u2013 and thrive \u2013 in hot environments, but there were, in fact, such a thing as hyperthermophiles that could live in water up to and above the boiling point. Many of these microorganisms were highly specialized bacteria, and many more were from what is now recognized as a completely distinct domain of life \u2013 the Archaea. It is such creatures that produce the colorful bands around thermal pools in Yellowstone. These days, the study of such extremophiles, life in extreme conditions, is of enormous biological and even commercial importance.\n\nIn a similar vein, scientists have known since the 19th century that the human body contained bacteria. Mostly though, these bacteria were known as the cause of disease. It was assumed that they didn't belong in the body. This intuition became frozen into common knowledge, a bias. Even when it was later shown that some bacteria lived inside the body, particularly in the gut and were probably part of the digestive system, the focus was still very much on dealing with the destructive bacterial invaders. In short, the bias continued to guide the accepted wisdom and most of the research effort.\n\nUnbelievable as it might seem now, it wasn't until the year 2000, when Nobelist Joshua Lederberg published in Science a broadside aimed at his fellow bacteriologists:\n\nNew strategies and tactics for countering pathogens will be uncovered by finding and exploiting innovations that evolved within other species in defense against infection. But our most sophisticated leap would be to drop the Manichaean view of microbes \u2013 \"We good; they evil.\" Microbes indeed have a knack for making us ill, killing us, and even recycling our remains to the geosphere. But in the long run microbes have a shared interest in their hosts' survival: A dead host is a dead end for most invaders too. Domesticating the host is the better long-term strategy for pathogens.\n[Source: From Science Magazine: Infectious History]\n\nEven Lederberg couldn't purge his language of the 'pathogen' view of microorganisms, but those who heeded his call for a more equanimous view of microbes in the human body soon began to discover that the reality called for a wholly different view. For example, as is now often cited, the human body contains far more cells of microbes than our own cells \u2013 by almost 10 to 1. There are at least 1,000 species living inside us, and most of them are symbiotic or at least commensal (one sided benefit). This vast community of mostly non-pathogenic microorganisms is now called the microbiome, an ecology inside us.\n\nAs you can imagine, with only ten years of research microbiologists have just begun to scratch the surface of this newly appreciated relationship between human and microbe. For example, while scientists knew that bacteria were involved with digestion, a 2004 study by a team working with Jeffrey Gordon at the Washington University School of Medicine (St. Louis, Missouri, USA) discovered that bacteria were essential partners in helping to break down the food we eat and to make metabolic use of it.\n\nThe microbiome is now linked to various aspects of human health, including the proper functioning of our immune system. It is also suspected that bacterial DNA may play an active role in our own DNA development. With each new study the links to bacteria within the body proliferate. This new view is even extending to diminish an even greater bias \u2013 the bias against viruses. A new term, the virome was coined to encompass the role that viruses have within the normal functioning of the body, as strange as that may seem.\n\nSome of the practical impact of research into the microbiome and virome will be a better understanding of their benefits to the body \u2013 and how to keep it that way. Scientists are also learning that the microbiome is highly individualized; we can be identified as individuals by the denizens of our gut. These same fellow-travelers also identify our culture and genetic background. This has led research into areas of diet and body chemistry. In fact, the knowledge of the microbiome is leading research into fundamental metabolic pathways that were not even suspected ten years ago. This work will in time have an impact on cell biology, immune systems, and genetics.\n\n3 Trackbacks\n\n[...] that you're an ecosystem?

The result was the first eukaryote, a complex cell type that today makes up all plants, animals and fungi: pretty much any organism you can see without a microscope. Eukaryotic cells are those that contain endosymbionts, the descendants of that original undigested cell. They are the mitochondria that power our cells, and the chloroplasts that allow plants to photosynthesize. Although they've been with us pretty much forever, they live separate lives, maintaining their own genomes, producing their own proteins, and exchanging them amongst each other. At least, we thought they did. But a new study from the University of Guelph has overturned a century of dogma by suggesting that chloroplasts may live as independently from one another as they do from the plant cells that host them.\n\nIn my last post, I gave you an overview of the International Polar Year Conference that just wrapped up in Montreal.

The concept of i is straightforward enough: since i is the square root of -1, then it logically follows that i squared must be equal to -1.

{"text": "Wednesday, January 18, 2012\n\nMusings: Lessons From the \"Lowly\"\n\nLast night, as the trees creaked and big rain beat on the windows, I sent a video link to a friend of a crow clearly using a jar lid to sled down a snowy roof. It was accompanied by a short article in which a scientist described it as \"play-like behavior.\"\n\n\"I don't understand how people don't think animals play,\" she replied in an email I received after walking beneath a crescent moon as shell pink clouds blew past the waterfall-streaked face of Makaleha this morning.\n\nReally. So if it's hard for some humans to believe animals play, much less think or feel, I realize it's a big stretch to accept the fact that bacteria have something important to teach us.\n\nBut they do. After all, they've been around for some 4 billion years, compared to our measly little 100,000, only the last 6,000 of which have approached anything close to what we now congratulate ourselves on as civilization.\n\nMeanwhile, the bacteria can watch the frenzied empire-building, colonizing, exploiting, over-populating, over-consuming human dramas that have brought our species to the brink of simultaneous crises and yawn, \"Been there, done that.\"\n\nBecause they have, more than once, and each time they figured out a way to adapt themselves to weather it, which resulted in an evolutionary leap. Heck, they even developed electric motors as complex as our own, and way before we did, says Dr. Elisabet Sahtouris, an evolution biologist who was the subject of a fascinating and inspiring interview on New Dimensions that you can listen to free through today.\n\nI suggest you do, because hearing her give the abridged history of the evolution of life on the planet really helped to put things in perspective. It also gave me hope. As Sahtouris says, \"Life gets creative in a time of crisis.\"\n\nSo as we ponder our possible fates, it behooves us to take a few lessons from the \"lowly\" bacteria that not only were here first, but offer us a model for how we humans can evolve into a mature species \u2014 provided we don't kill each other off, first.\n\nHere's the biggest tip: move beyond hostile competition to cooperation and co-creation. \"We have to form a global family if we're going to make this thing work,\" Sahtouris says. \"We're not looking for monoculture; that's a human invention. We have to maintain the diversity and do things cooperatively within it.\"\n\nAnd another one: have a little more appreciation for all forms of life, especially the bacteria that play such critical roles in our own existence. Consider this: the bacteria in our guts alone regulate 80 percent of our immune system function.\n\n\"We're not supposed to call them germs and attack them all the time,\" Sahtouris says. \"They're so flexible. We're not as smart as they are. Our consciousness is new in evolution compared to theirs. Once we understand this, we will be demanding natural products and good food.\"\n\nNeedless to say, she is an opponent of genetic engineering and factory farming practices that call for giving livestock massive doses of antibiotics. While the technically-oriented scientists who come up with this stuff do have their place, she says, \"we need scientists who understand life to stand up to them when they're going off course.\"\n\nWhat I really liked was her description of life as \"a sort of improvisational dance, constantly rebalancing itself and learning flexibility and resiliency.\"\n\nInterestingly enough, just before listening to the interview I'd written an article about acupuncture, and how its sole purpose is to help restore the balanced movement of energy through our bodies so that we can naturally repair ourselves. Ah yes, yet another ancient concept that's finally trickling into Western awareness...\n\nAnyway, as Sahtouris sees it, we currently have \"an old culture and a new culture co-existing\" in human systems. The old is vigorously resisting relinquishing its power \u2014 think Mitt Romney preaching how he'll America arm to the teeth to reassert our role as a dominant force in the world \u2014 and the new fears that it won't prevail against that resisting force. But she sees the shift we're making \"less like a phoenix rising from the ashes than the metamorphosis of a butterfly emerging from the caterpillar.\"\n\nIn other words: \"Look for ways that we can adapt,\" Sahtouris says. \"Be in joy, not fear or negativity.\""}
{"text": "A new paper by cosmic ray researcher Henrik Svensmark suggests that the abundance of diversity of biological life on Earth is closely correlated to our planet's proximity to supernovae.\n\nSvensmark, a professor of physics at the Center for Sun-Climate Research at the Danish Space Research Institute, revealed his work in a paper published by the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nThe prof reconstructed the relative rate at which stars within 850 parsecs of our solar system went supernova over the past 510 million years, and compared it to geophysical and paleobiological records.\n\nHe concluded, poetically, that: \"\u2026remarkable connections to the long-term histories of life and the carbon cycle have shown up unbidden.

If Hollande can win, DSK would've squooshed Sarkozy.\n\nIn its most recent report, the GAO recommends switching to coins, which could make $4.4 billion for the government over 30 years. But the report says the government benefit does not come from the fact that coins are more cost effective. Instead the benefit comes from something called \"seigniorage.\"\n\nSeigniorage is the profit the government makes from having money out in the economy. More money out there means more profit for the government.\n\nOver time, coins earn more seigniorage for the government, but only because we don't like using them.\n\n\"Lots of people when they take coins out of their pocket or purse at the end of the day put them in what we call a coin jar,\" says the GAO's Lorelei St. James, who oversaw the agency's most recent study.\n\nAs a result, the GAO estimates that if the government were to eliminate $1 bills and switch to coins, it would have to replace every two bills with three coins, because one of the coins would sit idle.\n\nSo more coins means more profit for the government. But where does that profit come from? It comes from us \u2014 the public.\n\nI decided not to include the bit where they talk about the fact that the senators proposing the switch to coins are from states where\u2026 coins or their raw materials are produced. Surprise!\n\nLarge denomination coins are less likely to sit idle than pennies. And people will get used to them. However if you want to consider seigniorage the most egregious is the issuance of coins and postage stamps in special presentation packs for collectors. They cost very little to print and you can charge more than the face value. Daylight robbery.\n\nOn the contrary.

How much less likely to vote? Who knows? Not the most compelling data if you ask me\u2026\n\nOneDelayed-choice entanglement swapping consists of the following steps. (I use the same names for the fictional experimenters as in the paper for convenience, but note that they represent acts of measurement, not literal people.)\n\nTwo independent sources (labeled I and II) produce pairs photons such that their polarization states are entangled. One photon from I goes to Alice, while one photon from II is sent to Bob. The second photon from each source goes to Victor. (I'm not sure why the third party is named \"Victor\".)\n\nAlice and Bob independently perform polarization measurements; no communication passes between them during the experiment\u2014they set the orientation of their polarization filters without knowing what the other is doing.\n\nAt some time after Alice and Bob perform their measurements, Victor makes a choice (the \"delayed choice\" in the name). He either allows his two photons from I and II to travel on without doing anything, or he combines them so that their polarization states are entangled. A final measurement determines the polarization state of those two photons.\n\nThe results of all four measurements are then compared. If Victor did not entangle his two photons, the photons received by Alice and Bob are uncorrelated with each other: the outcome of their measurements are consistent with random chance. (This is the \"entanglement swapping\" portion of the name.) If Victor entangled the photons, then Alice and Bob's photons have correlated polarizations\u2014even though they were not part of the same system and never interacted. discoveryNobody, he says, is giving him a straight answer. \"The police said they went and reviewed the videotapes but they were too blurry,\" Petti says.

{"text": "Modern science is subject to strict ethical codes when it comes to scientific trials, and for good reason. In the past, thousands of experiments were conducted without regard to safety or ethics, often with deadly consequences. Many were performed because public safety or the imminent threat to the nation was deemed paramount over individual rights. Others resulted from the misapplication of junk science, shortsightedness, or political greed. Such unethical research programs are still making headlines today, as the federal and state governments apologize and grant compensation to victims. Yet, despite our progress in reining in unethical testing practices, some of the below research programs still use questionable methods. That said, here are 10 of the darkest chapters in U.S. scientific history.\n\nAfter celebrating its 60th anniversary a couple of years ago, it appears the FBI's \"Ten Most Wanted Fugitives\" list will reach another milestone in the not-so-distant future: 500 fugitives. So far, 495 people have earned this dubious distinction \u2014 from international terrorists like Ramzi Ahmed Yousef and Osama Bin Laden, to serial killers like Ted Bundy and assassins like James Earl Ray. What follows are some little-known facts about the FBI's program and this well-known assortment of murderers, pedophiles, bank robbers, crime bosses and gang leaders.\n\nMythological creatures come in all shapes and sizes, but it seems the same old creatures always hog the headlines. We constantly hear about gremlins, zombies, gorgons and cyclops \u2014 but now it's time for some lesser-known creatures to shine. Ten of the more obscure mythological creatures appear below, a collection that includes messenger squirrels, horse-headed, human-bodied tricksters, and gigantic, thrashing catfish that supposedly cause earthquakes. Since it's tough to rank bizarre qualities, these mythological creatures are ranked based on their alleged deadliness.\n\nNothing warms a scientist's heart like a science-fiction film that bothers to \"get the science right.\" There are plenty of B-grade bad sci-fi movies out there, but every so often a golden nugget stands out. Great science-fiction movies can be educational, stir our imagination, and even inspire younger viewers to pursue careers in science. And while even the gems on this list all contain a scientific error or two, as a rule they do not break the science-fiction mantra of disregarding more than one physical law of nature per film.\n\nStatistics tell us that between one-third and one-half of marriages in the United States are likely to fail. Once a social stigma, divorce is now becoming an accepted part of the American lifestyle. The media continues to trivialize holy matrimony, placing all the emphasis on the wedding, just one day, as opposed to the marriage, which is meant to be a lifelong partnership. We are constantly bombarded with the scandalous affairs of celebrities and politicians; people get married on reality TV shows, and commercials make light of spouses lying to each other. In this environment, it's little wonder that the divorce rate is so high.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be this way. Once identified, most marital problems can be resolved. Here are five common mistakes that can turn marriages into divorce, and how you and your spouse can avoid them.\n\nSo you've made the decision to eat a better diet, which means eating less fast food and adding more fruits and vegetables to your diet. Congratulations! In addition to weight-management benefits, many fruits and vegetables are loaded with powerful antioxidants, which can help your body fight the stresses of oxidation that have been linked to cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's and even aging itself. Chances are you've seen a story or two on so-called \"super foods,\" with foods such as red kidney beans, blueberries and tomatoes. One caveat that is rarely mentioned \u2014 much of the antioxidant power of these foods occurs only in their raw form. That's not so much a problem with blueberries (delicious raw), but very problematic with red kidney beans (not edible raw).\n\nHere are five food types ranked according to their antioxidant power, based on a database maintained by the United States Department of Agriculture. You'll find no mention of raw foods that you don't eat, and no rare foods (elderberries, chokeberries, etc.) that are never available at your local grocer. Instead, here are five readily available foods with tremendous antioxidant powers.\n\nHistory loves a winner. And in the field of science, the big winners are generously rewarded with Nobel Prizes, lucrative patents and international acclaim. Those who lost out in the quest for scientific recognition sometimes waited too long to publish a theory, or perhaps didn't follow the right procedure in applying for a patent. But sometimes, these historic also-rans did everything right, were the first to make a major discovery and still didn't receive the credit they deserved. Here are five such scientists who made important breakthroughs but have been overshadowed in the history books.\n\nSince 1976, February has been designated as Black History Month in the United States. So each February, children across America bring home projects or books featuring famous African-Americans such as Martin Luther King Jr., Booker T. Washington, Harriet Tubman and George Washington Carver. Those legendary figures are certainly worth celebrating, yet there have been many other African-American men and women who achieved significant milestones for their race, and made significant contributions to society, but get little attention today. Here are 10 notable African-Americans who are often overlooked during Black History Month.\n\nYou may not have heard them in years, but odds are you can finish each of these little ditties the way a couple might finish each other's sentences: \"Give me a break, give me a break \u2026\"; \"I am stuck on Band-Aid \u2026\"; and \"Plop, plop, fizz, fizz \u2026\" These jingles for the likes of Kit Kat and Alka-Seltzer may seem old school, but you can't question their staying power.

It's sunny, it's cloudy, and sometimes it rains (or snows). The weather changes daily, but generally within relatively narrow parameters.

The Aboriginal people of Australia and the South Pacific islands, such as the Solomon Islands,Vanuatu, and Fiji at birth are born with blond hair. In maturity the hair usually turns a darker brown color, but sometimes remains blond. Now, a study of people from the Solomon Islands shows that they evolved the striking blonde trait independently of people in Europe. These Aborigines are the oldest continuous population outside of Africa. The modern Aborigines are the direct descendants of the first explorers to leave Africa and arrive in the South Pacific 50,000 to 70,000 years ago.

Seriously, if your ovaries are exploding, go the fucking hospital, get off tumblr and go to the hospital that shit should not be happening.\n\nThe moisture from sexual arousal comes from the Bartholin's glands just inside the opening of the vagina. Ejaculation comes from the Skene's gland and the urethra. The ovaries are where the eggs hang out, if anything is going to explode from rapid arousal at least use a gland, sing the praises of your prostate (the skene's is like a female prostate kind of in conjunction with the G-spot).\n\nBut seriously, ovaries should not explode. If men started posted about their balls exploding I'd be equally worried (but I have heard that limp ejaculations can happen but that's different, it's not a fucking explosion).\n\nIf ovaries are going to respond to the sexual act it's when the body recognizes there is semen in the vaginal canal and/or the cervix and it's close enough to menstruation that it's pretty much like 'let's hop on this pregnancy' but that's after things are done.\n\nCome the fuck on, it's really not cute and the phrase is kind of annoying to see, I generally don't edit reblogs but when I'm checking my tracked tags and i see anything about ovaries responding to much other than that fucking hormonal shift that makes life hell then I'm like 'really, what the flipping fuck is wrong with you!?'. I kind of want to punch whoever started that shit.\n\nTetrachromatic vision. Most mammals have poor color vision because they have only two kinds of cones, the retinal cells that discriminate different colors of light. Humans, like other primates, have three kinds, the legacy of a past where good color vision for finding ripe, brightly colored fruit was a survival advantage.\n\nThe gene for one kind of cone, which responds most strongly to blue, is found on chromosome 7. The two other kinds, which are sensitive to red and green, are both on the X chromosome. Since men have only one X, a mutation which disables either the red or the green gene will produce red-green colorblindness, while women have a backup copy. This explains why this is almost exclusively a male condition.\n\nBut here's a question: What happens if a mutation to the red or the green gene, rather than disabling it, shifts the range of colors to which it responds? (The red and green genes arose in just this way, from duplication and divergence of a single ancestral cone gene.)\n\nTo a man, this would make no real difference. He'd still have three color receptors, just a different set than the rest of us. But if this happened to one of a woman's cone genes, she'd have the blue, the red and the green on one X chromosome, and a mutated fourth one on the other\u2026 which means she'd have four different color receptors. She would be, like birds and turtles, a natural \"tetrachromat\", theoretically capable of discriminating shades of color the rest of us can't tell apart. (Does this mean she'd see brand-new colors the rest of us could never experience? That's an open question.)\n\nAnd we have evidence that just this has happened on rare occasions. In onestudy of color discrimination, at least one woman showed exactly the results we would expect from a true tetrachromat.\n\nA botanist has discovered a new species of plant in eastern Brazil whose branches bend down upon bearing fruit and deposit seeds on the ground, often burying them in a covering of soft soil or moss.

The adaptation ensures seedlings germinate near their parents, helping them stay within the choice spots or microclimates in which they thrive. One well-known practitioner of geocarpy is the peanut, which also buries its fruit in the soil.

Bottom trawlers often catch them along with their intended targets, and this leads to a massive number of inadvertent deaths. The fact that people love to catch these ugly dudes for mounting, especially in their shallower habitats near the British Isles, really doesn't help their survival as a species.

{"text": "Events on the world lines of two theoretical physicists, from the horizon to timelike infinity. A scientifically minded blog with varying amounts of entertainment, distractions, and every day trivialities.\n\nPages\n\nThursday, August 26, 2010\n\nYesterday, Stefan and I went to see the \"Body Worlds\" exhibition, which is currently in Offenbach, close to Frankfurt, Germany. Body Worlds is a traveling exhibition that displays human bodies and body parts that have been preserved using a technique called plastination. Basically, it works by removing all bodily fluids and fat from the tissue by washing it out with acetone, and then replacing these fluids with silicone. That is to say, the exhibits are not anatomic models but actually real. The method of plastination used for these purposes was invented by Gunther von Hagens, then at the University of Heidelberg. His work there likely was inspiration for the horror movie \"Anatomy,\" starring Franka Potente, which still causes me the occasional nightmare.\n\nThe exhibition itself was absolutely non-nightmarish. It had in fact a high educational value, and at least for me no yuck-factor. Besides that, it also had a missionary theme, that of documenting and explaining the process of aging and not only the complexity but also the fragility of the body. Besides many whole-body exhibits in fancy positions - dancing, playing saxophone, jumping over fences, during intercourse (must be 16 or older to see that) - they had all organs separately, some showing various illnesses and diseases (fatty liver, cancerous uterus, smoker's lung), as well as artificial joints. Some of the organs were cut into small slices or into half, so you could see inside. It is quite amazing really, to see all the muscles, bands, and nerves. Most stunning I found the capillary system that leaves behind the shape of the body after plastination (see picture to the left, more here).\n\nWhat I found somewhat annoying about the exhibition is that in all of the full body exhibits there were necessarily parts missing for better visibility (or possibly because they were just missing? Who knows what these people died from.) To begin with, most of the skin had been removed, but sometimes one or the other muscle, or this or that band. Unfortunately, there was nowhere to find a detailed explanation of what parts had been removed, so I was sometimes left wondering if there shouldn't be another muscle on that leg or another part on that spine or so. Also, I could have done without the photos of happy 100 year old men water skiing, proclaiming that happiness is the key to a long life. On the other hand I learned one or the other thing. For example, I wasn't aware the liver lies to closely below the diaphragm. And did you know that your testicles are doomed to shrink after you've passed your mid 40s? Or, more amusingly, that two centuries ago it was believed sperm is produced in the brain. Because, you see, that's were the soul is located and how could it be produced elsewhere. (Of course today we're more enlightened and know that the male soul sits in the testicles ;-).)\n\nThe bodies that are being used for plastination stem from people who donated them during their lifetime by signing the necessary forms. You can indeed donate your own body if you want to be conserved for educational means. Presently, there's more than 10,000 people who have signed up, and I suspect that most of them will not be used for exhibitions but rather for anatomy courses. On the other hand you might become famous post-mortem on Lady Gaga's stage. Apparently, the Lady has expressed interest in a decoration consisting of human bodies. In the exhibition guide, there's a selection of donors summarizing their motivations, which ranges from a love for science over some sort of immortality to admiration of von Hagens' work. The anonymity of the endproduct's origin I guess sorts out most narcissistic motivations. As to me, I'm signed up for organ donation, in various countries, and prefer to maximize my educational value during my lifetime.\n\nMonday, August 23, 2010\n\nIf you know one thing about quantum mechanics, it's Born's rule: The probability of a measurement is the square of the amplitudes of the wave-functions. It is the central axiom of quantum mechanics and what makes it quantum. If you have a superposition of states, the amplitudes are sums of these states. Taking the square to obtain the probability means you will not only get the square of each single amplitude - which would be the classical result - but you will get mixed terms. These mixed terms are what is responsible for the interference in the famous double-slit experiment and yield the well-known spectrum with multiple maxima rather than one reproducing the two slits, as you'd get were the particles classical. (Dr. Quantum shows you what I mean.)\n\nThe short summary is that they haven't found any deviation to a precision of one in a hundred. But their method is really neat and worth spending a paragraph on.\n\nThe experimental setup that the group has used is a tripe-slit through which pass single photons. If one computes the probability to measure a photon at a particular location on the detector screen in usual quantum mechanics, you square the sum of the wave-functions originating from each of the three slits. You get several mixed terms, but they are all second order in the wave-function. If Born's rule holds, this allows you to express the probability for the three-slit experiment as a sum of probabilities from leaving open only one of the slits and leaving open combinations of two slits. Thus, what the clever experimentalist do is a series of measurements leaving each single slit open, all combinations of two slits open, and leaving all three slits open, and see if the probabilities add up. And they do, to very good precision.\n\nSo, there's nothing groundbreaking to report here in terms of novel discoveries, but I very much like the direct test of the foundations of quantum mechanics this experiment constitutes. I think we could use more tests in this direction, and higher precision will come with time.\n\nFriday, August 20, 2010\n\nYou are not a Gadget - A Manifesto By Jaron Lanier Knopf (January 12, 2010)\n\nJaron Lanier is an interdisciplinary computer scientist who doesn't shy away from also crossing borders also to the arts. He could probably be described as a creative intellectual, is known for his work on virtual reality, less known for his music, and now he has written a book. More details on Lanier's bio are on his website.\n\nLanier is a man with opinions, and that's basically what his book is about: Despite it being called \"A Manifesto\" what it really is is a collection of opinion pieces. Lanier is a skeptic, and concerned about many developments in software and information technology and their impact on human societies. I am very sympathetic to the points he is trying to make. Unfortunately, he doesn't make them well.\n\nLanier for example bemoans the \"locked in\" effect in which a piece of software, despite far from being optimal or even being plain annoying, becomes so wide spread that at some point it is more or less impossible to replace or change it; it simply would be too much effort. That is of course true, but it is hardly a new problem of software in particular. The same problem has hindered and does hinder progress in many other aspects of our life. Take tax laws for example. A mess. You want to throw them out and start all over again from scratch. Yet, too much effort and resistance. In practice, you fiddle something here or something there. Or, even worse, take norms and standards. Surely it would be less annoying if the world could agree on one paper format or one standard for power outlets. But the effort for such a change would be enormous. That is not to say that Lanier isn't making a correct point. It is a good point and one that we should pay more attention to. It's just to say, he misses the larger societal context and complains about an ancient problem without offering any new insight about it.\n\n\"If you love a medium made of software, there's a danger that you will become entrapped in someone else's recent careless thoughts. Struggle against that.\"\n\nAnother large concern of his is that the present organization of the internet, the spread of easy-to-use templates as well as making money per advertisement hampers creativity.\n\nAbout the former point: it is of course true that the availability of default websites has decreased expressions of individual design. On the other hand, it's what allowed the vast majority of people to set up a website in the first place, and let me add that I know plenty of people with a PhD who insist they aren't able to understand html or css-style sheets. It's a matter of convenience. And in addition, it is actually a great relieve that one can generally at least open and read these unindividual websites. Lanier is concerned that making use of imperfect software will change your humanity to adapt to the software instead the other way round. I can't but have the impression that this concern is borne out of observing a specific community of people rather than the average person. In any case, the scientist in me hears the rethoric and waits for the evidence. Yet, there's no evidence to come in Lanier's book.\n\n\"Am I accusing all those hundreds of millions of users of social networking sites of reducing themselves in order to be able to use the services? Well, yes, I am.\"\n\nDon't people also \"reduce themselves\" by buying a mass-produced car that comes in one of 5 colors and the only option to customize it is put a sticker on the bumper? The vast majority of people on the planet neither has the interest not the skills nor the money to individualize every detail of their average life. The artist might find that sad, but that's reality.\n\nIn any case, the latter point is a crucial one of course. You know that I too have frequently warned about the side-effects that the now common way of financing online presentations via adverts has. People often claim the internet is democratic, then they claim this sort of financing per adverts is just capitalism in action. As a matter of fact the internet is neither democratic, nor is what you're seeing a sensible capitalistic system, simply because people are not payed for their work. They are instead being paid by accidental clicks on banners that pop up on the screens of visitors who might have been looking for something entirely different to begin with. It's a feedback mechanism that one has no reason to expect to lead to any outcome that's beneficial for our societies.\n\nAgain however, Lanier misses the larger context. He puts forward a concrete proposal for how to allow artists to earn from their work better than is the case today, basically some system of micro-payments. That is all well and nice, but only addresses part of the problem. The problem that frankly concerns me much more than whether Lanier's musical friends can make a living is that the present organization erodes one of the most essential foundations of democratic societies: journalism. This issue is only mentioned in Lanier's book in the passing at some point. More generally, it is well-known that some services, especially those that are essential to the foundations of our societies, are better offered as public services than as private services. For what I am concerned, the best solution is probably a mixture. I find it particularly disingenuous that Lanier then claims \"the only alternative [to some version of the proposal he is advocating] would be to establish some form of socialism.\"\n\nLanier also has a proposal for how to improve our financial systems that I don't feel competent to judge on. I can't but think that again he has missed the relevant point. The problem is not to come up with some proposal for improvement. Everybody I know seems to have some idea for how to improve our financial system. Just that most of them don't get their ideas printed in books. The problem is not coming up with an idea for improvement. No, the problem is that the present political and economic system has no instance for such proposals to be considered and be tested viable for reality and promising for improvement. The problem lies on a much deeper level.\n\nIt goes on like this. Lanier is a computer scientist, all right, and he clearly knows his field, but again and again he fails to put his proposals or arguments into the larger context and contrast them with the realities of politics and social dynamics. For example, he bemoans that the programming language LISP has fallen out of favor, though in his opinion it is essential to realize some of the proposals he is making. It strikes me similar to the complaint that we're not all speaking Esperanto.\n\n\"Wikipedia, for instance, works on what I call the Oracle illusion, in which knowledge of human authorship of a text is suppressed in order to give the text superhuman validity. Traditional holy books work in precisely the same way and present many of the same problems.\"\n\nHis criticism of the benefits of using the knowledge of large groups, though strongly expressed, remain superficial. In my opinion, he is throwing out the baby with the bathwater by not clearly explaining exactly what he is critical of and why, where the benefits are and what the drawbacks are. It is not very insightful.\n\nTo make matters worse, the book is very incoherently written. It is subdivided in 12 Chapters, that contain vaguely related short subsections to various topics. Ironically, since Lanier is outspoken critical of the blogosphere, the whole thing reads more like a collection of blogposts than a book. I am sure that all these little pieces he is offering fit perfectly together in Lanier's intellectually creative mind, but I had a hard time seeing a line of thought. Somewhere he elaborates on a research project he is working on with a friend on the relation between olfactation and language. That's certainly interesting, but I can't avoid having the impression Lanier just wrote down whatever crossed his mind. The book finally ends unexpectedly, without even so much as an attempt at drawing a conclusion or summarizing the argument. There are pretty much no references in the book to back up his claims or to at least justify his concerns.\n\nThat is not to say though that the book is uninteresting. See, having spent the money to buy and the time to read it, I am inclined to find something of value in it now. Lanier touches on many important points, and I hope that the book makes people think. However, exactly because I think that the theme of Lanier's book is important, it is even more disappointing it is so badly argued.\n\nWhat keeps me up at night is the question whether mankind will be able to solve all the problems it is causing, and do so in a timely manner. The question whether, from here on, the suffering on Earth will increase and progress will turn into regress, or whether we will manage to find a sustainable balance. I am wondering how to stabilize our economies, and how to complement them with desperately needed global political institutions.\n\nWhat keeps me up at night is the question whether the gap between the rich and the poor will ever close, how to ameliorate hunger and disease, war and corruption. Whether climate change will increase the pressure on our political, social, and economic systems so much we'll be tumbling back into the middle ages and our children will speak with awe of the times when everybody had an iPod.\n\nWhen I follow these thoughts, I always end up at the same point, at the question whether humans will ever be able to organize their collective actions smartly enough to manage the effects their presence has on this planet, if we are able to make intelligent enough decisions in a world in which events are getting closer connected every day, or if some brainless slime mould will remain ahead of us. I worry if we will ever be able to make this step or if progress will stop here and now, forever being limited by our inability to grasp the dynamics of global social systems.\n\nWhat keeps me up at night is the question what I can do to help alleviate unnecessary suffering. Not much ever comes to mind - What is a PhD in physics really good for? - except possibly write about it, talk about it. If you open a newspaper, look beyond the stories. Everybody has an opinion on everything and you'll disagree with many of them, but that's not the relevant layer to look at. What's relevant is that it doesn't matter what all these opinions are, as long as there's no way to intelligently use them. It's all talk and no action. It's all well-meant, but no outcome. It's all rhetorics, but no conclusion. It's all, still, trial and error till one day we'll make an error we won't be able to fix.\n\nThat's what keeps me up at night. And then there's Stefan's snoring.\n\nWhat I do in these sleepless moments is to focus on the problems that I understand well. Why is the cosmological constant so small, yet nonzero? Does the universe have the same laws of nature everywhere? What is space and time? Questions to which I'm sure there is an answer, and though I'm unlikely to find one, nobody will die and nobody will suffer if I wake up in the morning and still don't know why the neutrino masses are so small.\n\nAnd next time we'll talk about these questions that let me sleep at night.\n\nSaturday, August 14, 2010\n\n\n\nBlack Swan Rising By Lee Carroll\n\n\n\nThe Ice Cream Girls By Dorothy Koomson\n\nA well-written and well-told story about two girls who in their teenage years were charged for murdering one of their teachers. The story is told when they are in their mid 30s, at which time one of them is being released from prison while the other one is fighting psychological problems and trying to save her marriage. This line of the story is interrupted with the events back when they were teenagers. The characters are well-developed and the plot is interesting. Only shortcoming is that the ending is entirely obvious all the time, simply due to lack of characters introduced.\n\nThe Time Traveler's Wife By Audrey Niffenegger\n\nA lovely, yet incredibly sad story about a man who involuntarily jumps through time. It is written partially from his point of view and partly from his wife's. It is the one and only time-travel story that I can recall having read that stayed truthful to its own logic. I didn't see the movie, but the book is well-written and definitely worth reading.\n\nThanks For the Memories By Cecelia Ahern\n\nIs an incredibly dumb, annoying and foreseeable story about a women who receives somebody else's memories with a blood transfusion. Obviously the guy whose memories she now has is nice, good-looking and single. Guess what happens. Don't waste your money on that.\n\nThursday, August 12, 2010Tuesday, August 10, 2010\n\nSome months back, I summarized for you a paper that I wrote last year about a model called \"Deformed Special Relativity\" (DSR) with an energy-dependent yet observer-independent speed of light. In my paper, I essentially constructed a scenario that allows one to conclude these models are in conflict with observations to very high precision. Since then, several of you have been asking what happened after that, so here's a brief update.\n\nA short version of my paper was published in PRL, and was mentioned in Science. As you can guess, this made some people quite unhappy. After all, the version of DSR I argued to be ruled out to high precision due to incompatibility with well-confirmed physics of the standard model is the one that's been claimed for a decade to allow a first glimpse on quantum gravitational effects. Frankly, I'm not even happy myself the model doesn't work because I'd very much prefer would we be able to observe something and connect our research to experiment.\n\nSince my paper was published, Giovanni Amelio-Camelia and Lee Smolin, who have both worked on DSR, put out a few papers attempting to find a flaw in my argument. You find these papers here, here and here. My replies to these papers are also on the arxiv, you find them here, here and, the most recent one from today, here. In a nutshell, Amelino-Camelia et al's argument is just wrong due to a mistake in the re-calculation of the constraint. Smolin's two papers are more interesting in that he's doing the smart thing: trying to find an assumption I've made that can be replaced or shown to be not fulfilled to find a way DSR might work. One has to give it to him, he is actually amazingly creative. So far however, neither of his arguments has worked, though they gave me something to think about I hadn't considered in my original paper. Note also that Smolin has meanwhile updated his paper from April, while I haven't come around to update my reply yet, so don't get confused.\n\nIn any case, I'm afraid this won't be the end of the story. I'm admittedly quite tired of the whole issue since I have nothing really to win here. I'm either wrong, then I'm wrong, or I'm right, then I'm wasting my time arguing about a model that's wrong. Anyway, if you have any questions about this discussion, that's the place to ask.\n\nFriday, August 06, 2010\n\nA month ago, Tommaso Dorigo wrote a blogpost Rumors about a light Higgs. I usually just ignore such blogposts. That day, I was in a particularly foul mood and bothered to leave a comment that expressed very clearly my disapproval of such rumor spreading. (You'll find it in the comment section to Tommaso's post, I'm the \"not verified B\".)\n\n\"One culprit here is the Web, which was invented to foster better communication among physicists in the first place, but has proved equally adept at spreading disinformation. But another, it seems to me, is the desire for some fundamental discovery about the nature of the universe \u2014 the yearning to wake up in a new world \u2014 and a growing feeling among astronomers and physicists that we are in fact creeping up on enormous changes with the advent of things like the Large Hadron Collider outside Geneva and the Kepler spacecraft.\"\n\nThe first physics rumor that I can recall hearing of was the discovery of the top quark. It is also one of the very few rumors I've heard that later actually got confirmed. It's not that I don't hear rumors about some alleged signal in some experiment. I certainly find this interesting and thought-stimulating. I think it's quite natural that one talks about this with colleagues, and discusses the probability of it being confirmed and wonders about the implications. But I don't publicly distribute these stories. Nowadays, sooner or later, I'll find that rumor on some blog and then possibly even in a newspaper. Sometimes, by the time I read about it, I already know the rumor wasn't confirmed.\n\nWell, Tommaso's rumor wasn't confirmed either. But the question that stayed with me is whether rumors constitute a valid vehicle to get science across. I don't think so for the following reasons.\n\nFirst problem is that while it might draw interest in the short run, it erodes trust as well as interest in the long run. Science lives from accuracy more than any other field. The more often people read claims that something maybe was discovered, but then it wasn't, the less attention they'll pay if they read it again. Quantum gravity in cosmic rays! No wait, nothing to find there. Quantum gravity in gravitational wave interferometers! No wait, nothing to find there. Quantum gravity at the LHC. Well, let's see how that goes.\n\nSecond problem is one of principle. If rumors are considered a useful tool to draw attention, why not make up a few? It's easy enough, isn't it? Last week for example, I talked to a friend who was just visiting CERN. He doesn't want his name mentioned, but he told me...\n\nThird problem is that these rumors tend to circle around a few presently particularly popular topics or institutions, and if they dominate the news the vast majority of topics remains uncovered. Let's face it, most people on this planet still have no clue how a laser works and are confused by something called the particle-wave-duality. Their understanding of physics is stuck in the middle of the last century, if not some centuries earlier. There's plenty of physics that needs to be brought across more urgently than the latest rumor about dark matter detection. Yes, you might think that's dull. But you think it's dull because you're being fed constantly with the highly speculative, allegedly groundbreaking, maybe-discoveries. I myself would sometimes rather read a useful, popular, introduction about a not-quite-as-hot topic in a field I don't work on rather than quotations about the latest controversy.\n\nLast month, when I saw the July issue of Scientific American on Stefan's doorstep, I was thinking \"Oh, no.\" The headline read \"Is the Universe Leaking Energy?\" I was thinking, they probably picked some way-out random paper from the arXiv and are trying to proclaim that there's something fishy with energy conservation in General Relativity. Einstein was wrong! Stefan later said, he had exactly the same thought when he saw the headline. Reading the article however, I was pleasantly surprised: Tamara Davis has provided a well-written, insightful and entertaining explanation of, yes, just standard physics knowledge! She writes about symmetries and Noether's laws, conserved quantities, and about time-dependent backgrounds. She explains why there is no conflict between the seeming violation of energy and and accepted physical laws. It's textbook knowledge, yet it made it the title story. That's the sort of articles that we need more of.\n\nMonday, August 02, 2010\n\nOn a recent flight I was reading Jaron Lanier's book You Are Not a Gadget: A Manifesto. I got stuck somewhere in the middle and then dozed off watching Avatar. (Brilliant. Best movie I've seen for a long time, even on a tiny in-seat monitor.) This combination got me thinking about a common theme in both: collective intelligence. Lanier is a skeptic. He writes\n\n\"The intentions of the cybernetic totalist tribe are good. They are simply following a path that was blazed in earlier times by well-meaning Freudian and Marxists [...] A self-proclaimed materialist movement that attempts to base itself on science starts to look like a religion rather quickly [...] The Singularity and the noospehre, the idea that a collective consciousness emerges from all the users on the web, echo Marxist social determinism and Freud's calculus of perversion.\"\n\nAnd later, in a section \"Why It Matters,\" he writes \"Emphasizing the crowd means deemphasizing individual humans in the design of the society.\"\n\nI am very sympathetic to many points Lanier is making, but I dislike the \"Manifesto\"-style in which he's trying to lead his arguments. In any case, should I make it to the end of his book, I'll write a review. For now however, I want to focus on the topic of collective intelligence, for despite all the words Lanier is quite fuzzy on the use of terminology. I started wondering: What do people actually mean when they talk about collective intelligence? Are they really all talking about the same thing? I came to the conclusion that there's two different notions of collective intelligence, and I thought I'd amuse you with writing about a topic that I know pretty much nothing about.\n\nSetting the Stage\n\nFirst, let us be clear on what we're talking about: A collective or a group or a crowd will in the following simply be a set with elements. The elements of that set operate on input and create output. I will refer to the input and output likewise as \"knowledge.\"\n\nI further do not actually want to talk about the \"intelligence\" of a collective in the common sense for two reasons. One is that a collective can be intelligent one day and stupid the next day. I'd rather focus on one particular process the collective makes instead of assigning a qualifier to it as a whole. A process could be a decision as well as a direct action. Second reason is that using the term intelligent isn't useful without defining it. Thus, I would instead like to talk about collective processes that are beneficial for the collective. That's basically because I don't think measures like the IQ are particularly meaningful to assess intelligence since they also test for knowledge. Sure, the both are in humans correlated with each other because both draw upon the functionality of the same brain, but in principle it's different things: The one, knowledge, is the input a system has to work with, the other one, intelligence, is the procedure by which the input is processed. Clearly, to make good decisions both is needed. That's true for individuals as much as for groups. Consequently, to make beneficial decisions the collective needs to be well-informed as well as have a good way to process that information. Googeling doesn't make you more intelligent. It gives you more information.\n\nThus, what I will mean in the following with \"collective intelligence\" is the ability of a set of elements operating on some input to perform processes that are beneficial for the collective. Note that you'll have to define what your set is before you can make any statements. I know, it sounds pretty abstract, but it will be useful in its generality for the following.\n\nCollective Intelligence Type I\n\nThe first sort of collective intelligence is simply the gain in knowledge that you can get when you bring many elements of your set together. If every element brings some knowledge, you've now trivially more knowledge together. But that isn't the interesting aspect. The interesting aspect is that you can give the elements of your set the possibility to operate on each other's output, which means that you can create more knowledge than you could have done had they be disconnected.\n\nThere's many examples for this sort of collective knowledge. It's what you count on if you bring smart people together and let them talk to each other. They'll exchange ideas, they will build on each others' conclusions, and that way they can produce something genuinely new, say, a groundbreaking paper. I'll count that as a process that's beneficial for the collective. (A recent meeting of this sort is this one, report unfortunately in German.) It is this sort of collective intelligence that has become vastly easier to make use of with the internet, web2.0 and other advances of information technology. It is much easier today than it was two decades ago to give people with shared interests a platform to exchange their ideas.\n\nNote that I carefully wrote that you can get a gain of knowledge by better connectivity. It is however not a given. Just providing a possibility to share knowledge is not necessarily a way to arrive at a good decision, conclusion, or even useful creation of knowledge. Under certain circumstances, too much sharing of knowledge actually dumbs down a group because it reduces heterogeneity. Besides, human cognitive processes are messy and affected by all sorts of biases. As a consequence, the benefit of sharing knowledge depends on how the knowledge is shared, for example because judgement about the truth-value of a piece of knowledge is often dependent on the source it came from. These are some pitfalls that Surowiecki pointed out in his book The Wisdom of Crowds (read my review here). To exploit the additional knowledge gain you get from connecting groups of people you thus have to do some research about the effects and side-effects of social interactions.\n\nYou, and you, and you and I, we are some sort of collective and we exchange knowledge. If you give me a piece of information that's useful for my work or if you learn something from me, it's beneficial and I would argue we're thus part of an collective intelligence in that sense. Clearly, the internet has opened a vast potential for this. There's all sorts of unused possibilities in connecting billions of people online which we have only begin to explore. However promising, this sort of collective intelligence is at the same time of a very trivial sort. We're not actually doing anything new here. People have talked to each other and exchanged ideas as long as humans have wondered how to best skin a bear. The difference is just that now we're connecting more people faster and easier.\n\nA mathematical example for this sort of collective intelligence is a group with some basis elements and operators acting on them to create the full group. The basis elements are in this case the knowledge you start with. The operators are the collective. If you only allow each operator to repeatedly act on the same element (his own \"knowledge\") you'll generate only a small part of what you'll generate if you allow all operators to act on all elements (use all knowledge).\n\nCollective Intelligence Type II\n\nThe first type of collective intelligence is common and readily found in human groups, but in my opinion actually not the interesting type. The interesting type of collective intelligence is one in which knowledge is created by the collective as a whole and not by any of its elements. An example for that is your brain. Your brain is some sort of collective. It consists of neurons that process input and create output. Yet the thought processes that allow you to make conclusions are circuits in your brain that are not assigned to any specific neuron. The steps of your decision can not be broken down to processes on the elements simply because they don't exist on that level. Your intelligence is a truly emergent feature. It doesn't make sense on the level of a neutron.\n\nNote how very different this is to the first example of bringing together elements that create knowledge individually. The first type of collective intelligence is very common among human groups, the latter isn't. Wikipedia is an example of the first sort of (trivial) collective intelligence: It thrives from adding up the knowledge of many individuals. It doesn't actually collectively create anything truly new. The same is the case for crowdsourcing: Posing a problem to a large group of people allows you to use all their knowledge as well as their intelligence. Yet you're not creating anything that wasn't previously there already.\n\nA simple example of actual collective intelligence of type II is the starting point of Surowiecki's book. Have a group of people estimate something like the number of marbles in a jar or the weigh of an ox or something like that. Then take the average value. It will generally give a pretty good result, basically because individual errors average out. (This is an example that does not work well if you allow people to exchange their guesses in advance, it will skew the result. Recall above cautionary note about how to exploit collective wisdom.) What's new here is that one has added a process that was not previously there, a procedure to aggregate individual knowledge other than just adding it up. Note here that it's relevant to first define what you mean with the collective you're talking about before you decide what sort of intelligence you're dealing with. You could easily enough add Bob to your ox-estimating group and what Bob does is that he asks everybody for their guess and takes the average value. Now who is intelligent: Bob or the group? It would depend on whether you did count Bob with his input processing as being part of the group originally, so one has to be precise. Anyway, in this simple case one is just taking an average value, not a very sophisticated aggregation of knowledge, but there are less trivial cases.\n\nFor example our economic system, according to the standard general equilibrium theory, the well-known interplay of supply and demand that, ideally, results in pricing products in such a way that the economy runs maximally efficient. The equilibrium that one works towards is not something known by anybody participating in that system. The aggregation mechanism is a free market economy. Now one can debate how well that actually works and under which circumstances the model doesn't apply, but that's not really the point here. The point is that this \"invisible hand\" of optimization is a features that adds something truly new, some intelligence that is not present on the individual level.\n\nOther examples for human collectives are arguably political decision making processes. Again, one can debate how well these work and how beneficial the outcome really is, more research is clearly needed, but it suffices to say here that at least they work better than nothing at all. The thing is however that for human collectives you need some mechanism to bring back the insight gained from the aggregate to the individual level, either by communicating the result of a decision or directly by converting it into an action or recommendation. Just leaving it standing inaccessibly at the aggregate level isn't useful because actions are still made by the individuals.\n\nI want to add another example of human collectives here which is the academic system. In the academic system we do not have written down rules to aggregate knowledge, neither do we have a model for how it works. However, if you look at the history of science, we nevertheless de facto have some aggregation mechanism. It's not like there was ever a vote whether or not Coulomb's (wrong) magnetic field law should be kept in the textbooks, yet here we are without it. I think Smolin in his book The Trouble with Physics (read my review here) summarized it well:\n\n\"Science has succeeded because scientists comprise a community that is defined and maintained by adherence to a shared ethics.\"\n\nThe shared ethics Smolin is talking about is basically some sort of scientific method. Again one can debate whether Smolin's suggestion is the best way to set up the system, but that isn't the point here. He's right in that, written law or not, scientists have used some sort of ethics and that's what made the scientific community more than just a bunch of smart people. It has created a solid and growing body of knowledge that spreads though educational systems and is the driver of innovation. Note however that this sort of collective intelligence does not create a theory, it (ideally) merely singles out the ones to be kept.\n\nAnother example for this sort of collective intelligence outside the human realm is the DNA of the bacterium Escherichia Coli containing information in its topology and not only in its sequence. That's not some \"knowledge\" that any of the elements of the DNA string encodes - it can only be read off from the whole string. An example of the mathematical sort might be a manifold. Consider every point of the manifold the knowledge and parallel transport by some infinitesimal step the elements of your collective. If you only look at the local surrounding you'll never figure out additional information in the topology of the whole thing. You'll have to do something more for that, like looking for closed loops.\n\nLimitations\n\nClearly for me as a scientist the interesting question is what can collective intelligence do for scientific progress. I think we're doing well with the first type of collective intelligence. It is frequently used. The second type of intelligence is however one that does not exist for the creation of scientific knowledge and I am not sure it ever will.\n\nWhat would it mean, this collective intelligence of type 2 in science? Consider a large group of scientists, maybe thousands, working on a notoriously difficult problem, possibly for decades. They'll collect and publish many pieces of knowledge. Collective intelligence of type 2 would be an aggregation process not working on the individual level that finds a solution to this difficult problem from the pieces scientists have found. However, the aggregation process that commonly worked for this is an individual finding the right pieces and being able to draw the right conclusions, thus type 1 of collective intelligence. Remember what I said earlier, as long as our society is run by the actions of individuals you need some way to bring back collective knowledge to the individual level, otherwise it's useless. But what mechanism do we have for that in science other than a scientist?\n\nThere are some few cases in which indeed scientific conclusions have been drawn by aggregation of accumulated knowledge. For example finding relations between seemingly distinct (medical) topics from citation analysis. But these examples are rare and I'm not sure how far one can ever get with this. This then opens the following question: Can it happen that we will not be able to arrive at some insights simply due to the limitations of the human brain to recognize knowledge that is not present at the individual level? And what is the next step of evolution? Can we ever go beyond that?\n\nI've argued there's two types of collective intelligence: One in which bringing together elements of a group and connecting them creates output that was not possible to create without the connections. In this case however, the output is still created by the single elements, it's just that the connections allow more of it and thus making them can open unused potential. This is the trivial, type 1, sort of collective intelligence. The second, more interesting, sort of collective intelligence one has when the knowledge is not present at the individual level at all. It is contained on the collective level, and its production cannot be assigned to any element of the group in particular.\n\nFor what groups of humans are concerned, the first sort of collective intelligence is already well in use and with a better understanding of social dynamics and psychology we will be able to exploit more unused potential. For what the second type is concerned, I think one should rightfully be skeptic. It is questionable how much can be achieved by it, and unclear how it can be created or used. We're a long way from global collective intelligence like that connecting the lifeforms on Pandora.\n\nIn his book, Lanier offers the reader a list with suggestions for \"what each of us can do\" featuring the item \"Write a blog post that took weeks of reflection before you heard the inner voice that needed to come out.\" Well, I report that I've been reflecting on this for some weeks, though not continuously. After all, I have a job to do. My inner voices are typically busy with some other things than wanting to come out, like reminding me I should put the laundry into the dryer now. In any case, I hope it won't take you several weeks to read it ;-)"}

I use mine to link to places I like to visit, and I hope you like to visit them, too. I don't always agree with every view on every blog I link to, but I do find them all to be thought-provoking and worth my time to visit when I get a chance.\n\nA few years ago I happened across an online \"stock market\" in blogs called BlogShares. Instead of real-life stocks, this game trades in blogs. As you can imagine, there are blogs that talk about nearly every facet of human existence, literally from A to Z. Blogshares lists them (and gains listings every day) in categories called \"Industries.\" A blog's value is based on how many links go to and from it. The site estimates the value of a blog and sells shares in it.\n\nI was intrigued by it, so I listed my blog and started playing the game. I worked my way up into the top 200 players (although I'm certainly not the wealthiest player in the game), and have learned a lot about the amazing variety of blogs out there, simply by reading the blogs I've visited as I played the game. Not that I have as much time to play as much as I once did. Work and real life do have a way of intruding into game play, but I still make trades, vote on blogs, moderate votes that others make on blogs, and in general, keep my finger on the pulse of the game as I have free time to do so.\n\nI'm not going to get into the specifics of the game; if you're interested, go check it out. But, I do want to mention how many very cool and interesting people are playing it. There are folks from around the world playing 24/7, buying and selling shares, trading in \"ideas\" (which are another unit of exchange in the game), and sharing their tips on how to play the game in the online discussion forum attached to the game.\n\nWhen I first began playing the game, it was still being run by its inventor, a student named Seyed Razavi (who eventually sold it to the group that runs it today). He didn't actually start out to create a strict copy of a stock market so much as he wanted to explore social networking through the exploration of the blogging phenomenon by using a game to do so. He also wanted to explore how power law theories might work in human networking systems.\n\nA power law basically says that over time, any system will evolve to favor a small subset of users/units/participants, or, in other applications, a small subset of participants or objects in a given system will consume the majority of the system's resources. You could say, for example, that when a planetary system begins to form, the largest bodies will gather in the most amount of system resources; i.e., the large planets get larger, possibly at the expense of the smaller ones.\n\nFor blogs, the power law shows that some blogs get more attention than others; they get larger numbers of sites linking to them, and so forth.\n\nThe power law distribution as applied to blogs is an interesting use of a scientific statistical tool to measure human interactions on the Web. And, Blogshares both shares in that power law and facilitates interactions by rewarding sites with more links a higher value than those with few or no links. My own blog has about 51 links to it (some from other BlogShares users), and is valued reasonably well (in the 500s per share). The sites with the most links to them, like Flickr, have very high share values (in the millions of dollars per share).\n\nSome years ago, before the Web was a huge presence in our lives, the idea that getting on the computer and socially interacting was a new one. It's interesting that the \"geeks\" among us (me included) are often derided in the media for being anti-social nerds because we interact via computer networks.\n\nBut, as it turns out, the social interactions we're now doing on computer networks are following some of the same laws of interaction and social structure that we see in real life (when, for example, small subsets of our societies control 80 percent of wealth and commodities). The power law does, indeed, describe an interesting human propensity to \"cluster\" in our online activities, even as we do in \"real life.\" And, for those who have been playing Blogshares and didn't know it, we've all been taking part in a social and science experiment. It reminds me of the old days, when Xerox and their PARC facility used to invite people to participate in MUD (Multi-User Domains) so they could study and model human interactions.\n\nIn that game, I actually built a home in a virtual ski area in New Mexico. I had an art gallery, a pool, a salon (wherein I invited guests to come in and debate various issues), and a front room where I interviewed guests for my home. Other people had built virtual homes in the MUD (it was called Lambdamoo), and so each personal \"space\" was like an extension of a person's imagination. The interactions were great fun, sometimes disturbing, and always way more than I ever imagined we'd see on a computer network way back when I first learned to program computers in high school in the early 1970s.\n\nOf course, today we have gone way beyond the MOOs and MUDs of yesteryear to places like SecondLife, which purports to be a parallel life online. (I haven't visited it, not sure if I really have time), and forums like BadAstronomy (where all of us astronomy- and science-minded folk can talk about our mutual interests). But, it may well turn out to be not terribly different from the MOOs and MUDs, forums and BlogShares\u2014online places where humans can network in yet another way, among the endless varieties of networks we already have. And, as it does, it will go into competition for that most valuable of resource: user time, sucking it in according to the power law that states that the most popular ones will end up taking the most attention from users. An interesting experiment, indeed"}
{"text": "1. \"Beam Me Up, Scotty\"\nTeleportation is such an old desire of mankind that we can find mentions of it as far back as the New Testament. Luckily, with the help of science, we should soon be able to enjoy God's favorite mode of transportation as well, or at least your atoms will.\n\nDuring 2009 scientists from the University of Maryland's Joint Quantum Institute successfully copied an atom to a remote location almost a meter away. Although this may not sound terribly impressive it's a major breakthrough in quantum physics and will soon allow for the teleportation of complex molecules and viruses. Just imagine how great the future will be when teleporting a common cold right inside someone's lungs will be a common practical joke.\n\nHowever, the most important implication of this experiment is not teleporting molecules of beer inside your mouth. By replacing physical wires with teleporting atoms, scientists hope to create a computer so powerful that it will break all secret codes ever created, while still running the latest GTA game. Better known as quantum computing, this new way of transmitting data via teleportation is expected to revolutionize everything we ever knew about computers. It will also make your custom-made $5,000 gaming PC obsolete.\n2. Electric Microbes\nTeleporting supercomputers sounds awesome, but the biggest problem will be generating enough cheap electricity to keep them running. Then again, scientists might have just found the solution to the whole energy crisis by turning to microbes for inspiration. It seems science is really fond of microscopic organisms that could kill us.\n\nUsing bacteria, researchers at the University of Massachusetts created a microcell that can generate electricity by decomposing organic matter. In the first stage, the artificial bacteria will be used to generate electricity in difficult environments such as the bottom of the ocean. We're not sure who exactly needs electricity underwater, but we hope the next step is developing microcells to be used in cars and other electric devices.\n\nThis discovery could very well mean that in the near future we'll be farming our electricity from tanks of sludge. While it sounds highly unappetizing, this practice will be dirt cheap, renewable and won't damage the environment. As long as the bacteria don't mutate and start decomposing our tissue, this whole deal sounds incredibly awesome.\n\n3. Telepathy\nSo far we have supercomputers and electricity farms, but why not control these technologies without lifting a finger? Soon enough you'll be able to lounge on the couch and let your brain do the heavy lifting thanks to the latest discoveries in brain reading and thought transmission.\n\nAt the University of Utah, scientists implanted a series of microelectrodes right under the skull, thus allowing paralyzed people to control computers and prosthetic limbs. If this sounds familiar you're probably remembering \"Robocop,\" where electrodes implanted under the skull transform people into cyborgs. While we don't want to sound unreasonable, we can only conclude that Utah will soon build an unstoppable cyborg army and conquer the rest of the U.S.\n\nIn order to prepare for the imminent civil war, the University of Wisconsin developed an external telepathy cap. This device literally reads your mind, allowing users to communicate simply by thinking of a letter. Of course, the first usage of the brilliant invention was to send a tweet. One can only hope that once scientists take the invention away from text-addicted teenagers it'll be used to kick-start an unprecedented age of communication. Then again, it will probably just be used to connect your brain to Foursquare so everyone can know exactly how you feel about the new Starbucks latte. 4. Nanorobotic Slaves\nWhile waiting to telepathically connect with robots, why not become the host for some tiny machines that will cure you of all disease, improve your organs and make you lose weight? Nanorobotics has been an established field for quite some time, with many innovations that sound more like magic than reality. The main problem with the technology was mass-producing the microscopic innovations. We said \"was\" because now we have the solution: a nanorobot assembly line.\n\nIt's like an old-school factory, except every worker is created entirely out of DNA and works based on chemical orders to assemble compounds that we can barely see. Right now the robots can assemble gold particles into eight different products, but soon the process will be used to produce more complex results, including other nanorobots.\n\nJust like the first Ford factory, this invention will usher an industrial revolution, allowing us to produce new technology on a scale previously unimaginable. However, this time around we won't need child labor and horribly unsafe work conditions. It's really a win-win scenario.\n\n5. Power Plants Inside Your Body\nUnfortunately, before we can pump our body full of tiny robots we need to find a way to power them. The solution comes from France where scientists have recently created a glucose biofuel cell.\n\nBy decomposing chemicals inside your body these tiny power plants will create electricity for any type of implants imaginable. The cells were already successfully tested on mice and they were powerful enough to power a pacemaker, thus finally solving France's problem of heart attacks in mice.\n\nThe next step on the agenda is implementing the cell in human bodies where it could power artificial organs or nanorobots cruising through our bloodstream. While there aren't high hopes that you'll be able to recharge your phone by touching it, the technology will make cyborgs even more feasible. We understand that Utah is highly interested.\n\n6. Robotic Swarms While we fully agree that robots are awesome, we do worry about the day when they will finally become sentient and organize in packs so they can hunt us. In order to avoid such a horrible disaster, scientists are keeping one step ahead of the robot revolution -- by making sure to create intelligent robot swarms themselves.\n\nFesto, a company that specializes in creating smart robots, recently unveiled AquaJelly, a swam of robots inspired by jellyfish. These intelligent machines can swim together and coordinate their movements through radio and LED signals. Since making underwater robots that can communicate with creepy, glowing lasers is not scary enough, the same company created an airborne robot.\n\nSignificantly larger, AirJelly uses helium in order to gently swim through the air and silently sneak up on you. Now all we need is for the two swarms to collaborate and we're completely screwed.\n\n7. Planet of the Dogs\nSince we're on the topic of communication, how often have you looked at your dog at 4:23 a.m. wondering why that was the perfect time for barking? Science is here to help you answer exactly that question, with the aid of the latest dog-emotion reader.\n\nWhile not the first of its kind this new Japanese pet translator is spectacular in the way it analyzes the acoustic details of barks in order to deliver accurate interpretations. Not only will you be able to know when your dog is sad, happy or excited to see a squirrel, but the device will ask you to play with the dog and feed it. It sounds like pets have finally found an easy way to train their masters.\n\nAccording to psychologist Vanessa Woods, this is just one in a series of developments that allow dogs to communicate more easily with humans than any other animal. She predicts that if this trend continues, dogs will eventually evolve to a stage where direct communication with humans will become possible. Sadly, this kind of evolution takes centuries, so we probably won't be around to witness the first talking dog. 8. Meat Farms\nThe future looks like a great place to be a farmer, as long as you're willing to farm electricity or meat. Currently being developed by Dutch researchers, pork and beef muscle grown entirely inside a laboratory sounds like a very possible development.\n\nWhile growing your own sausage from pig stem cells might sound like the plot of a crappy horror movie, it's actually not all that bad. Considering the amount of energy, water and food necessary to raise animals, as well as all the pollution they cause, growing meat in a lab makes economic sense. Of course, many people will probably scream that artificial meat means we're messing with nature, but we've been doing that for years, ever since we introduced growth hormones in our cows. Besides, the artificial meat might finally get PETA to stop protesting for a few minutes.\n\nHowever, don't get your hopes too high. Right now the meat farm is nothing more than a university lab with some tiny muscle tissue developing in a highly controlled environment. Researchers have mostly focused on generating fat and bone, although they hope to be just as successful with edible muscle. In the meantime we can all enjoy some artificial pig fat.\n\n9. Force Fields\nWhile we're still a ways away from crying \"Force fields up!\" as an alien ships attacks the Enterprise, the laser developed by Boeing is a pretty close approximation. The ominously named MATRIX is a highly concentrated laser beam that can automatically detect and shoot down anything that flies in its range, be it a plane or a rocket.\n\nCreated at the request of the U.S. Air Force, this laser is just one of a series of new weapons being developed by Boeing. The company also created a laser that can be mounted on an airplane and a laser/machine-gun combo, for those times when a death ray just isn't enough to kill anything what's bothering you.\n\nWhat is truly remarkable about the laser is that it's light enough to be carried by a few soldiers and will probably become even smaller over the next few years. Also, the whole machine is silent and invisible, so while it's not a traditional \"force field,\" it will stop anything that flies toward you in exactly the same way. We look forward to Boeing creating a personal version which we could install in our cubicle so no one can ever annoy us again.\n\n10. Adamantium\nIn case you have no clue what adamantium is you need to read up on the Marvel universe. This is the Holy Grail of all metal, a light alloy that can withstand impossible pressure and will always stay sharp. It's the stuff that Wolverine's claws are made of, and until recently it was considered impossible to make in real life.\n\nModumetal, a U.S.-based company, used nanolaminating, an electro-chemical process that re-arranges atoms, in order to create a compound they named, very originally, modumetal. Besides having the least innovative name for a product, modumetal is predicted to revolutionize the way we use metals. Since nanolaminating changes the exterior structure of metals it will make them stronger, corrosion-free and practically indestructible.\n\nThe company has already won numerous awards for bringing wolverine claws a little closer, and modumetal will soon be used in armor of all sorts as well as replacing bridges and other public metal structures. Considering this material will probably reduce government costs for repairing infrastructure by a couple of million dollars, we're sold.\n\nTuesday 15 June\n\nWe are living in the time in which all technologies known and unknown are uttered, spun, and utilized. This is creation. The Allidile Report message, a physics paper written over the past 10 years, goes to great lengths to expose the truth about nano technology and our involvment with it. This physics report tells all, names /names, and reveals what the end looks like, and it looks just like this. Look around you, observe these telling events and their connection to our light / carbon atom chain reaction universal spin. It is time to wake up, to wake up, to wake up!"}

{"text": "Lab life\n\nExpect observations on lab life, fish life and the outside world in this mixed up blog.\n\nThe thoughts and opinions expressed in this blog are not those of the University of Sheffield or the CDBG, and should not be seen as such.\n\nTo comment on a post using twitter use the hashtag #lablife\n\nScience and cartoons\n\nTwo pieces of news caught my eye today; a new mushroom has been described and named, and Sonic the Hedgehog, a video game character is 20 today. Read on to find out what the connection between them is.\n\nOpinions are divided, heated debates can be heard in science departments the world over, the bone of contention? Should new genes, species, disease and other discoveries be named in an orderly fashion, or at the whimsy of the discoverer?\n\nThe privilege of naming a new discovery has long been the reward for diligence and hard work. Immortalizing oneself or an admired contemporary was the traditional choice. But more imaginative choices have also been made.\n\nOne of my favourites, and close to my heart, are the members of the hedgehog gene family.The first Hegehog gene was discovered in 1978 by Christiane N\u00fcsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus, in the fruitfly, Drosophila. If Drosophila lack the gene for Hedgehog, they have a thick coat of spikes (called denticles) that reminded the scientists of a hegehog, and so that's what they named it.\n\nLater, similar genes were found in vertebrates, but instead of there being just one Hedgehog gene, there were multiple, and they needed to be distinguished from each other, two were named after hedgehog species, Indian and Desert, whilst the most famous (and most biologically active) was amusingly named Sonic, after the video game character.\n\nFruitfly genes provide fertile ground for interesting names, such as the two mutants amnesiac and cheapdate. They're both have defects in the same gene (called amnesiac), whilst the mutant amnesiac has memory loss, the change that causes the cheapdate phenotype (physical manifestation of a gene), lowers the fly's tolerance to alcohol.\n\nOther favourites are; methuselah, which increases the lifespan of flies, named after the biblical figure who lived to 969, stargazer mutants look up over and over (due to an affect on the cerubelum) and brainiacflies have much larger brains then normal.\n\nZebrafish gene names are often imaginative too, such as the class of blood mutants, that were discovered by the Zon lab, which are named after fine wines, such as chardonnay, chablis and merlot (rumour has it that the discoverer of a new gene in the lab is awarded a bottle of the corresponding wine \u2013 hence a increase in more obscure and expensive wines as time has gone on!)\n\nUnderstandably perhaps, the penchant for amusing names in science seems be dying out, in favour of methodical, structured naming, saving doctors from having to give the unfortunate news, for example, that a patient has a mutation in swiss cheese(which results in holes in the brain although for the record, I know of no patients that have this mutation!)\n\nHowever, wit amongst scientists has not been lost forever, for today I learned of a new species of mushroom, discovered by researchers from San Fransisco State University, that is shaped like a sea sponge, and was therefore named: Spongiforma squarepantsiiafter the yellow-marine dwelling-cartoon character.\n\nThis makes me happy.\n\nWhy genetics isn't the answer to every question\n\nWhen I meet someone new, and they ask me what I do, I tend to say I study genetics. It's a word people are familiar with, and they may even have some idea of what it means, but I often find many don't. (If I bring up the zebrafish first, I suspect they go away thinking I'm a marine biologist, after all, it took me a number of years and the establishment of fishforscience to persuade my mother otherwise!)\n\nThe media's insistence on saying that any newly discovered gene function means it's the gene 'FOR' something has probably distorted many people's ideas about what genetics is about and what it's really 'FOR'. Although I often talk about the diseases I study, I try and emphasize that the genes aren't there to cause disease, as really the genetic disease is often caused by the lack of the gene. So perhaps the headline should read: \"Gene for Health discovered\", though I guess that would get repetitive after a while.\n\nIn this interesting article from Prof Stephen Jones on the BBC website, he bemoans the newspaper headlines and highlights the many holes we have in our knowledge of what does cause us to be different from each other (whilst still clearly looking like our parents). The bottom line is, that genetics are complicated, and rarely does one gene explain a dramatic change in our appearance or health.\n\nFact or Fiction\n\nThe lovely science team at the BBC have created another little quiz for us to play with. This one tests your knowledge of fact or fantasy in science.\n\nClick the image to go to the quiz.\n\nAs you can see, I did ok, but I'm pretty sure I should have done better! (But I like being a Professor)\n\nIve had a Brainwave\n\nThrough the support of the British Science Association and the University of Sheffield a team of enthusiastic scientists, mathematicians, engineers and artists are aiming to bring science to the masses. The Science Brainwaves team take part in heaps of activities in and around Sheffield, and have even been known to escape Yorkshire and have traveled as far as the casino en ligne francais Brecon Beacons (although I don't think any of them were complaining about casino online running an experimental \"Einsteins Kitchen\" at the Green Man festival!)\n\nKnow your scientists\n\nScience on TV is absolutely essential, getting the public to understand what, how and why scientists do the work we do is fundamental to ensuring we continue to be supported by public funds. The BBC does a pretty good job of producing science programs, the latest Horizon series has casino poland been particularly fantastic.

Pigs are considered animals unfit for consumption. Among these parasites are as follows:\n\nKamis, 14 April 2011\n\nPrincess shame (Mimosa pudica L.) is widely encountered in the weeds and also one of the wild plants. For those who still do not know the daughter of shame, this plant has a small leaf shapes arranged plural, oval shape with a pointed tip, green color (there are a reddish color), has thorns on its trunk. These plants also sometimes flowering, the flowers form round like a ball, the color pink, stemmed. Characteristic of this plant is a plant is very sensitive to touch that leaves so touched and will shut this plant Although many people know and never see these shy daughter plants will but not many know if it's embarrassed daughter is very well medically efficacious and empirically. Princess shame can prevent and treat some diseases. Almost all parts of this shy girl efficacious, from leaves, roots, until the entire plant, either fresh or dried.\n\nJumat, 08 April 2011 comprised of 10 more unexplainable and interesting phenomenon and incidents that we crave so much. This list is made up of a mixture of two submissions to the Christmas competition which shared some items, so it seemed a good idea to combine the two to give us ten things never before shown on the site. Also note, this list is in the newly created category \"Mystery\" and all of our lists involving mysteries can now be found under that category in the archives or on the mystery category page."}
{"text": "Grab your lab coats and slap on your safety goggles, because the world of science is in turmoil. Sort of. This week Zealous Xenobiologist Zach Kagan brings you exciting tales of global warming, stem cells, the secrets of the the brain and more.\n\nLast Wednesday Havemeyer Hall became a battleground over the future direction of Neuroscience research. In a public debate, moderated by Robert Kulwhich of Radiolab fame, two top neuroscientists argued over the direction of future research: In one corner we have Sebastian Seung, MIT professor of computational neuroscience and swanky dresser, and in the other corner we have the one-and-only director of the Center for Neural Science at NYU, Tony Movshon. Seung came into the ring swinging, arguing the the ways that neurons interconnect throughout the brain is the most important avenue for research. Movshon fought back, standing firm in his belief that scientists should specialize in which area of the brain they study, getting deeper into how each individual part functions. In the end both combatants went the whole fifteen without a knock out, but it was a hell of a show.\n\nMost people, other than Fox news pundits, will agree that global warming is caused by increased carbon dioxide levels. However, there have been many other warm periods, which begs the question\u2013was CO2 also involved in these instances? The answer is generally yes, according to a sweeping new study analyzing the global mean temperatures and carbon dioxide levels throughout time. When CO2 levels go up, temperature rises not long after. For example, approximately 21,000 years ago variations in the Earth's orbit caused warmer summer in the norther hemisphere, causing glaciers to melt, the resulting glacial water altered the Atlantic current system, allowing deep sea CO2 to escape into the atmosphere, warming the planet. Columbia post doctorate fellow Jeremy Shakun remarks: \"We constructed the first-ever record of global temperature spanning the end of the last ice age based on 80 proxy temperature records from around the world\u2026 It's no small task to get at global mean temperature.\""}

Welcome to Chemistry World with Victoria Gill, Richard Van Noorden, Manisha Lalloo and James Mitchell Crow. I'm Chris Smith. Coming up, why the moon is actually a much wetter place than we first thought.\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nWe've always but in the middle of these beads, they did detect a small amount of water.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo, no cheese then. That's on the way. Also talking of water, we'll be finding out what ice cores from Antarctica can tell us about climate change.\n\nInterviewee - Eric Wolff\n\nWe are much higher than it has been at any time in the last 800,000 years. So it ranges between a 170 in the cold periods and about 300 in the very warmest periods and right now we're at 380 this year and rising by 2 parts per million per year.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nThat's Eric Wolff from the British Antarctic Survey who will be joining us later and we'll also be celebrating summer with a drink.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nSo we're going to see if Rich can tell the difference between the beer that has been exposed to sunlight and hopefully there's been some interesting photochemistry affecting its flavour and the beer that's been lovingly refrigerated. So this is beer number 1 (sound of beer being poured)\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nI can see you've worked in a pub Vic. Can he have some beer with his head please? Now they say, you shouldn't taste your chemistry experiments, but this was one exception that the team were willing to make, that's the science of beer and photochemistry and it's coming up later and we'll also be solving last month's chemical conundrum.\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nIf you had a standoff between hydrogen, carbon, and chlorine, which has the highest first ionization energy.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nThe answer is on the way and if you sent in a chemical solution, then stay tuned to find out if you're one of this month's winners.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nThe Chemistry World podcast is brought to you by the Royal Society of Chemistry.

Richard.\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nWell, not a lot of water Chris. We've always thought and it's the titanium and the magnesium that's causing this colour, and when they looked at these beads, there's no volatile components like water or chlorine or fluorine on the surface, as you would expect, the moon is very small, it doesn't have an atmosphere. All of these volatile components would have floated away long ago, that's why the moon is bone dry, but in the middle of these beads, they did detect a small amount of water and doing some modelling to work out perhaps how quickly the water diffused away from these beads, which they think were formed during volcanic eruptions, these beads have sort of melted glassy magnesium or titanium.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nWere they formed in situ on the Moon or presumably they were formed on the early Earth and then when the Moon got formed from the Earth's crust, it got carried with this. Is that what happened?\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nWell that's the question. That's what they don't know. They actually found, as they were modelling that the amount of water that would have been present in these beads is about the same as what's in the Earth's mantle and that obviously gives rise to the question, did these come from the Earth in an impact. But they don't think it was a meteoroid from outer space because there doesn't seem to be things like nickel there that would have come from the meteoroids as well. So, now the question is, how was the water preserved in these glassy components. Did something crash in from the Earth as you say is very intriguing and they seem to just struck lucky. They seem to just found these beads. People have been looking at these soils for sometime and they happen to pick some that seem to have water in. It may be that water isn't scattered all over the Moon in these beads and that they just picked exactly the right spot.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo, what's the implication of this then? Where next, what are the big questions that this has opened up?\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nWell the question is, was there water on the early Moon, it could have hung around long enough to something interesting to happen or did it all disappear very quickly leaving the mostly dry Moon that we know today and can we find more water in other types of beads. Can we work out how the water got there perhaps by more detailed analysis on the hydrogen and deuterium isotopes of the water? So that's still to be addressed, but it's very exciting that the Moon is not really as dry as we thought.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nBut it does sound like it's going to necessitate a return visit to answer some of those questions.\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nWell, the authors from the Brown University in Rhode Island, US say that even manned crews might not actually find water. You know they think that they were quite lucky and so they are not even sure that manned crews will find water because we should see many trying, and the US's race to the Moon continues at its current pace, we might see manned visits to the Moon by 2020. So perhaps the mystery will be resolved.\n\n(5:05 -- Chemistry on Mars)\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nThanks Richard. While sticking with the subject of water and our near cosmic neighbours scientists are working on Mars, Manisha to understand a bit more about the surface chemistry there.\n\nInterviewee - Manisha Lalloo\n\nYeah, there has been quite a lot of exciting chemistry going on, on Mars at the moment and as a result of the, Phoenix Mars Lander which touched down in the arctic plains on the 25th of May and so over the last couple of months, scientists have been busy carrying out chemistry experiments that can help us study the history of water on Mars and study whether Mars has the potential to support life.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nWhat sort of things have they been doing to answer those questions?\n\nInterviewee - Manisha Lalloo\n\nFrom a chemist's perspective, I guess there are two main experiments they have being carrying out. The first is being using the wet chemistry laboratories on Phoenix and which is part of an instrument called MECA, which is Phoenix's Microscopy, Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer. Basically though wet chemistry experiments are carried out in these miniature chemistry labs and which is the size of a tea cup and contain ion-selective electrodes which can measure things such as what type of ions are in the solution and the pH of the solution of soil and water and the conductivity of the soil. So far they have found that the soil of Mars is alkaline, it's about a pH of 8 or 9 and they've also found sodium, potassium, magnesium, chloride and sulphate salts.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nHow do the abundances of those things compare with the same chemicals on Earth? Have we got a composition of the surface in Mars similar to Earth or is it very dramatically different?\n\nInterviewee - Manisha Lalloo\n\nAt the moment, they've still got a lot of analyzing left to do and it will take weeks and months before they can determine the true significance of these results. I spoke to the lead and scientist, Sam Kounaves and he says that they don't know the exact levels of salts and ions in the solutions at the moment but somewhere in between tap water and seawater.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSounds tasty. So they haven't actually got that long to do all this, have they? Because the probe can only work until winter comes and then that's it.\n\nInterviewee - Manisha Lalloo\n\nYeah, that's true and at the moment the scientists have been working to a Mars day, they've been working to Mars time which is the 24.7 Earth hour day and that mission is scheduled to last for 90 sols which is 90 Martian days. So that should end at the end of August, but the scientist I talked to, said that they can hopefully extend it for a couple of months, but that (UNCLEAR 7:16) to get all the chemistry done.\n\nWell coming back to Earth now and to Antarctica which paradoxically despite being the coldest place on Earth, also holds many of the answers to the question of global warming. Here's is Eric Wolff.\n\nInterviewee - Eric Wolff\n\nAntarctica in various places holds the key to understanding a lot of aspects of the Earth, especially to do with climate change. The work that I do is particularly on ice cores and ice cores are the clearest way we have of knowing how the famous green house gases, carbon dioxide and methane have changed in the past and although we think of Antarctica as very remote, it does have a significant effect on global climate. So, we do really need to understand that just as much as anywhere else in the world.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo, when we are talking about the ice in Antarctica, how thick is it?\n\nInterviewee - Eric Wolff\n\nIn the central parts of Antarctica, the ice can be up to 4 km or 3 miles thick, of course around the coast it's very much thinner, but that 4 km has been snow fall falling over thousands and millions of years, actually the ice sheets been there probably continuously for at least 20 million years and so it builds up to these incredible thicknesses.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd so once you want to unlock the data that's in that ice, how do you get at it, obviously you got to drill it out in someway.\n\nInterviewee - Eric Wolff\n\nSo, I have friends who are engineers who go and drill this ice forming using these, they look a little bit like very large wood boring instruments, but they drill out a cylinder of ice may be about 10 cm in diameter. We pull up 3 or 4 meters at a time and if you keep going and do that a thousand times, you get to the bottom of the ice sheet.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd so how far back, if you get to the bottom that gives you how much time?\n\nInterviewee - Eric Wolff\n\nWell the oldest ice that we've got so far from ice cores in Antarctica is 800,000 years old. We think that there is older ice somewhere in and sometime in the rest of my career I hope we will get to well beyond a million years. But 800,000 years already takes us through 8 cycles of having ice ages and warmer periods, so it's already a very good range of climate.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd how do you get the data out. So once you've got the chunk of ice, how do you actually find out what the climate was doing by analyzing that?\n\nInterviewee - Eric Wolff\n\nOkay, well, as you are employing its all chemistry, mainly we bring the ice back and some of the analysis is done in the field in Antarctica but mostly it's brought back in different sections that are sent to different labs around Europe in the case of the projects like mostly been involved with. The first thing that we measure is the isotopic content of the water itself. So that's comparing the amounts of water with oxygen with the weight of 18 and standard water with oxygen with a weight of 16 and that tells you what the temperature was at the time the snow fell. So that's really the very primary thing that you want to know, that keys everything else in. Then in addition, there are lots of impurities in the ice, for example, we can measure sulphuric acid or sulphate in the ice and it tell us lots of things, but one of the very obvious things is that you occasionally see very big spikes whether the concentration of sulphate goes up by may be a factor of 3 over the background and that's always because that was the year when there was a big volcanic eruption like Krakatau in 1883 and then finally we got these little bubbles of air that are trapped in the ice and those bubbles can be cracked open again and analyzed for all the trace gases in the atmosphere.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd when you do this analysis, what's the message that's emerging; what are you seeing?\n\nInterviewee - Eric Wolff\n\nWell, there are different messages depending on the time scales you look at. The big one that comes after the long records is that you see climate warming and cooling over 800,000 years and the most striking thing is that carbon dioxide and methane, but carbon dioxide particularly go up and down as the ice ages go up and down. Our inference from that firstly is that they are playing a major role in amplifying what should be very small climate changes into big ones that can make ice sheets come and go. Of course, it's also telling us something about the carbon cycle and about how carbon dioxide is released from the oceans and from land at different times which is something we're going to really need to understand in the future as we want the oceans to mop up some of the carbon dioxide we're putting into the atmosphere. So it both tells us how carbon dioxide affects the climate and how the climate affects carbon-dioxide.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nBecause some people have pointed out that we assume that this year too goes up and then the world warms up, but of course when you warm the planet, you warm the sea and if you've a warmer water, then less gas would dissolve in warmer water and as a result that would lead to CO2 coming out, wouldn't it? So how do we know that it's the CO2 coming first and then other effects secondarily.\n\nInterviewee - Eric Wolff\n\nWell actually in the past, it probably wasn't CO2 coming first, that's a very good point and worth making and these natural changes of several degree Celsius in global temperature that happened roughly every 100,000 years, we think it was almost certainly the small changes in the structure of the Earth's orbit around the sun that triggered everything off but then the carbon dioxide coming out soon afterwards amplified it helped in being a very big climate change. So you get this, as you say a chicken-and-egg situation where both the temperature and the carbon dioxide are rising together actually for several thousand years and the difference with what's happening now is that we don't have to say which came first, because we know which came first. We know we are putting lots of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and that's another one of the very clear results from ice cores.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nWhen we compare CO2 levels now with what your record say they have ever been in the past, where are we now on the, sort of, grand scheme of things?\n\nInterviewee - Eric Wolff\n\nWell, we're much higher than it has been at anytime in the last 800,000 years. So it ranges between 170 in the cold periods and about 300 in the very warmest periods and right now we are at 380, 385 I think, this year and rising by 2 parts per million per year. So it's much higher than anytime in that period. There are very indirect measurements from ocean sediments suggesting that carbon dioxide was significantly higher 10 - 20 million years ago and then of course a lot higher back in the geological time, when the Earth was indeed very much warmer than it is now. So within the time period when the Earth looked like it does now, with the continents in the same places, this is probably the highest level but we only know about the last 800,000 years for sure.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSure, but when it has gone that high before, what actually turn things around to make it come down again, because that's a pretty important question for us, better answer it?\n\nInterviewee - Eric Wolff\n\nYeah, that's a very good question and I don't think anybody has a particularly good idea on these 100,000 year time scales, we think what's happening is essentially the balance between what's in the deep ocean, what's in the surface ocean, and what's in the atmosphere has been changing probably due to changes in the way the ocean circulates. But over longer geological time, there is a balance between carbon dioxide being put into the atmosphere and taken out through volcanism on the one hand and weathering on the other hand and so that's determined by things like how bigger an area of mountain building is going on that causes weathering and things like that, which I have to say are beyond my limit, but they are certainly on time scales that aren't going to help us.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo when it comes to global warming, it sounds like, we've got something of a mountain to climb, thank you very much. That's Eric Wolff from the British Antarctic Survey.\n\n(Music)\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nThis is the Chemistry World podcast, with me Chris Smith and still to come, we will be finding out why heavy metals might be to blame for dolphins beaching themselves and we'll also be raising a glass and drinking the contents to beer photochemistry.\n\n(14:30 -- Can humans sense light through their skin?)\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nBut first Victoria we've heard of people having eyes in the backs of their heads but now there is a possibility that skin almost has eyes of its own.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nWell and this is the team of researchers from the University of Paris and they have found that proteins that are sensitive to light very similar to the light sensitive proteins that you find in plants that can kick start chemical reactions that tell a plant when to flower or when to unfurl its leaves. They're found in our skin. Now we've known this for a long time. But what wasn't known was whether they were actually light sensitive and whether they have any function.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo what are they doing in the skin, do we know what they do there at all?\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nWell, we still don't know. This is very preliminary research and we still don't know quite why they are there, but this particular research group has discovered that they do respond to light which was something that was completely unknown. So what they did was they expressed these cryptochromes, these are light sensitive proteins, they reduce in response to light and at least they do in the plant version, so they took the proteins from human skin and also the fly version of this protein and expressed them in cells and then they exposed them to blue lights to which the plant's cryptochromes are very, very sensitive, very highly sensitive and they found, looking at them very closely with a very sensitive spectroscopic techniques, they found that indeed they do change. They photoreduce just like the plant proteins do and so what they have concluded is that there may be a function for these proteins, we may be sensing light through these proteins in our skin and that may be contributing to, say, our circadian clock, so that's the day and night rhythm that tells us when to sleep and when to be awake.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nIsn't that what eyes are for?\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nWell exactly, I mean, we know that we sense light through our eyes and that we have chemical reactions that are stimulated by proteins that are found in our retinas and we know very well that the circadian rhythms are linked very closely with those chemical reactions. So it's quite controversial, this research team haven't concluded quite what these proteins are doing, when they respond to light, just that they do and in fact we spoke to one researcher who explained that in humans who are blind and can't sense light through their eyes at all, those people don't have any body clocks, so they don't have a circadian rhythm, so we can only sense light through our eyes, this is what he was telling us. So it seems that we still haven't determined what the function of these skin cryptochromes is.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nThere was a paper in Science a few years back, where they were experimenting that the idea of shining lights into the backs of people's knees on airplanes to try to reset the body clock, so they wouldn't get jet lagged and in fact it was found to be rubbish.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nRight!\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd there is no evidence that light shown on skin can adjust the body clock, even though the paper in Science to start with, was subsequently disproved. So it sounds like this agrees with what your researcher told you.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nYeah, exactly and it still leaves these light sensitive proteins, they are a bit mysterious.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nWell, let us hope someone can shed some light on that dark mystery before too long. Thank you Victoria.\n\n(17:32 -- How mercury could be responsible for Dolphins beaching themselves)\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nWell, from a heavy question about lights to a heavy question about heavy metals, because there is a suggestion James, that this might be the reason that some animals like dolphins choose to beach themselves.\n\nInterviewee - James Mitchell Crow\n\nWell some Australian scientists have been looking at the connection between mercury poisoning and dolphins beaching themselves. And so a group at Monash University in Melbourne have looked at local pod of dolphins in Port Phillip bay just outside of the City of Melbourne and measured the mercury levels of apparently healthy dolphins swimming around in the bay and compared their levels with the dolphins who have beached themselves and subsequently died and have found that the beached dolphins have average mercury levels over twice that of the healthy dolphins.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nIs that throughout their body or are there any particular hotspots, like the brain for example, is this sort of a neurological effect?\n\nInterviewee - James Mitchell Crow\n\nYes, the levels detected would definitely have neurological effect which would likely induce confusion and disorientation. So could potentially be directly leading them to beach themselves.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo this is a, sort of, dolphin equivalent of the Mad Hatter syndrome.\n\nInterviewee - James Mitchell Crow\n\nYeah, that's right, in the particular area that these guys have been researching in Port Phillip Bay there's lot of dredging work going on at the moment in the port which is sort of stirring up the sediment and potentially increasing the mercury levels in the water. The team suggests that the likely source of the mercury was the historical gold mines dotted throughout Victoria which have gradually washed down the rivers and ended up in the bay, in the sediment and eventually through the fishes that dolphins eat, accumulate in the dolphins. The teams are going to go on and look at historical mercury levels and try and establish whether this is an increasing problem. So then the next step that these guys are going to take is to, take teeth from dolphin samples in museums and check the mercury levels there. The other benefit of using teeth is that you know exactly how old the dolphin is, so you can determine how much mercury is accumulated over its lifetime, to try and establish whether the mercury levels are increasing.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nWell let's hope it will, thanks James.\n\n(19:40 -- Malcolm Forbes, chemistry professor from the University of North Carolina, explains how chemical techniques are helping create the perfect pint)\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nNow as you put it to me almost every scientist likes beer, which is partly why you became interested in studying it and how sunlight can affect the way it tastes. Here's Malcolm Forbes.\n\nInterviewee - Malcolm Forbes\n\nI have a special technique I have developed in my lab called Time Resolved Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and it looks at fast photochemical reactions on the sub microsecond time scale that allows you to look at the structure of a free radical and the (UNCLEAR 20:06) structure looked at its reactivity, may be some of its molecular dynamics.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd what do you think is going on when beer changes flavour in this way?\n\nInterviewee - Malcolm Forbes\n\nWell, what we believe happens is the hop compound, these are called the isohumulones these are the compounds that give beer its bitter flavour. They absorb light and once they absorb light they are in a very high energy state and they break apart and they break apart into something called free radicals, which people have heard of in the cosmetics industry that are responsible for wrinkles, for example in aging free radicals play a big part of the aging process, but these radicals in beer are trapped almost immediately by sulphur sources in the beer and they make compounds called thiols and thiols are extremely stinky compound; they are found in skunks; found in cat urine and that are almost anything that smells really bad has thiols in it and humans are very sensitive to these smells. So we wanted to find out what radical exactly were being trapped by these sulphur compounds and were creating bad smells.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd so what did you do?\n\nInterviewee - Malcolm Forbes\n\nWell, Denis my collaborator at the University of Ghent sent us different types of hop compounds, some of them were of the natural variety, some that were chemically modified a little bit, the brewing industry uses to combat this problem and we put them in our spectrometer, we shined Ultraviolet light laser pulses on them and created free radicals and trapped these signals in real time and we determined their structure and we are able to say, Yes, indeed hop compounds produce free radicals and these are the radicals that are formed and this leads directly to an understanding of the mechanism, the formation of skunky beer.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo now you know this, are we, and this is the million dollar question, are we any closer to being able to stop it so that we don't have to put up with nasty smelling and nasty tasting beer?\n\nInterviewee - Malcolm Forbes\n\nYes, and I think that the answer is a natural additives to beer that can absorb the light before it reaches the hop compounds, so what you need is a compound that will have a very easy way to absorb the light and then dissipate the energy in some other way than giving it to the hop compounds and there are such additives, these are heavily guarded trade secrets in the brewing industry and the company that funded this research, The Interbrew-Baillet Latour Foundation and they are sponsored by Interbrew and they actually benefit from this because now there are beers that are sold in Beer bottles and they are not as light sensitive as other beers since they have a much longer shelf life and they don't get the bad smell when they open the beer and will last for a much longer time.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo this is almost like sun cream for beer, isn't it?\n\nInterviewee - Malcolm Forbes\n\nYeah!\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nDo you see the same chemistry happening in other things, not just beer? There must be other things like the way like the way the hops are behaving in other foodstuff which is also going to make things taste bad.\n\nInterviewee - Malcolm Forbes\n\nYes in fact anytime you have a natural foodstuff with sources of sulphur or usually amino acids like cysteine and so whenever you have a compound that makes free radicals in the sun and it is near these natural products that contain cysteine you are likely to get these thiols and I would say that almost any natural foodstuff that is left out in the sun, if the light doesn't get it, certainly oxygen will and free radicals are always responsible for the degradation and it's bad taste. There are pharmaceuticals that get bad in the sun very quickly, that's why people tell you not to keep your medications out in the sun or not to expose it to too much light because it will degrade very quickly.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nProfessor Malcolm Forbes who is from the University of North Carolina.\n\n(23:36 -- A live experiment in beer chemistry in the Chemistry World garden, and can you answer our Olympic-themed chemical conundrum?)\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nRight well we've come outside now partly because it is pretty unusual in this country to have a summer's evening where it's nice enough where we can get outside, but also to test out some of Malcolm's science for ourselves and also to have a major session by the look of it, because Victoria you've covered my table with beer bottles. So what are we going to do?\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nIt's all I promise you in the name of chemistry and we are doing an experiment in beer photochemistry. We have two bottles on the table at the moment, of beer encased in colourless glass and that's important because we've taken one of those bottles and left it on a sunny window sill for 12 hours of sunshine and the other one we have kept in this packaging and put it in the fridge. So we've one beer exposed to light and one not.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAnd for our Australian listeners I should reassure you this is nice warm beer at room temperature.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nHey, it has been under my desk all day, so it's at perfect room temperature. So we are going to see if Rich can tell the difference between the beer that's been exposed to sunlight and hopefully there has been some interesting photochemistry affecting its flavour and the beer that's been lovingly refrigerated.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo we are going to ask Richard to taste this. Let us pour Richard a beer, save some for me..\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nOkay, so this is beer #1.\n\n(Sound of beer being poured into the glass)\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nI can see you've worked in a pub Vic!

Should we pour the other one out of it now?\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nYeah!\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nJust well that one settles the five feet of head it now has..\n\n(Sound of beer being poured into the glass)\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nThat's a bit better, okay so Richard doesn't know which one is which.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nRight, that's right I hope, Okay so, we will try you on this one first. This is beer B.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nOkay Richard, you're ready?\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nI'm ready.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nIt my taste awful. I don't know.\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nI don't know. Let's try it out anyway isn't it.\n\n(Sound of Richard sipping the beer)\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nIt's so difficult. I am so used to having it without the lime. It tastes a little odd. I will tell you which one is awful when I have tasted both.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nSo beer A, and it's now finally settled so you can have the one you are supposed to have first, second.\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nRight here we go.\n\n(Sound of Richard sipping the beer)\n\nInterviewee - Richard Van Noorden\n\nI would have to say that the beer B the one I tasted first did taste a little weird compared to my normal culinary experience.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nJust to say, I did wash the glass before he tried. He has actually effectively got that right, because your beer B is one which you've got a big red \"do not drink\" sign on the bottle actually. So what's this all about?\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nSo, yes he's quite right. Beer B is the one that should taste weird and it's known as skunked because it has a compound in and that's lovingly referred to as skunky thiol. Now what's happened here is.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nNothing to do with cannabis.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\n(Laughs) Yeah. No, no, quite different. This is about alpha acids that are hop derived compounds that are in the beer and when light hits the beer, it starts a chemical reaction between the alpha acids and other molecules that would otherwise just remain in your beer and cause no harm to the beer's flavour. So, these photosensitive molecules that kick start these reactions are called flavins. Now these flavins when they are excited by light, they cleave off a side chain of these alpha acids, and then these side chains are quite reactive compounds, so they go on and react with sulphur sources in the beer to form what's called 3-methylbut-2-ene-1- thiol or MBT.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nThese are few to say.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\n(Laughs)Indeed. But it's a.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nAlso after you've had a few.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nMore commonly referred to as skunky thiol. Now it's very chemically similar to the compounds that skunks emit when they are frightened. I've never actually smelled that in my life, but I'm told by Malcolm Forbes, professor of chemistry at the University of North Carolina that this skunky thiol is in fact the exact same compound that gives cat urine its distinctive aroma.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nSo could this be one when we say the beer tastes like piss. Actually there is a real chemical basis for saying that.\n\nInterviewee - Victoria Gill\n\nYes. Exactly. That's chemically very accurate.\n\nInterviewer - Chris Smith\n\nThank you very much Vic. Well, there you have it; I'll drink the rest of the one that isn't the marked with the red \"do not drink\" sign in a minute. Talking about asking people things.

{"text": "Claim to Fame First cave documented in Colorado, in 1843. Now it may be the site of the first hydrogen sulfide-dependent animals ever discovered on land, and a link to learning about life on Mars.\n\nVisit Peek into the cave's upper room as you ski by, but don't go inside. Sulphur Cave contains deadly concentrations of gas, so entry is life-threatening and prohibited.\n\nLast fall, a small team of scientists, veteran cave explorers and a photographer gathered near a small -- and stinky -- opening on Howelsen Hill, on the outskirts of Steamboat Springs, Colo. Giant ventilation pumps whirred, pulling toxic, rotten-egg-smelling hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide out of the narrow cave so that the members of the Sulphur Cave Expedition could work their way in. For the fourth time in two years, they braved the drippy acidic atmosphere that burns holes through T-shirts and turns pennies black inside pockets. Undaunted by the slime coating every crevice, the 50-degree chill and the dark cramped spaces, the explorers were in search of something special: Worms.\n\nSulphur Cave's dark acidic spring waters hold squirming clumps of blood-red worms unlike any that have ever been discovered on land before. The team first collected the worms during its initial expedition in 2007. After finding them again a year later, one of the team leaders, Norman Pace, a University of Colorado distinguished professor in molecular, cellular and developmental biology, began to suspect their biological significance. He'd previously studied the hydrogen sulfide-eating tubeworms that live along hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The worms in this cave appeared to be thriving in similarly harsh, acidic conditions.\n\nBut it wasn't the worms that first drew scientific attention to Sulphur Cave. Veteran caver Mike Frazier, visiting Steamboat Springs on a ski trip a few years ago, observed snottites hanging inside the narrow entrance -- soft colonies of microorganisms that bear a remarkable resemblance to the gooey nose drippings for which they are named. Snottites are so rare -- there are only four other known occurrences in the world -- that Frazier and his scientific buddies quickly obtained a smattering of university and museum grants and assembled the first Sulphur Cave Expedition.\n\nAs the expedition members slithered into Sulphur Cave again last fall, Fred Luiszer, a University of Colorado, Boulder, geologist and speleologist, lurked at the entrance to monitor gas concentrations. He measured hydrogen sulfide at 325 parts per million; the federal standard for maximum daily exposure is 10 parts per million. Carbon dioxide stood at 20.8 percent -- four times the level that will kill you. Team members donned respirators before venturing to the back of the cave.\n\nPhotographer Norman Thompson captured Sulphur Cave's beauty -- the intricate masses of biological life on the cave walls that resemble the folds of brain coral; lacy ceiling gypsum crystals that glitter like starbursts; small yellowish stalactites and stalagmites clinging to the walls and floor. Thompson also documented team members squeezing through dark claustrophobic spaces encrusted with biological goo: \"It looked like about 10 people had thrown up on them. And that's how they smelled, too.\"\n\nThe team collected more of the pencil-lead-thin worms, and a month later, DNA analysis confirmed their genetic uniqueness. Sulphur Cave's worms may be the first hydrogen-sulfide metabolizing organisms ever discovered on land, where they'll be much easier to study than 14,000 feet below the surface of the ocean. This tiny, often-overlooked cave gives scientists an easily accessible location to learn about the kind of environment, and possibly the organisms, that may exist on Mars or the moons of Jupiter.\n\n\"On other planets, those animals are probably going to be bacteria or bacteria-like, and they're probably going to be living in environments similar to this,\" Luiszer says. \"By studying those things here on Earth, it's going to be a lot easier for (scientists) to figure out where to look for life and what kind of equipment and instruments we'll need.\"\n\nTeam member Hazel Barton, costar of the IMAX film Journey Into Amazing Caves, took some of the light-sensitive worms back to her Northern Kentucky University lab for study. She's hoping to determine exactly how the worms, or possibly their bacteria, draw hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to live on. \"This is the only habitat for (these worms),\" she says. \"The next closest thing is diving two miles to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. This is a world-class site.\"\n\nAs a chemistry and geology student, this is immensely interesting! I was recently told by a professor that the biosphere is now thought to extend up to 10km into the the lithosphere - this article is awesome evidence. Thanks for covering biogeochemistry"}
{"text": "Yes, there are some links to Higgs boson-related articles in this blog post. And we're also going to Lindau, Germany for the 62nd Lindau Meeting. But there's more: the largest meteorite crater has been found, science behind record-breaking heat, bears behave differently when hunters are on their trail\u2026\n\nLet's go!\n\nTwo pieces from Douglas Main, science writer, for OurAmazingPlanet featured here. In an article picked up by the Knight Science Journalism Tracker, Douglas writes about the discovery of possibly the oldest and largest meteorite crater on Earth. In another article, he dives into the science behind the unusually hot temperatures across the US. currently measures about 62 miles (100 kilometers) from one side to another. But before it eroded, it was likely more than 310 miles (500 km) wide, which would make it the biggest on Earth, Garde told OurAmazingPlanet.\n\nHeat is beating records around the country: the first five months of 2012 have been the hottest on record in the contiguous United States. And that's not including June, when 164 all-time high temperature records were tied or broken around the country, according to government records. That's unusual, since the most intense heat usually comes in July and August for much of the country, said Jake Crouch, a climate scientist with National Climatic Data Center. For example, only 47 all-time high records were tied or broken in June of last year.\n\nRachel Nuwer, freelance journalist, has a fascinating post in The New York Times' Green blog about bear psychology, if you will. More specifically, Rachel writes about a research carried out in Sweden which speculates that bears alter their behaviour when they know humans are on their trail. I do tend to agree with this comment left on the blog post: \"This is not in any way to demean the science that is the basis for this article but just how stupid do we think these animals are?\"\n\nAlpha predators like bears, wolves and mountain lions are used to calling the shots in nature. But when humans arrive with guns and hounds, this hierarchy is displaced in more ways than one. Obviously, hunting costs animal lives, but some researchers also speculate that a hunter's presence reverberates in other ways, too, changing the behavior of these large carnivorous quarry. In other words, predators know they're being hunted.\n\nAn interesting blog post by science blogger, Kyle Hill, at the James Randi Educational Foundation blog, in which Kyle argues that skeptics should wash off the \"cynic\" moniker to be even more effective against the likes of pseudoscience.Donna Belder, science blogger, asks how come kangaroos are able to jump around all day, while other animals prefer to walk or run. On Scitable's Student Voices blog.\n\nUntil a recent zoology class, I had never really given much thought as to why different animals move the way they do. For instance, what is it that makes some animals amazing runners over long distances? Why are some fantastic sprinters but wear themselves out after a short time in action? The question that really got my attention, though, was this one: what on earth could make kangaroos abandon running altogether and start mimicking pogo sticks? Kangaroos (genus Macropus) are famous for being ridiculously good at jumping, and they do it so effortlessly that you have to wonder what their secret is. Try jumping around hurriedly for a bit and you'll soon find you suck at it (yeah, I've tried). Not only will you get tired after about 5 minutes, but the fact that you don't have a tail to balance yourself means that you will probably face-plant before the 5 minutes are even up. Jumping just doesn't work for us, or most other animals for that matter. So what is the big secret?\n\nThe 62nd Lindau Meeting is currently underway and a team of bloggers currently at Lindau, has been busy blogging the meeting away. Here are two great posts by Kelly Oakes and Alexander Bastidas Fry:\n\n\"By their very nature, those discoveries that most change the way we think about nature cannot be anticipated.\" This was Douglas Osheroff's claim at the start of his lecture on Wednesday morning, where he promised to tell the young researchers at Lindau \"how advances in science are made\". In his talk Osheroff offered five things that scientists should keep in mind if they want make a discovery. One example that Osheroff used to illustrate these points was the discovery of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson. It earned them the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978, and provided evidence for an expanding universe that started with a big bang.\n\nTomorrow physicists working at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will make an announcement and while we don't know exactly what the will announce there is good reason to speculate it will be the discovery of the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson is a particle which mediates the interaction of all matter with the Higgs field which in turn gives all particles mass. The Higgs is the origin of mass in the standard model of physics.\n\nSpeaking of the Higgs boson, the news of its possible discovery on Wednesday did not leave the young science writers unmoved. Charles Ebikeme, blogging at Australian Science, summarises the news while Natalie Wolchover, writing at Life's Little Mysteries, attempts to explain what the elusive Higgs is all about with a twist:\n\nWhen Peter Higgs steps out onto the tarmac at an airport near the franco-swiss border, it will probably be with equal parts trepidation and elation. CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, and the world's leading laboratory for particle physics, is to hold a scientific seminar on July 4th, with Peter Higgs in attendance, to deliver the latest update in the search for the Higgs boson \u2014 the famed \"God Particle\".\n\nPhysicists at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) say they've discovered a new \"Higgs-like\" particle: a bundle of energy that has most of the trappings of the long-sought Higgs boson. They're not naming the newcomer outright, because there are subtle indications that the particle may not, in fact, be the plain old Higgs itself, but rather a close doppelganger. Don't let that disappoint you. To the contrary, Harvey Newman, a high-energy physicist at the California Institute of Technology and a member of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment (one of two LHC experiments that discovered the new particle), said finding a more exotic variety of Higgs boson is actually \"one of the most exciting things that can happen.\" Here's why.\n\nBefore you go reading all those wonderful stories above, here's something you can do for The SA Incubator and the young and early-career science writers. If you like The SA Incubator, do tell us who you are by leaving a comment here. Knowing who our readers are will help us better promote the young voices out there.

The achievement could free NASA to focus on designing spacecraft that can leave low-earth orbit while private companies focus on ferrying supplies and humans to the space station and other nearby targets. Last week, the company successfully tested its reuseable Grasshopper rocket to a height of about 12 stories. If successful, the rocket could greatly reduce the cost of spaceflight.\n\nOcean Exploration: In March, Avatar and Titanic director James Cameron became the first human to reach the Mariana Trench\u2014the deepest known part of the ocean\u2014in a solo mission. Cameron became the first human to explore the nearly 7-mile-deep trench since Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard took the trip in 1960.\n\nDriverless Cars: Nevada, Florida, and California all passed laws allowing self-driving cars on their roads. Internet giant Google has been extensively testing its autonomous car and has driven more than 300,000 miles without incident.\n\nDiamond Planet: Scientists discovered a \"carbon-rich\" exoplanet in October\u2014which turns out to be very hot, perfect for turning carbon into diamonds. The so-called \"diamond planet\" is 40 light-years from earth and is twice earth's size\u2014but because of its diamonds, the planet is more than eight times earth's mass. According to an analysis by Forbes, the planet is likely worth $26.9 nonillion dollars, which is $26.9 followed by 30 zeros\u2014or enough to finally put this fiscal cliff issue to bed for millions of years.\n\nAntarctic Exploration: This year was a big one for Antarctic exploration\u2014after more than a decade of drilling, Russian scientists bored through more than 2.5 miles of ice to reach Lake Vostok's liquid waters. Preliminary tests for life there didn't turn up much, but in Western Antarctica, a team of American researchers found life in the subfreezing waters of Lake Vida. That discovery suggests that life could potentially survive in seemingly inhospitable environments in space.\n\nControversial Flu Research: In June, researchers in the Netherlands and Wisconsin published a highly controversial study of the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus in which they were able to genetically modify the virus to be transmittable between mammals. The newly-created virus has been called \"scarier than anthrax\" and led the World Health Organization to call for a moratorium on synthetic flu virus research.\n\nNew Skydiving Record: After years of false starts and delays, Austrian skydiver Felix Baumgartner broke the 50-year-old skydiving record when he jumped from a capsule more than 24 miles above Earth's surface. In doing so, he became the first human to break the sound barrier outside of an aircraft and proved the effectiveness of the full-body pressure suit, which could one day help astronauts survive if they have to abort a mission.\n\nAntibiotic-resistant Superbugs: Both the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization warned that gonorrhea could soon join HIV as an \"uncurable\" disease as the bacteria is quickly developing resistance to most known antibiotics. The disease is estimated to infect more than 100 million people per year and can cause infertility, painful urination, and birth defects in babies born to women with the disease.\n\nHiggs Boson: On July 4, scientists at Europe's CERN announced they'd found a particle that could be the famous \"Higgs boson\" particle, which is believed to be responsible for all mass in the universe. The discovery of the particle has been called the \"final missing ingredient in the Standard Model of particle physics,\" which is used to describe every known thing in the visible universe.\n\n\"We have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature,\" CERN Director General Rolf Heuer said of the discovery.\n\nCuriosity\n\nAnd one major disappointment:\n\nTransatlantic Travel: Much of the world watched in August as the Air Force tested its X-51A Waverider, a hypersonic, unmanned aircraft that would be able to reach speeds of more than 4,500 miles per hour\u2014fast enough to cross the Atlantic in an hour.

What might NOT be readily apparent is that this lake is underwater.\n\nOff of the coast of the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula, in the Gulf of Mexico, there exist a number of undersea brine lakes. Way back in the Jurassic, the Gulf of Mexico was a shallow, mineral-rich sea. For a time, it was cut off from the ocean and dried up, leaving loads of salt deposits behind. Many years later, as the ocean reformed and the geography continued to evolve, we were left with the Gulf that we see today.\n\nBut much of that salt remains buried deep under ocean sediments. When it is exposed, super-salty brines are formed, far saltier than seawater. And just like the deadly brinicles that send starfish scurrying for their lives beneath the Antarctic ice, these super-concentrated salty pools are denser and heavier than the seawater around them. So they \"sink\", forming lakes within the ocean devoid of all but microbial life, slowly lapping salty waves onto the ocean shore around themFly through the latest release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, with images of 200 million galaxies.

Has anyone been successfully revived from cryonic suspension?\nNo. Fortunately, successful cryonics is a two-step process:\n(1) put the patient in suspension and\n(2) revive the patient from suspension\nFor cryonic suspension to be worthwhile, we only need to master\nstep (1) right now and have reasonable expectation that we might\nmaster step (2) later.\n2-2. What advances need to be made before people frozen now have a chance\nof being revived?\nA number of advances in basic areas of research such as medicine,\nmicrobiology, engineering, and information sciences are required\nbefore any serious attempt can be made to revive patients suspended\nwith current technology. Nanotechnology, the design and fabrication\nof molecular scale machines, is an emerging technology that will\nprobably be both necessary and sufficient for revival.\n2-3. Is there any government or university supported research on cryonics\nspecifically?\nThere was suspended animation research sponsored by NASA as late as\n1979 at the University of Louisville, Kentucky.\n2-4. What is the procedure for freezing people?\nRead an account of a cryonic suspension. Briefly, circulation is\nrestored by CPR, and the blood is replaced by other substances that\nprevent blood clots and bacteria growth and decrease freezing damage.\nAs this happens the body is cooled as quickly as possible to slightly\nabove 0 degrees C. After the blood has been replaced the body is\ncooled more slowly to liquid nitrogen temperatures.\n2-5. How can one get a more detailed account of a suspension?\nCryomsgs 601 and 602 is The Transport of Patient A-1312 (28K bytes)\nand cryomsgs 696, 697, and 698 are The Neurosuspension of Patient\nA-1260. (35K bytes). These messages give a first-hand description\nof the initial stages of two suspensions.\n2-6. Is there damage from oxygen deprivation during a suspension?\nNot if the suspension happens under good circumstances. One of the\nbig goals of the suspension procedure is to get the HLR machine onto\nthe patient as soon as possible, to prevent this damage. The\nbarbiturates they give reduce brain metabolism, as does cooling. In a\nwell done suspension, the damage from oxygen deprivation should be\nminor. In a more perfect world, the suspension procedure would be\nable to start before legal death, which should reduce the damage from\nischemia even more because there wouldn't be any time when the\nheart is stopped and the body is warm.\n2-7. Do memories require an ongoing metabolism to support them, like RAM in\na computer?\nNot long term memories. When children nearly drown in cold water,\nthey can often be revived after having no apparent metabolism and\nstill have their memories. Likewise large doses of barbiturates can\nsuppress all measurable brain waves without destroying long term\nmemories.\n2-8. If these frozen people are revived, will it be easy to cure them of\nwhatever disease made them clinically die?\nRepairing the freezing damage looks much harder than curing any\nexisting disease, so if revival is possible then curing the disease\nought to be trivial. This doesn't include diseases that lose\ninformation in the brain, such as Alzheimer's, mental retardation, or\nbrain tumors; in these cases, even if the disease were cured and the\nperson revived, the problem of replacing the lost information looks\nhard.\n2-9. If I'm frozen and then successfully revived, will my body be old?\nNo. Old age is a disease that ought to be easier to cure than the\nfreezing damage.\n2-10. Why is freezing in liquid nitrogen better than other kinds of\npreservation, such as drying or embalming?\nStraightforward chemical arguments lead to the conclusion that\nsignificant amounts of decomposition do not occur at liquid nitrogen\ntemperatures. (See Hugh Hixon's article \"How Cold Is Cold Enough?\"\nfrom *Cryonics* magazine, January, 1985, or fetch cryomsg 0015.)\nThis isn't true for either dried or embalmed tissue kept at room\ntemperature.\nAlso, Alcor and Trans Time have done experiments with dogs that\ndemonstrate that part of the suspension process does not cause\ndamage. Dogs have been anesthetized, perfused with a blood\nsubstitute, and cooled to slightly above 0 C for several hours.\nAfter rewarming and replacing the original blood, the dogs revived\nwith no obvious brain damage. Experiments like this cannot be done\nwith drying or embalming.\nAnother option that may become possible in the future is vitrification.\n2-11. What is vitrification?\n(Next paragraph copied from CRYOMSG 6)\nThe cover article of the Aug. 29, 1987 issue of Science News describes\nvitrification, which achieves cooling to a glassy state without the\nwater crystallizing into ice. The advantage of this is that the cells\ndo not suffer the mechanical damage from the crystallization. The\nmain disadvantage is that the concentration of cryoprotectants\nrequired to achieve this is toxic. It is also, currently, a\ntechnically difficult and expensive process requiring computer control\nof cooling rates, perfusion, etc. The March, 1988 issue of Cryonics\nmagazine (\"The Future of Medicine\", Part 2 of 2) suggests that\nvitrification may not be needed for ordinary organ banking, since\nother, cheaper methods may be good enough. For tissues and cells,\nthough, it has a lot of promise for the commercial market. Thus,\ncommercial research into vitrification may stop short of what is\nneeded for making it viable for preservation of large organs or whole\nbodies required by cryonics.\n2-12. How is the baboon? Did it live? Any brain damage?\nAccording to Art Quaife as of 14 Jul 92, the baboon is well and has\nno signs of brain damage.\nThis is part of what CRYOMSG 865 has to say about the baboon:\nBerkeley, California, May 29 1992. BioTime Inc. has, for the first\ntime, successfully revived a baboon following a procedure in which\nthe animal's deep body temperature was lowered to near-freezing and\nits blood was replaced with BioTime's patent-pending blood-\nsubstitute solution.\nThe animal was anesthetized, immersed in ice and cooled to below 2\ndegrees Celsius, using the BioTime solution with cardiopulmonary\nbypass procedures. After being bloodless and below 10 degrees\nCentigrade for 55 minutes, the animal was rewarmed and revived. The\nbaboon is presently under study by BioTime scientists to determine any\nlong-term physical effects.\nThe company intends to conduct further experiments on primates, using\nits blood-substitute solutions.\n2-13. Who has successfully kept dogs cold for hours? Did they survive? Any\nbrain damage?\nSeveral people have achieved that. The first cryonics organization to\ndo so was Alcor, in the mid 1980's. For example, the Jan. 1986 issue\nof Cryonics magazine describes, in the article \"Dixie's Rebirthday\", a\nGerman Shepherd dog named Dixie who \"experienced the privilege (and\nthe peril) of having all her blood washed out and replaced with a\nsynthetic solution and then being cooled to 4 C. For four hours she\nwas held at this temperature: stiff, cold, with eyes flattened out,\nbrain waves stopped, and heart stilled. Then, she was reperfused with\nblood, warmed up and restored to life and health.\" She made a total\nrecovery. Several variations, with different perfusates and slightly\ndifferent temperatures and/or times were also performed by Alcor.\nLater, ACS performed a similar experiment on a beagle named Miles and\nrecently (1992) BioTime successfully cooled and revived a baboon.\nIn comparison, hypothermic cardiac surgery was pioneered on humans\ndecades ago, although the temperatures used were not nearly as low as\nin the dog experiments above. More recently, the October 1988 issue\nof The Immortalist described successful surgery on a brain aneurysm in\nwhich the patient was cooled to 15 C for almost an hour. During that\ntime the patient's blood remained drained from the body, there was no\nrespiration, the heart did not beat, and the brain barely functioned.\n2-14. Who froze the roundworms? What happened?\n(This text is quoted from CRYOMSG 790)\nGerry Arthus, our New York Coordinator, has announced preliminary\nresults of an experiment which was designed to investigate whether\nmemories will survive cryonic suspension.\nFor his experiment, Gerry used Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode\n(tiny worm) that's one of the simplest living creatures. It has a\ncomplete nervous system, however, and can be \"trained\" in a\nrudimentary way. Worms that are raised in a warm environment will\n\"remember\" it and will prefer it if they are given the choice.\nConversely, worms that were raised in a cooler area will tend to\nprefer that environment.\nGerry placed a small number of worms in a cryoprotective solution and\nfroze them to -80 degrees Celsius for two hours. After he revived the\nworms, the ones that survived the experience still \"remembered\" their\nformer environmental preferences. So far as we know, this is the\nworld's first experiment designed to verify that memory is chemically\nencoded and will survive the freezing process.\nThe sample that Gerry used is too small to prove anything\nconclusively. Soon, however, Gerry hopes to repeat the experiment with\na larger sample. He also intends to devise tests to eliminate the\npossibility that the worms changed physiologically to adapt themselves\nto warmer or cooler environments.\n2-15. What were the circumstances under which cat brains produced\nnormal-looking brain waves after being frozen?\nThis was reported by I. Suda and A.C. Kito in Nature, 212, 268-270 (1966).\nThe cat brains were perfused with 15% glycerol and cooled to -20 C\nfor five days and, upon rewarming and perfusion with fresh blood,\nshowed normal brain function (as measured by EEG). Since this experiment\nwas done so long ago, and technology has improved considerably since\nthen, there is some interest in redoing these experiments to see how\nwell we can do now.\nThe April 1992 Cryonics, volume 13 number 4 page 4, talks more about\nthis and gives more references. Appendix B of CRFT talks about the\nplausibility of repair in general.\n2-16. Would it be possible to use some improvement on modern CAT or MRI\nscanners to infer enough about the structure of a brain to reconstruct\nthe memories and personality?\nThis was discussed on the cryonics mailing list some time back. The\nconclusion was that using radiation to infer the structure of the\nneurons in a brain in a reasonable amount of time would require enough\nradiation to vaporize that brain. Then the discussion moved on to\nnuclear-bomb x-ray holography devices in outer space that record the\nresults on film that has to be moving by at an astronomical speed so\nit doesn't get caught in the blast. Cremation and immortality, all in\none convenient package. I find nanotechnology-based approaches more\nbelievable, albeit less spectacular.\nTo read about this yourself, fetch articles from the cryonet archive\nwith the words \"brain scan\" in the subject. There are 18 as of July\n30, 1992. See the \"What is a cryomsg?\" question below."}

{"text": "Flawless evolution at work (unfortunately, it doesn't have a species bias).\n\nIn the 1980's, cockroaches in a Florida 'test kitchen' mysteriously defeated a poison bait that had, up until then, worked. Researchers eventually discovered that many of the roaches had lost their sweet tooth, and in just five years, the trait became so widespread that the bait was rendered useless.\n\nA study published Thursday explains the genetic mutation that allowed this to happen. In \"normal\" cockroaches, glucose excites neurons that tell the brain the food is \"sweet\". However, in mutated cockroaches, glucose not only activates the \"sweet\" neuron, but another that tells it \"yuck\". The \"yuck\" neuron overpowers the signal from the \"sweet\" neurons, so the brain gets the message that the food tastes awful.\n\n\"A team of researchers in the Canadian Arctic is reporting on an interesting find: bacteria that thrive at \u201315 degrees Celsius. That is the coldest environment bacteria have ever been found to grow in.\"\n\nPlanococcus halocryophilus, whichmakes its home in the tiny veins of salt water in the arctic permafrost, can grow and survive in temperatures as low as -25 degrees celsius.\n\nWhy are scientists so interested? Well, aside from how amazing this discovery is on its own, it also has major implications for the search for bacteria on Mars and Saturn's moon Enceladus. Both mars, and its moon, may have similar habitats to the one this bacteria has made its arctic home.\n\nLately, these shows have also filmed killing of wolverines, lynx, grizzly bears, rattle snakes, and crocodiles for no reason other than ratings. The wolf, above, was no threat to Tanana. The show exploits viewer's naivete about guns by shooting this animal with an AR-15 semi-automatic gun. That's not how Alaskans hunt, they use hunting rifles, not assault weapons that look good on camera. In fact, Alaskan outdoorsmen and women are appalled at this blatant exploitation of both the animal and the audience. There is no need for this.\n\nMy point is that we are at a critical time in human history. Species are going extinct at a rapid pace, science education is under attack from aging politicians, and young people are generally experiencing nature less and less.\n\nI am genuinely worried about the future of this country's environmental leadership. Federal conservation programs, which have taken decades to create, are weakening. The ethic of conservationism (a conservative ethos) is dwindling. Young people are being pulled in the direction of technology, and away from grandeur, away from fresh air and nature.\n\nIt seems to me that one important aspect of this messy new milieu are education based TV companies who heretofore have been untouched by healthy criticism.\n\nI think it's time to analyze the impact of these shows. I believe that the Discovery Channel et al are not contributing to a healthy planet nor are they assisting educating viewers. It seems to me they are mastering fear for short term gain and profits. If I am correct, and I believe I am, these companies need to stop and focus on their mission, which is non-fiction, education-based media - not sensationalism or harm."}

{"text": "[In] common table salt, or NaCl[,] one of the elements is a metal, and the other is a poisonous gas.\n\nKarl F. Kuhn, Basic Physics: A Self-Teaching Guide\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nThat is a simple example of why it's important to have at least a basic understanding of chemical compositions, if not simply the scientific literacy and common sense to research them when it matters \u2014\n\nFor example, prior to using the word \"chemicals\" as if they're all equally poisonous, and not the constituents of everything in our reality,\n\nAnd, prior to touting \"Natural\" and Organic products without understanding that a \"natural\" formula may be no better than an artificially-created one,\n\nAnd, prior to eschewing all types of a compound (for example, sulphates in hair products) without really grasping that [sulphate] compounds are different from one-another, and that if one type is hazardous to your health, it does not mean that all types are. [I actually don't know whether all sulphate-based additions are or not, but it's important to research.]\n\nOrganic compounds of unexpected complexity exist throughout the universe, Prof. Sun Kwok and Dr. Yong Zhang of the University of Hong Kong have discovered, suggesting that complex organic compounds can be synthesized in space even when no life forms are present.\n\nThe organic substance they found contains a mixture of aromatic (ring-like) and aliphatic (chain-like) components that are so complex, their chemical structures resemble those of coal and petroleum. Since coal and oil are remnants of ancient life, this type of organic matter was thought to arise only from living organisms.\n\nProfessor Lee Cronin, Gardiner Chair of Chemistry in the College of Science and Engineering, and his team have demonstrated a new way of making inorganic-chemical-cells or iCHELLS.\n\nProf Cronin said: \"All life on earth is based on organic biology (i.e. carbon in the form of amino acids, nucleotides, and sugars etc) but the inorganic world is considered to be inanimate.\n\n\"What we are trying do is create self-replicating, evolving inorganic cells that would essentially be alive. You could call it inorganic biology.\"\n\n\u2026\n\n\"Bacteria are essentially single-cell micro-organisms made from organic chemicals, so why can't we make micro-organisms from inorganic chemicals and allow them to evolve?\n\n\"If successful this would give us some incredible insights into evolution and show that it's not just a biological process. It would also mean that we would have proven that non carbon-based life could exist and totally redefine our ideas of design.\"\n\nThese home-made aliens might be able to provide us with tangible evidence that our idea of \"being\" should be reconstructed, from the paper-doll view we have of \"things\" as isolated forms, to a systemic fluidity.\n\nOr so it seems! So I am back from Cancun, but as I was packing up to leave last Saturday I was having a problem with my eyeliner. It would not sharpen and kept breaking. I got frustrated as anyone would at 3am and just grabbed an eyeliner I used to use. I knew it was only about 4 months old and\u2026\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nI also use organic products, especially liner, but it's probably more from caution/belief than evidence\u2026 whatever one experiences from a subjective point of view, even/especially in a case of \"self-study\" like this one, might not be entirely reliable. If you pursue this question, it would be great to see some exploration done in a scientific, methodical way. Is it correlation or causation? Is it to do with organic ingredients, or simply a \"natural\" chemistry (fruit, etc. as opposed to man-made). Is it perhaps an allergic reaction particular to you? How would test groups respond?\n\nIf anyone knows of controlled studies about this, it would also be helpful.\n\nFor a time it was believed that the substances which are associated with living things were so marvelous that they could not be made by hand, from inorganic materials. This is not at all true \u2014 they are just the same as the substances made in inorganic chemistry, but more complicated arrangements of atoms are involved.\n\nRichard Feynman, Six Easy Pieces, Ch. 3: The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, 49\n\nA new study from Cornell University graduate student Jenny Wan-chen Lee [pdf] either shows that the label \"organic\" creates some sort of placebo effect in which people are convinced they're eating healthier, or that people can be really stupid. Maybe it's a little of both? In her study, 144 volunteers were asked to compare \"organic\" and \"regular\" samples of yogurt, cookies and potato chips, rating them on taste, estimated fat content and estimated calorie content. However, all of the samples were in fact \"organic.\" Take a wild guess what happened.\n\nVolunteers almost unanimously preferred the taste of the perceived \"organic\" samples, which they believed to be more nutritious and worth more money. And these perceptions were consistent across all the samples.\n\nSo far, every re-post of this has been comment-less, or along the lines of \"ORGANIC IS DUMB\", or has only addressed this particular aspect of organic foods (unhealthy foods with a green label) while making the argument that it applies to all organic foods. So much fallacy up in here.\n\nYes, maybe they could have used a more fitting word to begin with. But \"organic\", in this context, does mean \"healthy-naturally-grown-without-pesticides-or-chemical-stimulants foods\", so the biochemistry textbook definition is irrelevant.\n\nOnly nicolenaddy has mentioned health as it applies to the wider subject:\n\n\"\u2026Eating fresh and local food is good. \u2026 But the top consumer nation in the world allowing their food industry to serve them food covered in poison, the WORST. Until the 20th century food was all grown organically. Big business and capitalism changed the industry. \u2026\"\n\nThe point of eating organic or using organic body-related products is not about feeling virtuous, not about taste (though I have to say, there are some foods that taste like shit when conventional, like strawberries and apples) and not as much about the environment as it is about an individual's health. At least, that's the hope.\n\nSo no, \"organic\" mac & cheese, sodas, chips, whatever\u2026 are not any better for you than regular. But let's not stretch the \"organic labels suck & people are stupid, lololol\" argument beyond the organic-coke context (which is what's happening).\n\nI would rather not have my produce covered in pesticides (you can't just \"wash it off\" \u2014 produce has pores, that shit sinks in) and even though the neighboring farmer's sprays might land on the organic crops, at least it's a little bit less than direct sprays.\n\nLikewise, there's some commentary on body products:\n\n\"They do this for shampoo. People pay out the ass for expensive, organic shampoo but its really just normal shampoo in a green bottle plus $10.\"\n\nThere's some truth to the above, but there is a difference between buying natural products for the body as opposed to regular brands. Human skin absorbs whatever goes on it quickly, even faster than through digestion. For that reason, it's a healthier option to choose brands that don't litter their products with chemicals known to be associated with various ailments. That doesn't mean to trust all green labels and spit out cash for organic \u2014 just know your ingredients:\n\nNow, all that being addressed, there is a lot of BS that goes on: non-organics being mislabeled, hopelessly high prices, crop maintenance issues, cognitive biases, misnomers, & the fact that the American FDA approves just about anything.\n\nIt's difficult, but awareness is necessary. It may not be the case now, but it would be great if everyone had the ability to choose inputs which are more agreeable with human body-systems. It's something to work towards.\n\nNow if anyone (especially the resident MDs) cares to offer counterpoints, please do.\n\nfreshphotons: The transparent shells of tiny Cypridina hilgendorfii, found in the coastal waters and sands of Japan, hold a creature that emits a luminous blue substance when disturbed.

I'm filching the nice caption explaining the life cycle of the organisms that cause malaria, Plasmodium spp. Plasmodium is a protozoa that requires mosquitoes to be vectors to spread the organism and needs them (as well as the human) to go through the life cycle and multiply. Mosquito nets can be extremely helpful in areas with malaria to reduce exposure to mosquitoes. I also remember when we learned about sickle cell anemia in various classes in vet school that sickle cell anemia is prevalent in people who live in areas (or have ancestry) where malaria is prevalent. The Plasmodium organism can't live in a sickled red blood cell and I remember hearing about it being an adaptation (albeit not a good adaptation) to the disease. That kind of not so great adaptation is thought to be behind cystic fibrosis which is a mutation of a chloride channel in the cell (and is prevalent in people who live or have ancestry in places where cholera is/was endemic). I could say more but then I'll never publish this post and instead frantically keep trying to edit the draft and then finally give up.\n\nThe P.vivax life cycle involves two hosts. During a blood meal, a malaria-infected female Anopheles mosquito inoculates sporozoites into the human host (1). Sporozoites infect liver cells (2) and either enter a dormant hypnozoite state or mature into schizonts (3), which rupture and release merozoites (4). After this initial replication in the liver (exo-erythrocytic schizogony A), the parasites undergo asexual multiplication in the erythrocytes (erythrocytic schizogony B). Merozoites infect red blood cells (5). The ring stage trophozoites mature into schizonts, which rupture releasing merozoites (6). Some parasites differentiate into sexual erythrocytic stages (gametocytes) (7). Blood stage parasites are responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease.\n\nThe gametocytes, male (microgametocytes) and female (macrogametocytes), are ingested by an Anopheles mosquito during a blood meal (8). The parasites' multiplication in the mosquito is known as the sporogonic cycle (C). While in the mosquito's stomach, the microgametes penetrate the macrogametes generating zygotes (9). The zygotes in turn become motile and elongated (ookinetes) (10) which invade the midgut wall of the mosquito where they develop into oocysts (11). The oocysts grow, rupture, and release sporozoites (12), which make their way to the mosquito's salivary glands. Inoculation of the sporozoites (1) into a new human host perpetuates the malaria life cycle. (via Plasmodium vivax)\n\nThe life cycle of the parasite Toxoplasma gondii goes like this: Toxoplasma reproduces inside the intestine of a cat, which sheds the parasite in its feces. Rats then ingest the parasite when they consume food or water contaminated with cat feces. The parasite takes up residence in the rat's brain and, once the rat gets eaten by a cat, it starts the cycle all over again.\n\nResearchers have known for a few years that a rat infected with Toxoplasma loses its natural response to cat urine and no longer fears the smell. And they know that the parasite settles in the rat's amygdala, the part of the brain that processes fear and emotions. Now a new study in the journal PLoS ONE adds another bizarre piece to the tale: When male rats infected with Toxoplasma smell cat urine, they have altered activity in the fear part of the brain as well as increased activity in the part of the brain that is responsible for sexual behavior and normally activates after exposure to a female rat.\n\nThe double messages of \"you smell a cat but he's not dangerous\" and \"that cat is a potential mate\" lure the rat into the kitty's deadly territory, just what the parasite needs to reproduce. Scientists still don't know how the parasite works to alter the brain, though there apparently is a link to production of dopamine, an important neurotransmitter in the systems for decision-making and reward.\n\nThese are skeletons of victims of the Black Death from East Smithfield, London. Scientists have extracted fragments of bubonic plague DNA from their teeth. Fragments of 700-year-old DNA from the bug responsible for the Black Death have been pulled from the teeth of four plague victims buried in east London. Scientists used the degraded strands to reconstruct the entire genetic code of the deadly bacterium. It is the first time experts have succeeded in drafting the genome of an ancient pathogen, or disease-causing agent. The researchers found that a specific strain of the plague bug Yersinia pestis caused the pandemic that killed 100 million Europeans - between 30% and 50% of the total population - in just five years between 1347 and 1351.

The details are vague, but in this particular case, the Korean-language report (which is more detailed than the supposed English translation) says, that South Korean officials inspected packages mailed from China to Chinese expats in South Korea. The problem is, that the article claims that South Korean officials can inspect the pills using their senses, not chemical analysis, because whatever the substance is, it's mixed with traditional herbs. The article in Korean and English mention, if \"Baby\" means placenta or actual deceased persons.\n\nI've heard urban legends like this above-quoted article mentions. I've also heard of black markets for body parts in decades past. My South Korean wife claims Chinese medical expats resort to this questionable remedies once they have exhausted conventional treatment for cancer and have learned the prognosis is terminal.\n\nI also will stipulate that diplomatic relations between China and Korea are strained, because of incursions by Chinese fishermen into Korean waters in the Yellow Sea resulting in the deaths and injury of South Korean maritime officials and North Korea. Koreans and Chinese (and Japanese) trade nationalist slurs readily. But, what I find most disturbing is, that the only inspection done on these capsules is human. It's not uncommon for South Koreans to make scientific claims using informed language with \"experts\" in white coats and other bureaucratic officials, and then follow with heart-rending tales from laypeople.\n\nOn the 48 frames per second stuff, it's kind of sad that a defect (a slow frame rate) has now been taken by some to be a virtue.

Any movie maker who wants to retain that unique 'film' look (largely established by barely subliminal frame judder) can easily do so with a 48fps production system. Just choose 24fps!

Each time they woke, the participants were asked what they were dreaming about. From these accounts, the researchers picked out common themes, and created a list of pictures which represented the common categories (i.e. cars, computers etc.). Then, participants were asked to go back in the scanner, and look at the list of images.\n\nBy comparing the data from the first scan with the second, the researchers identified patterns in the electrical activity. The areas this activity was found in are three key brain areas that process visual information from our eyes.\n\nDr. Katamani, who led the study, said \"Using a database of picture-elicited brain activity and a pattern recognition algorithm, we can read out, or decode, what a person might be seeing from brain scans during dreaming\".\n\nNASA is underfunded.

{"text": "Life and left-handed meteorites\n\nI wonder if Empress Gensho, who ruled Japan for nine years and died in 748, had something against left-handed people.\n\nIt was Gensho who decreed that kimono should be worn migi-mae (right side over the left at the front) rather than hidari-mae (left over right), as was the style until then. Now only the dead have hidari-mae kimono, so it's not done to wear one like that.\n\n(Once when I wore a yukata the wrong way, a Japanese colleague said to me, \"Are you dead?\" It took me a while before I understood what he was on about.)\n\nThe kimono custom comes to mind because I was reading this week about how the building blocks of life \u2014 amino acids \u2014 are predominantly \"left-handed.\" In the case of kimono-wearing, it was Empress Gensho who, long ago, caused the dominant form to be one particular side over the other. This was just chance; she might have decreed it the other way around. With amino acids, it seems to have been meteorites which fell to Earth billions of years ago that decreed it.\n\nChains of amino acids make up the proteins found in all forms of life on Earth, from plants to people. The funny thing about amino acids is that they come in two versions, a left and right form, just as hands come in a left and right form. Anything that is not identical to its mirror image in this way is called \"chiral.\"\n\nAlmost all living things have left-handed amino acids, known as L amino acids (some bacteria have right-handed, or D, amino acids). Change L-type for D-type, and life would grind to a halt.\n\nSo why do most amino acids come in the left-handed form?\n\nThe immediate answer is: because they arrived from outer space like that.\n\nThis week, Ronald Breslow, of Columbia University, New York, described his evidence for this idea. Amino acids can form spontaneously wherever you get the right chemicals. When this happens in space \u2014 say on asteroids \u2014 equal amounts of left- and right-handed forms are made.\n\nBut asteroids roam across great distances of interstellar space. As the rocks pass neutron stars, the light rays from the stars reach the amino acids, and that triggers the selective destruction of one form of amino acid. The stars emit circularly polarized light. This means that in one direction, the light is polarized to the right. Conversely, 180 degrees in the other direction, light rays are left-polarized.\n\nAs a meteor tumbles toward Earth, it is bathed in an excess of one of the two polarized rays. Breslow has confirmed in experiments that circularly polarized light selectively destroys one chiral form of amino acids over the other. The end result is that meteors landing on Earth have a 5 to 10 percent excess of L-type amino acids.\n\nEvidence of the left-handed bias has been found on the surfaces of meteorites that have crashed into Earth even within the last 100 years.\n\nBut a mere 5 to 10 percent bias doesn't explain why the vast majority of living things on Earth use L-type amino acids. So Breslow has gone on to simulate what happens after the dust settles following a meteor bombardment.\n\nImagine Earth 4 billion years ago. It's a rock covered in a warm soup of basic chemicals, including equal amounts of both types of amino acids \u2014 but without any life on it yet. Then in comes a meteor carrying a payload of extraterrestrial acids. What Breslow has found is that when the amino acids on the meteor mixed with those in the primordial soup, the cosmic amino acids directly transferred their chirality to the native Earthling amino acids.\n\nThis experiment is the first to demonstrate that \"handedness transfer\" \u2014 like a cosmic version of Empress Gensho's decree \u2014 occurs under conditions found on prelife Earth.\n\nThis means that there was a slight excess of left-handed amino acids.\n\nBreslow has also shown how left-handers came to dominate.\n\nIn warm conditions, such as those found in deserts, water will evaporate and leave the amino acids crystallized. As this happens, the left- and right-handed forms bind together, leaving behind increasing amounts of L-type amino acid in the remaining water.\n\nEventually, life got going, and the amino acid in excess became ubiquitous as it was used selectively by living organisms.\n\n\"Everything that is going on on Earth occurred because the meteorites happened to land here. But they are obviously landing in other places,\" said Breslow. \"If there is another planet that has the water and all of the things that are needed for life, you should be able to get the same process rolling.\"\n\nSome scientists have suggested that an intricately linked process leads from the predominance of L-type amino acids to the fact that we process language and motor control in the left hemisphere of the brain. This could explain why most of us are right-handed, why our heart is on the left side of the body \u2014 and even why the accelerator of a car is always on the right and the brake always on the left.\n\nAsymmetry, it seems, is something we find everywhere we look.\n\nBut what if, on that other planet, there was an excess of R-type amino acids?\n\nIf life took off there, it would lead to aliens built from R-type amino acids \u2014 mirror images of us, but unable to process our L-type amino acids"}

Researchers at the at Griffith University in Australia didn't even know if was possible for atoms to cast shadows like this until they tried it, but with some laser-cooled Ytterbium, a fancy lens, and five years of work, they were able to take this picture.\n\nOn Wednesday, CERN is expected to announce that the Large Hadron Collider has found evidence that the Higgs boson exists with something on the order of 99.99% certainty. The Standard Model of particle physics has predicted the existence of the Higgs since 1967, so why is finding it such a big deal?\n\nLiquid metal is an awesome thing to play with. Mercury, the most common kind, is sort of toxic and will eventually drive you insane, but before that happens, you can make it do some amazing stuff: play music, and it dances."}
{"text": "Southeast of San Francisco, on the way out to California's Central Valley, thousands of wind turbines dot the landscape of Altamont Pass. Mounted both in rows and individually, machines with large propellers catch the wind, turning round and round at different speeds. Learn how wind energy is generated and stored for use in this most peculiar area, and its impact on living things both near and far.\n\nAdmit it: Hasn't the Godzilla inside you always wanted to grab the Golden Gate Bridge and shake it silly? Finally, you can. In honor of the iconic span's 75th birthday, Exploratorium exhibit developer Dave Fleming presents a dynamic model of the Golden Gate Bridge. What happens to the bridge during an earthquake? How about strong winds and heavy traffic? The model dances and wiggles realistically, displaying the same vibrational modes and motions that occur in the actual bridge.\n\nThe Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System ( gathers live data about winds, waves, surface currents, temperature, and water quality, and makes it available to everyone. In this piece, Oceanographer Art Miller tells us about this system, and about how America's Cup sailors can use this kind of data and modeling to improve their race performances.\nTo access wind modeling data, visit:\n\n\nHow can a wind-powered sailboat move faster than the wind? Why do the America's Cup sails look like airplane wings? With the beginner in mind, Exploratorium senior scientist Paul Doherty introduces the basic physics of sailing and sail design.\n\nHave you ever wondered exactly what clouds are made of, or what the difference is between a cumulus and lenticular cloud? Clouds are an ever-present, ever-changing part of our natural landscape. They come in a huge variety of shapes and sizes, and capture our imagination with their endless permutations. Join Exploratorium Senior Scientist Paul Doherty for a live Webcast about cloud physics. Paul will discuss the basic makeup of clouds, and explore some of the aspects that make them such a rich part of our daily lives.\n\nAs a special event in conjunction with the 2009 American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting, we connected a live audience at the Exploratorium with scientists at the South Pole. Learn about atmospheric research at the South Pole from NOAA's Nick Morgan, the IceCube neutrino detector from Mark Krasberg and Laura Gladstone, and the South Pole Telescope from Bill Holzapfel"}
