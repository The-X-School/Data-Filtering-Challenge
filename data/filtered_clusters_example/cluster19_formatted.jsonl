What is contentious, however, is when the embryo becomes a person in the legal sense, having its own rights and entitlements, separate and apart from those of its mother. The mother, we know with certainty, is fully entitled to all the rights and protections of other distinct persons under the law. This has not been established in the case of foetuses, and whether a foetus ought to be afforded such rights is a matter best left to philosophical, moral or legal debate, not the scientific method.

{"text": "I had an interesting thought the other day. People who are avidly pro-life claim to be acting in the best interests of the baby. But is this completely true? Sure, they're protecting the baby from being killed, but what about after?\n\nThe majority of women who get abortions do it because they don't feel ready for a child. They're generally poor and uneducated, living in the bad part of town. They may be drug-users or alcoholics who fear their own destructive behavior would hurt their newborn. Or perhaps they simply don't want the child.\n\nNow, let's say abortion is outlawed. These women who would be most likely to get abortions must now have their babies. These babies will now grow up in poor environments. They may be unwanted, or they may have an alcoholic or crackhead for a mother. Numerous studies have shown that kids growing up in situations like this are most likely to either follow in their parent's footsteps (become poor, uneducated, teenage mothers) or turn to a life of crime. In short, their lives really aren't going to be very good at all. This is not to say that some won't rise above that kind of life, but unfortunately, those kids are among the minority.\n\nSo, if you really did care about the well being of the child, you'd recognize that forcing them to be born is as much a punishment to the child as it could be to the mother, especially if they're unwanted. Following the legalization of abortion in the United States, infanticide rates dropped rapidly, and more than 20 years later, crime dropped even more (as a direct result of all those future criminals not being born).\n\nWhile I certainly don't condone abortion as a drastic form of birth control, I would rather it be left open for women to make the choice. Believe it or not, women know if they'll be a good mother or not, so I'd rather they had an abortion than be forced to give birth to a child who won't be wanted or taken good care of.

Anyone who was motivated to ask for a late abortion in the first place must be distressed enough to qualify, he said.\n\nI wonder if any pro-choice feminists bloggers or pro-choice organizations will attack Llorente for his comments regarding women who want late term abortions?\n\nUPDATE: Imagine if Pat Robertson declared that every woman having an abortion after a certain point was mentally ill. That would quite some firestorm.\n\nWe'd here shouting from the rafters that \"Women aren't crazy because they want to make a decision about their body!\" \"How dare he pass judgement on women in difficult situations!\" \"Since when did Pat Robertson because a psychiatrist?\" But when an abortionist makes what most ardent pro-choice people would consider a patronizing comment, the response is silence.\n\nIf I was that reporter for the Telegraph, I'd ask Llorente, \"Why are women who want to abort late term pregnancies mentally ill? If abortion doesn't take a human life then why would a woman wanting a late term abortion be mentally ill? If the women wanting late term abortions are mentally ill, how much more mentally ill are you for wanting to perform these types of abortions?\n\nWhy is he treating women for psychological illness by killing their children?

{"text": "AuthorTopic: Shit that made your day (Read 560130 times)Weeell, Roman culture was certainly more than OK with abortion, but early Christians were technically against it. They never recorded taking any actual action against anyone for having an abortion though, so I think the objection was more theoretical than practical. Then there was no official stance for Christianity on abortion until like the 12th century or so. Councils came and went that established Christian legal positions on various subjects, but all that was said about abortion was that it was condemned following sexual crimes like adultery and prostitution. 'Normal' abortion wasn't even mentioned. Then in 1100AD Ivo of Chartre wrote that abortion was wrong, but that aborting an \"unformed\" embryo didn't count, which was basically the official position for the next 700 years. A foetus was considered \"unformed\" officially for the first 40 days if it was male and 80 if it was female, and if there was doubt as to the sex then it was assumed to be female. But, back then, really the only certain test for pregnancy was the quickening, so it wasn't always clear when conception actually occurred. In practise, abortion wasn't considered a sin until the quickening, which developed into traditional canon. It's all very cool stuff, and it's really interesting how both sides have become completely convinced that abortion was always condemned throughout church history when it blatantly was not. It didn't really get seriously shitty until the 19th century, when American doctors..... OK, I just realised I'm rambling and this probably isn't that interesting!

The latest it splits is only a few hours after fertilization, long before the mother is even aware of being pregnant.\n\nThere is not nothing. Things exist. That's what we intend by the term [creation]. The idea that there is existence in the first place is simply observed. Existence is self-evident.\n\nIf you're suggesting that the term \"creation\" instead of \"existence\" is pre-loaded to assume a creator, may I remind you that you introduced the term into this discussion to explain your use of the term \"self-evident.\"\n\nNo, but that itself is still a judgment derived from an observation. It would be self-evident only if you observed the creator.\n\nYou're using the phrase \"self-evident\" to be synonymous with \"taken for granted.\" In colloquial conversation that's fine, but it matters in epistemology, i.e., when you're trying to assert it as knowledge.\n\nYou've claimed that it's self-evident that a fertilized egg isn't a human being because it doesn't have a nervous system, or doesn't have organs, etc. But that's not what \"self-evident\" means, and instead of making an argument on observation, you're really making an argument based on things you take for granted. Well, just because you take it for granted doesn't mean that it's true, and in this case, those assumptions are indeed debatable.\n\n\"The difference between a legal person [..] and a human being is that a legal person is whatever the law says it is.\"\n\nIf you want that definition to be based on reason, rather than pure politics or public whim, you have to give some reason for it. That's what the discussion is about.\n\n---\n\n\"The question of at what point a fertilized egg has developed enough to be considered a human being ... \"\n\nThat assumes that [there is] some point where a fertilized egg \"becomes\" a human being. That's like asking when Clark Kent \"becomes\" Superman; admittedly the appearance may change, but Clark Kent is always Superman. There's no difference. Ever wonder why we can't \"find\" that threshold when the fetus \"becomes\" a human being? It's because there is no threshold to find.\n\nIn the case of having multiple embryos, suppose it splits into 5 of them? So what? They're all human beings.\n\nAs for whether they have organ development, again, why does that count as being necessary? Many born adults lack particular organs, so why would any organ be a necessary quality of civil rights?\n\nYour side doesn't want to accept the possibility of a distinction between human life and a human being.\n\nThat's because the distinction is silly. A skin cell is a part of a being, not a being in entirety by itself. The argument about \"life from the moment of conception\" is that this is the point at which a distinct being in itself begins.\n\nTo claim that civil rights only apply to legal persons is to claim that there's some distinction between living human beings and legal persons. Logically, that implies that a legal person must have some quality that a \"mere\" human being doesn't have. Can you identify (and justify) what that quality might be?\n\nI have stated that I find it to be self-evident that a blastocyst of 70 cells which can potentially form any number of embryos and which lacks even the precursor of a nervous system is not a human being and is not the moral equivalent of, say, a two year old child.\n\nNo, that's not a candidate for self-evidence. You can't just say that something is self-evident because you simply don't have any further analysis for your conclusion.\n\nIn fact, your argument rests on an assertion that isn't self-evident at all: namely, that a nervous system is necessary for something to qualify for civil rights.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe knowledge or awareness of one's rights isn't necessary for one to have them. A six-month old baby has no grasp of the notion of rights.\n\nThe Church is an institution devoted to the pursuit of truth in all things, yet Ignatius' thirteenth rule commands:\n\nThirteenth Rule. To be right in everything, we ought always to hold that the white which I see, is black, if the Hierarchical Church so decides it [...]\n\nDecide for yourself the role he wanted the believer to play.\n\nWell, this is an interesting conversation on its own. It calls for reflection on a topic that Jesuits (among many others) spend a great deal of time on. I posted about it a few months ago.\n\nWe can start by looking at a word Jeff used above: \"yet.\" That word is disjunctive. It says that whatever came before it is contradicted by whatever comes after. The assertion, then, is that the pursuit of the truth is contradicted if you must hold what the church holds.\n\nThat can only be asserted if you also hold that an individual has a right to withhold judgment until the truth has been proved to him personally, i.e., to his individual satisfaction."}

{"text": "Judith Jarvis Thomson: a Defense of Abortion\n\nThe goal of Judith Jarvis Thomson in her defense of abortion is to sway the ideas of those who are against abortion by challenging the arguments they give for thinking so. She begins by stating a premise. \"For the sake of the argument\" a human embryo is a person. This premise is one of the arguments most opponents of abortion use, but as she points out, isn't much of an argument at all. These people spend a lot of their time dwelling on the fact that the fetus is a person and hardly any time explaining how the fetus being a person has anything to with abortion being impermissible. In the same breath, she states that those who agree with abortion spend a lot of their time saying the fetus is in fact not a person. Either way, no argument is really formed. No reasons are given. For sake of challenging an actual argument, she is disregarding this issue. With this premise out of the way, she addresses the basic argument the pro-choice campaign believes. \"Every person has a right to life. So the fetus has a right to life. No doubt the mother has a right to decide what shall happen in and to her body; everyone would grant that. But surely a person's right to life is stronger and more stringent than the mother's right to decide what happens in and to her body, and so outweighs it. So the fetus may not be killed; an abortion may not be performed.\" The remainder of her paper is a series of analogies meant to challenge the basic argument mention above. When looking at the analogies separately, they are in no way related to the abortion topic, but the conclusions drawn from each can be applied. Because these examples aren't directly related to the debate, our emotions won't necessarily be involved and we can clearly think about what is the \"right\" thing to do for each specific scenario.\nTo begin, we're given the following analogy.

So I put this question to a friend (and fellow musician) who happens to work for Central California Right To Life.\n\nJosh,\n\nAn important issue in the abortion debate is the argument over when life begins; at conception, at birth, or somewhere in between? I've heard many opinions over the years, but one (from a fellow engineer) has always struck me as a possible solution. The logic of the argument goes like this: 'life' and 'death' are inverse states of existence. Therefore, the set of criteria that define 'life' and 'death' should also be inverse quantities. Thus, we should define 'life' by the inverse of the criteria we use for 'death', since those criteria are pretty well accepted both legally and morally (of course there are always edge-cases). For example: if someone is pronounced dead when their heart and brain consciousness stop, then life is defined as conscious brain function and a heart beat (over-simplified of course).\n\nThis is a very pragmatic argument. It view's the woman's body as analogous to a life-support system, thus rendering null the argument that life begins when the baby can exist outside the mother's womb.

However, even the most restrictive criminal laws usually recognized the broader scientific view of conception by providing no penalties for the use of \"morning-after pills\" or intra-uterine devices, which prevent the beginning of pregnancy in spite of possible fertilizations. Indeed, the very fact that such substances and devices are generally considered contraceptives and not abortifacients suggests that the traditional religious interpretations are not shared by the public at large. Neither did the laws ever reflect the opinion that abortion is murder. If they had, the penalties for abortionists would have been the same as for murderers: Death or life imprisonment. In actual fact, however, the penalties were always much less severe. Moreover, the most important person involved in the crime, the woman who had the abortion performed, was practically never prosecuted at all. Such curious hesitancy, indeed ambiguity, on the part of the law indicates that the modern secular state cannot support any particular moral or religious viewpoint, but tends instead to seek some position of compromise. In fact, the state, which has to accommodate and protect the adherents of many different and often conflicting beliefs, can meet this obligation only by basing its laws on purely rational considerations. In the case of abortion, such considerations point clearly in one direction: leaving the matter entirety to professional medical judgment and the conscience of the individual."}

Thus the fewer abortion, the more crime roughly a generation later (when the children who weren't aborted reach the age at which criminal activity is most common).\n\nObviously, the conservatives are unhappy to hear that liberalized abortion confers social benefits, and the liberals aren't thrilled to hear that abortion mainly kills babies of a specific socio-economic background."}
{"text": "Is it possible some people just do not want or cannot have a baby? Why do some parents assume that everyone eventually wants babies and that babies may everyone's life complete? And that every pregnancy is risk-free and happy?\nI don't think anyone pretends it's \"nothing\". Woman who do it aren't cold, callous monsters. Vilifying them isn't constructive.\n\nDo we pretend it's \"nothing\" to decide to have a baby? These are world-changing decisions for a couple, either way.\n\nWomen who CAN'T have babies have nothing to do with it. The one's who don't WANT a baby shouldn't have sex or should use protection. I never said any of the things you're arguing against. I never said I assumed everyone wants babies or any of the other stuff you're talking about so I'm not going to respond to it."}
{"text": "Number of abortions in US dropped 5 percent\n\nSpecialists say decrease may be due to economy\n\nBy Mike Stobbe\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Abortions in the United StatesComments\n\nI would also suggest, that besides economic reasons, a significant cause for the decline had to do with the record number of new restrictive abortion laws -- targeting a woman's right to choose -- were sadly passed and implemented in dozens of states over the last two years.\n\nWhy did the Globe choose to print the number of the abortion rate for white women, about 8.5 per 1000, and that of hispanic women, about 19 per 1000, but not that of black women? It wrote out that number as about 4 times that of white women, would that be because about 34 per 1000 is too glaring for its delicate sensibilities?\n\nMost research suggests that a reduction in abortion rates correlates with availability of reliable birth control. Restrictive laws generally do NOT reduce the number of abortions, merely shifts the procedure from medically safe to backroom and dangerous. Which, I guess would reduce the number of abortions that \"counted\"."}
{"text": "Friday, August 24, 2012\n\n'Trust Women' - A Rhetorical Shell Game\n\nAmong the millions of people in the prolife movement, the vast majority are women, including most of its leaders. To suggest that this female-dominated entity seeks to squash other women, or doesn't trust women, would be silly if it were not so condescending. This is just another shabby tactic the abortion lobby uses to keep from having to defend abortion.\n\nTo understand how truly asinine this \"trust women\" rhetoric is, imagine someone opposing laws against rape or incest because he \"trusts men to be their own moral agents.\"\n\nOr imagine that a woman is scheduled to have an abortion tomorrow, but gives birth in her home today. If the baby survives, should she be allowed to kill it? After all, the child was going to be killed the next day anyway. Why should she lose her \"right to choose\" because of a premature delivery that was completely beyond her control? Is she only allowed to pay someone else to kill her baby, but not allowed to kill it herself? Are we saying that we only trust women to make good moral decisions while they're pregnant?\n\nIf we are supposed to just blindly trust women, why not trust them across the board? Let each woman make her own moral choice about whether to stop at red lights, embezzle money from her employer, write bad checks, use cocaine, or become a prostitute. Let's also exempt all female business owners from discrimination laws which make it illegal for companies to refuse employment or service to minorities. In fact, since every law on the books prevents women from choosing to engage in a particular activity and says that women can't be trusted to make that decision, shouldn't the prochoice mob be screaming that women should be exempted from all laws? Do they trust women or don't they?\n\nThe reality is that the only reason for the law to even exist is because people \u2013 men and women \u2013 can't be trusted to always do what's right. Laws are necessary to keep them from inflicting their immoral decisions on others.\n\nClearly, this \"trust women\" rhetoric is a sham. By using the term \"moral agents\" to describe women who submit to abortion, the prochoice gang hopes to create the illusion that women who pay to have their children slaughtered do so out of some kind of moral conviction. It's just a rhetorical shell-game to make abortion seem morally defensible"}

{"text": "Thursday, September 08, 2005\n\nIf you can't trust me with a choice, how can you trust me with a child?\n\nI think this is probably one of the more clever pro-choice bumper stickers out there. At a quick glance, it appeals to our idea of fairness and how much responsibility and trust a person should be given. Those who are trusted with important tasks should also be entrusted with \"simple decisions.\" If we can't trust a person to make a \"simple choice,\" then how could we ever entrust them to the immensely more important task of raising a child?\n\nThe bumper sticker displays one of main tactics of the pro-choice movement. Don't talk about what the choice actually is. Just emphasize that it is a \"choice.\" The immense problem with this bumper sticker's message is when someone asks \"what choice?\"\n\nImagine a candidate for President of the United States running on the slogan, \"If you can't trust me to run the country, how can you trust me with a child?\" It doesn't really work, does it? Most of recognize the importance and skills need for parenting yet we also realize that being President of the United States entails a different set of skills.\n\nOr imagine an advocate for bigamy with a bumper sticker saying, \"If you can't trust me with a choice (to marry more than one person), how can you trust with a child.\" The pro-choice bumper sticker uses language to obscure the reality that some choices are wrong regardless of how much responsibility an individual might have.\n\nImagine a mother holding her toddler and saying, \"If you can't trust me with the choice (of whether or not I can legally kill this toddler), how can you trust me to raise this toddler?\" Just because we trust parents with their children doesn't mean we entrust them with the right to decide whether to kill them or not.\n\nThe bumper sticker assumes that having an abortion is a choice that doesn't affect anyone else instead of doing anything to prove it.\n\nOnce the question \"what choice\" is asked, the real issue becomes obvious. The issue isn't \"shouldn't I have a choice?\" or \"aren't I responsible enough to make a choice?\" but \"what is unborn?\" If the unborn aren't living human beings, then yes, you should be able to choose. But if the unborn are living human beings then you shouldn't be granted the right to kill that human being anymore than a mother should be granted the right to kill her toddler.\n\n7 comments:\n\nVery well articulated! I enjoyed the way you laid out your thoughts and I'm with you 100%.

{"text": "One thing about being a feminist is that you're often marginalized or ignored or basically told to shut up because \"come on, it's not like there's a group of dudes meeting in a dark, smoke-filled room to specifically plan how they're going to pay women less/dehumanize oppressed groups/ensure rape culture is promoted.\"\n\nWell, here you go, sunshines. A document specifically advising antichoicers to say \"mother\" instead of \"pregnant woman\" (the irony of course being that many people who get abortions already have kids!) and \"protect unborn children\" instead of \"ban abortion\" and \"abortionist\" instead of \"doctor\" \u2013 while people who want to restrict your life entirely to the productive abilities of your uterus get to go around using their medical cred to give their arguments weight.\n\nAnd let's be clear here \u2013 I've always had something of a prochoice language playbook in my own head. I don't say \"pro-life\" because that obviously frames opponents as \"anti-life\" (though they usually just say \"pro-baby killing\"). I say \"anti-choice\". But the difference to me is this: calling a doctor an \"abortionist\" \u2013 when no doctor solely performs abortions \u2013 is dishonest framing designed to produce an emotional response.\n\nCalling \"pro-lifers\" anti-choice is only \"framing\" in that it rejects their own. They are opposed to choice. They do not want pregnant people to be able to choose to have abortions. They are generally also opposed to the choice to use contraception, the choice to have sex outside of marriage, etc. Their specific goal is enacting legislation to remove people's choices.\n\nSo yeah, I think \"anti-choice\" fits rather nicely. So nicely that in their own documents they advise not using the word \"choice\" at all.\n\nThere's probably an antichoice argument that says \"oh, but I do think doctors who perform abortions are so disgusting that it should be called out!\"\n\nBut let's look at that list. That list isn't about \"we think term X is more accurate because \u2026\" That list has a single purpose: using emotionally-laden language to perpetuate the idea that abortion is icky, that doctors who perform abortions which may save people's lives are evil, and above all that women are good for nothing but popping out babies.\n\nThe document that list comes from?

Admit it to yourself, and either own it, or get some counseling to figure out why you hate women so much. And yes, many of these misogynists are women. It's called internalized oppression. Don't ever think that because someone is in a marginalized group, they can't rather amusingly find ways to identify with their oppressors to avoid recognizing their own oppression \u2013 or just to make their lives more comfortable.\n\nIn her article, Keslar is obsessed with the notion that women have no value but fails to provide a single shred of evidence that that is what pro-lifers believe or any philosophical underpinnings as to how, exactly, anti-abortion sentiments necessitate misogyny. In fact, the only quote from an actual \"woman-hating\" pro-lifer is from a female OB-GYN embracing the inherent value of all human beings. Without any grounds to stand on, finally resorting to the \"women who disagree with me do so because they're CRAZY!\" defense as illustrated above is no argument at all.\n\nRep. Babette Josephs goes even further with a common critique she gives about her female colleagues in the House involved in anti-abortion legislation.\n\n\"They must believe that [their constituents] are not capable of making their own health care choices, but they are capable of voting on bills that control all of our behavior\u2026I don't understand it \u2026 I don't believe they're really women. \u2026 I believe they're men with breasts.\"\n\nFaced with such a crass insult questioning how truly-true her female colleagues are in their womanhood I ask, who's really the misogynist here?

Or is it the women who demand allegiance to their own ideologies, resorting to asinine verbal abuse against any women who doesn't fall in line? Is that supposed to be liberating?\n\nBut the thing that strikes me about her remarks is how anti-man they are\u2014not just anti-pro-life-man, but anti-men-in-general. Calling your opponent \"men with breasts\" implies that all men are, by definition, the enemy. It's like saying \"the devil in disguise\" or \"a wolf in sheep's clothing.\" It assumes that the worst thing you can say about a woman is that she's like a man.\n\nIf Josephs just wants equality for women aren't there plenty of men out there that share her views? Yet, her comments suggest that, no, men are inherently evil, they naturally want to oppress women. The only way to bring women up is to tear men down.\n\nI disagree. I want what's best \u2013 for everyone. That means finding solidarity between groups, whether they be men and women, Catholics and Protestants, Israelis and Iranians. We should be working together to lift everyone up \u2013 not tearing others down to your level. So, men, stop treating women like objects; grow a pair and stop being selfish.

This article is an analysis of the original subject matter, but does contain a link to it.\n\nEssentially, the article which was published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, makes the following basic points:\n\n* A newborn is not terribly more neurologically developed than a fetus in utero.\n\n* Many birth defects are not caught prior to birth.\n\n* Many families do not realize the emotional and financial toll of having a newborn until after birth.\n\n* Abortions before birth are often performed for the comfort of the mother/family or due to birth defects.\n\nThe authors then jumped to the conclusion that pro-life proponents have argued for years, and liberals have denied: Aborting a \"fetus\" is really not terribly different from killing a newborn. The exception? The authors, rather than the logical conclusion that no pregnancy should be terminated for anything but the most dire circumstances, jump to the OPPOSITE view point. They put forth the idea that, ethically, it is okay to commit infanticide--which they term \"after-birth abortion\"--if the family will be caused undue emotional, financial, or physical hardship by caring for the baby.\n\nYes, it's an actual article. Yes, it's actually being debated, although even vehement pro-choice supporters have been disgusted by it.\n\nI wonder if this a troll paper.... It just seems too odd. It is fishy.\n\nI think that far too often people kid themselves when it comes to abortions in general. This seems to show the flaws in that logic.\n\nBut you know, if I want to apply their logic to other things.... you know grandma sure is getting expensive with all of those medications and doctor visit, not to mention that nursing home. Dang, it really is an emotional drain to watch someone slowly die, and the money oh boy. You know maybe we should just kill her off too with that newborn, I mean if we can't take care of grandma who says we can take care of the newborn?\n\nOk, I realize that was a bit, over the top. But, it is how I see it. We wouldn't kill Grandma, so why kill off the baby.\n\nNot to the idea of the \"after-birth abortions\". It's actually having the opposite effect--there are several pro-choice responses where people are actually saying, Wait a minute, is this really where the pro-choice movement has led us?\n\nPro-choicers are actually arguing that it is a plant, because the logic that they use is so perfectly applied to this concept when you read the original article. I am interested to see if it \"converts\" anyone."}
{"text": "Viewpoint: How far would \"pro-lifers\" go to control women's actions?\n\nCan we agree that we are all \"pro-life?\" Everyone except folks like Jeffrey Dahmer, Lizzie Borden and Timothy McVeigh?\n\nCan we agree on that? Okay?\n\nWe can't? How come?\n\nBecause abortion is murder? Because women who kill their babies should be put in prison? Women's clinics should be burned to the ground? Abortion providers should be murdered and all those who support a woman's access to a safe and legal abortion are \"baby killers?\" Really?\n\nGee, that's a pretty heavy indictment of a lot of people. Sounds like we can't agree that we're all \"pro-life.\" But why are so many people \"pro-death?\" Are they crazy? Why do progressive folk like to kill babies? Are they crazy? Why do they let women run wild doing whatever they want and then let them cover up their sins and their lust with birth control and abortion? Are they crazy? Why does the government let them get away with it?\n\nOkay, \"pro-lifers,\" I got another question for you: What would happen if you got your wish and abortions were outlawed again like they were prior to \"Roe v. Wade?\" What if you were able to drag us back to the Dark Ages of \"coathanger abortions\" when so many women died? What if you were able to get the government to start locking up abortion providers again? What would you do next?\n\nWould you be satisfied at that point? Or would you then put the machine into high gear and go after virtually all forms of birth control? The \"morning-after\" pill would have to go, of course. Would you then demand that the government outlaw \"the pill,\" the condom and all other forms of artificial birth control?\n\nWould you then insist that the government station agents in hospitals to make sure that any and all miscarriages weren't really covering up abortions?\n\nAnd you know how irresponsible so many women are. They would still be out there running wild. What next? Would you demand that the government require women to wear \"burkhas?\" Would you prohibit them from working at jobs alongside men? (That would help them avoid \"occasions of sin.\") Would you make sure that the education of women was really restricted? (It gives them too many funny ideas anyway). Would you then have the government require that they stay home and be obedient and subservient to their husbands? Wouldn't all that keep those lustful women in line?\n\nBut what if you still had irresponsible, rebellious women, and we all know you would? What would you do with those who still refused to behave as you demanded of them? In the olden days, there was always \"the stake.\" How would you feel about that? If you were able to reach this level of political success and some women still weren't sufficiently intimidated, would you consider \"the stake?\" Wouldn't that set a powerful example for younger women to learn from?\n\nAt that point, you would be in charge of a truly \"pro-life\" utopia. I'll bet you'd be happy then!"}
{"text": "Medical science *cannot* answer that question. That's because there's no scientific way to determine when human life \"begins.\"\n\nIt's all a continuum. Nobody who understands the process that's involved really believes that life begins at conception. As others have pointed out, there are plenty of spontaneous abortions following conception--and nobody's holding funerals.\n\nAnti-abortion zealots point to the fact that the fetus has a beating heart. Well, so what? So does an ant--and some of them have stepped on ants without a second thought.\n\nIf one defines a human life as when the fetus becomes viable, well, that's a start toward a rational definition. Butt what means \"viable?\" With huge machines and expensive round-the-clock care, medical technology is redefining viability all the time. Five-month fetuses can be considered \"viable\"...sort of. It helps that they've essentially designed womb-mimicking machines.\n\nI love people who proclaim themselves \"Pro-life.\" Most of them are very much in favor of war and the death penalty. That means that they're \"pro-life\" when it suits them. Isn't *that* \"hypocrisy at its worst?\" Later."}

{"text": "Planned Parenthood Care Chart vs. NPR Spending Chart\n\nAfter last night's late budget compromise and extension, Planned Parenthood has been protected from any government spending cuts (so far). Yesterday, the Washington Post's Ezra Klein posted a graph from Planned Parenthood demonstrating what activities they perform (abortion is excluded from federal funding). For curiosity's sake, we thought we'd take a look at the spending chart of a program that recently had their government funding cut: NPR. Below is a comparison of Planned Parenthood's chart vs. (our best guess at) NPR's chart.\n\nWe Recommend\n\nAgain, the reason why the cons are going after Planned Parenthood is the same reason why they are attacking unions, NPR, education, voting rights, etc. They know the demographic trends do not favor them, so they are trying to stack the deck and destroy any organized resistance to their reactionary right and corporate agenda. They *know* Planned Parenthood is a good reproductive health outfit, and they *know* no federal money ever goes for any abortions, but they want to kill it because it is not part of their rabid base."}
{"text": "Reply to Message\n\nRE: Could better family planning help slow the effects of climate change?\n\nInteresting thing is, that generally (certainly not all) the reason higher educated women tend to have smaller families is not because they are deciding to 'save the environment', but because they are being more distracted from thinking about and doing family creation during their most fertile years - and they tend to have a more developed desire for self-centered meaning in their lives than do mothers of naturally large, two-parent families.\n\nMuch more often than not, we run into higher-educated women who wish they had not waited so long to get married and have children... and now they often can't have their own biological children."}

These pieces of shit act like they want this better America, when what they really want is an oppressed America, especially as far as females are concerned. What's next? Female circumcision so we have joyless sex?\n\nHe can't be for real....... Just become someone is on birth control doesn't mean they are having sex all over the place. I'm on it because I need it to regulate my period other wise I can go as long as 6 months with out having one. People like him need to stfu.\n\nI can't stand the double standard. It's ok for a man to buy condoms and sow his wild oats but GOD FORBID a woman take control over her sexual health so she doesn't have an unwanted pregnancy. If a woman has sex that makes her a slut but it takes two to have sex so what does that make the man? An innocent bystander?\n\nAll those Republicans keep raging about social welfare and people needing to be able to fend for themselves. Birth control keeps people from having unwanted pregnancies so they aren't burdening the system any more then it already is. I can't stand the hypocrisy of it all. They're all for the sanctity of life and anti abortion but then they go all \"how dare a woman actually take steps to make sure she doesn't have an unwanted pregnancy and an abortion.\""}
{"text": "Yeah, I think it's for me, if I did this 100 times, this decision again I wouldn't change my decision. I don't have, knowing what I now know about the condition that the babies had and etc, etc, I don't have any dissonance about ending a pregnancy. I have a great sadness that I needed to face that decision and go through what we went through, but I never for a moment think either of the babies should have been born and been allowed to wither or survive for moments or days or whatever.\n\nWhat I, I think I feel uncomfortable with is people not understanding it fully enough, and drawing their own conclusions about why we did it. And perhaps them in some how viewing it as, you know, the kind of designer baby stuff, you know, that them viewing that in somehow this baby was mildly imperfect and that we ended it's life. Because in a sentence you can't get across, you know, why we did it and why we believe it was the right thing for us to do.\n\nAnd so I think that's why I sometimes feel uncomfortable about saying \"termination\" because I know they won't really understand, you know, the difficult decision we took when we made that, you know, albeit quick decision, you know, the difficulty and how ill the babies were and all that kind of stuff."}

What if you accidentally flush out something by accident that you didn't know what there because you were having your period. It has to be as realistic and medically possible as aborting a child before it was conceived, right?\n\nArizona has to be one of the most confusing states in the union. That's what sucks about being an independent. Some things I can cheer for, some things are so laughable that you want them to secede and join some other country.\n\nMy only hope is they are the first state to ban men from masturbating. After all, there are millions of lives lost every time a man ejaculates. Women like Octomom would gladly use those eggs at the cost of taxpayers. Fair is fair. And....no more viagra.

{"text": "Pepsi uses fetus cells?\n\nWell that's what some would have you believe. However, for anyone with deductive reasoning skills it should be obvious there is a clear and distinct difference between HEK cloned cell-lines, which derive from a single 40 year old cell, and a fetus. And despite the initial ruse I'm happy to say aborted babies do not make it into pepsi, although that would have explained the foul aftertaste.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with what I'm talking about please follow the link\n\nregardless of the facts there are still a plethora of religious and other anti-abortion zealots sensationalizing this non-issue as another reason to hate Obama (not that there aren't any) but more importantly to fuel their anti-abortion hatred and the hatred of science. Don't believe me? simply google \"fetus, pepsi, obama\" and you'll fullfil your unscientific fantasies of Obama's cannibal nature towards murdered babies. And probably something about socialism..\n\nThe fact is HEK cells derive from a single kidney cell of an aborted fetus in the early 1970's and have been used since in pharmaceutical research to test metabolic reactions of chemicals in human models, and in the case of Pepsi, HEK cells are used as \"taste receptores\" when measuring the amount of \"flavor ingredients\" the company should use in their product.\n\nI imagine this wouldn't be much of an issue if the cell-line was derived from mice or a chimp, but in that case the biology wouldn't be human and therefor, I suppose, not as reliable in testing products for humans?? feel free to fact check that one... but in that sense I guess I can see why a human embryonic cell line is useful in terms of accurately testing and measuring chemicals for human consumption over cells derived from chimps..\n\nbeyond the sensational and false rhetoric of dead babies in our food, does it still bother you companies like Senomyx uses HEK clones to measure chemical reactions of products meant for human consumption? And not even just Pepsi products, but like vaccinations and other medicines which treat diseases as well? Medicines and treatments that save lives.. medicines we've all used and been treated with at some point..\n\nSo given the controversial origin of the HEK cell-line, the cell-line itself is mostly used for good reasons, no? Yes? Maybe?\n\nI guess my biggest discrepancy is why can't scientists use non-human cell lines derived from embryonic tissues? Why does it have to be human?\n\nRegardless, all this won't change my opinion of pepsi one way or another. I've always preferred Coke and Dr Pepper... and anything Cherry flavored for that matter. pepsi can suck it.\n\nRe: Pepsi uses fetus cells?\n\nThere are people who still won't drink Pepsi because of the misconception that they purposely left \"Under God\" off of one of their can designs about a decade ago.\n\nI don't drink Pepsi but I really don't remember it ever having \"Under God\" on any merchandise.\n\nNow, on another story, when I was in college Budweiser came out with Bud Dry. I discovered that the label was made specifically for right handed drinkers as the label would be exposed upside down for lefties. I wrote AB with this revelation in hopes that the lefties of the world wouldn't be stuck having to decide whether to drink right handed of cover up the label.....I heard nothing.\n\nI did, however, manage to get my revenge! You may notice that Bud Dry is now a thing of the past.....if they'd only listened...."}

{"text": "This is a list of questions that I get asked frequently, any questions that are on this list will not be answered ( At least, not by me [ Lilly ] ) if you send them in so please check here first before sending any questions, thank you!\n\nPlease note that they are in no particular order.\n\n1. Q: What if the mother/unborn child would not survive the abortion?\n\nA: If neither would survive the abortion, I believe that is the only circumstance in which an abortion is okay or even needed.\n\n2. Q: What if the mother was raped?\n\nA: As absolutely horrible as rape is, it doesn't justify murder. We don't give rapists the death sentence, why would we do that to their innocent child?\n\n3. Q: Don't Prolifers only care about the fetus?\n\nA: Not at all, a lot of Prolifers volunteer at places like Crisis Pregnancy Centers or donate to them, we care about both the mother and her child equally!\n\n4. Q: If the fetus were gay, would you still support aborting them?\n\nA: First of all, I believe homosexuality is a choice, no one is \"born gay\". Second, if I could somehow see into the future and know that they would become a homosexual, I would still stand for their right to life. No one who is truly Prolife or a Christian is okay with killing homosexuals.\n\nIf you send me a message regarding my beliefs on homosexuality, it will not be answered. That isn't the point of this blog.\n\n5. Q: Isn't it forcing your own beliefs on other people to make abortion illegal?\n\nA: Is it forcing our beliefs on other people to make cannibalism, theft, ect. illegal? Some people don't believe those things are wrong, or at least claim not to. If something is wrong, it's wrong, regardless of what other people believe or want to believe.\n\n6. Q: How do you feel about birth control?\n\nA: I am fine with birth control. I'd like to make it clear that I am one hundred percent against sex outside of marriage, but I'm fine with birth control used within marriage or birth control pills used to help with painful periods and such.\n\n7. Q: Teens/adults are going to have sex anyway, we might as well provide them with abortion and birth control!\n\nA: Adults as well as teens ( and I have a right to say that, because I am one ) have control over their own bodies and they are old enough to know the consequences of bad decisions. A lifetime of regret is not worth a few moments of pleasure. Their unborn child should not be punished for their mistakes.\n\n8. Q: Why do you want to make abortion illegal? That will only force people to have illegal abortions, it won't make it go away!\n\nA: If abortion was made illegal, the number of abortions would go down dramatically and it would be far less available to women. Abortion is murder, therefore it should be illegal. If women choose to break the law to kill their own child and thus get hurt while doing so, how is that our fault? We didn't force them to get an abortion.\n\n10. Q: If abortion were illegal, do you think women who have abortions should be punished?\n\nA: All we want is for the murder of the unborn to end, that is why we want abortion to be illegal"}
{"text": "It IS rather a black and white issue. You either consider the fetus a person or you do not.\n\nUsually this would involve when life begins. And well, that's a whole other debate unto itself.\n\nReally I'd rather see abortion done for actual life threatening reasons as it would be more dignified if you ask me. Yes being pregnant and then afterward is hard enough but stillOf course I understand how screwed up it is, but it's obviously not something that's going to be fixed if we're simultaneously dumping more kids into the system while trying to fix it.\n\nMake it so that kids--and not just babies and/or little white girls alone--are actually being adopted, first, and then we can argue about what you're proposingIt's a woman's body and she can do whatever she wants with it. Even if I was against it, I understand that it's none of my damn business. There are many reasons for it, and against it. However, for the most part I'm for it. Accidents happen, condoms tear, rape happens, etc. Some may not be able to afford a child, or the process of having one. While an abortion isn't cheap, it certainly is cheaper than the process of having the kid to give up for adoption.\n\nHowever, if two kids are goofing around and decide to have sex without a condom \"just cuz\", I wouldn't agree with it. However, I wouldn't stop them because it's their right. There's no time to worry about the hypothetical \"but the baby could be Jesus\" bull\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 when the lives of people that are already living matter more.\n\nI volunteer at Planned Parenthood often and the flak that I get from the brain dead protesters is hilarious, by the way. The \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 they like to show people on posters is far more gruesome than what they're protesting against. For example, we have one guy that covers plastic baby dolls in fake blood and shoves them on pitchforks and holds up posters of dead babies (not aborted fetus', mind you, actual pictures of dead babies) and yells out of a bullhorn all day.\n\nIn my opinion, the protesters are far much worse than an abortion could ever be. Also, notice how most of the pro-life people are men?That's a cool argument bro.\n\nI guess when I go to the US I can legally get murdered in the streets since I don't have citizenshipThis brings to mind an anomaly in the legal system.\n\nIn Canada, the Supreme Court has ruled that a fetus is not a person and thus has no rights (Actually, not until the child has fully emerged from his mother's womb).\n\nYet at the same time if a woman is pregnant and the father dies, her unborn child will get a share of the inheritance as if it were an already born individual. We are also willing to sue someone for murder if she has a miscarriage due to injury caused by someone elsea bit of hypocrisy in the legal system, I agree.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Cut Man\n\nYou've successfully convinced me to take the abortion issue a step further and just support legalizing cannibalism.\n\nI have been strongly pro-choice with the circumstances that the abortion is made after careful consideration, and not for \"\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s and giggles\". Even barring the issue of whether or not a human fetus is sapient (which I believe it isn't, and therefore I believe that the mother has the overriding say on what to do), there's also the fact that, as Crash Man said earlier, there's the issue of what happens after birth. It's not as simple as \"overhauling\" the welfare system. In my opinion, if you have the money to not only pay for a woman's pregnancy, but also childbirth and raising the child to begin with, that money may as well go to help develop education and infrastructure for disadvantaged children who are actually alive and sapient in the poorer regions of Africa and the Middle East.\n\nOr do we not care about \"other\" people?Let's ignore the whole \"Is a fetus a person\" part of the debate, since that never goes anywhere.\n\nI've a \"new\" one:\n\nThere is no situation, not a one, where it is expected that a person sacrifice their body for another. It doesn't matter if cutting off a toe would save lives, you're not expected to do so.\n\nSo, why is pregnancy different? That involves giving up your bodily autonomy and, without exaggeration, risking death in for the sake of another. Noble, perhaps, but hardly something that should be mandated by law, now is it?\n\nI mean, imagine that one day someone from the government showed up at your door and strapped a collar around your neck. This collar would shock you at random intervals. If you take it off, then someone else dies, and you go to jail for murder.\n\nWould you stand for that?\n\nEdit: Oh, and tell me, pro-life people here, where do you stand on laws currently in effect in some states that make miscarriages illegal? I'm genuinely curious.\n\nI had a friend who on Facebook started raving about how abortion is murder and how you're a bad person if you do it, even if it's a life or death situation for the mother. And that it's the woman's own fault for getting knocked up in the first place.\n\nyeah sure, who am I to say whether or not you should be allowed to dismember the bodies of helpless and innocent creatures? We do it all the time. Tastes delicious.\n\nwhat makes a fetus more of a person than that cow was? It's even less sentient!\n\nWell, many people who support abortion think killing puppies is evil.\nTo me a fetus has the same sentience that a puppy does.\nSo... according to my moral POV its cruel to kill a fetus, there's no reason to kill an innocent puppy, they do nothing but being a( sometimes annoying) responsibility.\nthe fetus its a living creature you would kill for a most of the time a very silly reason, laziness to raise the kid you made cause' unprotected intercourse its very cool.\nAlso, the fetus is a member of your species, it's family, why kill family?\nIf I were a pregnant woman who didn't want the baby I would just give birth to he/she and send her/him to an adoption center.\n\nKilling the fetus/potential human being is not necessary, really, we don't eat fetuses, nor they are threat to us, quite the opposite actually.\nMy mind tells me I must not kill a creature I won't eat or won't hurt me.\n\nI would only agree with aborting the child if the woman is in serious danger and its a known fact that the baby won't survive.\nThe phrase above demonstrates the instance in which the fetus is a potential threat that won't survive even if the supposed birth happens."}

Yet we don't in any way try and stop parents with known genetic diseases from creating offspring who will suffer.\n\nAs for whether the UN should be involved in this debate.

{"text": "Thursday, April 29, 2004\n\na libertarian's position on abortion\n\nAs is usually the case, I once again find myself agreeing with a position expressed by Amy at The Fifty Minute Hour: \"...even if I believed that carrying human DNA granted a being the right to life, which I don't, that doesn't guarantee that being the right to live in my womb for nine months. Now, perhaps a pregnant woman should turn to her stomach and ask the fetus nicely to get out before seeking an abortion, but the point is that as long as a fetus lives inside of an independent, thinking, feeling person, the person's right to control the course of her own destiny trumps any claim the fetus might have to a right to life.\"\n\nNothing has a political right to be a parasite not even a genotypic human. This is also a pretty good argument against tax-funded welfare. Without choice, you don't have charity. You have theft and slavery. But perhaps I'm being too blunt again."}
{"text": "Life begins at conception\n\nI'm an atheist. I believe in reproductive rights for women. I believe a woman should be able to abort a pregnancy no questions asked. Why should I have to also believe the nonsense that \"life begins at birth\"? It seems to me that a human being is created as soon as a sperm fertilizes an egg.

It probably only began the one time, so to suggest that it begins billions of times each year over billions of years goes against scientific consensus by profound orders of magnitude.\n\nSaying something is human doesn't say much. My dead skin cells that slough from my body by the millions each day are human skin cells. If people are using human as shorthand for human being, then perhaps they should make note of it.\n\nHuman being would represent something more akin to maybe what people are referring to when they use terms like life or human. The important aspect of this term being \"being\", a sentient individual. Of course, alone, it could mean anything that is alive or simply exists, but paired with human, most common usage would be in reference to the sentient individual with the rare exception.\n\nPersonhood would be more of a legal term that would grant certain rights to an individual based on some set of criteria such as sentience among others. This does not have to be limited to human beings and has, compellingly I think, been argued in favor of being granted to some non-human primates and other animals with highly functioning brains.\n\nPeople may quibble about the meager definitions I have provided for various terms, but I'd be happy if during discourse of this type that there was at least recognition of the nuanced nomenclature involved. Best of all would be that people would agree first upon terms and their definitions prior to engaging in debate.\n\nThis thread isn't about abortion. It's about using terms like \"life\" and \"living\" consistently with the way we talk about other organisms, and especially mammals. It is the Christian fallacy to place man as separate somehow from the apes and squirrels and fish and tomato plants. There is never any problem referring to the early stages of those things as \"alive.\" It is only when it comes to man that for purely political, and not scientific, reasons that we hesitate to call our earliest stages \"life.\" By wanting to argue that a newly conceived human isn't alive, we are creating an exception for humanity. We don't hesitate to call a sprouting tomato seed \"alive\" or imbued with \"life.\" Ditto for squirrel or chimpanzee embryos. But for political reasons, many find it convenient to speak of human embryos in a different way. Let's get the politics out of it and admit the truth and then say, \"So what? It's still the woman's right to do as she wants with her own body.\"\n\nI don't know of anyone who claims that an embryo or blastocyst is not alive in the biologic sense. The question is one of when the collection of cells becomes a 'person'. As Reggie pointed out, using inconsistent and imprecise terminology just confuses things.\n\nSo this thing with no heart, no brain, no jaw or opposable thumbs, no spine or sentience or nerves, this thing that we have to call an \"it\" because it doesn't even have a gender, you would call it human? Simply because it has the capacity to become human? You're one of those people that doesn't kill bugs, aren't you?\n\nBut they treat it like an embryo, not a human. Because it's not. They wouldn't be like \"Oh hello there Mr. embryo, let me just... shake your... your little hand there... and how are you today?\" An embryo's a monstrosity. You know it is. If you saw it writhing in a garbage can, you'd put it out of whatever little misery it's barely capable of. Okay that's a little dark. How about this? You wouldn't treat a half-cooked pancake like a pancake right? Because it's not yet. It needs to cook more before you can call it a real pancake and treat it like a pancake.\n\nNo, actually, my position is that \"It's a human embryo, but so what? The mother's control of her own body means that simply because it's in her doesn't give the state the right to control it. I simply ask that we talk about human embryos as unexceptional and that we speak of them consistent with way we would an embryonic squirrel, for example. Nobody is standing on their head to insist that squirrel embryos aren't squirrels or that they aren't really alive."}
{"text": "The ectopic pregnancy is not supposed to be removed until its death is imminent. That is the moral teaching. We have ultra sounds and testing to verify this. Most women who go to the ER in severe pain are usually experiencing a rupture and the fetus is generally in the act of dying. In that situation it is ok to remove the part of fallopian tube which has the dying fetus .\n\nIt is not morally permissable to remove the ectopic pregnancy upon discovery if there is no fetal distress. Doctors are supposed to wait and see while providing emotional and spiritual support to the mother. That is the way I understand it.\nDr. May is one of the leading ethicists on this topic.He wrote a book I and others recommend -Catholic Bioethics and the Gift of Human Life\n\nWell, if the child does not die in the action of taking the child out, it will die of being taken out. There is a difference between treating a tube (which will result in the child's death) and removing the child alone. In the former, the action is treating the mother, removing a section of the tube. In the latter the action is directed towards the baby, not treating the tube but treating the baby. In the case of removing the baby, the baby is killed by the means of removing the source it needs to live. If the doctors were planning on providing it with another source to live, it would be a different case (which is not what we are talking about). Since the doctors are not planning on doing anything, then it is killing the child.\n\nBTW, here's some info on how methotrexate can work:\n\"How does methotrexate work?\nMethotrexate can cause an early abortion by stopping the ongoing implantation process that occurs during the first several weeks after conception. It may also affect attachment of the embryo to the uterine wall. Misoprostol is the second drug used in this regimen which causes uterine contractions that expel the embryo.\"\n\n\" What methotrexate does is kill off the throphoblast cells which are the invading cells of the pregnancy and those that form the after birth or placenta. It is these that rupture the tube cause the pain and potential death of the mother. Once these die off, the pregnancy is lost and the whole pregnancy sac, including any baby that may be there, is reabsorbed by the mother. This is normal and happens in many cases of miscarriage. You may feel pain after being given methotrexate but this is due to the pregnancy sac swelling and not effects on the baby.\"\n\nFrom what it says here methotrexate is doing the same thing the doctor's would do by removing the baby. The baby dies of not being attached anymore. It is a different way of doing the same thing, yet it is wrong. There are different ways of killing the baby, but they are all killing the babyBased on my own personal reasoning, I agree with you.\n...This is probably the same reason that treating severe menstrual cramps using birth control pills is enough of a justification for the possible side effect of causing spontaneous abortions.\n\nThanks for your support. I just hope one day the distinction won't be necessary when the baby can be saved as well.\nThe two instances of suicide are perfect parallels for my (and your) logic.\nAs for treating cramps with pills... those must be some severely dehabilitating cramps to justify abortion! That's kind of alarming!\n\nAs for treating cramps with pills... those must be some severely dehabilitating cramps to justify abortion! That's kind of alarming!\n\nI'm a man, so I can't really say, but I assume they are.\n\nThe reason that I bring it up is because when I first learned that severe but non-life threatening medical problems could justify the use of treatments with abortive side effects, it didn't make sense to me that this would be enough justification, but the Church seems to teach that it is. Later, when I learned that removal of damaged fallopian tube justifies the \"accidental\" removal of the baby, even though it is precisely the part of the fallopian tube containing the baby that must be removed, I can't say that it made more sense, but at least the Church's teachings seemed more consistentI'm glad you are looking into it too. I'm not 100% sure, but it does seem to me that is what the Church teaches.\n\nA related question would be the case where an ectopic pregnancy is caught early. Is it allowable to remove the baby and tube at that point, or must the ectopic pregnancy be allowed to progress to the point where the damage to the fallopian tube is actually life-threatening by itself? removingUnless nature is defied, jumping on a grenade is killing yourself. But the possibility of God performing a miracle is not the justification for killing yourself; the possibility of God performing a miracle is merely what proves that the death is not intended as a means, but is truly an unintended side-effect. What actually justifies this lethal side-effect is the directly intended good effect.\n\nIt doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me either. But I guess we just have to keep on trying to conform our conscience to what the Church teaches.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by vluvski\nThis is consistent with the view that killing a baby can't really be justified by less important objectives, including the removal of a damaged fallopian tube.\n\nThis is consistent with the view that killing a baby can't really be justified by less important objectives, including the removal of a damaged fallopian tube.\n\nNot exactly, I don't think. In the case of the fallopian tube, the baby's death is unavoidable no matter how the tube is treated.\nIn the case of the birth control, it IS avoidable... by not having intercourse when a pregnancy is likely to occur. removingOk, we agree that in both cases (with or without tube) the baby will die, or at least has the same chance of survival. The difference is in one, the action is removing the tube (or section) and in the other it is removing the baby. As it is right now, the baby will die in either case, but the action being taken is different. The Church says its ok to remove a persons organ if it will save his/her life but it does not say its ok to remove a live child that will die due to this removal from his mother (abortion). The results are the same, but the means do matter."}

{"text": "Menu\n\nMonthly Archives: March 2010\n\nYesterday I got into a facebook discussion with a friend of a friend (read: stranger) over the new law in Utah regarding criminalizing miscarriages. The law was passed because a 17 year old girl who was 7 months pregnant paid a man $150 to beat her so she would miscarry. Because they couldn't charge her with anything criminal they changed the law so that any termination of pregnancy that isn't \"carried out by a physician or through a substance used under the direction of a physician\" is criminal homicide. Yes, including miscarriages.\n\nSadly, instead of discussing the most disturbing aspect of this bill, that because it uses the word \"reckless,\" anything from getting into a car accident to staying in a domestically abusive relationship could be considered grounds for homicide, the conversation sort of became a discussion of whether or not this particular girl deserves jail.\n\nThis stranger argued that the bill is justified because, well, because abortion is murder, and only doctors should be able to murder, I suppose? She said that the girl decided to do it after her boyfriend threatened to leave her, so obviously, \"she very selfishly decided that a baby was a burden and would end her relationship with her boyfriend; so the baby had to die.\" This is a characterization that I've heard a lot, that girls who have abortions, especially late-term abortions, are selfish, shallow, callous women who make these decisions on a whim. But I am privy to some important information that I'm going to share with you now: Humans don't act that way.\n\nWomen don't end pregnancies on a whim, and they don't delay abortions because they are lazy or stupid or shallow. And in this case, a woman PAID a man to beat her up. He took her to a basement and kicked and bit her repeatedly. There is no universe where a woman wakes up and thinks, \"eh\u2026I don't want to lose my date for prom\u2026I'll pay this guy to physically injure me.\"\n\nIt's entirely possible that she did it because her boyfriend was going to leave her, and not because Utah requires parental consent (not just notification) for anyone under 18, or because there are only 3 clinics in the state, all of which are in Salt Lake (a four and a half hour drive from the county this girl lived in), or because once you find a way to get out of school and make the trip there is a mandatory 24 hour waiting period. But if that is true, I'm going to guess it's not as simple as Todd not wanting to date a teen mom. If this boyfriend was also the father, than maybe this girl didn't think she would have any support, emotionally or financially without him. And a boyfriend demanding you have an abortion sounds more than a little controlling and manipulative. We don't know the nature of their relationship but a woman who is willing to hire a man to beat her is not choosing between a movie date and a baby shower. Teen mothers aren't monsters who enjoy thinking of terrible things to do to their unborn fetuses. Humans don't act that way.\n\nThe way to stop women from seeking illegal abortions is not to criminalize miscarriages, it's to make contraception and sex education easily accessible. Restricting abortions only serves to increase rates of unsafe abortions. And that's a proven fact."}

{"text": "Of all the definitions I've read or heard of that most elusive of words, the one that comes closest to capturing love's essence is simply this: love is the movement out of narcissism. The true opposite of love is not hate but egocentrism, for hate can often be rechanneled back into love, but egocentrism prevents us from ever moving out of ourselves toward the other. Love is extinguished more quickly by apathy and indifference than it is by either jealousy or wrath. To be healthy, love must be like the Jordan River, a living, flowing conduit linking one sea to the next. When it ceases to flow outward, when it narcissistically holds within itself that which flows into it, then it becomes as stagnant and barren as the Dead Sea. broke in 2011. There would be something rich, if it weren't so infuriating, about these (almost uniformly male, as it happens) reporters and commentators scrambling to break open this shocking untold story. You know, the one that was written about here, here and here, to name some disparate sources.\n\n1) Though the New York Times ran three brief stories when the Gosnell story broke in 2011, they have, as of this writing, only mentioned the trial in one story just when it started, on March 18: not a word since.\n\n2) The Washington Post's health issues reporter directly says she's not covering the Gosnell trial because it's just a local issue with no broader significance.\n\nSo so ahead, Irin Carmon, just say stuff. Your audience won't bother to find out whether any of it is true.\n\nBut Carmon is right about one big thing: that seriously left and passionately pro-choice people have covered the story. As Ross Douthat tweeted earlier today: \"Gap in Gosnell coverage between lefty blogs and MSM reflects the difference between consistent pro-Roe view and pro-choice self-deception. In consistent pro-Roe view, Gosnell just makes case for having more doctors trained/willing/brave enough to perform safe late-term abortions.\" And Matt Frost added, \"One side sees the Gosnell case, thinks: 'abortion is an atrocity.' Other side says, 'abortion is too unsafe.' The 'center' just can't look.\"\n\nThe same media that gives daily attention to trivialities in slow news cycles does not find the mass-murder of live-born babies to be newsworthy. How can this be? How could they possibly pass up this story? Could it possibly be that they understand the implications of this story? Perhaps if the American public sees reports on the killing of live-born babies, they might conclude that there really isn't any real moral difference between the live-born babies and the unborn ones. Perhaps the public might recognize the moral insanity of suggesting that a baby in the birth canal is killable while that same baby outside the birth canal is not.\n\nHere's the bottom line. What happened in Gosnell's clinic exposes not just his crimes. It also underlines the moral bankruptcy of pro-choice arguments that routinely and callously disregard the humanity of the unborn. The entire pro-choice position requires persons to ignore the personhood of unborn persons who die daily in those clinics. That reality cannot bear the light of day, and that is why Gosnell and every other perpetrator like him are enjoying a media blackout.There is a wonderful irony here. It is this: The onset of individual life is not a dogma of the church but a fact of science. How much more convenient if we lived in the 13th century, when no one knew anything about microbiology and arguments about the onset of life were legitimate. Compared to a modern textbook of embryology, Thomas Aquinas sounds like an American Civil Liberties Union member. Nowadays it is not some misguided ecclesiastics who are trying to suppress an embarrassing scientific fact. It is the secular juridical-journalistic establishment.\n\nPlease indulge the novelist if he thinks in novelistic terms. Picture the scene. A Galileo trial in reverse. The Supreme Court is cross-examining a high school biology teacher and admonishing him that of course it is only his personal opinion that the fertilized human ovum is an individual human life. He is enjoined not to teach his private beliefs at a public school. Like Galileo he caves in, submits, but in turning away is heard to murmur, \"But it's still alive!\"\n\nTo pro-abortionists: According to the opinion polls, it looks as if you may get your way. But you're not going to have it both ways. You're going to be told what you're doing.\n\nThose who deny the scientific fact of when human life begins do so to avoid having to engage the troubling moral and ethical considerations of abortion. This can be a genuine cognitive dissonance or straightforward, cowardly dishonesty."}

{"text": "Problems Solutions and Trade Offs II Those descriptions are indeed accurate and reflect the intention behind the controversial essay. It was my intention to write a column that would identify absurd arguments as a means of drawing out the flawed reasoning of those who would support Romney's proposed rape exception to a law banning abortion. I elaborate on each flaw below:\n\n1. Viability and Humanity. Many of my readers were upset by my suggestion that the idea of killing the innocent product of rape because it reminded the victim of rape could also be used to justify killing an innocent man who bore a physical resemblance to the rapist. Readers stated that the \"obvious\" difference was that the product of rape was attached to the woman and dependent upon her for survival (whereas the rapist's double was unattached to the victim). That is nothing more than a restatement of the viability argument used to deny the humanity of the unborn and, therefore, provide abortion on demand, not just in instances of rape. It is wholly irrelevant to the issue of whether the product of rape is an innocent human being. Once again, those who seek to justify the rape exception undermine the initial rule against abortion, without which no exception could exist. That rule is predicated upon the simple principle that killing innocent human beings is wrong. Once we abandon the rule and fashion an exception we enter dangerous territory.\n\nThose who raise the issue of viability must remain focused of the issue of innocence. That will lead to the correct conclusion that killing someone to assuage the painful memory of rape is only justifiable if that person is also responsible for the rape. Once again, my position is simple: execute the guilty perpetrator of rape, not the innocent product of rape. Although both are human beings, regardless of \"viability,\" one is guilty and the other is innocent. No other distinction matters.\n\n2. Consent and Punishments. Some readers responded by saying that the rule against abortion was justified only if the woman consented to the sex and that an exception is justified only because she did not. Such reasoning is both dangerous and irrelevant to the central issue in the abortion debate"}

I don't want to waste my time with strawmen, though.\n\nSo, if you are Pro Choice and believe that the status of the fetus matters, is this definition more or less correct? Do you have a different definition?\n\n1 (2) a bipedal primate mammal (Homo sapiens) that is anatomically related to the great apes but distinguished especially by notable development of the brain with a resultant capacity for articulate speech and abstract reasoning, is usually considered to form a variable number of freely interbreeding races, and is the sole living representative of the hominid family; broadly : any living or extinct hominid d (1) : one possessing in high degree the qualities considered distinctive of manhood\n\nWhat separates humans from animals from both a scientific and philosophical perspective is the mind. Therefore, when the brain has developed to a point of potentiality where cognitive processes unique to the human mind can begin to develop, the fetus has begun its growth process as a human being. This is, what, 6 months in or something? I don't know when the brain activity shifts in the fetal stage, but it's somewhere around there.\n\nFrom another incorporeal perspective, our reason and will separate us from the instinctive animals. But the potential for this growth can only begin to develop at a certain point in the process, as mentioned earlier. Assigning the value of being human to a non-human entity is degrading to us, and therefore there is a distinction between early stages in the development of a fetus and the growth of a human being.\n\nI'm pretty sure this was agreed upon, but some people even claim that the potential for the mind's growth doesn't begin until born. Either way, zygotes are out.\n\nI define a person as an individual who is at least minimally aware of their surroundings. Alternately, a person can be defined as someone to whom a person of the first definition is viscerally attached.\n\nTherefore, to me, a fetus in the early stages of development is not a person according to the inherent (first) definition. However, if the mother is attached to the fetus--if she wants the eventual child, if she considers the fetus a person--then, for legal purposes, IMHO, the fetus should be considered a person. Deliberately inducing a miscarriage in a woman who wants to carry the pregnancy to term should be a serious legal offense.\n\nIn the later stages, it gets iffy. I personally wouldn't have an abortion much past the first trimester--that's what adoption's for--but I wouldn't condemn a woman who disagreed. It's her body. She has no obligation to allow another being--person or not--to reside inside it, to suck nourishment from it. She is no more legally obligated to keep that fetus/person in her body than you are to house homeless people in your living room. Or--maybe more appropriately--no more obligation to do so than a parent has to donate a kidney to their child, or a brother has to donate to his sister, or you have to donate to a complete stranger.\n\nYes, there may be moral obligations--indeed, I certainly believe there are. It's not a choice that I would make. But it is a choice I should be allowed to make. And, if I am not going to allow an inviable fetus to stay in my body, then the only kind thing to do is to make sure there's no chance of suffering.\n\nSo, personhood is a dividing line for me, but not for the legal status of abortion. But my definition is above.\n\nAs I noted in another thread the answer is partly objective and partly subjective.\n\nI think it is abundantly clear that anyone can see the difference between a blastocyst and a fetus 1 day away from birth.\n\nSomething changed during those nine months so we move forward from the fertilized egg and backwards from the nearly born fetus to find where the line is drawn.\n\nEventually we get to a gray area. The earliest a fetus is viable outside the womb is around 6 months of gestation. Of course modern medical science allows that. One hundred years ago I doubt such a premature baby would have a chance in hell of surviving.\n\nSo, where is the bright line drawn where one moment we say \"not a person\" and the next where we say \"person\"?\n\nBirth itself is about the only actual bright line but I think few people could view the fetus 10 seconds before birth as devoid of personhood than it is 10 seconds later after birth.\n\nIn the end, as with so many things in society, we need to balance different rights. Seems reasonable giving a woman six months to make up her mind is more than sufficient to protect her rights to her body and her choice. Eventually though the rights of the fetus supplant hers in most cases (life of the mother being an exception I'd say).\n\nWhere is it a person? No one can say with certainty.\n\nHell, try to come up with a hard and fast definition of \"life\" (which I think you can substitute for \"person\" in this context). Seems simple but actually it is an elusive target and to date has not really been done despite the efforts of a lot of smart philosophers and scientists.\n\nSiccinctly, I think if you don't have a functioning human brain, you're not a person. I gather that \"6 months in\" is a good marker for that, though I admit I haven't looked into it much. Even if that varies a little it from case to case I think that would be a fine legal demarcation for defining when elective abortions cease to be available.\n\nSupposing that \"A seed is a tree!\" and \"my pastor says so!\" aren't good arguments, is there any argument for an earlier cutoff?\n\nThis question is partially a red herring. I say \"partially\" because certainly some people who are pro-choice do indeed consider it important to their view on the subject that the fetus ( / embryo / blastocyte) is \"not a person\".\n\nBut only some of us.\n\nMe, I'm comfortable making the following stipulations:b) Abortion is killing. It is other things, too (medical procedure; termination of unwanted medical condition; exercise of the right to make one's own reproductive decisions; etc) but except in the case where the implanted conception-product is already dead, abortion kills it.\n\nc) Abortion is therefore the killing of a person.\n\nI'm pro-choice. I think abortion should be legally available to any pregnant person. Period. No qualifiers. I'm OK with Roe v Wade as a compromise.\n\nI ask for the following stipulations from anyone who is NOT pro-choice:\n\na) Not all killing is murder, or even immoral. While I am not going to point to any specific example as being just like abortion (nothing precisely is), it is generally held that to kill in one's self-defense is neither immoral nor murder; it is held by the majority of people, if not by everyone, that to kill in combat as a soldier in wartime is also neither immoral nor murder; and in triage considerations (military or medical) it is generally accepted that it is sometimes necessary to cause the death of some via the taking of action designed to save the lives and/or establish the goals of others.\n\nb) We have a general abhorrence towards the killing of human beings, but it does not have the status of an \"absolute value\". When and where it is wrong, it is wrong for a reason. Normatively it is an assault upon the person who is being killed insofar as that person has a consciousness containing plans, history, and intentions, all of which investments are lost prematurely when the person is killed. Normatively it is also an assault upon the person's family friends associates and community as well, insofar as that person has understandings and skills, relationships utilitarian and emotional, and has likely been the subject of investments of time and resources, all of which are again lost prematurely when the person is killed. Perhaps there are other reasons whereby it might be concluded that it is wrong to kill a person, but the argument has to be asserted and defended; establishing simply that a person would be killed does not ipso facto make something morally wrong.\n\nc) There may therefore be legitimate grounds and legitimate perspectives from which any given abortion may be deemed appropriate and necessary and not immoral. A decision is therefore required, either across-the-board (applying to all abortions) or categorical (in which case abortion situations must be categorized, and therefore categorized by someone), or individually (in which case each individual abortion situation must be evaluated on its own merits independently). Therefore it is a matter of critical importance to decide who should be making those decisions, and whether to try to make them once for all situations, to create a categorical structure and a decision-making structure for evaluations situations to categorize them, or to deal with each individual case on its own merits.\n\nA fetus becomes a person sometime between the start of brain activity and the ability to survive outside the womb. Never before the beginning of brain activity, though, even if technology advanced to allow development from a petri dish.\n\nHowever this is all my opinion, and I wouldn't force it on any woman who is actually carrying a fetus. Sometimes it is okay to say there is no real answer to a question like this.\n\nPersonhood is a matter of mental function; of awareness, thought. When, exactly a fetus achieves what level of mental functions isn't something science can define well yet. But it certainly requires a brain that has its basic functions up and running. Six months is about where it starts showing human brainwaves, but that's so basic that it probably doesn't qualify as a person yet. And it's unlikely that there's a neat, objective bright line that one can point to.\n\nAnd yes it applies universally, which is why it's moral to dismember the brain dead for their organs. THEY are gone; only the biological machinery remains. One reason I oppose the pro-birth definition of human life is that it inevitably defines the brain dead as people too. And as said, it degrades personhood to define personhood that way.\n\nAs AHunter points out, we may not define 'person' based on location, but we certainly use it to determine where their lives and deaths fit on the scale of 'most tragic' to 'least tragic.' See: enemy troops, civilian casualties, slave labor, developing countries, elder care, prisonersShort answer: A fetus becomes a person some time between conception and birth.\n\nLong answer: Well...\n\nThe question seems to assume that there is a discreet point at which a fetus becomes a human, and I see that as one of the great obstacles in discussing the abortion issue. If only it were that easy, then we could define what it means to be human and draw a line at that point.\n\nI think that everyone other than the most ideologically driven in the abortion debate recognize the difference between a zygote and a fetus at 9 months. There's really not a point at which person-hood happens, but rather a process of becoming a person.Wait, what? How do you arrive at this conclusion? Among other various problems, \"To be human is to be a person\" means that removing a fingernail clipping is murder, because it's a human fingernail clipping.\n\nYou can't just handwave away the question of whether the thing in question is a fetus, a baby, a person, or a tumor. If we're talking about something that is human but not a person, then it's simply not a person, and we shouldn't entertain the idea for any reason. Doing so just invites people to base arguments on the error need needPretty messed up thinking thereSorry, just to clarify, I know that this quote isn't your position on things, I was just trying to expand on it. Even a 'born' baby might be directly sucking resources...After a certain point, laws kick into place preventing parents from denying their child sufficient support, which goes a fair bit beyond breastfeeding, unless they go throug a legal procedure that moves those legal responsibilities elsewhere. However, best as I can tell, the point those laws kick in is birth, or at least closer to birth than conceptionSure any adult can do it but some adult has to do it or the baby will die. As such the child is siphoning resources from some caretaker. Time and moneyTo be clear I am not arguing with you but YogSoth's take on it. He departs from us in that he feels the mother should be allowed to kill the baby right up to the instant before the umbilical is cut. As such I think he is stretching the notion that it is a parasite thus at the whim of the mother out of all recognition. I merely extended that notion to try to portray its absurdity and show how it is morally bankrupt.\n\nBy-and-large I personally feel the same as you on the subject (as you just described it).Personally I don't see survivability as being relevent to personhood - it's relevent to responsibility for that person's survival. That is, there is a level of hardship we do not ask people to do, even to save another person's life. So, if we presume a fetus has finally become person, then we shouldn't kill it on a whim - which explains why most pro-choicers oppose casual abortion in the third trimester.\n\nFor most of us, the key issue is whether the fetus counts as a person yet. I suppose some people could base this on viability, but that doesn't make sense to me; I do it by cognition and levels of intelligence. Below a certain level, it's not a person to me, and I feel it can be killed with impunity regardless of it's viability. An adult cow is certainly a viable independent organism, and I'm fine with it being killed for trivial reasonsWhatever personhood is, it has to be something related to our minds, so a thing without a mind cannot be a person. Exactly what level of mind is necessary is a gray area, and difficult to pin down: A five year old dog has, in most respects, greater mental capacity than a newborn human, and yet most will agree that the newborn human has a greater degree of personhood than the dog. But certainly a human zygote or embryo before the development of nervous tissue cannot be a person, and probably not one before the start of brain activity.\n\nPersonhood cannot be defined in terms of being human, because doing so fails to account both for nonhuman persons and nonperson human things. In the former case, angels, aliens, artificially intelligent computers, and elves (without comment on whether any of those exist) should all be regarded as persons, even though none of them are human. By contrast, a HeLa culture is undoubtedly human in a biological sense, and is alive and self-sufficient, but can't by any stretch be called a personThis brings up an interesting point to me (as have many other posts in this thread). I've often wondering if there is any research going on anywhere into transplanting human embryoes. Research I've done shows that it is done with animals (cattle and such). I recognize that there are ethical considerations (for example, we don't know what detrimental effect this might have on the embryo), but it seems to me, for those who feel very strongly that abortion is murder and want to save babies, it seems like that might be one way to do it. Does anyone know if there is such research being done? Or can anyone explain to me why that's not an option?\n\nHope this isn't too much of a \"Hi, Jack!\" If it is, I could mebbe start a thread...If you don't believe in souls, as I do not, defining a person is far more problematic. Clearly, if cognition (or, potential cognition) is an essential component to being a person, then a late-term fetus which might be viable has a much stronger claim to personhood than a zygote.\n\nThe next question is simply what does the law require regarding protecting the rights of a fetus to the degree a fetus is definable as a person. In short, a person is what the Law (to the degree it is enforceable by the State) says it is. Presently, in the U.S. and in most industrialized nations, a fetus is not a person with rights endowed by the State, but a baby is. There will never be a clear line that can be drawn to the satisfaction of everyone, unless God himself comes down and defines an ultimate Law. Since that has not and will not happen, we're stuck with human Law.\n\nWhat becomes obvious in any discussion like this is that there will be no agreement on any of these points.Another problem with that argument is that even if they do have souls, so what? If a mindless lump of cells can have a soul, that's just an argument for souls not being important. They might as well argue that rocks have souls so we shouldn't dig minesThe attraction that m/f have for each other I believe is the desire of the woman to give life to a certain aspect of that man, to have a child - regardless of what her mind says it's her heart that desires the child. As such the female selects the child her soul/heart wants and desires. The child is part of the soul of the father at this time. During the sexual union that child is being coaxed to separate him/herself from the man and become a total person. Once that child agrees with that a new person is formed totally complete. IMHO Physically this would happen at ejaculationCome now, souls make things very simple. You simply declare that your god told you that zygotes get souls at conception, so they're babies and people and miscarrages are murder. Done!\n\nAnd liberals quoting the bible don't count as an authority; only his pastor paraphrasing what might be in the bible is. It's divine inspirationed interpretation, see.\n\nOn preview: Aaand there you have your divine inspirationed interpretation! Pastor-free! (And wet dreams are murder!)\n\nYou proceed from a false assumption - that pro-choicers feelings about \"what makes a person\" or when a \"fetus\" is a \"person\" makes any difference.\n\nTo me - being pro-choice is recognizing that my feelings and beliefs have no role in those of the person doing the choosing - I could feel/believe that every sperm is sacred and its only purpose is to be shoved into a vagina for procreation - but that has no bearing on what someone else might believe, or what they should choose to do with the parasite that is growing within them.This is my POV, somewhat, but I don't agree with your conclusion. The fetus is a parasite and until it is viable the mother should be able to choose to eject it from her body. Once it is viable and no longer needs to be attached to the mother to survive, I'm against termination. Viability is difficult to define - 23 weekers have survived on rare occasions, and in my mind there's a question mark over whether a very prem baby can be called viable if it's early birth is likely to result in moderate to severe health problems and disabilities. That's something that would need to be hashed out after a lot more research than I'm prepared to do this morning.\n\nA parasite is something that will die without being attached to a host. A newborn is not attached to a host and can be passed from one carer to another without difficulty. Therefore, I do not believe that even a helpless newborn can be called a parasite, they are simply a dependant.\n\nI can neither hunt, nor farm. I can only survive because other people do these things for me. Does that mean I'm not a person?\n\nYou have the capability of learning if you really have to. IEmbryo, Zygote, fetus-- anything in the womb is clearly not a person. It won't survive at it's present state if removed.\n\nBabies - ALSO not people. They are not capable of making decisions providing care for themselves. They need a grown person to provide.\n\nI can only consider beings capable of surviving on their own as people. Not necessarily in a society sense. I don't care how much their money earning potential is.\n\nAnd no, souls don't exist just because you want them to.\n\nThanks!Heck man, I wouldn't know when it was ripe. (I'm a nightmare in a kitchen, seriously.) At this point you are talking about deficiencies in knowledge, experience, and/or education, and if that's where we're going then I'm going to start slowly edging out of the room again, before somebody blindsides me with a question about european history or something and decides I'm subhuman based on the results.\n\nI often get the impression from anti-abortion types that their point of view is dependent upon the existence of a \"soul\" or something like that.\n\nFor some, that's surely true. Then you have people like Dr. Bernard Nathanson, who left NARAL to join the pro-life side. He did so while still an atheist, so presumably, the notion of a soul had no bearing on his decision.\n\nQuote:\n\nSince the person-defining \"soul\" has zero scientific validity....\n\nIf you mean that it cannot be detected by science, that's true... but only because science is the wrong instrument to use. The soul, if it exists, is non-material; hence, its existence is a metaphysical question rather than a scientific one. Beauty, ethics, and morality cannot be detected by science either, yet few of us would dismiss these notions are being nonsensical.\n\nI'd still need someone to teach me, making me dependent on the teacher.\n\nQuote:\n\nISure, if I were stranded on an island populated with the docile and domesticated end result of ten thousand years of animal husbandry, I'd probably be able to get by, too. But I'm still relying on the work of ten thousand years worth of cattle farmers to get by. If I have to hunt down a wild aurochs for dinner, my survivability is significantly impaired.\n\nOf course, the issue of disease and injury puts an entirely different spin on your definition of personhood. About two years back, I had to have surgery to correct a life threatening condition. It's not something I could have done myself, even if I had medical training. Did I lose my status as a person for the duration of my medical treatment?"}

{"text": "Tuesday, October 21, 2008\n\nAbortion, Unveiled\n\nHaving a conversation with an Obama supporter I heard yet again the argument \"nobody is pro-abortion.\" This made me wonder just why it is that people who support legal abortion as an option don't want to be called pro-abortion? This seems to me to say quite a deal. If as they often contend that it is not a child and just a lump of tissue of the equivalent of a tadpole then what is the big deal if I or someone else call you pro-abortion. Why should their be any argument about this and why shouldn't they be proudly pro-abortion? If they are not pro-abortion then do they think they are anti-abortion? Is there a middle ground where you are neither for or against abortion? Don't think so.\n\nBesides the definition of \"pro\" that applies is \"an argument in favor of a course of action.\" If you say that abortion is an acceptable course of action then you are in fact pro-abortion. There is often an equivocation about letting it be a choice for somebody else to make. But again if you support somebody in their choice of action you are in favor of that action happening. If I said it was okay for an individual to choose to go around shooting people or not based on their preference, I would in fact be pro-murder even if I never shot someone myself.\n\nDo read the whole thing; it's a good exploration of a curious bit of verbal engineering. There's a reason that pro-aborts will talk about choice and reproductive freedom and the rights to one's own body (never mind the body of the unborn child) and so on, but never use the word \"abortion\" to describe what they're talking about.\n\nOne thing that has always bothered me terribly is the language of \"choice\" from a strictly grammatical standpoint. Politicians and pundits and writers who should know better will prattle on and on about \"a woman's right to choose\" while blithely overlooking the simple fact that the verb \"choose\" is a transitive verb; it must have an object! I myself could say that I'm in favor of \"a woman's right to choose:\" her husband, her outfit, that cute pair of shoes she saw at Macy's, chocolate in large quantities, blogs to read, adult beverages--the list is endless. But if by \"a woman's right to choose (insert direct object)\" you mean \"a woman's right to choose to pay someone to kill her unborn offspring by some hideous method of execution or other that completely disrespects the child's inherent and inviolable right to life\" then of course I'm going to oppose that--and I'm going to think pretty poorly of people who don't.\n\nOf course, some of the dodginess around the word \"abortion\" comes from the fact that \"abortion\" means \"paying someone to kill your unborn offspring by some hideous method of execution or other that completely disrespects the child's inherent and inviolable right to life.\" And those who support legalized abortion don't really want to admit that, so they pretend it's possible to support other people's so-called right to do exactly that without actually having to admit they think it's a pretty good idea.\n\nWhich puts abortion supporters in the position of claiming that there's this fundamental human right out there, which belongs to every woman, but which it's impolitic to name let alone describe even while you loudly and fiercely insist that you support it to the hilt. It's as if people championed the \"right to choose\" to vote, while whispering the word \"vote\" as if it were an obscenity, and absolutely refusing to explain touch-screen ballots, hanging or dimpled chads, or other nitty-gritty details of the actual act of voting.\n\nJeff Miller is right: this makes no sense at all, but we've been letting abortion supporters get by with the \"personally opposed, but\" dodge for far too long. We need to make them say out loud what it is they support; we need to insist that they give \"choose\" its object; we need to fight for the linguistic clarity that shows the ugly horror of abortion stripped of all its gauzy euphemisms.\n\n5 comments:\n\nRebecca\nsaid...\n\nWell said. I am really amazed, recently, at the fact that the \"pro-choicers\" don't even seem to be pro-choice anymore; that is, they get really irritated if a woman chooses to do anything except abort her child. If you were pro-choice, why would it bother you that a woman might choose her mind if she saw a picture of the child in her womb? Don't you want the woman to make an informed decision? Wouldn't it be awful to have the woman make this decision based on the idea that she thought she was extricating a blob of tissue, whereas she would have made a completely different decision if she had just seen a picture? Why is it so irritating that a girl might choose to keep her baby after talking with her parents? Why are they so angry that more than three hundred women have chosen to keep their babies because of some people standing on the sidewalk praying? Did they interview those women, and did those women feel coerced into choosing against abortion? Why are people anxious to make up for the income planned parenthood lost through those changed minds? Is it about income, or about choice? I don't get it.\n\nLet me suggest this: So called \"choice\" is really about the negation of humanity. Now most people, even many that support abortion, are unwilling to sign on to this. BUT, having lost on the \"Is it Human?\" question, we are witnessing a shift. More and more we see abortion defenders concede that yeah, the fetus is human, but it is still justifiable to kill it. And so while we see people who quail at the prospect of showing pregnant women pictures of their babies in the womb and the gory pictures of abortions, we are also seeing people say women have to buck up, be able to look at these pictures, and still choose abortion. They are essentially telling us to anesthetize our conscience.\n\nGreat post, Erin. The pro-abortionists (and yes, I'll call them that- if they want to label me anti-abortion that's just dandy with me) have stolen the semantics of life from us. Utterly ridiculous. Another fun word is \"feminist\" and all its implications. I, for one, prefer the term \"JPII Feminist\" or \"Authentic Feminist\" rather than \"I want to destroy any differnce betwen genders\" sort of feminist. But that's just me. :-) wholly to You.

{"text": "A conservative (more or less) correspondent wrote to me of his dismay and despair about the freak show that is the Republican Party's contenders for president. Even though I'm not sure birth control is a right, what do we get out of calling Sandra Fluke a slut and a prostitute? he asked me. That's a right? We're going to fight for this? What do we get out of this?\n\nI wrote back to him that to understand why people object to the requirement to include birth control as part of preventative health services, we have to understand something about human reproduction.\n\nWhich is it kills women without modern medical intervention: in absolutely huge, horrendous, terrifying numbers. He'd seen the numbers I put up in Women in the Line of Fire, which estimates 840,429 maternal deaths in America just between 1900 and 1960, vs. 602,451 battle deaths, overwhelmingly of male troops between the Revolutionary and Korean Wars (or 1,079, 245 deaths if you add disease/non-battle deaths to combat deaths). Death in war for men was an episodic tragedy, death in childbirth for women, a constant bloodletting of women in their most economically and intellectually productive years. I once had access to a pre-colonial-era genealogical database, and I was absolutely haunted by how many men had two, three, four wives\u2014and this was the elite of pre-Revolutionary America. I could never bear to do a serious count, but an educated guess is that probably half the wives of those men died either of complications of pregnancy like pre-eclampsia, in childbirth, or of complications of childbirth. The men, of course, were all named. Many of their wives were not. They were impregnated and bred\u2014married women had no right to their own bodies; sex was their marital duty\u2014to death. Those women who didn't die were often horribly injured during childbirth, whereupon their husbands often took a mistress or imposed themselves upon the female household help. (Those who say that husbands should not be present in the delivery room because it might lessen their libido miss the point that this is a natural and desirable reaction to the suffering and even death that is the natural result of sexual intercourse. The woman, after all, must endure whether or not her man is there with her.) Then the widower, needing someone to run his house and care for his children, would marry another woman and repeat the process over again. For most of human history, then, it is extremely likely that at least half of all female deaths were either due to reproductive causes, or other causes that were greatly aggravated by pregnancy and childbirth.\n\nYes, men died young. But there was absolutely no comparable vulnerability men had to women\u2014and these men (for these people were of the Tory class) left some kind of mark upon their societies. Their names were all handed down in that database. They were not anonymous.\n\nThis dreadful interchangeability and anonymity is the social meaning we humans gave to the hideous biological fact of maternal mortality, and it lingers long after maternal mortality rates began to plummet in the developed world. It's probably one reason so many early feminists of the 60s and 70s refused to have children. They grew up in a world where their mother and their female relatives had died or been grievously injured in childbirth or had close friends who had or had been. In fact, it's probably one major, if unspoken, reason that any woman who refuses to bear children does so. Another way to put it is, the human female body isn't made to bear children. If our bodies were, we would give birth easily, at low risk, without public health measures such as sanitation and vaccination, pre- and post-natal care, medical intervention and supervision\u2014to include both cesareans and abortions\u2014and we simply don't.\n\nIn the context of this biological reality, birth control that we can use\u2014if need be without our male partner's knowledge or permission\u2014is one of the world's great public health triumphs. Moreover, because morality is not a matter of \"God says\" or \"It is written\" or \"In the name of Allah\"\u2014for God is neither a citizen nor a human being\u2014but the reduction of unnecessary suffering and harm borne by other human beings and yes, animals, the availability and indeed provision of such birth control to women and adolescent girls is a profoundly moral thing.\n\nThe most common and effective type of birth control that a woman or adolescent girl can use herself\u2014again if need be without male knowledge or permission\u2014is birth control pills (BCPs). And even if some BCPs are $8 or 9 a pack in America, that does not mean that others are not $100 a pack. Sometimes the difference is one of advertising but often it's not. Like hormone replacement therapy, BCPs use synthetic and natural anabolic steroids that are far more powerful than testosterone to intervene, regulate and control a hormone cycle that is more complex than the male. Getting dosage and timing wrong can be, to put it very mildly, extremely unpleasant, while working with an experienced doctor or nurse practitioner can minimize or eliminate the unpleasantness, even misery of an inappropriate prescription. If an $8-9 pack of BCPs works for you, great. If it doesn't, we still need birth control that works for us.\n\nThis is because sex\u2014including sexual intercourse\u2014like food and shelter, is a basic human need, so deep that it can override even a woman's need to live, rather than a male need women exist to satisfy. For women to have sex\u2014including sexual intercourse\u2014voluntarily with partners we want and enjoy, and controlling our fertility ourselves, without fear of an unwanted\u2014for whatever reason\u2014pregnancy is, then, profoundly moral. Unfortunately, all too many women and girls have sex all too often under conditions of manipulation and coercion that, if the law recognized as force what women and girls perceive as force when it used against us, would be considered rape. At the same time, prostitution and pornography are multi-billion dollar industries predicated upon extraordinarily violent crime\u2014and defended as freedom of choice, commerce, and speech. And even when women and girls have sex under conditions of authentic, meaningful consent, and\u2014if women\u2014are physically and emotionally capable of motherhood, having a child changes and limits our lives in the way it does not a man's life.\n\nBecause the bond between mothers and children for all of human history until half a century ago\u2014less than an eyeblink\u2014was not labor and delivery or nursing, but death. The value of our lives and our intellect is still circumscribed by the deep memory that the warrant for our deaths was signed at menarch, and to give one's daughter in marriage was to give her to the man who might kill her. If sex, particularly sexual intercourse, was used as a means of dominance and control, even unto death by abortion or in childbirth, a man who loved his woman lived with the terrible knowledge that the sex and the child she, too, wanted might kill her, and if so, he was the instrument of her death\u2014and very likely, their child's as well.\n\nThese, then, are the reasons women and adolescent girls need access to birth control: because freedom begins with the body. Ask any slave whether it doesn't. This is true for men, and no one would claim that a man or boy who cannot control his body is free. But it is even truer for women. For all the horrible, hideous things done to the male body\u2014whether by criminals, the enemy in war, or the state\u2014the perpetrators are usually other men and men are not usually controlled by sexual and reproductive means or for those purposes. Sex and reproduction, however, are the dominant and pervasive means of and excuse for controlling women and girls; this control is uniquely intimate, often astoundingly violent even in comparison to the violence done to men by other men, and has lifelong consequences. Finally, calling a woman a slut and a prostitute (as Ms. Fluke was called) has traditionally been used to justify any sexual violence (or non-sexual violence during the course of a sexual attack) visited upon a woman.\n\nThe vote may have given women a say in their lives, and modern medicine saved our lives wholesale, but it is access to contraception that frees women from the tyranny of reproduction and reproductive control.\n\nSo then, to answer my friend's question, what does what remains of the Republican Party get out of fighting women's access to birth control?\n\nCruelty. Knowing, deliberate cruelty towards women\u2014half the species. (The opposition to renewing the Violence Against Women Act is more of the same.) Mothers, sisters, lovers, wives, friends. The only way that birth control on our own behalf as individuals as a fundamental right is debatable is if you think women should not be able to control our fertility ourselves, without the permission of anyone else. If you want to debate that, then do so on the grounds of the facts outlined above, rather than demonstrably false claims of morality or religious freedom.\n\nThe arguments against birth control are usually made by extremely privileged men to mostly men but also some women, who are profoundly hurt, angry, and humiliated\u2014and not nearly as privileged. Their audience is that group of Americans who have a little left to lose, and can see themselves losing it, and react by wanting to hurt others whom it is safe to hurt. How can you hurt the big corporations and banks/financial institutions that have destroyed your work and your savings\u2014who fund these extremely privileged men\u2014who are campaigning for the Republican nomination and then the Presidency\u2014who don't have the slightest intention of biting the hand that funds their campaigns and lifestyles? The fact is that the Personhood Pledge, to which Romney, Santorum, Gingrich and Paul are all signatories, is the closest the Republican Party comes to a comprehensive jobs program. Leaving aside the practical matter of passing an amendment that defines personhood as occurring at the moment of conception is the brutal insult and diminution of women. To equate an undifferentiated cluster of cells with the female individual it exists inside and cannot possibly exist without means that that cluster of cells matters more than her dreams, fears and hopes. She is reduced to a host whether her pregnancy is longed-for and anticipated or a heart-breaking catastrophe. And this Pledge pretends that if women were once again subject to the tyranny of reproduction and childcare, their life options dependent on what the men in their lives choose to permit them, all would be well for men and women too.\n\nA quick look at any society in the world where this is true should disabuse one of this notion. Afghanistan is just one case in point: the fact is that what we learn in the home becomes normal to us. We take it out into the world and it informs how we treat others and how we expect to be treated. Another way to say this is that real democracy cannot exist without women's self-control and reproductive freedom. Because we are half of society and what happens to us profoundly effects that society.\n\nWhat the Republican Party gets out of the screeching over contraception is an offer of something evil and ugly to men\u2014and to the women who want to be their enforcers. The possibility of real, lasting control over the women in their lives, particularly their sexual partners, as well as a sop to their pride, in the offer of unearned moral authority at the real expense of others.\n\nIn the framework of the facts above, the attempt to withhold contraception from as many women as possible\u2014whether it is employers refusing to provide contraceptive coverage or refusing to fund Planned Parenthood or pharmacists refusing to fill prescriptions or make Plan B available\u2014is, at the most basic, profound and intimate level, about pitting men and women against each other as a way to defuse male anger and female humiliation at seeing other women live happier, less painful lives. Instead of sex, including sexual intercourse, being about mutual pleasure and affection, a bond between two human beings, it makes sex and particularly sexual intercourse a way a man imposes fear and pain and injury upon a woman even if she wants him, even if he loves her\u2014and if he wants to, a way to use sex against a woman to revenge himself for the hurt and pain his political elites have imposed upon him. It is a safety valve meant to keep these men and women uniting against a profoundly unjust economic order.\n\nBut there is also something else people, particularly women, get out of this. And that is the same thing people do anywhere who behave this way, be they Muslim or Jewish fundamentalists or whether religion is involved at all. If your memory is long enough, think of all those members of politically extreme movements who happily abnegated their freedom for the \"greater good,\" whether the Volk or the Reich or the classless society. Think of Darkness at Noon and victories for the Islamists in Egypt. What we are seeing is an escape from freedom, whether their own freedom and happiness or having to deal with the freedom and happiness of others. And yes, the uproar about women's access to contraception as a basic public health need\u2014and right\u2014is about freedom at its most basic and elemental: that a female should not have to become pregnant and give birth unless she wants to. Because having sexual intercourse isn't wrong\u2014much less a crime worthy of involuntary labor and great pain, often serious injury and sometimes death, be it in abortion or childbirth. Indeed, we rarely punish incest and rape so harshly.\n\nOnce upon a time, the Republican Party had a rationally different point of view from the Democratic Party, and both parties shared certain goals. This is no longer true: the Republican Party is slowly, deliberately purging itself of those who can legitimately be called conservative. Which is also to say, the sane, the rational and the humane. The party ceased to have room for Mr. Conservative, Barry Goldwater, who was light-years ahead of his time about women's rights, civil rights, gay rights, the environment, long ago. His ideas are no longer even a figleaf and if his soul knows what is happening to his beloved Republic and his Party, he is in agony.\n\nNow the Republican Party now exhibits an interesting conundrum. It advocates for massive defense spending on behalf of American security, while arguing against Americans being healthy by having access to health care\u2014or even being free of the deadly tyranny of reproduction by having access to contraception. It stresses individual liberty while sponsoring bills that would permit employers to refuse to provide insurance coverage for birth control for \"moral or religious reasons\" unless a woman provided proof she was using birth control for \"other purposes.\" It stresses morality while turning sexual intercourse into an exercise of dominance and infliction of pain and fear and humiliation\u2014the rapist's ethos\u2014even between people who love and want each other. Its \"traditional family values\" show that its real values are not people who love each other and commit to each other\u2014otherwise it would embrace gay marriage\u2014but dominance and cruelty. It claims to embrace freedom of religion yet freedom of religion means my freedom from your religion\u2014even if I am your employee and you are the Pope himself\u2014especially when it comes to something so personal, dangerous and permanent as pregnancy and childbirth or abortion. Belief in the Nicean creed is one thing. Eliminating basic medical care, which contraception\u2014like blood transfusions, which were in fact first developed to save women from dying in childbirth\u2014is, from health insurance, is something else.\n\nAnd all of this will still be true no matter who the Republican nominee is.\n\nTime was I thought that Iran would be the first nuclear power governed by men using religion and the possibility of engaging in sexual cruelty to twist and control their nation. Now, I'm not so sure."}

Like will I go to jail or have to pay a fine for getting an abortion? I've been wondering a LOT about this recentlyI am positive that Mississippi would ban abortion as well.

This is hugely expensive and problematic -- picture being fifteen and trying to explain to your parents why you need to leave the state for three days.\n\nOverturning Roe hurts poor women and young women the most. Affluent women will always be able to get abortions, just as they did before Roe, when you could go to Sweden or London or Japan. Poor women were limited to unsafe underground abortions because that was what was available for them. The death rate from abortion for poor women in New York dropped 75% after New York legalized in 1970.\n\nThat said, Washington state has validated abortion rights at the polls four times, and we were the first state to legalize by popular vote. You can come see us out here!\n\nIt's called the grandfather clause. If you did something legal before it was made illegal, you're fine.\n\nThat's not really what the grandfather clause means. If abortions are outlawed, you would not be in trouble for having one before they were outlawed because that would be an \"ex post facto law\" and they are banned in our country's constitution.\n\nA grandfather clause is a special privilege granted to certain people, such as in the south after the civil war you could vote without paying a poll tax if your grandfather did."}

{"text": "For the past nearly 40 years, the fight about abortion has been framed as a religious issue. And, while Christians certainly have a specific viewpoint on the issue, there is a truth we need to admit.\n\nThose who aren't Christian \u2014 or who don't fully understand what it means to be Christian \u2014 won't listen to an argument based on religious grounds alone. The message will get lost in the translation.\n\nSo, for once, I'm going to try to frame this discussion without ever uttering the words \"God,\" \"Jesus,\" or \"Bible.\" Anyone who knows me will understand I'm anything but an atheist; I'm simply trying to find a way to reach those who have yet to be reached with the message, hopefully in a way they can better understand it.\n\nSo, let's start from the beginning. We're talking about human reproduction, which is \u2014 according to the most commonly accepted scientific definition \u2014 \"any form of sexual reproduction resulting in the conception of a child.\"\n\nThose aren't my words, those are the words of the Journal of Human Reproductive Sciences. So, in purely scientific/medical terms, human reproduction is meant to result in the conception of a human child. Let's look at how we get there.\n\nAccording to the JHRS, human reproduction typically involves sexual intercourse between a man and a woman, although it is possible to have conception achieved via artificial insemination. Regardless of the method, the process is always the same.\n\nWhile at a childbearing age, the woman is constantly creating ova, or egg cells. Men are constantly creating their own reproductive cells, called sperm. We don't need to go into the details of how the sperm and ovum find each other, but when it happens, something interesting happens.\n\nThe ovum is a haploid cell, meaning it only contains 23 of the 46 chromosomes that lead to a complete human genetic code. In the case of women, only the \"X\" chromosomes are contained in the ovum.\n\nLikewise, the sperm is also a haploid cell. For men, the sperm can contain either the \"X\" chromosomes or the \"Y\" chromosomes, but not both. The type of chromosome the sperm cell contains will eventually determine the gender of the child (a topic for discussion on another day).\n\nBut \u2014 and this is the most important point \u2014 neither the ovum nor the sperm are capable of propagating a species. Both have a limited lifespan, and neither of them can undergo division. In essence, they are each meant to be joined with another cell.\n\nIt is that process that creates new life.\n\nWhen the sperm cell penetrates the cell wall of the ovum, it releases its chromosomes. At that moment, the ovum secretes a type of mucous that hardens the cell wall, preventing other sperm cells from penetrating.\n\nMeanwhile, the haploid chromosomal strings from the ovum and the sperm begin to conjoin, creating a diploid set of chromosomes, leading to the creation of DNA. The new DNA contains a complete genetic code that, while it is similar to both the woman and the man, is entirely different from any other cell in the universe.\n\nThis process happens in the tiniest fraction of a second, completely immeasurable with the naked eye.\n\nIn that fraction of a moment, the new cell with DNA, called a zygote, will determine every attribute of a new human being, a human child, if you will. The child's gender, height, and eye, skin, and hair color are all locked in \u2014 they cannot be changed \u2014 from that moment forward.\n\nAnd, regardless of your religious views, or lack thereof, the process is always the same. This is all a matter of fact, supported by irrefutable science that cannot be impacted by whether or not you believe in creationism or Darwinism.\n\nNow, let's go back to the JHRS definition of human reproduction. Based on it, the moment the zygote is created, it is a human child. Sure, not every zygote will go on to become a living, breathing child, but those instances are statistically few and far between, and irrelevant to this discussion.\n\nAt the moment of fertilization \u2014 the moment of conception, if you will \u2014 a human child has been created. That's not a phrase you're going to find in any religious text. In fact, you're likely only going to find it in a scientific text.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of fertilized eggs that do not become children are the result of human interference through processes that have been labeled \"abortion.\" But, let's look at a couple more commonly accepted definitions:\n\nHomicide: the killing of one human being by another.\n\nMurder: the unlawful killing of one human being by another with malice aforethought.\n\nBlack's Law Dictionary states that homicide is merely the act by one human being of taking another human being's life. It is not necessarily unlawful or illegal, unless done outside the boundaries of lawful behavior.\n\nAccepted justifications for homicide include self-defense, which is narrowly defined as protecting one's own life from immediate deadly attack. For the purposes of this discussion, that's really the only \"exception\" for allowing homicide.\n\nBlack's also states murder is delineated from other forms of homicide by the fact it is both done outside the boundaries of lawful behavior (\"unlawful killing\"), and that it is done with \"malice aforethought.\"\n\nJust what is malice aforethought, you ask?\n\nWell, in legal terms, it means the homicide occurred as a result of an intended act (or omission \u2014 not relevant here) by which there is a high degree of probability it will result in the death or serious injury of the deceased. However, if the homicide is the result of gross recklessness that demonstrates a \"lack of care for human life,\" this can also be considered malice aforethought in the modern American legal system.\n\nIn general, society has accepted these definitions as part of the \"rule of law\" that maintains order within our population. And, it is applied in the United States evenly, regardless of one's religious leanings, or lack thereof.\n\nSo, now let's take a look at a couple of provisions in the U.S. Constitution: the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment, in part reads: \"No person shall be\u2026 deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\u2026\" And, the Fourteenth Amendment, in part, states: \"\u2026nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\u2026\"\n\nThe dictionary definition of \"person\" is: a human being, or an entity that has certain capacities and attributes strongly associated with being human. The Fifth Amendment was meant to protect The People from the federal government; the Fourteenth was meant to protect them from their own state governments.\n\nSo, using scientific fact, accepted mainstream legal definitions, and the accepted interpretation of the U.S. Constitution, we have determined that a human being is created at the moment of conception, and that the intended death of that human being \u2014 through any one of many abortion processes \u2014 is homicide by murder.\n\nAnd it didn't take a single line of scripture to get there.\n\nBob Eschliman is an Iowa journalist who has been covering politics and government for more than a decade. He is the founder of the Ben Franklin Journalism blog, which promotes citizen journalism.\n\nOne can plausibly argue that the zygote is not morally relevant life, however. Whether it is morally relevant depends upon why one thinks that murder is wrong. If one believes murder is wrong because the human nervous system has evolved to find being killed aversive (as most atheists do), then it is hard to argue that the zygote is morally relevant until it has at least developed a rudimentary nervous system. Killing a life form without a nervous system has no more moral relevance than killing skin cells when you scratch yourself.\n\n Doug McBurney\n\nOK, then where would you draw the line Libgov?\n\nAnonymous\n\nAt 28 weeks, when the thalamus is sufficiently developed to feel pain.\n\nGregg Jackson\n\nSo you are saying that it's ok to kill persons who can't feel pain?\n\nAnonymous\n\nNo, I would argue that having any brain area that would find murder aversive makes murder wrong. There are areas outside the thalamus (the frontal lobes, for example) that would find being murdered aversive, and so as long as the human possesses such an area, it is murder to kill them. I gave the thalamus as the cut-off point for when abortion becomes murder because it is the first part of the brain to develop that would find being murdered aversive, so that is why I put the cut-off point at 28 weeks.\n\nGregg Jackson\n\nSo it's ok to kill pre-born babies who don't possess the ability to feel pain but not ok to kill other human persons who can't feel pain? That makes no sense.\n\nAnonymous\n\nUmm, yes it makes sense. It's morally wrong to kill any human that has a brain area that would find murder aversive. Someone with a working frontal lobe but not a working pain system (e.g., someone with congenital analgesia) possesses such an area. A developing fetus prior to 28 weeks does not.\n\nGregg Jackson\n\nSo is it ok, according to your line of reasoning to kill a person who is unconscious (in a coma) who doesn't possess the ability to \"find murder aversive\" as you say?\n\nAnonymous\n\nNo, it is not OK because they still possess brain areas that find murder aversive.\n\nGregg Jackson\n\nYes, but those areas of hte brain are non-functioning.\n\nAnonymous\n\nOh no, even when unconscious, those parts of the brain are alive and their nerve cells are firing.\n\nGregg Jackson\n\nPhysically perhaps. But the fact of the matter is that the person is still not conscious of being killed.\n\nGregg Jackson\n\nAlso, you did not answer my question above:\n\nDo you disagree with the scientific evidence that human life begins at the very moment of fertilization when the sperm fertilizes the ovum?\n\nYes or no?\n\nAnonymous\n\nUmm, what evidence?\n\nGregg Jackson\n\nAxiomatic biological and scientific evidence which all confirm that at the very moment of fertilization that a totally unique human person is created with a full set of 46 chromosomes and totally distinct fully developed and intact DNA.\n\nAnonymous\n\nOh yes, I would agree that at the moment of fertilization an entity with a full set of 46 chromosomes is created, but don't see how a human entity with 46 chromosomes has any greater moral relevance than one with half that number.\n\nGregg Jackson\n\nSo you disagree with the scientific evidence that human life begins at the very moment of fertilization?\n\nBob Eschliman\n\nThen make the plausible argument, Libgov. How is a zygote morally irrelevant?\n\nAnonymous\n\nBecause it does not have a nervous system that finds being killed aversive.\n\nBob Eschliman\n\nHow is that a plausible argument? You need to truly defend your position before the debate on this point can continue. Why is the nervous system the defining characteristic of a morally relevant human being?\n\nAnonymous\n\nBecause (again, according to Atheists, not Christians) the reason that anything might be morally wrong is because there is some entity that finds the action aversive if it is done to that entity (that's a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for something being morally wrong). Without an entity that finds the action aversive to itself, there can be no moral wrong, and that is the case when killing a zygote.\n\nBob Eschliman\n\nIt's a scientific fact that women who undergo a surgical abortion procedure later face deep depression.\n\nAnonymous\n\nAnd having a baby that they didn't want might make (at least some of them) even more unhappy than having an abortion. The woman is making a decision about what will maximize her happiness, and having an abortion might do so. Making abortion illegal robs a woman of the ability to choose what will maximize her happiness. Thus, the fact that abortion may lead to an overall reduction in the mother's happiness does not make it immoral, it is only immoral if it somehow reduces the happiness of the entity that is aborted (and without a nervous system, it doesn't).\n\nAme\n\nOne problem I see with the happiness standard is that these women can't see into the future. They don't know what will make them happier. Did you know that Steve Jobs was given up for adoption by a single women still in school? He wasn't a saint but he affected the happiness of a lot of people.\n\nGenerally, I believe that people that are giving are happier than people that are focused on themselves. It's odd but those who try to make themselves happy seem to mostly fail while the people who think of others succeed in improving the happiness of both.\n\nGregg Jackson\n\n\"Killing a life form without a nervous system has no more moral relevance than killing skin cells when you scratch yourself.\"\n\nSo, we should be able to kill paralytics who don't possess a functioning nervous system?\n\nAfter all, according to your own standard, Libgov, paralytics and humans in a permanant vegetative state aren't \"morally relevant life\" forms on par with \"skin cells\" as you have so determined them to be.\n\nAnonymous\n\nParalytics do possess a functioning nervous system. Otherwise they would be dead.\n\nAme\n\n@Libgov:disqus That's ridiculous. A skin cell will never be more than a skin cell. It has a limited purpose and \"dies\" and is replaced regularly as a part of that purpose. A zygote is an immature human being. Only interference will prevent \"it\" from maturing.\n\nAnonymous\n\nSo you are saying: Skin cells don't develop into humans and zygotes do so that is the difference. Fair enough, but it is not the case that only interference will prevent \"it\" from maturing. For example, the mother may be starving, and, if that is the case, then the zygote won't mature into a human being because it will not get sufficient food.\n\nIf your position is that killing a zygote is murder because, if all the right things happen, it will eventually turn into a human being, then you must logically also adopt the position that killing a gamete (egg or sperm) is murder because if all the right things happen, it will also turn into a human being. Is that your position?\n\nErik Goodale\n\nA child, whether zygote, embryo, infant, toddler, etc. is a distinct and separate entity genetically speaking (other areas too but we are keeping this scientific). Gametes are not. This is why the author and others point to conception/fertilization as the point at which human life begins. This is also why a woman has to have the placenta as her own body recognizes the child as distinct/separate genetically and so would attack it if the child was not protected from her immune system.\n\nAnonymous\n\nWhat do you mean when you say that gametes are not separate entities genetically speaking?\n\nErik Goodale\n\nThey are still considered part of the larger person which is displayed in at least two ways. 1) Immune response. A woman's ova are not rejected by her immune system. If they were, all women would be sterile. Males is a little different as last I knew the science held that we don't hold our gametes our entire lives as women due and instead produce them at the onset of puberty. 2) No gamete can develop on its own into a separate person. You can't even take two of the same gametes i.e. two ova or two sperm and make this happen. You have to have the ova and the sperm and it is only at that point \u2014 the point of conception/fertilization \u2014 that you have a genetically separate and distinct entity/person.\n\nAme\n\nI will die without nourishment and shelter. With those two needs met I will mature, not something I'm excited about given my age. The same is true from the moment of conception. A gamete will not. Nourishment and shelter will not grow it. It's only half of the information to build a human.\n\n Wm Luke Priest\n\nLibgov \u2013 Moral relativism has no place in the current legal process. Prosecutors, judges and juries do not weigh the relevance of a human life. Legally a person is a person, and therefor murder is murder. As Bob very methodically demonstrated using medically and legally accepted definitions of the terms in question\u2026 \"a human being is created at the moment of conception, and that the intended death of that human being \u2014 through any one of many abortion processes \u2014 is homicide by murder.\"\n\nYou are not arguing with his conclusion. You are arguing the above referenced murder is ok.\n\nAnonymous\n\nYes, you are correct, I was not directly responding to the argument made in the article in my previous comments. I will try to do so here.\n\nThe argument the author is making is that murder is the unlawful killing of a person with malice aforethought, and that a person is \"a human being, or an entity that has certain capacities and attributes strongly associated with being human\". Because a fetus possesses a full complement of human DNA, it has attributes strongly associated with being a human being (because only human beings have this attribute), and thus abortion constitutes murder under the legal definition. Is that a fair summary of the argument (I've tried to be as fair as possible, but maybe I misunderstood)?\n\nIf that is a fair summary, then I would argue that the author must also take the position that killing an individual human sperm or human egg is also murder. Human sperm contains strands of human DNA (an attribute only and strongly associated with being a human), and as such, killing human sperm constitutes murder under the set of definitions the author has laid out. If the author is willing to take his argument to its logical conclusion, he must also argue that masturbation is murder. If he is willing to say this, then I would say his argument is correct, but I suspect (knowing male humans as I do), that the author himself would have to admit that he is a murderer.\n\nThe author might respond, \"A full complement of DNA constitutes a morally relevant human attribute but a portion of human DNA does not\", but that is entirely arbitrary and much less defensible than my definition that \"Having a nervous system that finds being murdered aversive constitutes a morally relevant human attribute, but just having human DNA does not.\"\n\n Wm Luke Priest\n\nNo. I don't think you adequately summarized the argument. You are attempting to apply a relativistic definition to something that is quite concrete. Human life. A zygote is an independant life, consisting not only of everything necessary to build a person, but it actually is a person. Just like a baby is a human, and a child is a human, the elderly are human, etc. Not \"possessing strong attributes associated with being human\" but actually human!\n\nAnonymous\n\nUmm, didn't I use the definition of personhood he did in the article (I copied and pasted it, so I must have)? What is the author's definition of personhood (if I got it wrong)?\n\n Wm Luke Priest\n\nAgain, you misquote to make your argument. The definition is \"a human being.\" That definition is then followed with an \"or\" (indicating a correlation, correction, or alternative definition) and another possible definition.\n\nI think that the first definition is perfectly acceptable in this case. It is easily understood, fits in context, and conveys legislative intent. It is also virtually impossible to use for construction and reinterpretation of the passage.\n\nAnonymous\n\nI'm not sure what you meant when you said I misquoted. What was the misquote? (I copied and pasted)\n\nRegardless, if the definition is \"a human being\" then we need a definition of \"a human being,\" so what definition are you using?\n\n Wm Luke Priest\n\nThat is kind of like arguing what the definition of \"is\" is. As a self aware \"human being\" living in a world full of \"human beings\" raised by a society of \"human beings\" I hope you don't need a definition of \"human being.\" It is you. It is me. It need not be confused or twisted.\n\nAccording to Webster's 1828 (contextually accurate to the original intent of the amendments) a person is\u2026\n\nPERSON, n. per'sn. [L. persona; said to be compounded of per, through or by, and sonus, sound; a Latin word signifying primarily a mask used by actors on the state.]1. An individual human being consisting of body and soul. We apply the word to living beings only, possessed of a rational nature; the body when dead is not called a person. It is applied alike to a man, woman or child.A person is a thinking intelligent being.2. A man, woman or child, considered as opposed to things, or distinct from them.A zeal for persons is far more easy to be perverted, than a zeal for things.3. A human being, considered with respect to the living body or corporeal existence only. The form of her person is elegant.You'll find her person difficult to gain.The rebels maintained the fight for a small time, and for their persons showed no want of courage.4.

A member of the genus Homo and especially of the species H. sapiens.2. A person: the extraordinary humans who explored Antarctica.\n\nAnonymous\n\nUnder all the definitions you list, I would say a gamete is as much a human being as a zygote.\n\n Wm Luke Priest\n\nThen, for your sake, I am glad that you are teaching something as squishy as psychology instead of a concrete science like biology. Because, if as a bio prof you were teaching that gametes are people too, I think you would probably lose you job quite promptly.\n\nAnonymous\n\nYes, one of the things we have learned in psychology is that when people don't have a good argument to make, they resort to insults as a way of changing the topic and attempting to save face. Odd indeed that more than 90% of biology professors are pro-choice.\n\nAnonymous\n\nThat's weird; I think your response to my comment above and my response to that got cut off. So, to summarize, you are saying that a definition of personhood is simply \"a human being\" and the stuff after the \"or\" can be ignored. Fair enough. However, now I need to know what the definition is of \"human being\" (i.e., what criteria does something have to meet before it can be called a \"human being\").\n\nBob Eschliman\n\nAs I pointed out in the article, ova and sperm (gametes) are haploid (feel free to Google or Bing the meaning there), which in essence means they only have 23 chromosomes each. But, all organisms in the Animalia family have diploid cells (46 chromosomes\u2013XX (male) or XY(female)) that can replicate themselves. So, in that sense, ova and sperm do not meet the criteria of \"having attributes strongly associated with being human.\"\n\nAnonymous\n\nBut a zygote doesn't have lungs, a brain, or a nervous system so, in that sense, it also does not meet the criteria of \"having attributes strongly associated with being human.\"\n\nBob Eschliman\n\nGenetically, it IS a human being. I didn't decide the definition\u2026 the reproductive professionals did\u2026 if you feel your knowledge base is better than theirs, by all means, petition them to change the definition of human reproduction.\n\nAnonymous\n\nUmm, didn't decide the definition of what?\n\nBob Eschliman\n\nI didn't decide the definition of human reproduction, OR the definition of person.\n\nAnonymous\n\nOK, so who decided the definition of person? Which reproductive professionals decided on this definition? And where can I find the place where they wrote down the definition?\n\nI've often wondered why we cannot challenge abortion on the basis that the same laws will allow for one to be charged with double murder when a pregnant lady is killed regardless of where she is at in her pregnancy. If it's a life then, how is it not a life when she intentionally has a doctor kill it? Besides, if you believe she might've chosen to have her baby, once she's dead she's not going to be making many more decisions. It's hypocrisy. I've long thought IF I were a lawyer I would seek out a case where someone did murder a pregnant woman and demand the second murder charge be dropped. I'd build that part of my case on the fact that if my client were a doctor and the mother knowingly entered his clinic and asked for the baby to be killed there is not a single murder committed. So basic math tells us something isn't right.\n\nGuest\n\nWow\u2026Bob Eschliman is not a doctor, but he plays one on the blogs\u2026 lol\n\nThat aside, I would appreciate input from an OB-GYN (maybe Dr. Paul's available) concerning the difference between 'conception' (fertilization) and implantation on the uterine wall\u2026 \"Sure, not every zygote will go on to become a living, breathing child, but those instances are statistically few and far between, and irrelevant to this discussion.\" What? \"Irrelevant\"? I can't think of anything more central to the pro-life discussion as what happens to a zygote.\n\n\"The overwhelming majority of fertilized eggs that do not become children are the result of human interference through processes that have been labeled \"abortion.\" \" Really? So the zygotes that you had just referenced were likely aborted by human interference, or were they naturally? How many fertilized eggs simply do not implant on the uterine wall? While #Idon'thavethefactstobackthisup, my wife's OB once told us that the number of natural miscarriages (fertilized eggs simply not implanting) is much higher than we would expect.\n\nWhat I really wonder about is the effect of popular hormonal birth control methods that many in the pro-life movement employ\u2026 are fertilized eggs passed during menstration? If so, how is this any different than the morning after pill? Are those defined as abortion? Are those people just as guilty of abortion as those who use the morning after pill? As for me, I don't hear too many in the pro-life movement calling for the abolition of all monthly birth control pills. Should they be?\n\nCan you see now how this becomes complicated in a hurry? If we come to the conclusion that hormonal birth control methods (which many responsible, pro-life advocates use) actually prevent fertilized eggs from implanting, are we ready to champion the banning of these methods?\n\n Wm Luke Priest\n\nVery good question \"Guest.\" I wish you would identify yourself so we could have an accountable conversation about this issue. You are correct in identifying the complexity of defining abortion. Does that include hormonal birth control pills, IUDs, morning after pills, any other process of preventing implantation? I would personally say yes, but I don't know if I am ready to die on that hill.\n\nAbortions requiring surgical intervention, or physician prescribed medication however definitely constitute deliberate destruction of a human life. I would probably support outlawing the others as well, but would have to see a truly objective, universal, ideologically consistent bill presented to support doing that. I don't like piece-mealing anything.\n\nJohn Lofton\n\n\"Science says it's a human being.\" OK, and so WHAT? The REAL questions are: \"So what is a human being? An image of God, made by Him? Or just an evolved accidental pile of molecules that assembled by chance?\" And on the REAL questions, I do not care what \"science\" has to say. I believe what God says in His Word.\n\nI don't disagree with your position, John. I, too, accept that the Bible says so, so it is so. But, I also understand many people do not agree with that position. The point is to provide a different view that might reach an audience that is either ignorant or intollerant of the Christian worldview. Steve perfectly described it as a \"Christian apologetics view on abortion.\"\n\nBob Eschliman\n\nLibgov\u2026 Let's start a new string here on your \"moral relevancy\" statement. I'm going to assume you're at least reasonably versed in philosophy\u2026 if not, you should be able to Google this stuff pretty easily. You're suggesting moral relevancy is determined by the victim of murder, not by the murderer, which is a false premise from the start. Bernard Gert, in his Definition of Irrationality, said rationality and moral relevance are determined by actions, not by the person or object who/that is acted upon. So, I reject your moral relevancy thesis, because the pregnancy woman and the doctor who performs the abortion are both fully capable of understanding that the zygote/fetus/unborn child is a human being and that murder is wrong.\n\nAnonymous\n\nUmm, so is it immoral to shoot a dead body?\n\nAme\n\nWhat is up with the red herrings? And creepy ones at that.\n\nAnonymous\n\nI don't understand? Red Herrings? I'm asserting a false premise? What do you mean? I'm trying to understand Bob's statement that the victim is irrelevant to whether an action is immoral, so I asked him a question. How can asking a question assert a false premise?\n\nAme\n\nThe discussion is about killing. The dead can't be killed so your question is off topic to my mind.\n\nAnonymous\n\nAme: So can you explain to me what Bob meant when he said: \"You're suggesting moral relevancy is determined by the victim of murder,\nnot by the murderer, which is a false premise from the start\"\n\nAme\n\nBasing the morality on a status of the victim or circumstance is wishy-washy relativism. It's still wrong to steal from someone who won't or can't notice. Your motives and actions are at issue and are judged moral or immoral. Doing something immoral that doesn't end badly for anyone or thing is still immoral.\n\nAnonymous\n\nOK, basing morality on the status of the victim is wishy-washy relativism. Is it OK to kill a cow?\n\nAme\n\nAgain you are going off topic. A cow and a human are totally different.\n\nAnonymous\n\nSounds like wishy washy moral relativism to me in which the morality of an act depends upon the victim. How is it different?\n\nAme\n\nI may need to sleep on it to explain it well. A cow is never a human and a human is never a cow. They are not the same beings under different circumstances/with different statuses. Each is unrelated to the other. Does that explain?\n\nAnonymous\n\nHmm, no I still don't understand Bob's statement that the victim doesn't matter to the morality of an act.\n\nAme\n\nLet me try again. Since I believe that truth is not relative, there is an overarching principle that always holds true. The morality of killing a human being is different from killing an animal or plant because these are not the same type of being. The principle is different. This human and that human may have different statuses like an immature nervous system but they are the same type of being. They would fall under the same principle. That's why bringing up cows is irrelevant to a discussion of abortion. Dead bodies are also irrelevant since they can't be killed. Gametes are distinct from human beings because they never develop without conception. However, a zygote develops and needs nutrition and shelter just like me.\n\nClearer?\n\nGregg Jackson\n\nAgain, Libgov, you are asserting a false premise. A pre-born baby from the vry moment he or she is conceived is a living human person\u2026not a \"dead body\" as you atempt to imply.\n\nBob Eschliman\n\nDesecrating a dead body is a crime, ergo by virtue of the Social Contract, it is immoral.\n\nAnonymous\n\nUmm, is cutting into a dead body for an autopsy immoral?\n\nBob Eschliman\n\nSo, let's get back to your moral relevancy position\u2026 you have yet to back it up sufficiently.\n\nGregg Jackson\n\nWhen Does Human Life Begin?\n\nDoctors Testify to U.S. Senate\n\nMany internationally-known geneticists and biologists have testified that\nhuman life begins at conception. In 1981 (April 23-24) a Senate Judiciary\nSubcommittee held hearings on the very question: When does human life begin?\nFollowing are testimonies from two of the doctors who testified:\n\n1. Dr. Hymie Gordon, Chairman of the\nDepartment of Genetics at the Mayo Clinic, said: \"By all the criteria of modern\nmolecular biology, life is present from the moment of conception.\"\n\n2. Dr. McCarthy de Mere, a medical\ndoctor and law professor at the University of Tennessee, testified: \"The exact\nmoment of the beginning of personhood and of the human body is at the moment of\nconception.\"\n\n\"The Father of Modern Genetics\"\nTestifies\n\nDr. Jerome Lejeune, known as \"The\nFather of Modern Genetics,\" also testified that human life begins at conception\nbefore the Louisiana Legislature's House Committee on the Administration of\nCriminal Justice on June 7, 1990.\n\nDr. Lejeune explained that within three to seven days after fertilization we\ncan determine if the new human being is a boy or a girl. \"At no time,\" Dr.\nLejeune said, \"is the human being a blob of protoplasm. As far as your nature is\nconcerned, I see no difference between the early person that you were at\nconception and the late person which you are now. You were, and are, a human\nbeing.\"\n\nDr. Lejeune also pointed out that each human being is unique \u2014 different\nfrom the mother \u2014 from the moment of conception. He said, \"Recent discoveries\nby Dr. Alec Jeffreys of England demonstrate that this information [on the DNA\nmolecule] is stored by a system of bar codes not unlike those found on products\nat the supermarket\u2026it's not any longer a theory that each of us is\nunique.\"\n\nDr. Jerome Lejeune died on April 3, 1994. Dr. Lejeune of Paris, France was a\nmedical doctor, a Doctor of Science and a professor of Fundamental Genetics for\nover twenty years. Dr. Lejeune discovered the genetic cause of Down Syndrome,\nreceiving the Kennedy Prize for the discovery and, in addition, received the\nMemorial Allen Award Medal, the world's highest award for work in the field of\nGenetics.\n\nHe practiced his profession at the H\u00f4pital des Enfants Malades (Sick\nChildren's Hospital) in Paris. Dr. Lejeune was a member of the American Academy\nof the Arts and Science, a member of the Royal Society of Medicine in London,\nThe Royal Society of Science in Stockholm, the Science Academy in Italy and\nArgentina, The Pontifical Academy of Science and The Academy of Medicine in\nFrance.\n\nLibgov\u2026 you suggest there is no difference genetically between a zygote with 46 chromosomes than a gamete with 23. But, every member of the Animalia family must have 46 chromosomes. So, there's a distinct difference between an organism with 46 chromosomes and an organism with only 23 (e.g. plants).\n\nAnonymous\n\nOh no, I would never suggest that there is no difference genetically (clearly there is). I only suggest that there is no difference morally.\n\nBob \u2013 be careful to distinguish the actual definitions of your terms from the specific technical details related to using those terms. Humans have 46 chromosomes. Horses have 64. Donkeys have 62. The thing that matters is diploid cells(capable of mitosis or replication) versus haploid cells(not capable of mitosis or replication). One is a whole being, another is a part.\n\n Nick Weltha\n\nThere is going to be a time when citizens cannot own their own androids and it will be an extension of this Personhood argument that leads us there. That's my only complaint with this approach. PETA, Ape trusts, etc. are going to want to start extending Personhood rights immediately, and in a possible future where I design an android I want to later disassemble, I don't want to have to get a government permit to do it, or worse, have them tell me it's a \"person\" so I cannot.\n\nAdditionally, as Libgov has made clear, the debate will just change from whether or not a being that feels pain is a \"person\", or as fundamentalist Christians will inevitably have to argue, that they have souls from the moment they are conceived because as Jeremiah said, God knew us before we were in the womb.\n\n Wm Luke Priest\n\nLibgov \u2013 The conclusion to this article is as follows \"a human being is created at the moment of conception, and\u2026 the intended death of that human being \u2014 through any one of many abortion processes \u2014 is homicide by murder.\"\n\nThis is the point of this article. This is strict interpretation of the law. We are not debating the philosophical implications of the law. We are debating correct application of the law. Abortion is homicide by murder, a crime punishable in every American jurisdiction as a felony. The questions now are, why aren't governments upholding the law? Why aren't citizens suing their governments for not upholding the law? And Who should the governments be holding accountable for the above referenced murders?"}
{"text": "\"The act of abortion is intended to result in the death of a child\". No it's not. It's intended to terminate a pregnancy. A \"child\" is a distinct, separate human being capable of sustained life outside the womb.\n\n'What is \"irresponsible and flies in the face of the facts\" is to pretend that abortion is a good thing and that it is helping women'. What 'facts'? No one says abortion is a 'good thing'. Do you consider setting yourself up as the arbiter of private decisions made between a woman and her doctor to be a 'good thing'?\n\n'Abortion is most certainly part of the \"culture of death.\"' Then this about Mother Teresa: 'She said this because abortion is a form of killing.' Then you: \"How can you expect to end other forms of killing if you approve of this form?\" Do you approve of capital punishment? You know, state sanctioned, 1st degree murder of people. Does that not \"contribute to the culture of death\"?\n\n'Sheriff John Rutherford was correct. Abortion \"care\" is not health care for women.' Rutherford didn't say anything about \"abortion care\".\n\nI'm not sure \"abortion care\" is valid nomenclature. However it differentiates abortions performed in a clinical setting as opposed to those performed in back alleys - you know, the kind that will occur if abortions are outlawed.\n\n@ConservativeInJax: How can you call yourself that if you condone government intrusion into an individual's personal life? Where do I pretend that an unborn baby is not human? Where do I say it's easy to \"stomach abortion\" at all? You do love your strawmen, don't you?\n\n@Max Mutt: You're going to have to give a citation for that statistic. How many abortions were reported prior to 1973? How many deaths due to abortion prior to 1973 were listed as such? How many back room abortions are still performed because abortion opponents have made it difficult to obtain an abortion in a clinical setting?\n\nWho has decided to murder whom? If abortion is murder, why aren't the women and their doctors in jail? Those people don't \"insist they have a right to do it\", the Supreme Court upheld that right.\n\nYOU have decided to call something murder that our duly constituted courts have not. Not only are you ignoring constitutional law, you are advocating that the government does the same. No conservative would do either.\n\nYou have moral objections to abortion (as do I). However, you have politicized your morality. People have tried and failed that with alcohol and are now doing it with drugs.\n\nWomen and abortionist doctors when they decide to kill an unborn baby.\n\n\"If abortion is murder, why aren't the women and their doctors in jail? Those people don't 'insist they have a right to do it', the Supreme Court upheld that right.\"\n\nYou answered your own question -- a liberal Supreme Court decided that unborn boys and girls have no Constitutional rights.\n\n\"YOU have decided to call something murder that our duly constituted courts have not. Not only are you ignoring constitutional law, you are advocating that the government does the same. No conservative would do either.\"\n\nActually, it was God who said that we are all \"fearfully and wonderfully made\" in the womb thousands of years ago. And isn't it really common sense? I would also argue that \"Roe v Wade\" is about as unconstitutional as it gets. Supposedly it's to protect women's rights, but what if the unborn baby is female? What about HER rights? I've never gotten a good answer from this from anyone in the Pro-choice-to-kill crowd.\n\nOh, and by the way. In Nazi Germany, it was perfectly legal to kill Jews and others the Nazi leaders felt didn't further the Third Reich. Was that OK, too?\n\nOkay, you're using religion to dictate what you believe the law should be and totally ignoring the Constitution. Which answers my original question. You should change your account name from \"ConservativeInJax\" to \"ReligiousRightInJax\". You are not a real conservative.\n\nSo... just to clarify... you believe that the Constitution grants the right to murder children?\n\nAt this point I feel I need to challenge you to engage in a little critical thinking and not mindlessly repeat the liberal talking point of \"the unborn baby is not a child\". There is no evidence whatsoever that an unborn baby is any less human than any born person.\n\nNowhere, except in your imagination, does the Constitution grant the anyone the right to kill children or any other individual outside the law.\n\nAn unborn baby is just that - unborn. It is not an individual until it can live separate from its mother. That's not a mindless liberal (or any other tint) talking point. It's a fact. You ignore that fact because it doesn't sit well with your religious right dogma. You also mistake your indoctrination for critical thinking.\n\nThe only \"challenge\" to dealing with this subject with someone like you is that you are not open to facts or reason when they disagree with your dogma.\n\n\"An unborn baby is just that - unborn. It is not an individual until it can live separate from its mother.\"\n\nOK... now we're getting somewhere. You're said this before so obviously you think it makes sense. So you believe that it's OK to kill someone if they don't fit the legal definition of \"individual.\" Is that right?\n\nAt the Neurenberg trials, that's exactly what the Nazis argued: They did nothing illegal. After all, their laws clearly said that Jews were not persons (or, as you might say, \"individuals.\")\n\nMurdering millions of Jews was perfectly legal, according to their laws."}

{"text": "We can fight anti-choicers and fight scientific misinformation\u2026.together\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we have a problem. I wrote about this problem at RH Reality Check, but in the days since it's only gotten worse. (By the way, Katha Pollitt and I communicated about my linking of her article, and we see eye-to-eye on this\u2014she, as I suspected, was under a column length crunch and couldn't address every nagging detail. So I want you to say I'm not criticizing her, but simply pointing out that there's a, let's call it a \"plot hole\" in the pro-choice narrative.) The problem is that, in addressing anti-choice narratives around the personhood amendment and in explaining why such a thing can and probably will be used to restrict the birth control pill, feminists are giving air to an anti-choice misinformation campaign to redefine the pill as \"abortion\". I strongly suspect that personhood amendments aren't even really intended to win so much as to give anti-choicers frequent opportunities to claim the pill works by killing fertilized eggs. The long game, I believe, is to get that false belief ingrained in conventional wisdom, and then use it to apply existing abortion restrictions to the birth control pill. I especially suspect that the intention is to make sure that the Hyde and Stupak amendments are expanded to include the bill, meaning that the only way women will be able to get it is through out-of-pocket funding.\n\nI realize that doesn't make a lot of sense. Even if you buy the scientific misinformation that the pill works by killing fertilized eggs, that still wouldn't make taking it an \"abortion\", because pregnancy begins at implantation, not conception. The problem with making that point, of course, is that activists, legislators, and the courts aren't beholden to the medical definition of an abortion. They argue life begins at conception, and so from their point of view, anything that interferes with that is an \"abortion\". More importantly, you could call it a \"tiddlywinks\", and they wouldn't care. We aren't really arguing about terminology here. They're trying to claim the pill kills fertilized eggs, which are granted greater status in our culture than non-fertilized eggs, and they hope by doing so they can stigmatize the pill enough to start legislating against it. They probably wouldn't even need to call it an \"abortion\" if they're able to get the false story of how the pill works to spread far and wide. Already many abortion restrictions avoid talking about pregnancy and talk instead of \"life at conception\"; they're poised to do this. Now they just need to get people to believe something that just has no evidence for it, that the pill works by killing fertilized eggs.\n\nLuckily for them, they have feminists doing that job.\n\nFirst, the facts. The fact of the matter is that the pill works by preventing ovulation. The original formulation\u2014and I think this is still true for most forms of it, if not all\u2014was to put your hormone levels where they would be post-ovulation. The reason for this is that after you ovulate, your body suppresses another ovulation in order to prevent a second conception. Some medical scientists have theorized that there may be secondary actions in play for the pill that make it work better. One of these theories, which has no evidence for it that I could find (or that Lindsay Beyerstein could find\u2014she's been looking, too), is that the thinning of the uterine lining might make it harder for fertilized eggs to implant. Because of all sorts of regulations and practices in the pharmaceutical industry, these theories are included in the packaging for pills, in the same way they have to include potential side effects, even if the researchers are 95% sure the side effects weren't actually caused by the medication. For instance, your pill package probably includes \"weight gain\" as a potential side effect of the pill. That's because it was a potential, if basically untested side effect. But extensive research has demonstrated that the pill does not make you gain weight. As weird as it may seem to a layperson, that something is on your info packet when you get a medication doesn't make it true. That info packet isn't a scientific document; it's a CYA maneuver.\n\nNow for the facts.\n\nFact #1: Many eggs slough off on their own, so even if you manage to fertilize an egg and it dies while you're on the pill, there's no reason to think that the pill is the cause. That said, women on the pill don't ovulate much! If you take it perfectly, probably never. Or even somewhat imperfectly. But even if you have a tendency to skip 4 or 5 days here or there, and you do ovulate, you're still doing it less than someone who uses nothing at all. So you're simply killing fewer fertilized eggs than the good Catholic who uses nothing and is constantly pregnant. Odds are high I've never had a fertilized egg die on me, but Rick Santorum's wife has probably killed dozens, if not more.\n\nPrompted, in part, by the growing efforts of anti-abortion groups to define birth control as abortion, the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology in 1999 reviewed the available research on \"the mechanism of action\" of the contraceptive methods that so dismay pro-lifers\u2026\u2026\n\nThe researchers consider the question and report , \"No direct evidence exists showing that implantation is prevented by progestin-only methods\" and \"The evidence does not support the theory that the usual mechanism of action of IUDs is destruction of fertilized ova in the uterus,\" say the authors. After reviewing all the research available on the modes of action of all contraceptives in question the authors summarize their report by explaining that \"Even though the precise mechanism of action of modern contraceptive is not yet fully known, scientific evidence suggests the main mechanisms of action for each method. Inhibition of ovulation and effects on the cervical mucus are the primary mechanisms of the contraceptive action of hormonal methods. Evidence indicates that the primary mechanism of action of IUDs is the prevention of fertilization.\"\n\nIt's a widespread belief that emergency contraception works by killing a fertilized egg. Actually, it's just high dose birth control pills that prevent ovulation. If anything, emergency contraception is less likely to have the uterine lining effect that anti-choicers claim.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that LNG-EC acts through an effect on follicular development to delay or inhibit ovulation but has no effect once luteinizing hormone has started to increase. Thereafter, LNG-EC cannot prevent ovulation and it does not prevent fertilization or affect the human fallopian tube. LNG-EC has no effect on endometrial development or function. In an in vitro model, it was demonstrated that LNG did not interfere with blastocyst function or implantation.\n\nOver time, birth control pills thin the lining of the uterus. It has been hypothesized that a thinner endometrium is less receptive to fertilized eggs, but this conjecture has never been tested. This seems unlikely, given how easy it is for women to get pregnant by taking the birth control pill sporadically. Missing a couple of pills won't undo the chronic changes in the uterine lining, but skipping pills during the critical window can easily allow an egg to escape. If a thinner endometrium was such a barrier to pregnancy, we'd expect the pill to be even more reliable than it is.\n\nI hope this has convinced you that we don't need to repeat the claims that the pill kills fertilized eggs. There's no scientific evidence for that claim, and there is scientific evidence against it. We should insist on sticking to the science instead of being dragged into the anti-choice \"what if\" game.\n\nBut not only have I seen feminists make the understandable mistake of accepting the fertilized egg theory as a third mechanism\u2014the information that this is un-evidenced is very hard to get in a sea of anti-choice misinformation\u2014I'm beginning to see inexcusable examples of feminists suggesting that \"killing fertilized eggs\" is how the pill works. Which is what anti-choicers want you to believe. A woman confronted Mitt Romney about his support of a personhood amendment, and her misinformation got wide hearing:\n\nI don't know if you want to have some staff look into this, but hormonal forms of birth control work a little differently. They actually prevent implantation, not conception.\n\nI saw this exchange posted everywhere with absolutely no correction of this blatant (if unintended) misinformation. Even Jezebel's write-up unfortunately implied that killing fertilized eggs is an evidenced mechanism of the pill, and that it happens frequently, which it doesn't. They made it worse by making fun of Mitt Romney for not knowing how the pill works. The problem with that is he actually showed a better understanding of it than either the woman asking him a question or the Jezebel writer. If you make fun of someone for being wrong, but they're actually right, then you're the one with egg on your face.\n\nI get why feminists are allowing anti-choice misinformation to find home in our mouths. We want to tell people that personhood amendments are intended to ban the pill, because they are! The easiest way to say that is to accept the false premise that the pill kills fertilized eggs. And that will win us a short term victory, but lose us the long term war. Plus, bad science is bad science, and you shouldn't give air to it.\n\nThere is a way to make it clear that the right is using this to ban the pill without giving credence to their misinformation. One way I've gone about doing this is to say, \"Anti-choicers hope that misinformation about how the pill works can be used to ban it.\" Irin Carmon did a great job of parsing the scientific misinformation and the legal issues in her Salon piece on Mississippi personhood.\n\nIf this initiative passes, and fertilized eggs on their own have full legal rights, anything that could potentially block that implantation \u2013 something a woman's body does naturally all the time \u2013 could be considered murder. Scientists say hormonal birth-control pills and the morning-after pill work primarily by preventing fertilization in the first place, but the outside possibility, never documented, that an egg could be fertilized anyway and blocked is enough for some pro-lifers.\n\nI would also add that right wingers get all sorts of misinformation into the law all the time, as anyone who follows the creationism wars will tell you. Because the \"pill kills\" thing is untrue doesn't make it less of a threat. All you need is a few people with some letters after their name to present themselves falsely as experts to the court, a judge with a right wing agenda, and the law can be kept in place. If you want evidence of how this works, consider that Carhart v. Gonzalez was decided in part on a big, fat lie: that women who have abortions have \"post-abortion\" syndrome. This isn't even playing loose with the facts. Anti-choicers just made that shit up, presented it as evidence, and the idea of it was all over Kennedy's decision.\n\nThere's also the understandable fear of conceding the argument that fertilized eggs are people. No need to do that, either. I think one thing pro-choicers need to highlight as much as the pill thing is fact that these laws will almost surely be used to prosecute miscarriages. If anything, they're more likely to be used for that at first than to ban the pill, which will be a separate legal battle that will take years to fight. You can start prosecuting miscarriages right away; you can even do so while leaving abortion legal. Prosecuting miscarriages is an especially attractive fight for anti-choicers because you can target the most vulnerable women in our society for that abuse. We know this, because women are already being thrown in jail for stillbirth. They tend to be poorer women, women of color, and immigrants, exactly the sort of women that don't get a lot of defenders, especially if they live less than perfect lives. Particularly in Mississippi, I expect that a personhood law would immediately result in miscarriage arrests and investigations. I'm guessing you will quickly see women who go to hospitals for miscarriages grilled about whether they've had a drink, worked at a job requiring physical labor, and tested for drug use\u2014and if any of these things are true, out come the cuffs. Sure, there may not be any scientific information linking her miscarriage to these activities, but anti-choicers have never really been that enthusiastic about science in the first place. Additionally, expect it to become illegal for doctors to perform emergency D&Cs on women who are miscarrying, leaving those women to die, and doctors may also be required to let a woman's fallopian tube burst rather than give her drugs to terminate ectopic pregnancies"}

{"text": "The side of \"choice\" the American abortion lobby doesn't want you to see.\n\nThursday, January 08, 2009\n\n2004: Abortion arranged by abuser's sister fatal for teen\n\nAs 2004 got started, 15-year-old Tamiia Russell was pregnant as a result of statutory rape. Her \"boyfriend\" was 24 years old. He recruited his sister to get rid of his problem. She took Tamiia to five different Detroit area abortion facilities, which turned her away because of how advanced the pregnancy was. One even offered the girl prenatal care and vitamins. But the abuser's sister hit pay dirt on January 7 at Womancare Clinic in Lanthrup Village, a National Abortion Federation member.\n\nStaff at Womancare Clinic inserted laminaria to dilate Tamiia's cervix and prepare her for the actual abortion to be performed the following day.\n\nUpon returning home, Tamiia told her mother and aunt what was happening. They contacted WomanCare, asking to have the laminaria removed because Tamiia did not want the abortion. Staff lied, telling the family that removing the laminaria would kill the girl. So, the next day, Tamiia went through with the procedure, performed by Dr. Alberto Hodari (pictured).\n\nTamiia bled heavily after coming home froom the abortion on January 8. She bled so heavily that the blood soaked a mattress. Her family called WomanCare, and were reassured that Tamiia's bleeding was normal. But rather than take their advice and do nothing, Tamiia's family called an ambulance. She was dead on arrival at the hospital despite paramedics' attempts to save her.\n\nDr. Leigh Hlavaty, who performed the autopsy on Tamiia, attributed her death to \"uterine infarction with sepsis due to status second trimester abortion.\" Hlavaty said, \"I ruled it normal because these complications are expected with this type of abortion.\"\n\nHodari was also implicated in the death of Chivon Williams. Dr. Miller, director of Citizens for a Pro-life Society, reports that there have been 23 lawsuits in the past 20 years against WomanCare facilities and Alberto Hodari, for abortion injuries including complications resuting on hysterectomies on 19, 22, and 23-year-old women. All were dismissed, with many referring to undisclosed settlements.\n\nYou don't get the part about how somebody was GOIN G TO KILL HIS CHILD.\n\nHe wasn't upset that his favorite TV show had been pre-empted. Or that a girl turned him down for a date. Or that his steak was undercooked. SOMEBODY WAS GOING TO KILL HIS CHILD.\n\nAnd with the enthusiastic approval of millions of his fellow citizens.\n\nANY man who would just shrug that off with, \"Oh, well. Better luck next time\" doesn't deserve to be called a man, any more than a woman who actually WANTS to climb on the abortion table and have her child killed deserves to be called a woman.\n\nWe don't have the proper vocabulary to describe people who are keen on killing their own children. It's an insult to real men and real women to apply the words to people who kill their own children simply because they want to. But that's just a flaw in the English language.\n\nThere was a time we tolerated slavery. There was a time that rape and pillage were just perks of being soldiers. And one day there will be a time when we look back on abortion with the same horror and loathing with which we now view what was considered \"normal\" when those practices were embraced.\n\nIf you don't want people to hate you for killing their children, STOP THE KILLING. It's really very simple. It's too bad that too many people are too fucked up to grasp that killing babies is just wrong.\n\nThe question ought not to be \"Why did this guy do this?\" but \"Why aren't fathers all over the country standing up in defense of their children?\"\n\nThe harpies of the Left have castrated American men. It's about time they grew some balls and started saying, \"Anybody who wants to kill my child has to do it over my dead body.\"\n\nAnd it's about time the NORMAL women rose up and said that the babykilling harpies do NOT speak for normal women. Then need to refuse to choose.\n\nWhen BOTH parents say, \"Enough is enough! Nothing in this world is worth buying at the cost of my child's life!\"\n\nAnd the doctors need to grow a set as well. What kind of quack performs surgery on a patient who self-refers, based on what she heard from her friends or read in magazines or just decided on her own?\n\nIf I walked into an ENT's office and said, \"My friend's kids had their tonsils out and it cleared up their sinus problems. So I want you to take my tonsils out,\" and he actually set up an appointment and yanked my tonsils, he'd be rightly censured for quackery. If somebody walked into an oncologist's office and said, \"I think this lump in my breast is cancer; I want you to do a mastectomy\" and he just lopped the breast off, he'd rightly be censured for quackery. But four thousand women a day self-refer for abortions, based on conversations with friends and family, stuff they read on the internet, things they heard from activists, etc.\n\nCan we back up a bit please and realise that we don't have all the details for this case. Whatever it is, it doesn't sound like they were a stable happy couple in which a young child might flourish - do they?\n\nIf father felt the only way he could stop her abortion was to torch the place rather then ask her to wait while they looked at all the options, leads me to believe that he was a touch violent.\n\nGrannygrump knows I don't think that death is the worst thing that could happen to anyone so I wonder what happened to that baby in the end?\n\nAlso, about Tammiia's story - something just doesn't gell for me. Why didn't she talk to her mother and Aunt before the abortion? If she was so far along in her pregnancy, didn't anyone pick it up and call the police on statutory rape?\n\nLilliput, I'm not saying the guy is a paragon. There's a LOT we don't know. I'm saying we need to ask how the hell we got to the point where a man trying to SAVE HIS CHILD FROM DEATH is looked at as a freak at best. The man who looks the other way, who doesn't care if his child is put to death, the man who actively wants the child put to death, THOSE are the men who should be looked at askance. We should be asking first what's wrong with them, that they're abdicating the role of protecting their families.\n\nWhat that guy did is a symptom of a sick, sick, sick society, and our reaction to him is even more evidence of the sickness.\n\nAs to what happened to the baby, I'd like to know why \"We don't know that all would have been peachy\" comes to mean, \"So it's probably best if somebody just snuffed him.\" When a fireman pulls somebody out of a burning building, we don't get in the fireman's face about how that person will fare at the burn center, how much rehabilitation he might need, etc. Nobody lambastes firemen for pulling people out of burning buildings even though we also know that burn injuries typically mean hideous pain, often nasty disfigurement, and frequently disability.\n\nI agree that death isn't the worst thing that can happen to you. That'd be damnation. And there are a buttload of other horrible things that can befall people. But we have to ask what kind of a sick society have we built, where it's considered normal for a mother to be killing her child and abnormal for the father to protect the child.\n\nLilliput, I don't know why Tamiia didn't go to her family. Was she afraid her \"boyfriend\" would hurt her, hurt them, leave her? We can't ask her. We can only look at other girls in similar situations and we can see that there are a variety of scenarios.\n\nTeens can be good at hiding pregnancies. And every abortion facility the abuser's sister took her to failed to report the statutory rape. Why? Good question.\n\nNothing about Tamiia's story strikes me as odd. It's all too typical. It's like the stories of drunk drivers, or women who move in with men who abuse their kids, or so on. People do things that are crazy, stupid, and/or evil. And what went on with Tamiia is unusual only in that we know names and dates"}
{"text": "Reading the coverage of this case is making me sick to my stomach. I pray that true justice is enacted, because shit like this has to stop. No matter what the circumstances, sex with someone who is unconscious is RAPE. Just because she got drunk and hung out with males does not mean she deserved to be raped. As the Twitter feminists are pointing out, lots of men hang out with drunk women without raping them, because they aren't rapists! The teen boys in this story are rapists. There are photos and videos of what they did to her!\n\nBeing a woman is so scary. Apparently you can have a few too many drinks, hang out at a party with some dudes, and it's YOUR FAULT when they RAPE YOUR UNCONSCIOUS BODY.\n\n\"I've never been able to find a study on this, but I have to think that there's some psychological consequence of raising half the population with the idea that the primary name for themselves is temporary. You don't escape that on an individual level by not changing your name, although we do shift the culture when a critical mass of women stop changing their names. But I think there's something to the idea that an understanding of one's own name as temporary feeds into an understanding of one's identity as less fully developed \u2014 that when women are collectively raised in a society where we get our \"real\" names only after we find someone to marry us, that we understand our own identities as inherently tied to someone else.\"\n\n\"And women, if the man you're set to marry extols the virtues of sharing a family name but won't consider taking yours? Perhaps ask yourself if you should be marrying someone who thinks your identity is fundamentally inferior to his own.\"\n\nHere's how we know that the pro-life movement doesn't really care about saving the souls of the unborn\n\nThe claim, as illustrated by the quote I posted below, is that a new person is created at the moment the egg and sperm meet and a zygote is formed, and therefore we are supposed to do all we can to protect that new person who apparently has all the rights of a born person.\n\nBut that logic apparently doesn't apply to ALL zygotes. Here's some science, folks: After the egg and sperm meet (the moment of \"conception\"), it still takes usually 7-10 days for the newly formed zygote to actually implant in the uterus. That's why it takes a little while for the person to know that they're pregnant. But here's the thing. It's estimated that about 60 percent of the time, implantation fails to occur, and the zygote is naturally expelled from the body. The person gets their period and they never know that they were \"almost pregnant.\"\n\nIf a fertilized egg is a person who must be saved at all costs, that means 60 percent of people are dying shortly after fertilization, not even including abortions and miscarriages! So why is no one up in arms about all those dead zygotes that never had a chance? Why aren't they holding vigils for those failed implantations? Maybe there's a potential medical breakthrough out there that could reduce the implantation failure rate and save all those unborn humans.\n\nBut no one is pouring money into that kind of research or spreading the word about this common tragedy. Instead, they only want to restrict the rights of people who have a positive on their pregnancy test, or who want to use birth control or in vitro fertilization. If they really cared about zygotes, they would care about all of them.\n\nBut they don't care about zygotes. They only care about controlling the ability of a female-bodied person to decide whether or when they have childrenSo true. I remember sitting through abstinence (or \"purity\") lectures in school. When talking to the boys, the speaker would tell them that when they were tempted to have sex, or looked at a girl sexually, they should think about how they would feel if a guy looked at their future daughter that way. They were expected to be interested in protecting their imaginary daughters' virginities \u2014 and thus the virginities of girls they were dating \u2014 but not necessarily their own. It's like girls are either pure or corrupted, while boys are just neutral. And apparently girls can't make their own decisions, so boys have to take care of them and keep them pure/safe/whatever. Also, how paternalistic/patriarchal is that? No wonder men are terrible."}

{"text": "What exactly DOES belong in a uterus?\n\nA friend posted an image in a private FaceBook group that I am in. It was originally posted on the wall of a friend of a friend of hers (follow?)\n\nThe picture was attributed to a group called \"Acknowledge Class Warfare Exists!\" and while I can appreciate the sentiment, there are some bits that I find challenging.\n\nBefore I continue I need to share: I am a very linear thinker. This makes me good at math and science and pretty crappy at the touchy-feely things. I can usually \"see\" the other person's point of view, but I do find it hard to empathize with that point of view. In my mind, if A=B and B=Q, then A=Q. That little equation will come back later, so be sure to remember it, ya dig?\n\nBack to the message. So, according to this group, the following things \"belong\" in a uterus:\n\nIUDs\n\nbabies\n\nhormones\n\nThe following things do NOT \"belong\" in a uterus:\n\nreligion\n\nlaws\n\nmen\n\n\"persons\"\n\nmisplaced moral outrage\n\nFor those of you who skipped Biology or just hated it (and if you hated it, please don't tell me. I live in a world where everyone loves Biology and Anatomy/Phys,) and don't want to look at Wikipedia yourself, because like me you get sidetracked on Wikipedia, the uterus is the major female, hormone-responsive reproductive sex organ of most mammals, including humans. On one end you have the cervix, which opens into the vagina and the other end you have the fallopian tubes and ovaries. As far as the function of the uterus:\n\nThe reproductive function of the uterus is to accept a fertilized ovum which passes through the utero-tubal junction from the fallopian tube. It implants into the endometrium, and derives nourishment from blood vessels which develop exclusively for this purpose. The fertilized ovum becomes an embryo, attaches to a wall of the uterus, creates a placenta, and develops into a fetus (gestates) until childbirth.\n\nSo\u2026 biologically, the only things that \"belong\" in a uterus would be:\n\na fertilized ovum: most fertilization takes place in the fallopian tubes and requires the presence of sperm, so we could technically say that sperm belongs there from time to time.\n\nthe endometrium: this is shed monthly as a female's menstrual period, provided there is no fertilized ovum.\n\nblood vessels\n\nan embryo\n\na placenta: which does produce hormones\n\na fetus: which isn't technically a \"baby\" until childbirth. The fetal stage of prenatal development is from the 9th week after fertilization (11 weeks from Last Menstrual Period) until childbirth.\n\nGiven all of this, we can concur with their image that only hormones belong in the uterus. They don't specify endogenous or exogenous hormones, but I am going to say endogenous hormones, because those are the ones your body makes naturally. IUDs\u2026 don't really belong in a uterus. After all, it's either a piece of copper or a piece of plastic and hormones. I don't think plastic nor copper belongs in the uterus, do you? As far as \"Babies\" go, babies are developmentally fetuses until childbirth, so babies don't belong in the uterus either.\n\nLet's take a closer look at what doesn't belong there:\n\nreligion: fair enough. There are so many different religions with differing opinions that it would be painful to try to cram all of those ideologies into a uterus. But at the same time, that would mean that Religious Organizations would have to cease supporting women and children\u2026 so St. Vincent de Paul (besides the usual thrift store ware, SVdP also provides assistance in paying bills to low/ no-income individuals,) church food pantries, Religion-affilitated hospitals and the like should turn women away because we don't want religion and women to mix.\n\nlaws: since laws do not belong in the uterus, that means that all laws protecting abortion rights, equal access to healthcare, sexual assault (OK, technically that should be vagina,) and material/ maternity rights, including right to work, should be stricken from the books?\n\nMen: hmmm. Well, men are humans that carry an XY pair of chromosomes. Are they saying that all male children should be terminated? Of course, I am being facetious. I believe that the creator of this image is saying that the opinions of men do not count in the realm of women's reproductive health. So, you better fire your male OB and stop listening to the opinions of your husband/ boyfriend/ father because, you know, they don't count, because they don't have a uterus. (sarcasm) At the same time, if your mom, grandma, favorite aunt, best friend, MIL or any other women you know have had a hysterectomy, you better stop listening to them too, because they don't have a uterus anymore either. (/sarcasm)\n\n\"Persons\": this is probably my favorite. This, I believe, is referring to the \"Personhood Amendments\" that some states have tried to pass as a way to make abortion, some forms of birth control and/ or IVF inaccessible. The basic thought is to assign the title of \"person\" to an embryo and fetus, giving them human rights and making abortion and some forms of birth control akin to homicide as it would involve the termination of life of a person. The idea of personhood does get sticky when considering IVF and the freezing of embryos. What rights, if any, should an embryo or fetus have? But here is where the logic breaks down for me: If an Enbryo/Fetus/Baby is a human (because it's part of the human species) and a human is a person, wouldn't that follow that an Enbryo/Fetus/Baby is a Person?\n\nMisplaced Moral Outrage: This is one of those abstract ideas that my mind doesn't wrap well around. If you have any insights as to what \"misplaced moral outrage\" is, please share!\n\nIn the end, the image served its purpose. It's hip and gritty and I actually like the style of the photograph (LOVE the stark contrast and black and white.) It kind of generated discussion (on the original post) as much as a FaceBook image posting could. It is novel and creative, even if it lacks a bit of logic/ technical knowledge. I, obviously, do not agree with it, but I surely give it an A+ for creativity.\n\nSo the $10,000 question: Why did I spend the last 40 minutes of my life writing a post about this image?\n\nEasy. My house needs cleaning and I don't want to do it.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nDon't forget to enter the Fluffy Wishes Giveaway! It runs through July 24th!! Happy Entering!!\n\n5 Responses to What exactly DOES belong in a uterus?\n\nWell, since MY house also needs cleaning and I don't want to do it, I'll take a few moments to reply to further distract you from the chore that you and I are both avoiding\n\nLOL at too many religions to fit into a uterus\n\nThis image is quite silly, in my opinion. First, it contradicts itself by including 'baby' in the uterus category but then puts 'persons' in the non uterus category\u2026last time I checked, babies were people. I believe that if they were trying to prove a point against personhood amendments, they should have at least taken the time to change 'baby' to 'zygote/embryo/fetus'.\n\nAnd agreed on the laws sentiment\u2026there are many laws that protect one's 'uterus', so women would be ill advised to dismiss all laws from uterus territory. Did this artist forget about Roe v. Wade? Pretty sure they'd be on board with that law.\n\nAs far as the misplaced moral outrage, I am assuming this is referring to women thinking that people who are frustrated with the 'moral degradation of society' place the blame on women. To an extent, this is true as many of the moral arguments present in today's discussion center around issues involving women (i.e. abortion, birth control access, sexual violence, sexual 'promiscuity' for a lack of better term, etc.). However, I would say that this image does little more than to 'preach to the choir' of women (and men) who believe that this represents a valid feminist argument. As a feminist myself, I find it to be quite narrow minded and really not effective for changing people's minds. By using the term 'belongs', it's kind of ironic that they are saying they don't want anyone telling people what to do with their uterus, yet they are projecting that uteri are for IUDs, babies, and hormones (I'm assuming they mean exogenous in this context), none of which are universal 'wants' for all women.\n\nAll I see when I look at that poster is \"what belongs: whatever I want, whenver I want\" and \"what doesn't belong: anything that might make me feel guilty about doing whatever I want whenever I want without regard for the feelings of other, God's will, or unborn children and other natural consequences\"\n\nWell I can tell you that whenever I feel moral outrage, it's definitely at uteruses (uteri?). Oh wait, that's only when I have really bad cramps\u2026 yea, I really didn't get the misplaced moral outrage \u2013 no one is hating on the uterus, we are trying to love on the uterus"}
{"text": "I don't get why everyone's getting in such a heat over the \"When does human life begin?\" answers. Cecil was asked for his opinion based on his thoughts. That's exactly the answer he gave. He wasn't asked, \"Does a woman have a right to choose?\" or \"Do you think it's morally right to have an abortion?\" No. He was asked one question- \"When does human life begin?\"\n\nUnderstandably it's a touchy topic. There's a lot of emotion involved, and people get very wound up about it. But Cecil's logical answer has absolutely nothing to do with emotion, which is exactly what many people are missing. He mentioned many other common opinions, as well as his own, which was ultimately based on fact. If you don't like it, that's too bad. Fact is fact, you can't change it. The people objecting seem mostly to be driven by unrelated matters. Just because they don't like his answer, they're quick to jump on the \"he's a misogynist!\" bandwagon, much like many do when someone morally objects to abortion.\n\nI am strongly pro-choice and can understand where the objectors' opinions are coming from. However, I also understand Cecil's idea. At first it shocked me too- But as I thought about it, his answer ending up making a lot of sense. The thing is, all these people are so quick to attack the wrong people, for the wrong reasons. Based on everything he's said, Cecil doesn't seem the kind to protest outside abortion clinics or actively try and pass laws against abortion. Basically, he seems pretty pro-choice about the whole thing. Attacking him and calling him names because he approached such a delicate topic logically not only isn't going to do any good, but it also makes you look ignorant.\n\nIt's good to question- Hell, it's GREAT to question anything you're told. You shouldn't take Cecil's answer to heart if you haven't really thought about it yet. But in the end, it makes perfect sense- If the ceasing of brain activity marks the end of a life, shouldn't the start of brain activity mark its beginning? This has absolutely nothing to do with a woman's right to her body. This has nothing to do with misogyny or freedom or men ruling over women with an iron fist just for the sake of showing power.... No. The question was, \"When does human life begin?\" All other topics addressed are moot, and should at best be considered straw men attempts to destroy his logic-based answer.\n\nIf you've learned even one lesson from knowledge-seeking sites like this, it should be that just because you don't like the truth, that doesn't make it any valid. Emotion has nothing to do with fact. Cecil answered the question asked. If you don't like the answer, address the question at hand and give a real reason to object, rather than dance around the topic by taking cheap shots with name-calling.\n\nHyperShadow\n\n11-23-2008, 04:30 AM\n\nI'm not from the US, so I'm gratefully excused from having to make the decision as to be pro-choice or pro-life. At least, I refuse to decide before I have enough information.\n\nAs a health care professional, I've always had these two questions that have never been satisfactorily answered (I dunno if Cecil might want to take a crack at them):\n\n1. Since when does anyone have a right to their own body?\nSure, ethically u might argue that everyone should, and u might be right too, but how can one argue that this right even exists in most countries? If I have this right to my own body, why can't I legally pump myself full of drugs every day, in the privacy of my own home? Shouldn't the right to abortion and the right to abuse drugs go hand in hand? I notice very few people (save the extreme liberals) are for both.\n\n2. How does a right to your own body give you the right to mess with another body, even if it's inside you? Personhood or not, the fetus is made from genetic material that is very different from the mother's. Around 50% in fact, thanks to daddy. This difference sometimes causes serious problems in fact, such as HDN (hemolytic disease of the newborn). The mother might be growing the fetus inside of her, but it's not \"her body\" by any definition.\n\nI realise these questions may sound insensitive to many women, but sensitivity is not the issue here. I seriously wish to hear a legitimate, rational response to these questions.\n\nHap Shaughnessy\n\n11-23-2008, 04:43 AM\n\nHuman life began, as far as I can tell, during the year 2 800 074 (bc) ,according to your most recent best guesses at a cosmic calendar, which is, believe it or not, only a couple orders of magnitude or so away from universal reality.\n\nHap Shaughnessy\n\n11-23-2008, 04:52 AM\n\nMore directly, the answer is .... maybe. You don't really wanna know the whole truth. It will be disturbing to you, no matter which side you previously supported.\n\nbmoreluv\n\n11-23-2008, 12:21 PM\n\nRe: Hap Shaughnessy's original post:\nMaybe i can answer you. After all, i just made an ass of myself on this message board by letting emotions cloud my reason.\nRoe Vs. Wade became law in the seventies, and black men were 'granted' the vote before women were, and many of us women, especially the bright ones, feel the pain of inequities every day. It's certainly better than it used to be, but believe me... it's not over yet. It festers like a great big sore on our collective psyches, and sometimes, in a PTSD-like way, it can happen that the straw man looks very real. Sticks get poked inadvertently into this sort of hornet's nest all the time, often by well-meaning men who never intended insult, but only forgot to wear their oven mitts. We must remember, emotions are valuable, and have their place, especially those which foster connection. The point is to treat our own emotional reactions like we would our children when they throw a fit...check to see what the problem is, and choose the best course, but since we are all only human, it will always happen that occassionally, emotion will get the better of us, especially with such a touchy subject as this one.\n\nbmoreluv\n\n11-23-2008, 12:32 PM\n\nAs to Hyper-shadow's question:\nI wonder if we might not ask instead when the very idea of granting people rights came into being, because i'm pretty sure that it was only after such positions of ultimate power (to grant and take away rights) were invented.\n\nbmoreluv\n\n11-23-2008, 01:07 PM\n\nI was replying to Canis Major's \"what's the big deal, folks?\" Not Hap Shaughnessy.

What he said was that the circumstances of conception have effect on when human life begins. Are you suggesting that children of rape are less human than other children?

I wasn't sure if I should say something, as I feel that all post made primarily out of anger should be confined to the Pit, or, even better, left unsaid. YMMV, but I feel that one should get out the anger in a way that doesn't hurt anyone (even verbally), then figure out what made you mad in the first place. If it's legitimate, then discuss that, not the anger itself. Anger is a secondary emotion, after all.\n\nMusicat\n\n12-04-2008, 02:12 PM\n\n12 posts and no one has suggested that a link to the article we are discussing (this is the forum for Cecil's columns, right?) would be a good idea?\n\nEXCELLENT POST BY HYPERSHADOW! 11-23-2008, 04:30 AM Wow, someone who \"gets it\". Wonderful! I like the opening post in this thread too, but so far the second one is the best... maybe I should read the rest?\n\nLet me sum up bmoreluv's posts in general: \"Life is so unfair! The world is so unfair! Women are so oppressed and downtrodden! My life sucks! I hate myself, hate the world, hate everyone in it!\" That about sums it up. And what addled thinking, as evidenced by this: \"I wonder if we might not ask instead when the very idea of granting people rights came into being, because i'm pretty sure that it was only after such positions of ultimate power (to grant and take away rights) were invented.\"\n\nI think the concept first was tested when Adam said, \"Ya wanna\" and Eve took a minute before saying \"Uh-huh\". Do you have problems with authority or something? I do...\n\nLook, of course abortion is a touchy subject - it involves ending a life! And, as was pointed out on another thread, THERE IS IN FACT NO MIDDLE GROUND!\n\nFunny, Quepasa totally misrepresents most of what Cecil said: \"Cecil, a man, who doesn't have to deal with this stuff said a woman should be forced to bare a rapists child and that those of us who disagree with him are responsible for electing Bush.\" Sorry, you said those things, Cecil didn't.\n\nThe rape issue is particularly prickly, since it is perhaps the one case where it can be justifiably argued a woman got pregnant through no fault of her own, at least in most cases. But it can be equally argued that the new life inside her does not bear any blame for the sins of it's father and therefore does not deserve to be killed - it in fact should be cherished just like any other developing human. I know, the argument that it will remind the mother of the rape and associated arguments are very emotional - and thus should pretty much be toned down, if not eliminated entirely, if we're discussing the logic, not the emotion, of the issue.\n\nKudos to BigT: \"one should get out the anger in a way that doesn't hurt anyone (even verbally), then figure out what made you mad in the first place\"\n\nToo bad few here seem able to follow your wise counsel.\n\nThere were two pages about this topic, Musicat. You seem to have picked part 2 of 2 and I have a sneaking suspicion this thread came after reading both parts 1 and 2, if not only part 2. Here is the link to part 2:\n\nThere were responses, both that started whole new threads, and within existing threads, which really belong in the pit... yet some seem to be unable to follow rules.

{"text": "I created this thread to discuss abortion and the different opinions surrounding it. I know abortion has been mentioned a few times in the election thread, but I felt it should have it's own topic altogether.\n\nI am pro-choice. I believe that a woman has every right to what grows and lives off of her and that you obtain rights when you are born, not when you are conceived.\n\nI know there are also a lot of pro-lifers out there, so feel free to discuss your opinion and your own reasons for why you believe what you believe.\n\n_________________ \"It would be a stronger world, a stronger loving world, to die in.\"\n\nI'm pro-choice. Abortion's a moral gray area for me, but there are a lot of very valid reasons to get one. Some people look down on those who opt to abort a fetus with a known serious birth defect, but honestly that's one of the situations where I can unequivocally say I would make the same choice. Leaving it alive to suffer a hopeless life of pain and misery is a greater sin in my mind than killing it.\n\nHonestly I see abortion as a necessary evil, something that shouldn't be encouraged but should always be safely and legally available. No one's making these choices easily. If someone wants to avoid having a baby badly enough to get an abortion, they should be allowed to get one.\n\n_________________\n\n\"Under no circumstances should anyone encourage the ordinary person to be funny.\" --Bob Mackey\n\nIt's a fact that if technology like this exists, people will find it somehow.

So trying to minimize the number of accidental conception and problems which arise from theseLast edited by Tada on Fri Oct 17, 2008 1:56 pm, edited 1 time in total.\n\nI think one of the problems is the use of the words \"pro life\" and \"pro choice\". I feel that it should be a woman's rite to have a child or not. However, I would hope that they would have the child rather than abort it. I think everyone is \"pro life\", but there can be circumstances where abortion is seen to be the only option.\n\n_________________\n\n\"Heard them Walthers like to jump some\" \"As will you, with one in your elbowRight, if it gets banned in the U.S. (which is very unlikely) then it would open up a dangerous black market where doctors are literally doing abortions in their garages. I'm all for birth control and contraceptives and I'd much prefer that over abortion. Women should just have the choice to what is theirs. As long as that baby is in the woman and growing off of her, the baby belongs to the woman.\n\n_________________ \"It would be a stronger world, a stronger loving world, to die inThe problem I see here is deciding where to draw the line. If you're \"pro-choice with exceptions,\" what are the exceptions to be? What are the situations that make abortion completely unacceptable? (\"Pro-life with exceptions\" is easier to define.)\n\nYikes. What a topic. Volatile, but absolutely worthy of discussion. Might as well put in my two cents.\n\nFirst of all, I don't appreciate the phrases \"pro-choice\" and \"pro-life.\" Every reasonable person is both in favor of choice and in favor of life. Abortion is a totally separate issue.\n\nSecondly, there are quite a few times when pregnancy can endanger the life of the mother. Diabetes, for example, carries a high risk of miscarriage. If childbirth could potentially kill both mother and child, I don't care how you slice it. That fetus must be aborted.\n\nThen there's the issue of \"Sanctity of Life.\" With all respect, I think this is a crock. In a world where millions of people are killed and tortured in war and slavery; where people are killed every day for egregious crimes; where doctors, insurance agents and undertakers charge through the nose to deliver, take care of and bury people; I can't understand how anyone can think that life is sacred. Moreover, there's the charge that all children want to be born. This implies that pre-born children have emotions and thoughts. How, in Heaven or on Earth, can anyone possibly have emotions or ideas before they are capable of conscious thought?\n\nFinally, there's this simple fact: There are too many people. In 1975, there were 4 billion people on Earth. In the late 80's, we hit 5 billion. In 2000, we hit 6 billion. You do the math. We are growing at an exponential rate and it won't be long before the planet is unable to sustain us. Certainly, I don't propose mass murder or genocide to slow that trend. Birth control is the best -- and possibly the only -- solution to keep the birth rate down. To that end, I don't think that any method of birth control should be taken off the table.\n\nTo be clear, I don't like the idea of killing babies before they even technically exist. However, I recognize that it can be a necessary evil and I hate the hypocrisy and ignorance of common so-called \"pro-life\" arguments.\n\nAt the same time, I recognize that it is a volatile and debatable issue. You could argue either way that a fetus is a human being. I respect that. CSFRITZ, for example, is clearly a family man who loves his children and can't bear the thought of what life would be like if they had been aborted. His attitude is nothing short of honorable and I'll say nothing against it.\n\nThe problem I see here is deciding where to draw the line. If you're \"pro-choice with exceptions,\" what are the exceptions to be?I can agree with both of your points. But then, I'm sure that greater contraceptive use would lower the birth rate as well.\n\nWhen I made my earlier comment, I was referring to condom use and birth control pills as well as abortion. In retrospect, lumping the latter with the former two may have been a little extreme.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that if fewer people get pregnant, there will obviously be less need for abortion. That means greater contraceptive use, which would certainly be easier to accomplish with a higher standard of living."}
{"text": "propagandaRight now, like this very instant, I am in some pretty bad pain. I won't say horrible, or searing, nauseating, or excruciating, because that is what the pain was like today at noon when I had to leave work early. But still pretty bad.\n\nSix years ago, when I was nineteen, I had a cyst the size of a softball removed from my ovary. Before I had that surgery, I was in searing, nauseating pain for nearly three months. Because no doctor at the university medical center would believe me that what I felt was worse than just \"cramps\" or \"gas.\"\n\nI passed out during church (I went to church back then).\n\nI had to crawl into an elevator because I couldn't walk from the pain.\n\nAnd now that pain is coming back. It's been sneaking up on me. But I've been afraid to go to the doctor. Afraid to face up to having been uninsured and unable to pay for medication for the last two and a half years, despite specific orders that I remain on birth control always and forever. Afraid to see a new doctor and explain what I KNOW is happening to me, because I remember what it was like to be dismissed. Afraid to remind my parents that I am currently on birth control, which they strongly disagree with, despite it being the tenuous shield that is protecting my health.\n\nAll these legislators are arguing to try to take away my ability to own and control my body. It just makes me sick to my stomach. And I don't need that right now.\n\nIt is ridiculous enough that I am afraid to go to the doctor because my experiences tell me that I won't be taken seriously without having to see headline after headline about how some old men are certain that I cannot possibly know what is best for my life and my body. Because none of this is about religion, it's about making sure that I will never have the confidence to walk into my gynecologist's office and say, \"I'm 25, I don't ever want to have kids, and this uterus and these ovaries have been nothing but trouble to me, please take them away.\"\n\nI'm having a sonogram tomorrow, and hopefully some wonderful, understanding, feminist doctor will come and zap me with a magical laser and I will be okay forever. Because I just want my body back And more curiously, why do so few women \u2014 1 out of 10 \u2014 actually have them Not that we're complaining about our useless orgasms, but still. Sometimes it's cool to know what's going on behind all that excitement.\n\nWait.\n\nOnly 10% of women have orgasms?!\n\nBecause\u2026. that seems incorrect.\n\nI'm pretty fucking sure more than 10% of women masturbate, and that's a means to orgasm. Right? RIGHT??\n\nOkay, I'm about to go have an elusive female orgasm (or several) because I'm suddenly feeling extremely insecure about my ability to come. What if they take it away? WHAT IF??!?\n\nThere's no fucking way. Maybe only 1 in 10 women report having orgasms during intercourse. But I HIGHLY doubt only 1 in 10 women have ever had an orgasm in her lifetime.\n\nPlus, why are scientists still arguing about this? Female orgasms obviously have an advantage when you (male scientists!) stop implicitly assuming rape is an evolutionarily advantageous mating strategy AND if you stop projecting contemporary sexism back into prehistory.\n\nI think it's safe to assume that our ancient forebears had no fucking clue how reproduction actually worked. They likely understood that sex had something to do with it, but I doubt they even suspected the link between ejaculation and fertilization, especially given that human female ovulation is not obvious to the naked eye. Cavemen would have sex with cavewomen and sometimes a baby would be the result, sometimes not.\n\nIt's likely that ancient humans thought women were the main (re)producers of life, i.e. had the most control over when they conceived. Raping women randomly might get you offspring, but it might also get you kicked the fuck out of your tribe/village/whatever.\n\nWe also know for a fact that human children are helpless for a long time after birth. A woman recovering from childbirth couldn't go out and bring home a fucking wooly mammoth on her own. She needed a partner (or several) to help support her and her children while they were helpless. Given this (and some evidence from studying the few preindustrialized peoples left living in remote corners of the earth), it's likely that early humans raised children communally. That would ensure evolutionary success, not just a bunch of cave dudes putting their cave dicks into unwilling cave vaginas. Ensuring your genetic material survives is not necessarily just about reproducing as many kiddies as possible\u2014it's also about making sure they actually survive into adulthood!\n\nYou can't ensure your bundles of genetic material (children) survive all the rigors of a harsh primitive existence without a little help from not only your baby mamas, but your baby mamas' mamas, papas, cousins, sisters, etc. And I doubt those necessarily tightly knit, extended family/kinship networks in early human societies would tolerate the men basically raping the women. We're inherently social creatures and coerced sex is inherently anti-social.\n\nOK, so winding down: female orgasms make evolutionary sense because orgasms feel fucking great! Women who feel good are more likely to stick with a particular partner (or two, or three, if you believe that ancient peoples were poly, which I do). Figuring out how female sexual pleasure works is something that comes with time and necessitates a sensitive partner\u2026not a rapist. Given everything I've discussed above, it makes more sense to think that female orgasms are not merely a vestigial scrap tossed to women, but something that ensured bonding among partners, which was necessary for evolutionary success.\n\nThat's the problem with speculation about evolution: If you start off with a bad, sexist, patriarchal, culturally-specific premise like, \"female orgasms are useless\", then your theories are going to be bad. Oftentimes, shifting to a feminist perspective can answer questions that many scientists have deemed mysterious.\n\nreblogging for downlo's AWESOME commentary.\n\nAmazing how that shift in perspective makes something \"mysterious\" so obvious\n\nIt makes me really freaking sad (working in the food service industry) seeing how many otherwise powerful, intelligent, successful women are completely crippled by their unhealthy opinions of their own bodies.\n\nI'm not saying you shouldn't go to the gym, or be careful not to eat foie gras every night. But dammit, if you love food, then ENJOY it! If you want to be in better shape, do it! Work out, get fit. But do it because you want to get fit, not because you're terrified of being considered worthless if you're not.\n\nIt sounds cliche, but it's true that people like you better and think you're more attractive if you're comfortable with yourself and your lifestyle. And I doubt that you can be that way if\n\n\"I'm never eating again, except protein and now ill be living at the gym\u2026 forever.\"\n\nbecause your boyfriend thought someone skinnier than you (on TV, no less) was cute. That kind of reaction betrays the kind of poor self-esteem that makes me sad and angry.\n\nI'm sorry that the culture that we live in makes it so hard for women to like themselves. And I wish that the women I know who are great, talented, smart and good-looking could see beyond the barrier of \"skinny\" into the realm of \"happy.\""}

Come on. I can see saying there are tensions, but to blow off the issue that easily is\u2026well, absurd and illiberal.\n\nOf course most people are not saying that circumcision is anywhere as bad as FGM, but that it does mutilate the child and so violate individual rights\u2026But liberalism should mean distinguishing between abusive, unacceptable cultural forms that violate individual freedom and ones you just don't agree with (which, to some New Atheists, is going to mean pretty much all religious upbringings).\n\nYes but in what sense is it clear that snipping off a bit of a baby's penis for non-medical reasons is not an abusive, unacceptable cultural form that violates individual freedom?\n\nI would disagree with Fraser over only one thing \u2013 calling this liberalism. It's actually statism, an ideology that causes far more child cruelty than all the religions in Europe combined.\n\nAh right, it's the fault of New Atheism and statism. That's that sorted.\n\nShare this:\n\n92 comments\n\nThere is no medical reason for routine circumsicion of boys. Period. If this dudebro can't understand it from a moral point of view maybe he can from a medical one: it is wrong to administer and charge for treatment that isn't medically indicated.\n\n2\n\nBeauzeaux\n\nFascinating is the double standards of how we regard the sexes in our culture. The term alone \"FGM\" does not have an equally recognized form with respect to males; not because it doesn't exist, but because in the realm of the evolutionarily justified \"disposable male\" it is easily ignored.\n\nThe comparison is not absurd, the contrast is. Both \"function\" just fine. Both are life long choices made for person. Both are wrong on that basis. The only thing that makes one worse; is its statement against female sexual freedom of which it represents, and the insult therein.\n\npatterson\n\nWhile I guess you can claim some kinship between female and male circumcision, the two are in many ways incomparable, from the risks and the damage caused to the motivations for the respective 'surgeries/mutilations'. While male circumcision might be a cruel and pointless affectation, female circumcision is an unimaginable horror, a complete nightmare. However that doesn't mean that it can't be seen as a form of physical abuse and a violation. After all you can't justify violence by pointing out that worse violence is happening somewhere else.\n\nDoes anyone know what \"the evolutionary \"disposable male\"\" means? Is this MRA speak?\n\nWhile the penis can function pretty well without a foreskin, it doesn't function identically, I'm told. It reportedly changes (and allegedly reduces) sensation. Can't testify from personal experience, having only ever known one penis fashion style. But it certainly is no where as bad as FGM.\n\nBut what is far better is earlobe removal. The ear functions perfectly well without them.\n\nI'm not a father, but if I ever am, those useless earlobes are getting cut right off. Maybe not a tradition yet, but every tradition has to start somewhere!\n\nalnitak\n\nMale circumcision produces at least a 5-fold reduction in sensation (check the Pubmed database for the science). Circumcised men thrust strongly into their partner in order to overcome the limitation, altering the dynamic of lovemaking. Circumcision also makes masturbation much less facile. It is not a harmless procedure, but one that influences how the male experiences sex for the rest of his life.\n\nThis is not to say that it is equivalent to female mutilation, but it is neither useful nor harmless. For those who need verification, find the numbers of adult males who ask to be circumcised.\n\nDave\n\nI think we're on the territory of winnable and unwinnable battles here. We might succeed in stopping FGM, which is a variable cultural practice not formally endorsed by any major religion, and is a horrific act of intrusion on basic bodily function. It seems far less likely that circumcision, which is central to the tenets of a major world faith not noted for its appreciation of outside interventions, and which in itself cannot plausibly be said to be a harmful act, will be wiped out by campaigning.\n\nBeing the sort of person who equates these things is rather like being the sort of person who thinks that, for example, there should be unlimited international migration, and a right to tax-funded welfare for all residents. It makes sense to you, it may even make sense as a abstract proposition, but everyone else looks at you as if you're mad. You may be right, but that doesn't matter \u2013 politically \u2013 if most people think you're nuts.\n\nWMDKitty \u2013 even if it were the case that circumcision reduces premature ejaculation (which is isn't:  then pre-emptive non-consensual surgery would still be a bizarre response. The highest estimate for premature ejaculation is that it effects 30% of males. Why should all males be cut, with numerous and unstudied effects upon their sexual responses, because some of them might experience premature ejaculation at some point in their lives? Surely premature ejaculation is a problem to address via multiple therapies when it arises (ahem), and not something to be considered in relation to the body of a child.\n\nKevin Anthoney\n\nWest says in his article that he's not circumcised, which makes him the first non-circumcised person I've seen to support the practice.\n\nI think West's problem is that he's a died-in-the-wool traditionalist, and it doesn't really matter what the tradition is \u2013 if it's under attack from those pesky libruls, he'll support it. He'd probably support witch burning if we were still doing that.\n\n23\n\nDave Allen\n\nThe reason it's offensive is that you presume an infant will grow up to wish to adopt your standards of good sex, and that the only way to ensure that is to denude him of part of his genitals. Presumably if said infant grows up to be the sort of man who wishes to avoid sex that lasts for three thrusts the best way to do so would be to study technique, rather than mutilate himself, but if he wants a surgical reduction of penile sensation then he can do so as a consenting adult.\n\nThis then allows for him to grow up celibate and whole, or even a pathetic lover and whole, if that's what he wishes.\n\nI'm the proud owner of an intact foreskin and lived to 58 to enjoy it. I shiver at the thought of disposing of it, as anyone would do. The default position of parents toward their children's bodies should always be to keep them whole.\nFGM is much worse, I agree, but FGM and circumcision are both wrong.\nWhen my daughter was a baby, people were preparing to puncture her earlobes to wear rings, as is the custom im my culture. I forbade it. Later as a teen she did it, but it was her decision. Now as an adult she let the holes close. Her decision, again.\n\nLyanna\n\nHe's correct to say that FGM and male circumcision aren't equivalent. And there ARE people whose rhetoric implies that those two things are equivalent, so he's not attacking a straw man there.\n\nHe's also correct to say that we don't and shouldn't fully apply the liberal ideology to parent-child relations where there is no risk of serious and/or permanent damage\u2013basically, where whatever's at stake is pretty minor.\n\nWhere he goes wrong is, IMO, assuming that male circumcision is so minor. It's not the same as FGM, but that doesn't mean it's totally A-OK or trivial. If he wants to say that an alteration of a child's body by the parents before the child can give informed consent is harmless and shouldn't be banned, he needs to support that argument with evidence and reasons. He doesn't do that here.\n\n26\n\nresident_alien\n\nWMDkitty,there was actually a sexual health study in Turkey,where nearly 100% of the male population is circumcised,that came to the conclusion that the most common form of sexual disfunction in circumcised males IS premature ejaculation\u2026Apparently,it's not as simple as it seems at first sight\u2026\n\n27\n\npatterson\n\nBesides Kitty, now the MRA's are going to claim that male circumcision was dreamed up by our female overlords to increase their sexual satisfaction at the expense of the \"evolutionarily disposable males\".\n\nLeftSidePositive\n\nAs an official humorless feminist who's been accused of man-hating on these boards more times than I can count, I have to say that your statement is just plain not okay\u2013not even to joke about.\n\nPeople's bodies are their own, and they deserve to stay that way.\n\n(In my experience, though, the only people who explicitly *equate* FGM and circumcision are MRAs who are trying to derail conversations about women's rights. Feminists, at least the ones that I read, say something along the lines of: \"Thing A is bad, for reasons X, Y, and Z, and Thing B shares all those reasons but to a lesser degree, so while Thing B is not as bad, it's probably bad enough to stop doing.\")\n\nsteve oberski\n\nAny action performed on a child for motives not based on evidence and reason, be it baptism, confirmation, religious indoctrination, sexual mutilation, bar mitzvah, faith healing, etc. should be treated as child abuse.\n\nI'm sure that there is lots of non-religious motivated child abuse but as usual religion get to play the we're immune to criticism card in this area as well. It's time this stopped.\n\nYep. And a perusal of Steve's FB indicates he's a Thunderf00l partisan.\n\nNo, Steve, both don't \"function just fine.\" FGM is not analogous to removing the foreskin but to removing the entire glans penis.\n\nWMDKitty, here's a free clue: If a guy is a \"three-pump chump,\" the problem isn't penile sensitivity. The problem may not even be premature ejaculation. The problem may be that the guy is a selfish asshole. Perhaps you should improve your standards.\n\nAlso, despite the difference in societal privilege, mutilating a man's body for a woman's pleasure is no more morally supportable than is mutilating a woman's body for a man's pleasure.\n\nSteve Oberski, thanks for trivializing the issue of mutilation by comparing it to bar mitzvah and confirmation.\n\nEr, there's an ethical difference between having a child undergo a procedure that is medically necessary and having a child undergo a procedure that is purely cosmetic. (And, even in the latter category, I'd say that certain kinds of cosmetic surgeries are medically necessary, such as for facial deformities.)\n\nBY YOUR OWN LOGIC, a parent should be prohibited from making decisions about elective procedures of ANY kind (whether it's ear piercing or circumcision or what-have-you) for their child. (You did argue that the child has a right to an intact body, no?)\n\nTony aka The Psychic Octopus [safe and welcome at FtB]\n\nEmphasis mine.\nSo Ed, the genital chopping is done to both women and men. Correct?\nThe vast majority of the time, genital chopping is done without the consent of the individual involved. Correct?\nThere is no medical reason for routine circumcision of boys or girls. Correct?\nSo they're quite similar in those regards, but somehow they change to the point that one becomes a horrific, immoral, alien cultural practice, and the other becomes strange alien cultural practices. Correct?\nHow does that work?\nWhy are they different?\nThis *strange* cultural practice must be rooted in something. Something profound enough to persuade many, many, many people that male circumcision is desirable. Could the root of this *strange* cultural practice be\u2026religion?\nGod tells you to chop off bits of a boy's penis aka genital mutilation=Thumbs Up\nHumans decide to chop off bits of a girls vagina aka genital mutilation=Thumbs Down\n\nNow that we are, what's the difference between chopping off bits of a girls vagina and bits of a boy's penis?\nI'd also like to know if you would have an issue with your neighbor, father, mother, uncle or aunt telling you that you're going to get a piece of you penis chopped off as an adult (notice the lack of consent)?\nI don't know many people that would like that. I think many people would express extreme displeasure at the idea.\nWhy is it wrong to do that to an adult, but ok to do it to a child?\nWhy does the stupid religious practice of circumcision get to trump the supremely unnecessary anguish and pain faced by a young boy?\n\nDavid Marjanovi\u0107\n\n\u2026which is the historical reason for why there are circumcised Americans who aren't Muslims or Jews.\n\nThis is not to say that it is equivalent to female mutilation\n\nWell, it is equivalent to the mildest form of FGM; but that form isn't actually common. The others are much, much worse.\n\nWhat, because I think actual intercourse should last for more than five thrusts?\n\nI don't see how that's \"offensive\", especially because it's true that nobody wants a guy who gets off in three strokes.\n\nErm\u2026 are men somehow obligated to pull out and go to sleep as soon as they've gotten off once?\n\n~:-|\n\nMy nephew was circumsized in a hospital in the U.S. The doctor told the parents it was necessary for hygienic purposes.\n\n\u2026which is completely and utterly wrong. I'm just saying.\n\nI think West's problem is that he's a died-in-the-wool traditionalist\n\nOutside certain religions, circumcision only became a tradition in the 19th century, and it never caught on in, say, Europe. I was deeply disturbed when I found out a few years ago that most male Americans are circumcised.\n\nOMG, it's just as much \"mutilation\" as piercing a baby's ears!\n\nNo, much more so. Piercing an ear doesn't amputate anything.\n\n(Not that I think piercing a baby's ears is at all a good idea ever. I'm with comment 25 on that.)\n\nYou don't need your pinky toe either, would you be ok with removing it?\n\nI actually do use mine. It's sometimes very practical to be able to apply pressure at that corner of the foot during walking or running.\n\nNo it's as much as fully cutting off dangling ear lobes.\n\nNo, it's much worse than that.\n\nI simply disagree that male circumcision is \"mutilation\".\n\nYou don't actually disagree, because you lack the knowledge necessary to even form an opinion.\n\nNobody has provided evidence that circumcision is harmful or dangerous or somehow \"bad\". Just anecdotes of very, very rare surgical errors.\n\nAnd as we know, anecdotes are NOT data.\n\nSo, show me the evidence.\n====\n\nSecond:\n\nThe main argument against circumcision is, as I understand it, one of bodily autonomy, no? You're saying that it's immoral/wrong to perform a cosmetic procedure on a child without that child's consent.\n\nNow, logically, if one is opposed to circumcision, one must also be opposed to all cosmetic procedures performed on a child under the age of 18, regardless of parental consent. (This includes ear piercing.)\n====\n\nThird:\n\nLegally, parents ARE allowed to decide on these things, including whether or not to circumcise their sons, and that's the way it SHOULD be. The law should NEVER get involved in medical decisions (see the ongoing debate over abortion, birth control, and women's health), because that would interfere with the doctor-patient relationship.\n\n52\n\nJosh, Official SpokesGay\n\nYou are a self-centered fucking asshole, WMDKitty, and your position on this is morally monstrous. Who gives one FLYING FUCK what you want in bed? That has nothing to do with whether baby boys get their dicks chopped.\n\nWhat a disgusting, egotistical, inhumane, heterosexist bag of shit you dropped here. Don't tell anyone you \"disagree\". You don't get to \"disagree\" about someone else's bodily integrity, and you don't get to \"disagree\" about what is and is not mutilation unless it's YOUR OWN BODY.\n\nGack, you're putrid.\n\n53\n\nMelissaF\n\nWMDKitty \u2013 Jesus fucking Christ on a popsicle stick! WTF? You do realise that all the 'arguments' you've made are the exact same arguments people use to defend the lesser forms of FGM, right? What in the hell is wrong with you?\n\nAnecdata: I've never been with a circumcised man, & of the many men I've been with, only the teenagers (when I was a teenager) had problems with lasting long enough & being not so considerate bed partners (mostly 'cause they didn't have experience).\n\nCircumcision has NOTHING to do with how satisfying a man is at sex, & even if it did, that would be no reason for me to have had my son's foreskin lopped off causing pain, risk of infection, or having a botched job done.\n\nRegarding your 'the sex is better' argument \u2013 besides that being a hideous reason to cut off part of a baby's penis, it's also plain wrong. Not only does circumcision not alter how long the average man lasts, but that's not even how one should define good sex. If a man employs oral & manual sex, toys etc, I couldn't give a flying fuck how long he can 'thrust' for.\n\nWhether a person is good at satisfying their partner/s depends on how considerate & attentive they are, not whether they have bits lopped off their genitals. (plus I imagine it'd be easier to orally/manually stimulate an uncircumcised male \u2013 I am at a loss as to how you'd do it with only tight immoveable skin to work with. If it's not too TMI, might anyone enlighten me as to the technique one uses?)\n\ncarlie\n\nJust chiming in to say what the fuck, WMDKitty? You are seriously, totally in the wrong here. Look, I had my two boys circumcised. It was right at the cusp of when it was just starting to be talked about as an issue rather than being completely normal, my spouse was for it, and the doctor compared it to, yes, ear piercing in equivalency. I didn't know enough, and neither did my spouse, to make the correct decision. I admit I did something heinous and wish I hadn't done it, and I argue against it every time it comes up now. What I DON'T do is try and make bizarre justifications for it so that I don't feel so bad about myself. You're coming off as someone who is trying to do that.\n\n@ 56 \u2013 But that's not the criterion. Adults don't get to slice off bits of infants \u2013 even very small bits \u2013 merely because the harm is (according to them) minor or insignificant. (We know it's not zero. There's bleeding.) That's not the default. The default is the other way around \u2013 don't slice bits off infants for no real reason.\n\nIf men want to get circumcised at 18 or 21, that's up to them.\n\nAnd by the way I certainly don't approve of adults piercing the ears of children.\n\n.\n\nIn short, the decision of whether or not to circumcise \u2014 just like an abortion \u2014 ought to be between patient (or patient's caregiver) and physician.\n\nKitty \u2013 but it isn't the government telling us what we can do with our bodies \u2013 it's the gov't (or in this case the court, which is slightly different) telling people what they can do to their children's bodies. Granted that implies that children can't \"decide\" to get circumcised at age ten \u2013 but they can when their brains are developed enough.\n\n61\n\ncarlie\n\nit all comes down to the government telling us what we can do with our bodies, and that ain't cool.\n\nBut that's just it \u2013 it's not at all the government telling you what you can do with your body. Your child does not belong to you. It is not part of you. It is its own person with its own body, and this is the government telling you what you can't do to someone else's body.\n\nI can see one instance of ear piercing of babies being an ok idea, and that's in the case of identical multiples. And only because I'd be so scared I'd mix them up. (The first day I dropped my son off at daycare, my biggest, and I know irrational, but biggest fear was that I wouldn't recognize which one was mine when I went to pick him up, since he hadn't been out of my sight until that point and all babies kind of look alike. I actually wrote down what outfit he was wearing and what outfit I had taken for an emergency change just in case.)\n\nKitty \u2013 no. The patient doesn't get to include her child as part of herself once it's born. The doctor-patient relationship doesn't extend to people the \"patient\" wants to do things to. That makes no sense.\n\nBut anti-abortion people are talking about a fetus, not a baby. Once it's born, it is its own person. It's helpless, so it needs care, but it has rights. (Dave will remind us that rights are nonsense on stilts. But it's shorthand for saying the parents can't just do whatever they like to it.)\n\nOphelia, legally, parents are supposed to make medical decisions for their children. The child may be the patient, but it is incapable of understanding and consenting to anything, especially as an infant, and therefore REQUIRES the parent to make those decisions. So, while the parent is most certainly NOT the patient, the parent IS \"the decider\" FOR the patient.\n\n[snark]Or\u2026 you know, we could just let infants and toddlers make their own medical decisions and see how that goes.[/snark]\n\nThe state intervenes (though not always readily enough, at least in the US) when people deny their children medical care for religious reasons. That's to protect the children. Yes it's intrusive, but the alternative is worse.\n\n71\n\nJosh, Official SpokesGay\n\n1. I haven't failed to notice that you're changing your rationale. Don't think anyone's forgotten the monstrous thing you said about boys being circumcised being awesome because it makes for better sexy timez for you. I'm not dropping that or going away.\n\n2. Parents are prevented from \"making medical decisions\" that harm their children for no good reason ALL THE TIME. What is wrong with you?\n\nJosh, Official SpokesGay\n\nFuck you, WMDKitty. You are loathsome, and it's shocking. I can't believe I'm seeing you, a known non-crazy commenter, go on like this. What happened to you? How did you get so downright cruel and lacking empathy on this issue?\n\nMaybe you're just going into defensiveness mode; I hope so. But it's vicious and ugly to shut down your ethical lobe and go on about \"a bit of skin\" just to preserve your ego.\n\ncallistacat\n\n\".\"\n\nJosh, Official SpokesGay\n\nWhy are you pretending not to understand that a patient's proxy is not permitted to order/authorize just any medical procedure with no justification and with a potential for diminished or altered capacity later?\n\ncanadianchick\n\nWMDKitty \u2013 I understand what you're saying because not too long ago I felt the same way, to a degree. I preferred the look of a circumsized penis, and the best lover I've ever had was circ'd. But my uncirc'd DH is pretty damn good too, and I like the look of his penis just fine.\n\nso, I waffled and said stuff about how I didn't need to have an opinion because I'd never have to make that decision, etc.\n\nthen I realized how wrong I was.\n\nIssues of bodily autonomy aside, it is a completely unnecessary procedure, not done for any valid medical purpose, that can and does result in harm to the patient. Not every circ ends up with a bad outcome, but why subject a child to that completely unnecessary risk? I'm not being hysterical or alarmist when I say that boys have lost their entire penis due to surgical error. Boys have wound up with STDs from circ's (very recently a bunch of orthodox jewish babies wound up with HPV from an infected mohel).\n\nthere's no justification for the risk. Especially for the reasons you give.\n\nFWIW I also consider piercing babies' ears to be unnecessary and barbaric. If an older child wants her ears pierced, fine, if he is mature enough to understand that even that comes with potential risks \u2013 you don't even have to meet someone who had their ear torn by a snagged earring as a child to recognize that.\n\nthere are times when circ is medically necessary \u2013 and THAT should be a discussion between the patient (and guardian if necessary) and the physician. But not on a child.\n\nJosh, Official SpokesGay\n\nAt the risk of seeming to rub salt in the wound (which I'm really not trying to do!) my getting angry has nothing to do with whether you or I were right or wrong. People get passionate and angry about things that matter to them. I do, and you do too. There was nothing inappropriate or a-contextual about how angry I got. It was justified.\n\nIt's easy to get pissy and say \"You're being meaaaaan and so I'm gonna disagree,\" but it's cheap and wrong. I've done it; hell, everyone's done it. But it's still wrong.\n\n89\n\nSiverly\n\nThe religious privilege to cut children's genitals is finally being seriously challenged in the courts, and that's progress. Most of us get it.\nWhen it comes to understanding how male circumcision affects male sexual experience- and how it can affect his partner's- it has to be looked at from an understanding of the most up to date anatomical and histological research on the penis. 'A little piece of skin' isn't accurate, either. We know so much more now about how important the male foreskin is to natural sexual functioning. We are learning just how much damage is done with surgical interference and to downplay it flies in the face of evidence. A good place to start:\n\nYOU Tube: 'Anatomy of the Penis: Penile and Foreskin Neurology'\n\nHarming male sexuality in this way too often ends up 'in the laps of women' both figuratively(emotionally) and literally. This most certainly is a women's issue as well as a children's rights issue.\n\nWMDKitty thus aligns herself behind the \"parents' rights\" crowd, the fundie wingnuts who are the reason the U.S. won't ratify the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child because they want the \"right\" to beat their kids senseless as recommended by James Dobson or the Pearls.\n\nWhat, what do you mean, \"But that's harmful\"? They see it as loving discipline and correction!\n\nAlso, fuck you for the use of the word \"hysterics\" in reference to a gay man, and telling him to \"calm the fuck down,\" and accusing him of \"whining.\" Also, the passive-aggressive remark to CanadianChick thanking her for not \"getting angry,\" as if people don't have a right to be angry over violations of bodily integrity.\n\nYou are such a pile of ignorant, selfish fail, it's mind-blowing.\n\nJosh:\n\nI can't believe I'm seeing you, a known non-crazy commenter, go on like this.\n\nI've seen her say profoundly stupid things before. Two examples: Here, she insists that even people living in very rural areas don't need to own guns for hunting, because animal control exists (has she ever lived way out in the boondocks? She sounds like what a country friend of mine calls a \"citiot\"), and because \"you can go to a STORE and BUY your meat.\" And here, she proudly declares herself \"colorblind\" in racial issues.\n\nShe's said other dumb things, but enough of them that no search terms come to mind.\n\nI do enjoy the way you have presented this concern plus it really does supply me some fodder for consideration. Anyway, thank you for this superb piece. Tempe Dentist, Tempe Dental Studio, 4427 South Rural Road Tempe, AZ 85282"}

So, if they take away the woman's autonomy over her body, as the conservatives are trying to do. As well as changing the definition of rape as conservatives are trying to do. Women will be forced out of the workplace in many situations due to safety. Destroy the unions as the conservatives would like and destroy child labor laws as well. You have the replacement worker at a cheaper wage. It also destroys the educational level of those children and allows for easier manipulation by the governmentSlavery was once legal, too.

{"text": "What is the difference between aborting a baby and euthanizing\nit? Nothing except the timing of the killing. In the Netherlands, a\ncountry that never hesitates to unfold the logic of liberalism to\nits farthest points, doctors have devised a program to euthanize\nbabies deemed defective. They euthanized four babies last year,\naccording to press reports earlier in the week. Now they are\ncalling upon the Dutch government to pursue a more ambitious\nprogram that would let doctors euthanize undesirables with \"no free\nwill,\" meaning minors.\n\nC.S. Lewis wrote that evil is done \"in clean, carpeted, warmed\nand well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut\nfingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their\nvoices.\" Lewis could have added that they don't even need to raise\ntheir voices when they go on public radio to explain their evil. On\nWednesday, National Public Radio politely interviewed one of the\nDutch doctors overseeing the euthanasia-for-children program,\nEduard Verhagen, clinical director of the Pediatric Clinic of the\nUniversity Hospital at Groningen. This white-coated doctor with\nneatly trimmed fingernails didn't need to raise his voice when\nasked by NPR quite casually, \"How was it decided that they should\ndie?\" The children had medical conditions like \"spina bifida,\"\nresponded Verhagen. The babies were born \"with incurable\nconditions,\" so \"we felt that in these children the most humane\ncourse of action would be to allow the child to die, and even\nactively assist them in their death.\"\n\nAssist them in their death. Had the toddlers scrawled\nout a consent form? No, they lack \"free will,\" so pediatricians\nmade the decision for them. Asked if what his hospital had done was\nlegal, Verhagen blithely said, \"No, it's not legal,\" but implied\nthe Dutch government would tidy up that decision later. \"It's a\nvery delicate and very important decision that one needs to make,\"\nhe said. \"And if such a decision is made, we prefer to have it\ntested or assessed by a committee of experts, just to make sure\nthat we have taken into account all the requirements and that we\nare really doing something that is correct.\"\n\nWould parents be able to veto the decision on which children get\nto live or die according to the committee? Apparently not. When\nVerhagen was asked, \"Is it just up to the parents?\" he said, \"No.\"\nBut he quickly caught himself and magnanimously allowed that\nparents are \"always very much involved.\" Ultimately, however, who\nlives or dies is the culture's decision, he said. \"Let's see how\nsociety thinks of it,\" he offered. \"What we would like to happen\nhere in Holland is that we put the spotlight on such decisions\nbecause they need to be extremely secure. And instead of taking\nthese decisions in a kind of gray area, we want them to be in the\nspotlight\u2026The culture in Holland is a culture where\neuthanasia for adults has been legalized in 2002 by the\nParliament.\"\n\nVerhagen concluded on the thought that \"the best way to protect\nlife is to sometimes assist a little bit in death.\" This\ncontradicted what he had said earlier when he stressed that \"we are\nactually talking about children that are already in a dying\nprocess.\" No, they were not dying. If they were dying, they would\nhave died without euthanasia. It is precisely because they were not\ndying that the Dutch doctors euthanized them.\n\nEuthanasia isn't letting a patient die but killing a patient who\nisn't dying. It is an act of annoyance at a patient who isn't dying\non the timetable those who want the patient to die would prefer. In\nthe Terri Schiavo case, for example, her impatient husband demanded\nthat she be deprived of food and water because she wasn't dying\nwith sufficient speed. \"Has she died yet?\" a nurse heard him say.\n\"When is that bitch going to die?\" Euthanasia, it was said, would\nallow Schiavo to \"die in peace.\" Die in peace? No, it would\nguarantee that she die violently. Starvation is not a peaceful\nact.\n\nIn clean, well-lighted hospitals, Verhagen and doctors like him\nare committing barbaric acts no different from pagans of old\nleaving inconvenient children on hilltops. Whenever a doctor uses\nthe word \"humane,\" it is clear that he has already performed the\ninhuman"}

{"text": "Family members are sometimes unable to carry out their relative's wish to donate organs when they die, because of conflicting feelings between making a gift of life and protecting the body of the deceased, according toNotice that there is no \"I do not choose to donate body parts\" response?\n\nYeah, I noticed that too. One would presume that a \"no\" is infered, but no telling how a government org will try to interpret it. In the U.S., we've had a checkbox on our licenses for as long as I can remember. I always check and sign mine. Not signing it means \"no\". Sounds to me like they're preparing to implement implied consent with no real opt out. That's just my experience with beurocrats in the U.S. and assuming it applies across the pond too.\n\nAgree Treegeek. The main issue is tissue rejection, but there are also moral issues. The concept of \"brain death\" was largely invented to justify taking organs from people whose hearts are still beating. There have been many people declared \"brain dead\" who woke up and made a full recovery. Remember the guy a couple of years ago who woke up shortly before they were going to \"harvest\" his organs?\n\nPeople seem to be more valuable dead than alive. Now accidents will seem OK because a noble act will happen. He/she had a great heart, liver, kidneys, lungs... but a stupid brain. Youths' deaths will be acceptable because they will spread their organs. The people on the transplant list are eagerly waiting for some deadly events to happen; while themselves do not want to die they wish death for fellow humans so they can harvest their parts.Hmmm\n\nIf they really want to save lives and increase the supply of organs, they should provide organ donors compensation for their organs. There are many ways to do so. They could pay the funeral expenses as one example.\n\nIMHO, those saying you can't sell your organs because it's unethical, are the unethical ones because they are using the force of government to stop what would otherwise be a transaction between consenting parties that would save lives. I believe those who want to decide who gets organs want that power for themselves rather than donors and their families. There was even a case where a friend offered to donate a kidney (he couldn't give it to his friend who needed one due to compatibility) provided his friend got one - yet those controlling who decided, wouldn't allow it. There have also been cases of funeral homes harvesting and selling body parts and tissues without the consent of the families.\n\nSilly question. Of course the government owns EVERYTHING. Those on the left here even argue that government owns the fruits of your labor, 100%, lock, stock and barrel, and it is only out of the goodness of their bureaucratic hearts that they let you keep some. The rest is for redistribution to their friends and approved victim groups who didn't earn it.\n\nWhy should your organs be any different? It was just by an accident of birth that you have them in the first place, anyway, like inherited wealth. The greater good of the Collective must prevail.\n\nAnd once bureaucratic rationing of health care is fully implemented, it will inevitably result in the politically connected and politically correct getting the organs. The rest of you \"small people\" will have just die and bear it.\n\nExcept for women, that is. They get to kill that lump of cancerous tissue or whatever it is for their own convenience"}
{"text": "On this fortieth anniversary of the Supreme Court decision in the abortion case, Roe v. Wade, a NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found 70 percent of U.S. adults support the decision, compared to 58 percent in 1989. That marks an all-time high. 2012 saw a huge number of abortion restrictions passed through state legislatures (though significantly less than 2011). But the feminist movement's main victories last year came on the national stage: not just the defeats of Senate wannabes Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock, but also the election of President Obama himself. Fifty-five percent of women voted for Obama, making him the first president in history unambiguously elected by women when men wanted the other guy. (Bill Clinton won women in 1996, but his loss among men was within the margin of error of exit polls.)\n\nThe surge of support for Roe in the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll reveals that the core groups in the liberal coalition that elected Obama have a surplus to offer others. The pollsters found the new support for abortion rights, long seen as the effete preoccupation of middle class white women, was concentrated among African Americans, Latinos and women without college degrees. These highly religious groups tasted political power as the Obama campaign scrambled for re-election. Now the polls show them supporting a new cause: women's right to abortion. And so a virtuous cycle begins.\n\nSomething similar happened last May, when President Barack Obama spent some of his liberal political capital coming out for same sex marriage. Gloomy pundits predicted that his declaration would cost him dearly among African-Americans, many of whom had religious objections. Just the opposite occurred. After the leader of the liberal coalition extended membership to the LGBT community, ABC/Washington Post polls found the support for same sex marriage among African Americans rose from 40 to 59 percent. Gays and lesbians poured into the Obama campaign, with money, talent and huge appeal to the youth vote. On election day, same-sex marriage won approval in three states including Maryland, where a heavily African-American electorate supported the gay cause.\n\nPresident Obama may not have made as dramatic a gesture on reproductive rights, but his opponents, from Mourdock and Akin to Rush Limbaugh (who called Sandra Fluke a \"slut\"), did much of the work for him. Now the core groups comprising the liberal resurgence are polling robustly in support of abortion rights. The first indication of a new political order has already appeared: the most insulting and extreme attacks are disappearing. There has been less talk lately of vaginal probes, personhood amendments and \"legitimate\" rape. When gay marriage reached this stage, the argument shifted from talk of sin and crimes against nature to mealy-mouthed arguments about how opponents want gays to have everything but the title. When the victim group is no longer treated as a rhetorical free-fire zone, the process of empowerment begins. The shift in power on this issue will take a while to unfold, because of the Republican dominance of local government in normally blue states like Michigan. But, as with same sex marriage, as the population hardens around support for women's abortion rights, the resistance will be concentrated more and more in the red states, mostly of the South and West. (The latest rape confusion, for instance, came from a congressman in Georgia.)\n\nThis is not the time to declare victory, as states continue to pass laws making it harder to \"execute\" as Obama put it in his Inaugural Address, the rights that Roe located, so long ago, in the founding document. Indeed, although there is not a case pending at the moment, the decision itself is widely viewed as hanging by the slender thread of a single vote on the Supreme Court. Even in those remote chambers, however, public sentiment echoes. Although the Court does not follow the election returns, there are rumors that Chief Justice John Roberts cares about the reputation of his institution and its place in history. And even a Supreme Court hell-bent on reversing Roe v. Wade would pause at the polling revealed today.\n\n24 comments\n\nWhat is there about this slight piece that I find so discomfiting?\nI'm pro choice. I dislike and stand against reactionaries who fulminate against the first term right to abort a fetus, or, more refined, the right to abort a fetus before outside the womb viability. I don't like and stand against locating personhood in conception. I'm against and dislike tunnel visioned Republican state legislators who try to chip away at the right to abort by throwing up coercive hurdles chilling its exercise. I wouldn't want SCOTUS overturning Roe or vindicating state based means of intruding on it.\nSo what I don't like is more sub textual: Hirshman's barely suppressed glee at abortion's seeming triumph, the very tone of insensitive triumphalism pervading what Hirshman writes. What all that amounts to is the failure to see any abortion as a tragedy in the sense of a clash between two discrete rights: women's bodily autonomy, where the decision to abort isn't a case of sheer and serious danger to the mother's health, as against the snuffing out of forming life.\nIt amounts to the failure to see Roe and the line of cases it has engendered as a tragic balancing of the-near-impossible-to-reconcile values inhering in that clash, only a few notches better than Solomonic baby splitting wisdom.\nTo my ears and mind Hirshman's tone deafness is ear splitting.\nAnd why do I surmise, though I don't know, that as science stands to contract the right to abortion by expanding viability, Hirshman would want to expand the scope of women's right to choose? If so, hers is an unpalatable manifestation of a certain kind of blinkered feminism.\n\n\"Chief Justice John Roberts cares about the reputation of his institution and its place in history. And even a Supreme Court hell-bent on reversing Roe v. Wade would pause at the polling revealed today.\" I was born, long before Roe v. Wade, when my mother and father were much older than most mothers and fathers. My son was born, three years before Roe v. Wade, when I and his mother were much younger than most mothers and fathers. I don't know if it would have made a difference, for me and my son, if our lives began after Roe v. Wade. I don't really care to know, even if I do support a woman's right to choose. As for C.J. Roberts and his place in history, I don't know which side of history he would choose. I would hope that it wouldn't make any difference for me, or my son.\n\nWhy do I find the above comments discomfiting? Because they're all made by people I assume to be men?\nGuys: abortion isn't a Solomonic tragedy. If you're a woman up a creek, especially if you're the victim of rape and incest but also poverty, abandonment, or dying of a pregnancy, it's a godsend. And, theological judgements to the contrary are yours, period.\nWomen's lives are equal and just as valuable as anybody else's, despite the fact that we were born with ovaries, vaginas and wombs and less physical and economic and politic power than you.\nAnd: our choices are our own, not yours, and judgement isn't yours, it's ours, since we're in the situation, at the moment, and you are not.\n\nSo: I think Roe is popular because Americans are realizing that women are human beings. We have a right to control our own bodies! Our futures belong to us not to you, not to the Church and not to the State.\nAnd, there is perhaps a growing respect for First Amendment rights, which include freedom of religion. This includes my freedom not to have to kowtow to your religion.\nHallelujah.\n\nSophia you last comment is beside any point I can see being pertinent here.\nAnd you may not know this, but when a woman is pregnant she has life inside her. The longer she is pregnant the more formed that forming life becomes. So the issue is balancing not an absolute answer, which is precisely what Roe's trimester analysis does, shifting the balance as pregnancy goes on to give the state's interest in protecting and vindicating that life as it becomes more and more like a whole person.\nWomen's bodily autonomy, a mighty thing, must yield increasingly to that life, which is what Roe says. And as the test shifts from trimesters to viability, that yielding will become earlier as science progresses. So any abortion when life has started to develop is the taking of life and women's problems in that are one side of a shifting equation to be resolved in their favour before viability. Pregnancy isn't nothing.\nAbortion is nothing to celebrate. It's incidence is something to work preventatively against.\nAnd yammering about women's perspectives over men's, and about men having power blah blah blah, and abortion being a blessing is just that--unnuanced, ideological yammering.\n\nOF COURSE my comment about First Amendment is pertinent and it's key to why younger people are supporting Roe, because they don't remember the bad old days.\nIssues of ensoulment and whether an alive thing is a human being or when an acorn becomes an oak are totally religious in nature.\nAnd, women's perspective and a reflection on our relative lack of power isn't just \"yammering,\" you wouldn't say that if you were a woman, so get a grip basman. Please. You sound like a harem owner at the moment. Sorry but you do.\n\nAlso you wouldn't be yammering about yammering if you were dying of a toxic pregnancy, facing a lifetime raising a child you don't want, a victim of rape or incest, or coping with poverty.\nFTS. Damn right perspective is important. And no it IS NOT a Solomonic tragedy for heaven's sake, again with the judgmental nonsense.\nIn fact, if I were a whale or a shark or a bear or a hummingbird or an endangered butterfly I might regard \"human life\" as a total, complete, utter catastrophe.\n\nFreedom of religion is epiphenomenal here. The analysis in Roe is essentially secular. That's why too what you call \"ensoulment\" is beside the point. Of course what's inside a pregnant woman is alive, that's basic biology. People differ about what status to confer on that life, legal status or otherwise.\nI sound like a harem owner?!?! Here you're being incredibly dense.\nRead my first comment. I favour Roe. And if you were actually to read Roe, and not reflexively spout it for things you think it means, you will see that SCOTUS in its reasoning is talking along my lines about balancing competing rights and drawing lines. Women's lack of power is one thing. But on the issue of abortion men and women across a variety of spectra agree and disagree. It's a vexed issue and men and women have equally refined and equally stupid views about it.\nAnd why would you be presuming to lecture me about rape and incest. I support in those instances in particular the greater legal weight to be accorded to the choice side of the equation. But in those instances too, there's innocent life involved, which at a certain point is going to get the legal balance resolved in its favour.\nDo you favour women's absolute right to choose right up till the time of birth? If you do, then line up with the rest of the idiots on abortion. If you don't, ask yourself why and apply your reasoning to your own position and you'll wind up roughly where the court in Roe was, which is about where I am.\nIf you were a shark or a whale or a bear or a hummingbird or an endangered butterfly, you would probably be making more sensible comments here and thanking me for being so nice to you in each incarnation the last time I was at the zoo. Looking on appreciatively and like the sign says not feeding you.\n\nI agree with basman's points in this discussion. Though I also am \"pro-choice,\" I come to that conclusion advisedly and with recognition that the issue requires a balancing of competing interests, both of which are valid and profound. As basman notes, it is a biological fact that a fetus is a living entity that has all of the required genetic material to become a fully developed human being. Whether that living entity has a moral claim to life is a question that we must, perforce, come to grips with. Theology may or may not come to play in answering that question. That also is true of the question whether a new born infant has a moral claim to life. The fact that theology may, for some, play a role in that determination does not mean that we cannot make that determination as a matter of law. The last time I looked, infanticide is considered murder and is criminally sanctionable.\nAnswer this question Sophia: why is infanticide a criminal act? It has nothing to do with ensoulment, does it? Even an atheist would agree that a newly-born infant has a moral claim to life, and that killing a newly-born infant is homicide. Why?\nDhurtado\n\nNR a \"born infant\" does have a claim to life.\nHowever, abortion is not about born infants, it's not even about potential infants, it's about who has the right to decide at what point we can \"speak of a life\" and not merely biological tissue.\nHence your point that \"the issue requires a balancing of competing interests\" is besides the point, since one only balance the interests of competing claims and I don't see that the claim of a so called \"potential life\" is equal to the claims of a real life.\nBesides the interests of the \"potential life\" is always enunciated by those who have other more pressing interests and they are not those of the woman. These same interests would stop women from having access to pills that would stop pregnancies in the first place. Their interests are social, they wish to control human behavior, and are not merely about protecting \"the born infant.\"\n\nBut WHY does a born infant have a moral claim to life, arnon? Please answer that question, and then explain why the same rationale does not apply to a third trimester fetus, or a second trimester fetus or a first trimester fetus.\nDhurtado\n\nI don't know your point of view, but form a moral point of view you may be right that a potential being has the same rights as an actual being. You can also argue that only what is actual what can live outside the womb is a person. People with divergent moralities will never agree on that.\nHowever, from a purely logical and metaphysical point of view the fetus is a potential and not an actual being while the just born infant is an actual being and hence a claim on us.\nTo kill a born baby is as wrong as to kill an old man.\nNow getting back to the abortion issue: if one claims that potential life has as much a claim on us as an actual being then logically (and for the sake of consistency) one would have to claim that not only the first trimester fetus has a claim to life but that potentially the sperm as it enters the woman's body is already a potential form of life as is the released egg cell in the woman.\nThis is why the Catholic Church is as opposed to birth control pills as they are to abortion. It's a moral position which if you decline to make the distinction between the potential and the actual is logical.\nI don't know enough about Catholic theology to know for certain but I doubt that Catholic theology wouldn't distinguish between potential and actual in all ontological matters.\nIn any case, I believe in limited abortion (which is the law) in part, because it keeps from sliding back into a kind of Talibanization of logic. I hope I have answered your question, Dhurtado.\n\nI'm not sure that you have answered my question, arnon. The question is why does a born infant (or an old man, for that matter) have a moral claim to life such that killing it constitutes murder? I take your answer to be that a born infant is an \"actual being.\" With all respect, that's not a very satisfying answer. After all, apes, dogs, and even earthworms are actual beings aren't they? But I take it that by \"actual being\" you are endeavoring to distinguish a born infant from a fetus (or unborn infant) by contending that a fetus is only a \"potential\" being. You say that \"from a purely logical and metaphysical point of view the fetus is a potential and not an actual being while the just born infant is an actual being and hence a claim on us.\" I find that to be completely question-begging. I might be able to agree that a newly fertilized egg is merely a \"potential\" being, but by what logic or metaphysical analysis is a six-month old fetus, for example, which has a beating heart, brain activity, and sensory capabilities, merely a \"potential\" being rather than an \"actual\" being? To be sure, it is difficult to isolate the point at which a developing fetus becomes an actual being, or becomes a being with a moral claim to life, but to identify that point as birth is no less arbitrary than identifying that point as the beginning of the third trimester, the beginning of the first trimester, or viability. It is no less self-serving for the pro-choice faction than identifying that point as conception is for the pro-life faction.\nAnd even if a developing fetus does not have a moral claim to life equal to that of a born infant, it clearly has SOME moral claim to life, doesn't it? That moral claim needs to be balanced against the legitimate interest of a woman in not carrying a pregnancy to term. As basman has noted, the very premise of Roe was that there are profound, competing interests that need to be balanced, and that there is a point at which the state has an interest in protecting fetal life that trumps the woman's interest in bodily or reproductive autonomy. People can reasonably disagree about where the line should be drawn. Although, as I said, I am pro-choice, it has always frustrated me that pro-choice activists have refused to recognize that the issue does present a legitimate moral dilemma, a dilemma that should, in my opinion, usually be resolved in favor of the interest of the woman, but a dilemma nonetheless.\nDhurtado\n\n\"After all, apes, dogs, and even earthworms are actual beings aren't they?\"\nYes, and in many cultures animals are sacred.\nWell, NR, i did answer your question. I made a distinction between morality and logic and within logic between actual and potential.\nIf you can't understand my answer, well..... the best to you.\n\nBut YOU don't believe animals are sacred, do you? You don't believe killing animals is murder, do you? So the fact that a born infant is an \"actual being\" can't be your real answer for why you believe infanticide is murder. Therefore, your distinction between actual and potential does not answer the question. Even if the actual/potential disntinction were morally and logically relevantl, you don't explain why a 6-month old fetus is only a potential being, while an earthworm is an actual being. Indeed, you don't answer my last post at all, other than to say that that in some places animals are sacred. Are really going to adhere to the position that at least a fairly developed fetus has NO rights that need to be balanced against the pregnant woman's rights?\nDhurtado\n\n...However, abortion is not about born infants, it's not even about potential infants, it's about who has the right to decide at what point we can \"speak of a life\" and not merely biological tissue...\nThis isn't precise or sufficiently complete.\nThe issue isn't when \"we can we speak of a life.\" The issue is, or at least includes, at what point and why and in what circumstances does the autonomy we rightfully accord to women over their bodies as a legal matter weigh less in the balancing than the state's interest in protecting the forming life inside their bodies, and when and why and under what circumstances does that latter interest give way, even in the case of late term pregnancies, to the life and well being of the mother?\n\nP.S. And the issue isn't I don't think over \"who has the right to decide...\"\nThere may be an interesting debate about that whether the \"who\" \"ought\" to be the court or the legislature. But it's quite settled now that the \"who\" is both as they long as they confine themselves to their proper jurisdictional domains.\nQuite the same issue in Canada with respect to \"who ought\" even though we are a parliamentary system combined with an entrenched Charter of Rights.\nMy country's experience is that abortion was against the Criminal Code. In Canada, crime is a federal matter, beyond the scope of the provinces. The SCC, after our Dr. Henry Morganthaler kept getting acquitted for running abortion clinics throughout the country, (an affirmation of the jury as community writ small), then ruled the Criminal Code provisions violative of the Charter--I can't remember the precise technical legal reasoning.\nSince then, about 30-40 years ago, the federal government under different political stripes, liberal and conservative, in Canadian parlance, never sought to legislatively fill in the void. And now there is no prohibition.\nI once tried to check out whether there was any prohibition against late term abortions anywhere and found none but was advised by one clinic I spoke to that they are extremely rare as a matter of medical convention.\nEvery once in a while a private members' bill get introduced but gets no traction. It's my country's tradition to allow Members of Parliament a free vote, unwhipped that is to say, on the issue.\n\n\"This isn't precise or sufficiently complete.\"\nAbortion was and is above all a political debate between one side (and this isn't limited to \"the State,\") which believes that for moral (usually religious) reasons it has the right to decide whether or not to make abortion a criminal matter and another side which believes that it's up to the impregnated woman to decide the matter.\nQuestions of viability which are scientific (biological ) issues cant in itself decide the debate. Nor can questions of ontological logic. These notions are being used by both sides to pursue arguments that all too often are grounded in moral beliefs.\nThe State has been the arbiter in this debate by legalizing one or the other side of the issue. Prior to Roe the State had made abortion illegal in most instances. With Roe the State introduces standards under which abortion would be legal. Its first standard I believe was viability.\nThis standard has since shifted to \"trimesters.\" It will shift again as the political debate continues. The State can decide what is legal (under the constitution and what is not) however the State can't decide what is (from a biological point of view) a life. This primary issue will be decided through philosophical and moral debate by hopefully rational discussants.\nThe rest is commentary.\n\n@ Arnon,\nWe may be speaking past each other, but it's too binary and it's unnecessary, respectfully, to say it's one kind of question or the other. It's all kinds of questions and as between the legal and the political among other categories of question, the legal has been holding its own. There is of course a strong religious dimension to the pro life side, but my view is that at the high levels of legislative action and at that level of public debate and even more so and certainly in judicial instances of dealing with abortion the only legitimate public arguments are secular.\nI don't think there's any suggestion that viability can decide the debate. Science will determine viability, but American courts as I understand the post Roe case law, have gotten away from the trimester analysis and are moving to keying on viability, the reverse of the trend you note, as the test under which state interest starts to get taken into account. If someone more knowledgeable in the post Roe case law can clarify that I'd be obliged.\nNor of course will judicial decisions \"decide the debate.\" They will rather decide the issues as a matter of law, an ongoing dynamic process. As to what all the \"rest\" is, and what is and isn't \"commentary, I couldn't and don't feel the need, to say."}
{"text": "Thursday, September 25, 2008\n\nSo wait... my rights are dessert?\n\nI wonder if this conceited little fuck Googles himself when no one is looking. If he does, I certainly hope that this blog comes up, cause I've got a lot to say to Benjamin Ledford of the Idaho Argonaut who wrote this trivial little piece about why the rights of \"humanity in general\" are more important than the rights of a full half of the human species.\n\nAfter comparing women's rights to dessert, and proving once again that conservative and conservative leaning men are horrible with analogies (sorry, sexism sucks doesn't it guys?), Ledford goes on to say,\n\n\"Of course, I will say it is better to have women's rights than not to have women's rights, but the only way to put women's rights first is if we are willing to say \u2014 which I am not \u2014 that women are better and more important than humanity as a whole.\"\n\nHm... wait, don't women make up 51% of the species homo sapien?\n\nOur irrelevant little idiot goes on to say\n\n\"If we agree human rights are actually better, then what does it mean for how we think about current issues? Well, there is one major implication which comes to mind immediately: abortion.\"\n\nOkay. I'll bite, why is that?\n\n\"Whether we want to call them people or not, embryos are human, and they are a separate organism from their mother, not a part of her body. From its conception, an embryo is alive, has a different DNA structure than its mother and is of the species Homo sapiens.\"\n\nAlright Ben, I've got a quick little quiz for you.\n\n1. True or False: the meaning of separate in this instance is, as used in the adjective, \"unconnected; distinct; unique: two separate questions. \" 2. True or False: the process of pregnancy fits the dictionary definition, as above, for incubator and incubatee being \"separate\". 3. True or False: prior to the third trimester, a fetus can survive outside the womb. 4. True or False: women aren't part of humanity and therefore don't deserve as many rights as men, who are part of humanity.\n\nYou have the audacity to talk about human rights and then start off on a Logical Fallacy of the Year award winning diatribe about how women don't deserve their rights because they... what? aren't human? Please. Human rights include life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness and legally only apply to humans that are breathing. Do dead people have rights? No, they don't. Rights cease after the heart stops and respiration comes to an end, and the rights of the corpse are conferred upon the executor of their estate who provides for whatever care needs to be taken. The corpse is thereafter treated as property, which itself does not have rights.\n\nFetuses don't breath either. They just don't. Ergo, they do not have rights, and the rights they would have are conferred upon their incubator, whose own rights supersede the rights of the not-yet-born-human.\n\nAnd for fuck's sake, the skin that just flaked off of my ass while I was untwisting my panties after your retarded argument (no offense to the mentally impaired), that skin can also be classified as biologically human. Does that mean that I am violating the rights of my Skin by scratching myself? Hey, you wanted fallible arguments -- as a student of Logic and Reason, I've got a million arguments that can be tailored to match your \"women's rights are equitable to dessert: great, but totally not necessary and it makes you fat\" argument; the difference being that I make stupid, fallible arguments on purpose to weed out the hoi moroi like yourself, Ben.\n\nBack to the question at hand: are human rights more important than women's rights? Gee, well, in order to answer that question, which Ben mind-bogglingly answers in the affirmative, you have to make an extremely illogical leap in reality and decree that the rights of humans and the rights of women are mutually exclusive because women aren't, in fact, human. Which brings out one more little detail in the \"fetuses are human\" argument: what about girl fetuses?\n\nSince we're discussing the pre-born, and it's a well known fact of biology that during development those with XX and XY pairings being their development the same: as gendered females. Later on during the development of the endocrine system, the ovaries drop to become testicles and the vagina folds itself inside-out to become a penis, but only when there is an influx of testosterone as determined by the programming set in motion by the determination of XX or XY.\n\nErgo, since women aren't humans, that means that fetuses aren't humans until after their endocrine system has decided that they are male. Right? That is what you mean right? Cause that's what you fucking wrote.\n\nSo, since women aren't human, and fetuses aren't human until about the middle of the second trimester when gender begins to appear, abortion prior to this time is not a violation of human rights. This deduction is made using your \"logic\", Ben. Generally accepted logic proves that womne are, in fact, human, and that her rights as a sentient, autonomous being trump those of the not-yet-born, not-yet-sentient, not-yet-autonomous being within her womb. Of course, sentience is no measure of rights, but being born and becoming able to survive outside the womb is a measure of rights.\n\nInfants have rights, I agree. But it's not an infant, not a child, and does not have rights until after it has passed through the birth canal (or been otherwise extracted from the uterus) and takes a breath. Still born infants, as sad as they are, do not have rights, and no court in this country, nay the world, would confer rights upon it.\n\nYou want to talk about human rights? Let's talk about them, but make sure you're talking about the rights of those who are capable of having rights conferred upon them. There's on criteria for being able to have basic human rights: respiration.\n\nFinally, in the words of the Immortal George Carlin\n\n\"If you think that fetuses are more important than women, you try to get a fetus to scrub the shit stains out of your underwear.\"\n\nSo I read the article he wrote, googled him to find out who the fuck this guy is (I'm a student at University of Idaho as well), and I came across your post on it. I just want to say, bravo. I'm a senior philosophy major, and his misuse of 'logic' on this and many other issues is beyond acceptable. Thank you for putting in your, and many other people's, opinion!"}

I believe that it is because you don't actually care at all. You fight against pro-choice people because seeing that the option of abortion is there makes you feel uneasy.

Here's my reply:\n\nAre you serious right now? Let me sit down and tell you a damn story. I lived in a damn food desert for most of my life. For a good two years me and my mother were homeless. We got our food from soup kitchens, churches, and school lunches. When we finally did get an apartment in the hood, the closest \"grocery store\" was the convenience store down the street. All they had on their shelves was processed foods, cereal, milk and bread. If we did want to go to a \"real\" grocery store, that meant we had to get up early in the morning, hop our asses on a bus, buy enough food to last but not so much that we couldn't carry it all, carry our food from the grocery store to the bus stop, squeeze our way on the bus (if there wasn't a seat that meant standing in the middle of the damn aisle with groceries in your hand for the whole ride back home), and then carry the groceries from the bus stop back to the house. Needless to say it was an exhausting trip that we didn't wanna make often.\n\nWe also had to contend with the fact that grocery stores in the hood don't carry quality fruits and produce and the shit they had was massively overpriced. We also worked so hard (yes, \"we\", I got my first job at 13 and never stopped working) that by the time we got home we were way too damn tired to even think about making a home cooked meal every damn night. Even when my mother got a damn car so we could go to the better stores, the prices only got higher and then we had to worry about keeping the car up and paying for gas which meant we needed more money and therefore had to work even fucking harder.\n\nIf you managed to stay vegan while taking your ass across the country, good for you. Go get yourself a fucking cookie. For the rest of us though, that shit don't work. We got way more important shit to worry about than making PETA or some random ass vegan motherfuckers mad. It's a hell of a lot more cost effective for people like us to buy some meat and processed foods (and to be honest, that's all that a lot of us have available) rather than pick around for some vegan shit to make some other motherfuckers happy. If you're not willing to address the inherent classism and racism in the whole vegan \"movement\" I'm gonna need you to sit your ass all the way fucking down and take your bullshit somewhere else. I ain't here for that shit."}
{"text": "Harbored within this image is a stirring elegy to despair of the human condition. The voluptuous form of the buttocks is rendered with naive, jejune lines, and drips with Freudian connotation. This symbolic rendering of the young anal-fixative mind serves as an eloquent metaphor for life in the modern age. The viewer is confronted with a disturbing representation of childlike innocence focused on intensely sexual emotions, paralleling our times' mix of rampant industrialism and undeveloped social impulse. Yet there is still a strong sense of hope about this striking image, particularly in regards to the upwardly inclined cheeks which seem almost to stare longingly into the aether. Heroic, Randian, this youthful \u00dcbermensch seeks transcendence through self-empowerment. Yet the future of the Modern Man is still uncertain, a fact which is highlighted by the innovative composition.

Condoms are the only current, preventative form of contraceptive that only lasts for one fuck. All the shit the girls have is generally time-based, meaning that no matter how many times she gets laid, she's paying the same amount. Also, don't forget that many times, birth control is used to straighten out hormonal imbalances in women, whether or not they're actually having sex. That's right, folks\u2014I know LOTS of girls who are virgins that are on birth control to stabilize their shit. STFU, you know shit about the situation.\n\nLiberals: The government has no right to force anyone to do anything against its religion. The United States made that clear with the \"Establishment\" and \"Free Exercise\" clauses of the First Amendment. Nobody is going to remake their religion in your image. Come to terms with this now, and save yourself a lot of fucking trouble. If you want a birth control script filled, don't go to a Catholic pharmacy. If you want your employer to pay for your birth control, make sure you don't work for a religious organization that doesn't support birth control. If you're gay, and you want to be married, don't demand that a minister who doesn't believe that's right marry you when there are many other ministers that feel it's your right to be wed. Go hire one of them, instead. STFU, you're being dumbasses.\n\nWow, so you don't even understand what the issue is, do you? I'm going to have to break this one down.\n\n\"If you're gay, and you want to be married, don't demand that a minister who doesn't believe that's right marry you when there are many other ministers that feel it's your right to be wed. Go hire one of them, instead\"\n\nPlease, please show me when at any time during this debate about church v. state has anyone demanded that Catholic priests marry gay people. Show me. Oh wait you can't show me because THAT'S NOT WHAT LIBERALS WANTS. Why would gay people want to be married in a church that says their existence is an abomination to God? Nobody, anywhere, ever, is demanding that churches marry gay people against the minister's will. Moving on.\n\n\"Nobody is going to remake their religion in your image.\"\n\nAnother straw man \u2014 nobody wants this.\n\n\"If you want a birth control script filled, don't go to a Catholic pharmacy.\"\n\nRight now, the law allows a \"conscience clause\" that says ANY pharmacist at ANY pharmacy can refuse to fill a birth control prescription if the medication conflicts with their morals. It's not only happening in pharmacies inside of Catholic hospitals (because BTW \"Catholic pharmacy\" is not a real thing, unless the church has expanded their rectory quite a bit since my last visit). If you need birth control, and there's only one pharmacy within a reasonable distance of where you live, you can have the prescription refused because the pharmacist says his (or her, but usually his) religion conflicts with it. You don't even understand the laws, why are you trying to defend them?\n\n\"If you want your employer to pay for your birth control, make sure you don't work for a religious organization that doesn't support birth control.\"\n\nAgain, you have NO. IDEA. what you are talking about. Nobody wants their employer to pay for their birth control. What we want is for our insurance companies - the ones we pay a monthly premium to, just like you men - to cover all of our medication, including birth control. Currently, religious leaders and Republicans are trying to make it so that any employer, even ones who aren't religiously affiliated, can refuse to have their private insurance company cover birth control on the basis of their personal morals. In other words, the CEO of your investment banking company can decide his religion doesn't condone birth control, so he can tell YOUR insurer to stop covering it. Again: you just have no idea what you're talking about.\n\nFurthermore, remember the whole economy no-jobs-thing? It's difficult for someone who can't afford birth control to say, \"You won't pay for my medication? I QUIT!\" and pluck another job from the job tree. You're being ignorant of other people's situations, which isn't surprising given your complete ignorance of what liberals actually want.\n\nSo STFU and sit down until you know what the hell you're talking about. Please refrain from giving advice to an entire political group before knowing what they are even talking about.\n\n-Jess\n\nI know exactly what I'm talking about: everybody wants to point fingers and demonize their political opposites instead of shutting the fuck up long enough to make this world livable.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\nSo like\n\nThe fact that you don't even have a basic understand of the laws you're trying to defend qualifies as \"knowing exactly what you're talking about\"\n\nand also\n\nif we all shut up and stop talking about problems like, say, a political party dedicated to taking away medication coverage, the world will be more livable?\n\nBecause political and ideological problems are generally solved by SILENCE."}

CT also examined how religious freedom has become the new battleground for personhood debates.\n\nComments\n\nWhether its by pill or the hand of an abortionist, the aborted child is just as dead. When I took my first formal course in high school Biology in about 1960, everyone seemed to know that human life begins at conception, the union of a man's sperm with a woman's egg. Without uniting in the womb, the egg and sperm have no human life at all and do not develop into anything; they remain just an egg and a sperm and soon die. The part of the human \"life cycle\" that we universally agree includes all of the developmental stages of human life from babies to teens to adults actually begins with conception in the mother's womb. Those are the basic, biological facts of human reproduction. So, from a biological perspective, human life begins at conception and proceeds on an uninterrupted continuum of developmental stages, first in the womb, and then outside of the womb. There is no identifiable point in this continuum at which an unborn child becomes suddenly human; the unborn child is a human being all along. The idea that there is a moment when a developing child changes suddenly from non-human to human is a fantasy that has no basis whatsoever in the science of biology. Rather, it is purely a figment of the human imagination, designed to rationalize the termination of innocent human life in the womb and, thus, avoid the enormous emotional toll that routinely follows in the aftermath of an abortion. Ultrasound images or videos \u2014 especially the new 3-D versions \u2013 of a developing child in his/her mother's womb will provide conclusive and convincing evidence that the unborn child is, indeed, a human being in the early stages of development.\n\nIn response to James Aist, \"There is no identifiable point in this continuum at which an unborn child becomes suddenly human\". Seems to me birth is a pretty \"identifiable point\". Conception is not an \"identifiable point\". Further, scriptures give ample clues to the fact that the spirit ('ruach' in Hebrew OT and 'pneuma' in Greek NT) is a live-giving force; its very much associated with breath (and wind - moving air) in both cases. This is what happens at birth. Note that I'm not arguing in favor of abortion - I'm against it. Its sin. But maybe a more reasonable view is that at 8 months a fetus is 8/9 of a human; at 7 months 7/9 of a human ... at 1 month 1/9 of a human. Why not look at the \"continuum\" that way? So at 8 months, very bad to abort; at 7 months a bit less bad. I don't know if IUDs are still used (intra-uterine devices which keep a fertilized egg from implanting in the womb), but I just can't see that their use is equivalent to murder of a breathing human being. There are degrees of sin.\n\nIn response to Dave Ibach, let's accept your \"more reasonable view\", but this time apply it to the end of life rather than its beginning. If a fetus can be 1/9 of a human, why can't an elderly person be 1/9 less of a human because, and you can fill in the blank, that persons can no longer walk on their own, feed themselves, have impaired vision or hearing etc?\n\nIn other words, if the unborn can be considered less than human because they are \"breathing human beings\", why accept born \"Breathing human beings\" as human if they are not yet mentally or physically well, or if they are regarded as \"burdens\" to society? Why spend money on time on the severely mentally ill when we can simply take the \"reasonable view\" of the \"continuum\" and see them as less human and therefore less worthy of life?\n\nIn the same way that a female cannot be a little pregnant, a living entity must either be human or not human. One certainly cannot be \"less than human\" in any biological sense.\n\nIf you use scripture as a test, I think you look to Mary's visit to Elizabeth when both were pregnant. The child in Elizabeth (John the Baptist) leapt for joy when the child in Mary entered the house. At that time, Elizabeth did not know Mary was newly pregnant, yet scripture speaks of both John and Jesus as children, not partial people.\n\nFrom a biological standpoint, our DNA is our fingerprint - when egg and sperm unite, that unique fingerprint is formed and does not change, regardless of our age.\n\nWell, Steve, by my \"more reasonable\" view, it is precisely because an older person is breathing that they are 100 percent human. The devaluation begins after that. I don't mean to be crass, but the respect for the person immediately begins to diminish after they stop breathing. As time goes on, and memory fades, their importance and esteem as a living human returns eventually to zero."}

But then there's a fine line of \"ok where do we stop.

The only question is whether or not it actually has medicinal value. Yes its disgusting but it doesnt make it immoral, and if its not immoral then there is no reason to object to it. Your bodys going to decay away and become dust either way, if you could make your body of some use to other people after your death then isnt it worth it. There are thousands of people dying because they need organ transplants. If everyone carried a doner card then think how many lives would be saved, the only reason they dont is because people have stupid selfish ideas about wanting to keep their eyes and heart ect even though they are dead or the families want to keep the dead body of their loved ones preserved for selfish reasons acheiving nothing for anyone, whereas if they allowed them to be used as doners so many lives could be spared. Yes the stamina pills are not as important as someone who needs an organ, but the same basic point is there, there is someone who is suffering with a problem, and there is a solution to that problem that doesnt harm anyone, and the only reason people are against it is because of their own personal beleifs about whats disgusting and whats natural, It is not immoral in anyway, and so by telling someone that they should not be allowed the cure because you dont like the idea of ingesting a pill just because it uses the leftovers of someones body just makes you an immoral arogant person, or atleast just that you need to think more clearly about this before you make a rash judgement. Of course i doubt that the pills actually do anything medically benefitial, but the same arguements are used against stem cell research and organ donations so it is still important for people to understand both sides of the arguement on issues like this.\n\nBrah\n\n+1\u2032d for amazing name\n\nCarolepaul2005\n\nIf they were aborted, they did not die naturally!

{"text": "Should I have a baby?\n\nYou've taken a pregnancy test and it's positive. So many questions are buzzing through your head: am I ready to be a mother? How will I cope? Where will we live? Can I afford it? What about my studies? Deciding whether or not to keep a baby is a big decision, but the important thing to remember is this is YOUR decision and no one else's. Here at TheSite.org we can't make this choice for you - but we can help you analyse your feelings. Here's what you should consider asking yourself if you're trying to decide whether to keep the baby.\n\nHow did you feel when you first found out you were pregnant?\n\nWhat was your initial reaction? Was it horror? Happiness? Confusion? It's worth coming back to this initial response when you're making your decision as it's easy to override your instinct with logic. So if your first thought was \"I'm really pleased\", but now you've got bogged down with thinking about the practicalities, remind yourself you were initially happy. Yes, the practicalities of having a child needs huge consideration, but factor in your feelings too.\n\nThere are many different opinions and beliefs about abortion. We asked you what you thought.\n\nHow do you feel about being pregnant?\n\nIt's hardly a secret that pregnancy can be a challenge. What with morning sickness, odd cravings, and your body changing dramatically. Then, of course, there's the birth itself which - well, let's be honest - will be one heck of an experience. How does thinking about this make you feel? Do you feel ready to go through such a life-changing process? Also, remember that all of this is the relatively easy part compared to the challenge of bringing up a child. Of course, it's natural for woman of any age to be nervous of the whole pregnancy/birth thing - but it's more about whether you feel ready to take it on.\n\nHow do you feel about your relationship?\n\nWe're assuming your pregnancy wasn't an immaculate conception, so it's worth examining your relationship with the father and the impact of adding a child to the equation. Is your relationship stable? Do you want to have a child with this man? Can you imagine them being a good parent? If not, how do you feel about doing all this by yourself? How do you feel about not having a father for your child? Identifying your reaction to these questions could help you make a decision.\n\nThe practicalities of having a child\n\nSo you've looked at how you feel. Now it might be worth looking at the actual practicalities of having a child and deciding whether it's something you could do. Here are some things to consider:\n\nMoney\n\nBabies aren't cheap. You'll be financially responsible for their food, clothes, nappies, and providing a warm roof over their head. If you want to continue working or want to study, can you afford childcare?\n\nYour future\n\nStill in education? Or only just got into the world of work? How will having a child affect this? How will you finish your A-levels/degree? Does your company offer good maternity leave?\n\nLong-term\n\nThe baby phase is relatively short-lived. Consider not only if you want to take on an infant, but a toddler, a child - even a moody teenager. Because the baby will be all those things in time.\n\nFreedom\n\nIt's the little things that people don't realise they'll miss after having a child. Just a simple thing like going to the cinema isn't doable with a child. You have to get a baby-sitter. Want a night out? You'll need a baby-sitter. Even if you get a sitter - your baby won't stop crying the next day just because you have a hangover.\n\nHard bloody work\n\nChild-rearing is a full-time, 24-hour-job that goes on for 18 years. Think about how you'll cope with sleepless nights, round-the-clock feeding and nappy changing, moving onto school runs, and chauffeuring them to ballet/football lessons.\n\nOf course, this isn't to suggest having a baby would be an awful experience. It's likely to be quite the opposite and the most rewarding thing you've ever done. But it's important to consider the realities and how you feel you'll manage.\n\nTalk to someone\n\nDon't feel you have to go through this by yourself. Yes, the decision is ultimately yours, but talk through your emotions with a trusted friend or relative. If you don't feel you have anyone to turn to, then speak to your GP, or ring you local sex clinic, Brook, FPA, or Marie Stopes.\n\nBe aware of organisations that claim to advertise 'impartial' pregnancy or abortion advice, as they're sometimes strongly anti-abortion. They may pressure you into keeping your baby even if it's not the best decision for you. Make sure you're seeking help from a trusted source. The Next Steps part of this article is a good place to start.\n\nTaking your time\n\nThis is a big decision and it's certainly not one to rush. Yet it's worth knowing that if you're considering an abortion, the procedure is easier the earlier you have it. Ideally, you would want to have an abortion in the first nine weeks. Also, if you're considering having the baby you ideally need to tell your GP ASAP so they can organise your antenatal care.\n\nStill confused? This online test by Marie Stopes may help you examine your feelings further"}

{"text": "So do you DEFEND Roe v. Wade?? What is your position on it? I see Roe v. Wade precisely as an egregious violation of the Tenth Amendment, the federal government (i.e., the SCOTUS) overstepping its bounds by taking away the states' right to have laws against abortion. How can you not be in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade?\n\n19 posted on 05/26/2012 9:11:04 AM PDT by Charles Henrickson\n(Constitutional and social conservative Republican who wants to win)\n\nThe Tenth Amendment speaks only of legitimate powers, of the general government, the states, and the people.\n\nBut our free republic is premised upon the self-evident truth that all men are created equal, endowed BY THEIR CREATOR with certain unalienable rights, starting with the right to life. Notice that those rights are not granted by men, period. Not by our national government. Not by the states. Not by the people themselves.\n\nNot only do the states have no legitimate power to alienate God-given, unalienable rights, they have a sworn obligation to protect them. It's not optional. It is imperative. This is the primary reason these governments, these offices, all of them, existI find it amazing that one has to contend on FreeRepublic.com for the ABCs of American self-government."}
{"text": "Chinese Dragon, thank you for explaining yourself (quite eloquently, more so than the average 35-year old) and your situation. I grew up Catholic, too, although my household was pro-choice, so I just had conflicting things stirring within me when I was 15. I remember having someone come to our CCD (aka, Sunday School, not on Sunday) and show us the horrors of abortion, and feeling very conflicted.\n\nFor the record, I think you have EVERY RIGHT to believe what you believe. It's a totally viable viewpoint. Like came up earlier, for instance, killing animals for food. I see why that bothers others, but it doesn't bother me. I have a line drawn where others don't, and it's as solid an opinion as mine is. We all get heated up about abortion because it is, well, sensitive, and many people have personal experience with it, and others don't, but have a strong moral idea about it. Like, I don't believe in the death penalty morally, but if someone killed my child, would I want them dead? Hmmm... Don't know.\n\nNot to say the situations are the same, but I think abortion is an argument that goes around in circles because each side is arguing a different issue, and yet everyone is intending the best for society (well, usually, but in this thread, yes). I live in the San Francisco area, and grew up in the Boston area, so also, my environment was totally different than others. Anecdote: my ex-boyfriend from Oklahoma came to college in Boston and would wear a Pro-Life tee shirt in public, and he didn't understand when I told him he might get beaten up, because in his environment, it was totally cool, like saying, \"Go Green!\" or whatever, but it Boston, it was a RED FLAG.\n\nAnyway, I don't discredit you for being 15; I credit you and respect you for your intelligence and your eloquence and your integrity. Keep it up."}

I am pro-life, as I would never want to kill my own child. With that said, my position on abortion has no effect on who I am voting for. Pro-life candidates do not make much of a difference anyhow. I would rather judge the candidates based on their other positions and history."}

{"text": "Women's health centers are reporting that Texas women are crossing the border to Mexico in search of misoprostol, a drug used primarily to treat ulcers. Misoprostol requires a prescription in the United States, but it can be purchased over-the-counter in Mexico.

They've taken the pills, but they're still seeing symptoms of pregnancy.\" Though taking the drug while pregnant won't terminate a pregnancy, it is not without consequences - especially when women are given varying recommendations regarding dosage\n\nThis is fucking vile.

{"text": "Long-established Constitutional law entitles each individual to human rights and the equal protection of the law. Ratified on July 9, 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment states: \". . . nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" Currently, however, the law protects an individual only after \"viability\": the point at which that individual, as a fetus, could survive outside the womb. In the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, the Supreme Court declared: \"1\n\nWhen Does Life Begin?\n\nSince 1973, much effort has been expended to determine when life begins and personhood is gained. But a person's opinion about when life begins can vary based on his cultural heritage, religious background, and scientific understanding (see Table 1).2 Religious definitions of when life begins vary from conception to specific gestational milestones to birth, but usually depend on when the soul or spirit enters the new being.3 Philosophical and socio-cultural views of when life begins vary considerably.4\n\nScientific views of life's beginnings also spread across the spectrum of time from conception to after birth.5 Except for the ones that designate conception as the beginning of life, these designations involve \"phenotypes\"\u2014 characteristics that arise from the expression of the organism's DNA, and from the interaction of its DNA with its environment.6\n\nA major difficulty in determining when life begins is the problem of what life is in the first place. It may be easy to identify life when we see it, but establishing a simple, concise definition is not easy.7 While some in the U.S. Congress and in South Dakota claim that life begins at conception, this is not clear. At conception, a sperm's single-stranded DNA and an ovum's single-stranded DNA unite within a single cell, creating a new and unique human.8 But whether this constitutes life is questionable, since life may be defined as, for example, \"the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic objects and dead organisms, being manifested by growth through metabolism, reproduction, and the power of adaptation to environment through changes originating internally\"9\u2014and whether these conditions exist at conception is debatable, since 1) it will be many months before the new human is able to adapt to the environment outside the womb, and 2) it will be years before the new human can reproduce.\n\nAs for the religious definition of life, it's difficult to prove: How, after all, does one measure whether the soul has united with the body? Amidst the many definitions of life, the assignment of one point at which a developing but unborn human becomes alive or gains life\u2014and thus deserves legal protections\u2014 is difficult at best.\n\nHuman at Conception\n\nBut in the context of legal rights and protections for the unborn, the question of when life begins may be irrelevant: While the two issues are usually discussed interchangeably, the point when life begins and the event whereby personhood is obtained are not necessarily the same. Consider that the law recognizes that a dead body cannot be desecrated (this is a third-degree felony in Utah10). Furthermore, the legal tradition of using wills and trusts that are established prior to death, or probate court afterwards, to provide due process in the disposal of a decedent's property also recognizes that rights exist after death. Thus some rights to liberty and property remain, and due process is provided, even if a person does not have life. Further, as noted in the Roe v. Wade decision, the unborn have been recognized in some situations to have rights and to be entitled to protections of the law (although the Court claimed that \"the unborn have never been recognized in the law as persons in the whole sense\"11\u2014which is reminiscent of the assertion that a slave is to be counted as only three-fifths of a person).\n\nBecause the Fourteenth Amendment addresses personhood and does not address whether or not a person has life, the most pertinent issue for the entitlement to rights and protections under the law is whether the unborn offspring of human parents is a person or not. If it is determined that personhood is gained prior to \"viability,\" the Court has declared that the right to life would be effective and Roe v. Wade would be reversed: \"The appellee and certain amici.\"12 (Note that the Court did not require life to have begun for the collapse of Roe's case, only the establishment of personhood).\n\nIn the past, membership in the human race was determined by the presence of characteristics, such as brain size and ability to use complex language,13 that take years after birth to become fully manifest. But owing to advances in human understanding, beginning with the description of the DNA molecule 14 and continuing with the many recent (largely post-Roe) developments in molecular genetics, it is now possible not only to clearly define the one event at which a new person comes into existence and gains personhood, but also to quantify this event scientifically: The event at which a new, unique person is formed and personhood is gained is the event wherein a genetically unique, one-celled human is formed. This event occurs no earlier than when a human sperm penetrates the zona pellucida of a human ovum during the fertilization process, creating a one-celled human who possesses a full complement of human DNA, and occurs no later than when that first cell begins the process of mitosis to divide into two cells.\n\nThrough all of human history it was always the human DNA that endowed those who possessed it with their membership in the human species.15 Human DNA is the component of each human that makes him or her a person, regardless of the many and varied definitions of when life begins.\n\nA Human Being Is a Person\n\nThe connection of human DNA to personhood is based partly on standard terminology and biological knowledge that have existed for centuries. The novelty of the concepts expounded herein involves the connection of the recent molecular understanding of DNA to the assignment of beings to the species Homo sapiens.\n\nThat is, a person is a human being,16 a human being is a member of the species Homo sapiens,17 and membership in that species is traditionally based on human phenotypes that do not fully manifest until adulthood.18 These definitions connect personhood to membership in the species Homo sapiens. Black's Law Dictionary upholds this conclusion and acknowledges that personhood can be gained prior to birth (please note that Black's has no entry for \"human being\" or \"Homo sapiens\"):\n\nPerson: 1. A human being. \u2013 Also termed natural person. Person not deceased: A person who is either living or not yet born.19homo: 1. A male human, 2. A member of humankind; a human being of either sex.20\n\nNote that \"homo\" is the Latin term for \"man\" and is the source for the scientific name for the human genus, \"Homo.\" The Oxford English Dictionary also supports the conclusion that a person 21 is a member of the human race. 22 While the first edition of Black's was published in 1891, 19th-century definitions published in Webster's Unabridged Dictionary in 1864\u2014four years prior to the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2014support the idea that a person is a member of the human race.23 Thus standard terminology, utilized widely in this society for a long period of time, establishes the connection of personhood, humanness, and membership in the species Homo sapiens. This was known in 1973 at the time of the Roe v. Wade decision.\n\nPersonhood Is Determined by Human DNA\n\nHow do we determine which organisms meet the criteria for membership in the species Homo sapiens? Traditionally, we have looked at phenotypic qualities\u2014usually either physical characteristics 24 or the biological ability to produce offspring within the species, while not being able to do so with members of other species.25 The most unique physical characteristic of humans is the size of the brain and the abilities this produces (e.g., use of complex language), characteristics that are not manifest until after birth.26\n\nSince a phenotype is the consequence of DNA expression, the traditional methods of species assignment are an estimation of the underlying genetics. Different DNA sequences will produce different phenotypes, including the distinctions in anatomical and physiological characteristics that traditionally have been used to distinguish between species, because the DNA code is a universal code for all forms of life.27 It simply takes years of human DNA expression for the traditional species-defining phenotypes to be fully expressed.\n\nThus, physical human features such as the size of the brain and the ability to successfully interbreed with other humans are phenotypes arising from human DNA. Developing or possessing such human phenotypes is the consequence of expressing the information contained within human DNA. These phenotypes do not occur from the DNA sequence of another species.\n\nWhen Is Personhood Acquired?\n\nIt became possible only relatively recently to differentiate between species at the molecular level based on differences in DNA sequence. Using \"molecular phylogenetics,\" with assumptions about the rate of random mutation and the accumulation of new mutations over time, evolutionary distance between species can be computed.28 Through these calculations, historical divergence of species can be deduced, and the species to which an individual organism belongs can be determined.29\n\nGiven DNA's central role in coding for the characteristics of a cell, for groups of cells that form tissues, and for groups of tissues that form organs, DNA sequence differences are the most basic source of distinction between species. 30 Thus, if it possesses human DNA, even a single cell can be a unique human.31\n\nWhile the adult human is constructed of countless numbers of cells, in all humans this adult structure results from one initial cell that divides into multiple daughter cells which themselves divide into more cells.32 Most of these daughter cells specialize to perform tissue- and organ-specific functions. But, with few exceptions (and ignoring small errors of duplication), each of the adult body's non-reproductive cells contain essentially the same DNA that existed in the initial single cell.33 Thus, personhood is acquired in the event in which a single-celled being with human DNA is formed. In the usual case (i.e., sexual reproduction), this event is conception; in the case of a human clone, the event would be the creation of the clone.\n\nFurther Considerations\n\nOne of the primary arguments favoring abortion has been that the fetus is simply tissue in the mother. The DNA of the \"tissue\" in question, though, arose not solely from the body of the mother but through sexual reproduction. DNA is heritable information, which each new person receives from his or her two human parents. That is, the \"tissue\" is not tissue of the mother, despite the fact that it is, in the typical case, contained for the initial nine months of its existence within the mother's body. It is, as evidenced by its DNA, a human being distinct from its mother and father.\n\nAnother argument in the abortion debate is that personhood cannot exist at conception because a potential for \"twinning\" exists during the first few weeks following fertilization and, thus, it is not clear what form the zygote will take or how many persons may actually exist. \"Twinning\" is the process in which the pluripotent cells of a developing zygote physically separate into two (i.e., twins) or more (i.e., triplets, quadruplets, etc.) groups of cells that subsequently develop independently. However, twinning is not the creation of a new individual in the way that conception unites two single strands of human DNA to create a new organism. Twinning is the natural cloning process (or asexual reproduction) in which one or more pluripotent cells are naturally separated from a developing but conserved human individual, forming a duplicate who subsequently develops independent of the original.34 When twinning occurs, two or more new and unique persons exist independent of their parents.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe knowledge that establishes personhood based on a human being's membership in the species Homo sapiens has existed for a considerable period of time. The determination of membership in that species has, however, until the recent post-Roe v. Wade era, been based on phenotypic characteristics, such as brain size, that become manifest only after birth. With the modern understanding of the molecular structure of DNA and the molecular basis of inheritance, membership in Homo sapiens can be quantified at conception, and personhood can be shown to be acquired at one and only one event. In the usual case, conception is the event in which a human being obtains his or her DNA sequence and acquires personhood.\n\nThis knowledge ends the need for reliance on theology or speculation as to when life begins: A unique being possessing the DNA to make him or her a member of the species Homo sapiens is a person\u2014and is thus entitled to the equal protection of the laws and to the rights of due process under the law. A one-celled human being is as human, and as much of a person, as the most educated, most renowned, and most powerful Supreme Court justice.\n\nDr. Benjamin Horne, Ph.D., M.P.H., is currently employed as the Director of Cardiovascular and Genetic Epidemiology at the LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah.

They are killed with no questions asked.\n\nI know that some animal rights types *do* feel some affinity for the unborn; feminists however, feel none. They simply do not care if the baby dies, and will never admit the slightest amount of pity for him. Because they know their movement rests on dehumanizing the unborn\u2026\n\nWhat abortion is about is the freedom to engage in a risky recreational activity and to terminate the life of a separate, distinct human being who is a victim of the irresponsible choices of grown-ups who ought to know better. It's about killing the weak and helpless so that the strong are not inconvenienced by additional mouths to feed, which diminishes their selfish pursuit of pleasure. (And secular leftists complain about greedy capitalists \u2013 but at least capitalists don't murder innocent children out of greed).\n\nWhat moral relativism means\n\nECM sent me a brilliant post from David Thompson, that made me think of what secular leftists do after jettisoning real moral rules like \"don't kill innocent people without justification\". Read the post, then reflect on how moral relativists try to cover up their selfish hedonism in front of others by agonizing over fashionable causes and moral dilemmas. It's just an example of screaming \"me too!\" to religious people, even though morality is not rationally grounded without God.\n\nPeople who reject the objective morality that comes from God will go on to invent a new morality that they find easier to accept. Typically it will involve embracing things like animal rights, recycling, vegetarianism or yoga. But if you ask a leftist to curtail their sexual desires to protect children, (born and unborn), then you can forget about it \u2013 they won't do it. The whole point of atheism is to pursue pleasure apart from moral obligations.Just because we humans can't hear them doesn't mean plants don't howl\u2026 It's a small daily tragedy that we animals must kill to stay alive. Plants are the ethical autotrophs here, the ones that wrest their meals from the sun. Don't expect them to boast: they're too busy fighting to survive.\n\nSo, plants are people, too, and we shouldn't do violence to them by eating them. Interesting\u2026 But you know who doesn't deserve protection from violence, according to the secular left? Unborn children, that's who. I don't see them mentioned in this NYT article.\n\nIn fact, the left wants to use government power to stop conscience rights for pro-life doctors, and even the public expression of pro-life convictions. (H/T Lex Communis)\n\nDon't forget all the pro-life clubs that are banned across Canada. But maybe plants have a right to life, because maybe they feel pain.\n\nPeople on the secular left like recreational sex, but they don't like having unexpected mouths to feed. They want the pleasure of sex, but not the work of taking care of innocent little babies. To feel less guilty about killing babies, they have to invent a new morality that blesses something else they want to do as morally good, like recycling, animal rights activism or vegetarianism. It's idolatry \u2013 inventing a god of your own that you can appease just by doing anything you want."}

A country that attempts to prevent suicidal children who have survived abuse only to become pregnant from leaving the country.

It's to punish. Because he feels it's his place to step up and punish people (all women, in his eyes, which is a large portion of the motivation here) who are daring not to use their bodies the way he believes they should be used.\n\nJust like the rest of the \"pro-life\" movement, it's not about preventing abortion, it's about punishing people with pregnancy.\n\n\u2026imagine that your parents had the same belief and you were aborted.

My mother is, and always was afaik, pro-choice. She CHOSE to have my brother and I. How is it \"liberal hypocrisy\" to acknowledge that people deserve choices? It's sort of right there on the label of the movement. CHOICE. Including the choice to give birth and parent if that's what you want.\n\nI always laugh when people pull this \"your mother was pro-life!\" bullshit, because this is my mother who, when I had a pregnancy scare at 15 and my dad found out and swore he'd keep me locked in the house for 9 months to make sure I didn't abort his grandkid (ew), privately told me not to worry about that, she'd get me to the clinic when he was out of town if need be.\n\nThis is my mother who, when I did have an unwanted pregnancy in college, went with me to my appointment and took care of me afterward with my favorite foods and movies all weekend.\n\nMind you, when I called her and told her I was pregnant, she in no way encouraged any particular decision. I said \"Mom, I'm pregnant.\" She was quiet for a moment, then calmly asked in an absolutely neutral tone, \"Okay.

I've already called PP.\" (I'm childfree by choice and have been saying I don't want kids whenever someone asked since I was 12.) There's that funny CHOICE thing again.\n\nBut the point is, being \"for abortion\" doesn't have a damn thing to do with what a person might choose to do with their own pregnancy.\n\nPS: pontificating on the potential opinions of the never-born is one of the most ridiculous \"tactics\" (and I use the term loosely) I've seen from your side in awhile. How is that even relevant? It's purely speculative by definition, and talking out your ass on what you believe some nebulous potential life might have eventually come to believe about the circumstances that brought them into being, is not particularly effective as a debate strategy.\n\nEither you believe abortion should be legal and we need to protect access to safe, compassionate, and confidential abortion services, full stop, or you want to fall right down the slippery slope of moral relativism and directly into the hands of conservatives. You do not need to justify abortion because a pregnancy endangers the life of a patient, because a pregnancy is the result of rape, because you think certain people shouldn't be allowed to have children, because you think a fetus carries disabilities, or for any other reason.\n\nThe real money quote:\n\nEvery time a progressive justifies abortion, one of those horrid 'lamenting the preborn killed by pinko commie scum' websites gets another set of animated sparkling angel wings and a dreadful midi.\n\nJust FYI to everyone in Tallahassee, specifically FSU: The planners that the school has been handing out has a coupon for one of the crisis pregnancy centers in town.

They do not discuss abortion as an option and they are not qualified to offer thereputic or medical services in most cases.\n\nTo be specific about that harassment thing: they have a documented history of outright lying to \"patients\" about whether they're pregnant or how far along they are, forcibly keeping people trapped in their \"exam\" rooms to be bombarded with propaganda, telling \"patients\" (if non-Christian) that they're going to hell, deliberately setting up shop as near to actual reproductive services clinics as they can (like next door or right across the street) and choosing names as close to the actual clinic's name as possible in order to try to trick people into coming to the wrong office then pulling their usual \"hold them here\" trick to make people miss their actual appointments, pulling people in \"just for an ultrasound before your appointment\" and convincing them to have a drink of water or something which means they can no longer have their abortion (surgical abortions require that you come in on an empty stomach apparently), tracking down people's work and home numbers and family members' contact info to try to shame/harass them into keeping their pregnancy, and my favorite one, where a woman had an abortion but had gotten suckered into a CPC beforehand, received a fake-bloody \"birthday\" card every year around when she would have had the baby.

If I truly didn't care than I should say that the guy deserves no charges. But he does. This woman was apparently happy to be pregnant or at least desiring to continue the pregnancy. The guy took it on himself to try and end that, and that is absolutely wrong. Just as wrong as someone choosing to remove your kidney without your permission. Or deliberatley giving you wood alcohol to make you go blind. It is an attack on the tissues of another person with intent to damage them. That's assault. It's a crime and should be treated as such. The guy (assuming he is guilty and the story is true) should be going to jail.\n\nSuppose the fetus is far along enough to determine that the baby who was killed was a girl. Suppose the mother already had a son. Suppose that all the subsequent pregnancies were male (assuming she can still carry to term)- How do you compensate for the loss of her only daughter? Apparently then, a fetus is not merely the hope for baby, since there was an actual female present in her womb and a female that was taken from her without her consent. A fetus is not a commodity that can be replaced if broken. Children are not guarenteed, nor is gender. She didn't simply lose the hope for a child- she lost her child.\n\nHuman beings are not replacable. Once one is gone, he/she is gone-- as well as the changes that would have come with their presence in the world. If humans weren't unique, none would mourn death so (especially since 6 billion other humans exist). But if you have lost a child, born or not, all the other children in the world can not compensate for the unique son or daughter that you will never see grow into an adult.\n\nYou can't really compensate someone for that. You can commiserate with them.\n\n\"Apparently then, a fetus is not merely the hope for baby, since there was an actual female present in her womb and a female that was taken from her without her consent.\"\n\nNo there wasn't an actual female present. There was some flesh that might have some day been a little girl.\n\n\"A fetus is not a commodity that can be replaced if broken.\"\n\nWell technically speaking your body allows you to replace a given fetus every 28 days from puberty until menopause (except when already in the process of gestating). So yeah they can be replaced. Just as your hair grows back when cut, or your nails grow back. Or your skin grows back from an injury"}
{"text": "Oh, great. Another MAN weighing in on abortion. Well, ladies, if you don't like it, exercise your \"right to choose\" to not read it. But as it turns out, this man has the answer. And no, it's not one of those stupid joke answers like \"dude we shouldn't make abortion legal, we should make it mandatory hahahaha!\" That's dumb, the population would run out. What I will offer instead are a few points of clarification from the legal and moral perspectives, points that will cause you not to reconsider your stance on abortion, but rather to reconsider whether abortion is even a real issue. Sounds interesting, huh? Remember this whole thing is a joke though.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate the claim that a fetus has a right to life. Ridiculous. But let's grant for a second that the fetus is a human being, which, come on, that's like saying a baby chicken is the same as a real chicken. Regardless, let's give them that and consider the right to life from a legal perspective. Now, abortion isn't a pleasant issue, and this could get ugly, so you might not be well suited to this if you have a weak constitution (looking at you, France!). That was a funny joke, huh?

{"text": "Friday, September 7, 2012\n\n\"Pro-Life\"? Nope. Just Pro-Birth\n\nCountless media pundits question\nthe efficacy of the pro-life movement. \u2026 Some maintain that overturning Roe\nv. Wade would not result in fewer abortions. The spin they give is that if\nabortion policy returned to the states, women seeking abortions would simply\ntravel to blue states where abortion would likely remain legal.\n\nHowever, a new study from the National\nBureau of Economic Research shows that women seeking abortions are sensitive to\nthe travel costs and that state bans on abortion would be effective in reducing\nabortions.\n\nIn other words, \"pro-lifers\" are excited by evidence that state\nrestrictions on abortion\u2013 or\noutright bans if Roe v. Wade were overturned \u2013 force poor women to give\nbirth. Rich women (National Review readers?) are fine \u2013 they can just buy\na ticket to California or New York or Europe or someplace and make a long weekend of it. No biggie.\n\nBut poor women couldn't\nafford to travel to places where abortion was legal, so they'd have no choice\nbut to have a child. No money = no choice. Mandatory motherhood.\n\nHere's my question for \"pro-lifers\": If women can't afford\nan abortion, how on Earth will they afford to adequately care for a child? Have you looked into the\ncost of diapers\nthese days? Day\ncare? Food?\nEducation?\n\nThe right wing can crow all day about how much they respect\nlife, but forcing women to give birth to children they don't want and can't\nafford while voting\nto slash the social safety net doesn't sound \"pro-life\" to me. Pro-birth,\nmaybe. There's a BIG difference.\n\nAnti-choicers used to have a billboard that said \"2 million couples waiting to adopt\". So there's your explanation. They want you to not be able to afford to raise your child, so that you will give him/her to them. I have known a lot of adoptive couples, and yes, some of them would stoop that low."}

Like there were birthers always having their unfounded claims \"prepared to be reviewed\".

Govt is forcing religious groups to provide abortifacients.\n\nObamacare is being prepared to be reviewed by the Sup Ct again. You will learn that it is unconstitutional in many ways... if Romney does not eliminate it first.\n\nIn 1965, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) issued a bulletin to redefine the term \"conception.\" That bulletin stated that conception should be understood to mean \"the implantation of a fertilized ovum.\"1 Why this change? The timing of their decision makes it almost certain that it was politically rather than scientifically motivated. The FDA had recently approved the sale of hormonal birth control pills, but \"the pill\" didn't fit the traditional definition of \"contraceptive.\" Why? Because it doesn't just prevent conception; it also inhibits implantation\u2013or at least purports to. If breakthrough ovulation and fertilization occurs (which is the biological beginning of individual, human life), the embryo may find it difficult to implant because of changes the pill makes to the endometrium. This created an ethical problem for doctors who wanted to assure their patients that the pill is a contraceptive and not an abortifacient. How did they deal with the dilemma? They changed the definition of \"conception.\" By saying \"conception,\" but meaning \"implantation,\" it became possible to market hormonal birth control pills as contraceptives \u2013 as something that prevents \"conception.\"\n\nIf you look through the ACOG website today, you won't find a glossary of terms, but you will find numerous references to their altered definition of pregnancy and conception. In a pregnancy FAQ , they state that \"fertilization, the union of an egg and a sperm, is the first step in a complex series of events that leads to pregnancy\" (emphasis added).2 On a page titled, \"Contraception ,\" they state that the IUD \"can stop pregnancy\" by \"thin[ning] the lining of the uterus making it harder for a fertilized egg to attach.\"3 On their Birth Control Pills FAQ , they state that one way the pill can \"prevent pregnancy\" is by making the uterus lining thin, \"making it less likely that a fertilized egg can attach to it.\"4 By redefining the recognized beginning of pregnancy, birth control methods that would have otherwise been said to end pregnancy, can now be said to prevent pregnancy. These semantic changes do nothing to alter the biology of prenatal development, but they do plenty to confuse the ethical implications. In a 2005 Guttmacher Report on Public Policy , Rachel Benson Gold argued that \"according to both the scientific community and long-standing federal policy, a woman is considered pregnant only when a fertilized egg has implanted in the wall of her uterus.\"5 She goes on to say that though conception is \"often used synonymously with fertilization\u2026 medically, (it) is equated with implantation.\" This is clearly an overstatement.\n\nQuote from stu:\n\nYes you are wrong and insisting on being wrong repeatedly doesn't make you right.

Most times for most women it does.\n\nConception is nothing but the act of becoming pregnant. What definition is there to change, unless of course you're trying to confuse yourself in the way you are.\n\nUntil a fertilized egg implants in the right place, a woman isn't pregnant. Many times the egg doesn't naturally implant when fertilized, so just how the hell is she then at all pregnant in any real sense.\n\nThe contraceptive pill whether progesterone only or the ordinary pill, is to stop the egg being released in the first place. To delay release so sperm doesn't work making it difficult to get to the egg. Also makes the lining of the womb thinner and less receptive to an egg.\n\nIt stops the process to pregnancy.\n\nDebate with you ?... what a joke. You haven't a clue. All you do is scream troll every two minutes and have no idea what you're talking about or spell it properly.\nYou run off to your outdated religious bullshit websites, copy what they say without critically considering it , then parrot it in ET. It's not debating, just debunking your ignorant and senseless bullshit claims.\n\nIf you don't like contraceptives don't use them. Millions upon millions do and want to use them.

{"text": "The Bible and Abortion: The Biblical Basis for a Prolife Position by Rich Deem\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Bible declares that God values all human life and that He wants all\npeople to come to repentance to inherit eternal life.1 The Bible\nexplains that the entire life of a human - from the beginning to its natural end\n- is sacred, since God determines the length of those days.2 When\ndoes human life begin? This page will examine that question from a biblical\nperspective.\n\nWhen does life begin?\n\nMany Christians believe that the Bible is silent in regard to God's view on\nlife before birth. Although the Bible does not specifically define when life\nbegins, it does give us enough information to formulate a solid biblical\nposition.\n\nThe sayings of Jesus\n\nJesus demonstrated the love of God for children often during His ministry. In\none passage, Jesus took a child to him and sat with him. He said, \"See that\nyou do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you, that their angels\nin heaven continually behold the face of My Father who is in heaven\" (Matthew\n18:10). Jesus tells us not to despise or look down upon the least powerful\nand significant (by human standards) of humans. It is ironic that the most\nhelpless humans are those inside the womb. Of all the risks that we must face in\nour lives, the most dangerous place we can be is in the womb, since fully one\nfourth of all human babies are aborted in this nation - over one million every\nyear. Greater than 90% of all abortions are done for non-medical reasons.\n\nOld Testament law\n\nThe Old Testament provides most of the information on God's view of life\nbefore birth, since it gives us the law. The law specifically addresses the\nissue of taking the life of a fetus in the book of Exodus:\n\n\"And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so\nthat she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further injury, he shall surely be\nfined as the woman's husband may demand of him; and he shall pay as the judges\ndecide. But if there is any further injury, then you shall appoint as a\npenalty life for life.\" (Exodus 21:22-23)\n\nTherefore, the law tells us that a man who induces an abortion or miscarriage\nis to be punished, indicating that God values life before birth. A verse from\nHosea3 says that abortion is a punishment for sin,\nindicating God views it as bad. Likewise, God expressed His disgust for the\nAmmonites, who \"ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead\".4\nWhen does this life begin?\n\nHuman life begins in the womb\n\nThe Bible tells us God is involved in our creation from the womb:\n\n\"Did not He who made me in the womb make him, And the same one fashion\nus in the womb? (Job 31:15For Thou didst form my inward parts; Thou didst weave me in my mother's\nwomb. I will give thanks to Thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made;\nWonderful are Thy works, And my soul knows it very well. My frame was not\nhidden from Thee, When I was made in secret, And skillfully wrought in the\ndepths of the earth. Thine eyes have seen my unformed substance; And in Thy\nbook they were all written, The days that were ordained for me, When as yet\nthere was not one of them. (Psalm 139:13-16)\n\nThus says the LORD who made you And formed you from the womb, who will help\nyou, `Do not fear, O Jacob My servant; And you Jeshurun whom I have chosen. (Isaiah\n44:2)\n\nThus says the LORD, your Redeemer, and the one who formed you from the\nwomb, \"I, the LORD, am the maker of all things, Stretching out the\nheavens by Myself, And spreading out the earth all alone, (Isaiah 44:24)\n\nHuman vs. animal\n\nGod distinguishes between human life and animal life, since the killing of\nanimals has been allowed by God from as early as just after the fall.5\nIt would be helpful to first define what makes human life different from that of\nthe animals. The Bible says that God created three kinds of creatures:\n\nMost of God's creatures possess bodies only. These creatures include the\ninsects, worms, fish, etc. God defines the creatures possessing souls as being\nthe birds, the whales, the predatory and domesticated land mammals, and human\nbeings (Genesis 1:20-27). Creatures which possess a soul have the\ncharacteristics of having a mind, a will, and emotion. Most of us who have cats\nor dogs realize that these soulish creatures have all these character traits.\n\nTherefore, the difference between human life and animal life is that, in\naddition to having a body and soul, we are endowed with a spirit, (1\nThessalonians 5:23), by which we can communicate with, love, and worship God.\nThe Bible tells us that God forms this spirit within us,6\nand we are endowed with a spirit before birth (Luke 1:15), which makes us fully\nhuman before we are born.\n\nProphets called from the womb\n\nIn addition, there are a number of great men of God (and Jesus) who were\ncalled to be God's servants from the womb:\n\nSamson:\n\nThen the woman came and told her husband, saying, \"A man of God came\nto me and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God, very\nawesome. And I did not ask him where he came from, nor did he tell me his\nname. \"But he said to me, `Behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a\nson, and now you shall not drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean\nthing, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his\ndeath.'\" (Judges 13:6-7, see also Judges 16:17)\n\nJesus (prophecy):\n\nListen to Me, O islands, And pay attention, you peoples from afar. The LORD\ncalled Me from the womb; From the body of My mother He named Me. (Isaiah\n49:1)\n\nAnd now says the LORD, who formed Me from the womb to be His Servant, To\nbring Jacob back to Him, in order that Israel might be gathered to Him (For I\nam honored in the sight of the LORD, And My God is My strength), (Isaiah\n49:5Jeremiah:\n\n\"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, And before you were born\nI consecrated you; I have appointed you a prophet to the nations.\" (Jeremiah\n1:5)\n\nJohn the Baptist:\n\n\"For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no\nwine or liquor; and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, while yet in his\nmother's womb.\" (Luke 1:15)\n\nPaul:\n\nBut when He who had set me apart, even from my mother's womb, and called me\nthrough His grace, was pleased (Galatians 1:15)\n\nIn addition, the Bible tells us the wicked are estranged or enemies of God\nfrom the womb:\n\nThe wicked are estranged from the womb; These who speak lies go astray from\nbirth. (Psalm 58:3)\n\nWhat is murder?\n\nAll of the above verses tell us God considers us to be human before we are\nborn, but they don't answer the question of when we actually become so. I\npropose there is a way to know what God considers the latest point in\ndevelopment at which we must consider a fetus to be a living human. Even before\nGod gave Moses the law, when He gave Noah and his family all the animals for\nfood (in addition to the plants), He told them, \"Only you shall not eat\nflesh with its life, that is, its blood\" (Genesis 9:4). At the same\ntime, God gave the law and penalty for murder (described as the shedding of\n\"man's blood\").7 Therefore, God considers\nblood to be the basis for life and the shedding of human blood, which results in\ndeath, to be murder. Science tells us that the heart of the human fetus begins\nto form 18 days after conception.8 There is a\nmeasurable heart beat 21-24 days after conception.9\nSince blood is flowing at this point, it is likely that blood formation begins\nwell before day 21 (I could find no reference for the date at which blood\nformation begins). Therefore, this represents the latest date at which we\nmust consider the fetus to be human (according to biblical standards), which is\nonly 7-10 days after a women would expect to begin her menses. Most women have\ncycles that can vary by this amount, and therefore do not discover they are\npregnant until after this point. For all practical purposes, from a biblical\nperspective, abortion at any point must be considered murder by Bible-believing\nChristians.\n\nFinal words\n\nI did not write this article with the intent to condemn those who have\naborted their babies or participated in decisions to do so. Praise be to God\nthat He has provided a way for all of us to escape the condemnation we all\nrightfully deserve.\n\nThere is therefore now no condemnation for\nthose who are in Christ Jesus. (Romans 8:1)\n\nThus says the LORD, \"For three transgressions of the\nsons of Ammon and for four I will not revoke its punishment, Because they\nripped open the pregnant women of Gilead In order to enlarge their\nborders.\" (Amos 1:13)\n\nAnd Abel, on his part also brought of the firstlings of\nhis flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and\nfor his offering; (Genesis 4:4)\n\nThe burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel.\nThus declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of\nthe earth, and forms the spirit of man within him, (Zechariah 12:1)\n\n\"Whoever sheds man's blood, By man his blood shall\nbe shed, For in the image of God He made man.\" (Genesis 9:6)"}

{"text": "[This was originally\ndistributed at the Libertarian Party's National Convention held in Anaheim, Calif., June\n29-July 3, 2000.]\n\nIn two different planks (Population, and\nWomen's Rights and Abortion), the Platform of the Libertarian Party gives unconditional\nsupport to abortion choice -- at any time, for any reason, partial-birth abortion, the\nworks. Even many who support abortion choice recognize the need to delete those provisions\nfrom the platform.\n\nIn discussing abortion and the Libertarian\nParty, the practical political question for LP members is pretty simple: Do you wish to\nconsign the LP to the periphery of American politics for as long as you have any influence\non the party?\n\nI'm pro-life.[*] A majority of you reading this\nprobably call yourselves pro-choice -- even though many of you have severe misgivings\nabout late-term abortion, about partial-birth abortion, and about the inflexible dogma\nthat these are fundamental human \"rights.\"\n\nIf you vote or work to continue the LP's\nunconditional support for abortion until full-term birth is completed, then you will be acting\nas if that dogma is right -- that there's nothing more important in life than \"the\nright to a dead fetus.\"\n\nI joined the LP shortly after it was formed; in\nthose nearly 30 years, I have seen it grow, spread -- and stall. A Presidential vote of\none percent seems to the LP's glass ceiling. Abortion is not the only reason, but it's\nExhibit A. There is a significant constituency in America who agree with the basic\nprinciples of libertarianism -- that the only real justification for the use of force is\ndefensive, and that government ought to be severely limited to that sphere.\n\nCan the LP go anywhere (except to a\nfootnote in the history books) if it continues to close out that constituency?\n\nWho make up one of the LP's natural\nconstituencies?\n\nThe problem is, people who are perhaps the LP's\nnatural constituency take the nonaggression principle more seriously than many who\ncall themselves libertarian. That constituency finds it difficult to put much confidence\nin a party and a platform that figure homicide is perfectly all right so long as it's\ncommitted in the first nine months of life.\n\nNow, you may say that you don't think\nabortion is homicide (although, again, many of you stifle your misgivings or outright\ndisagreement about the status of the fetus late or even midway in pregnancy). But those\nfolks out there do think abortion is homicide, and they think homicide makes a\ndifference.\n\nSome of those folks call themselves\nconservatives, some call themselves independents, some even call themselves liberals. They\ninclude home schoolers, people who think the Second Amendment is a very good idea, people\nwho worry about government reaching into every sphere of their lives, people who don't\nlike the idea that government will tell them what to approve of and what not to approve\nof. They're ordinary people who have seen other ordinary people get shafted by government\nwith everything from sex and drug laws to business and tax regulations.\n\nThey may not do drugs or even booze; they may\nbe boringly monogamous; and their reading materials may make the Puritans look loose. But\nthey have absolutely no difficulty telling the difference between aggression and\nvictimless \"crimes.\"\n\nBut the LP and its relentless support for\nabortion leave them out in the cold. Again, they don't see this as a matter of sexual\nimmorality, loose living, or as a \"social issue.\" Again, they see it as\nhomicide. They also see it as the first step to a \"right\" to infanticide. (And,\nlet's face it, so do some supporters of abortion choice.)\n\nHow badly does the LP need a plank\nsupporting abortion choice?\n\nI think at this point, some of the more\ninsistent supporters of abortion choice will be saying that the LP doesn't need the people\nI'm talking about; you'll also hear that unconditional, absolute support for abortion\nchoice is essential for the LP to exist. Take away abortion, it will be said, and no\none (except a handful of pro-life nutcases) will vote Libertarian.\n\nDo the facts bear them out?\n\nIn fact, when some abortion choicers go orbital\nat the thought of the LP waffling on abortion, methinks those ladies and gentlemen do\nprotest way too much.\n\nAsk some questions:\n\n1) In the population at large, how does the\nrandomly selected hardcore supporter of abortion choice stand on issues important to\nlibertarianism?\n\n2) How do those who tend to vote with\nlibertarians tend to vote on abortion?\n\n3) How do current LP members stand on\nabortion?\n\nAbortion and libertarianism?\n\n1) How does the abortion-choice movement stack\nup on libertarianism?\n\nAre you serious?!\n\nThe principles of the abortion-choice movement\nhave been described quite succinctly: \"Exhausted from controlling, regulating,\ncensoring, zoning, policing, taxing, sanctioning, and proscribing, these pinpoint\nlibertarians toss a dart and pick out abortion as the one human acivity worthy of all-out\ndefense against the encroachments of the state. Their motto could be: If it's not\npregnant, regulate it.\" (\"Selected Skirmishes,\" \"Mario's Choice,\"\nThomas W. Hazlett, _Reason_, June 1990, p.58)\n\nAnd do you think the leadership of the abortion\nmovement really sees this as a \"women's rights\" issue? How many years did\nit take to get some of the hardcore to admit that the People's Republic of China had a\npolicy of forced abortions?\n\n2) How do free-marketers, etc., tend to\nstand on abortion?\n\nThis isn't as obvious as the politics of the\nabortion movement, but it's close. Get the Congressional ratings from a pro-life group (or\nan abortion-choice group). Compare it with the ratings from a libertarian group. The\ncorrelation isn't perfect, but it's basically clear: free-market, limited-government types\nheavily tend to be pro-life; pro-lifers tend to be against big government. (Among\npro-lifers, I've also found that the exception proves the rule: In state and local\npolitics, liberals and big-city Democrats who are pro-life tend to be a lot easier\nto live with than the usual liberal ideologues.)\n\n3) What about LP members?\n\nAs far as LP members are concerned, I think\nmany of you already know that things are a lot dicier than the Platform and the press\nreleases would indicate. When libertarians and LP members have been polled, the odds have\nbeen pretty stable: In roughly ballpark terms, a third are pro-life: they say we're\npersons with rights from fertilization onward, and abortion is aggression; it can be\noutlawed. Yes, there are points of difference and emphasis, but the basic agreement is\nthere.\n\nAnother third are the hardcore of abortion\nchoice supporters: Regardless of anything else, they insist that there should be no\nrestrictions on abortion at any time up until birth, maybe even until the umbilical cord\nis cut. Here, too, there are points of difference (such as infanticide), but the basic\nagreement is there.\n\nAnd finally, there's the middle -- where everything\nis differences and there's hardly any basic agreement at all.\n\nI do not mean that things are a tidy 33-1/3\npercent each, but the odds hover in that neighborhood. Pro-lifers are sometimes down to 20\npercent or so; the opposite side likewise. The middle is never less than a third.\n\nSo where does that leave you?\n\nThe point here is that those of you in the\nmiddle invariably vote with the hardcore supporters of abortion choice. Some of you are\nbrow beaten; the hardcore can be, shall we say, \"insistent.\" Others of you\nfigure there are these raving pro-life fanatics who will install a pregnancy police like\nsomething out of science fiction.

Wade; and the\none that really exists is in China.)\n\nWhatever the reason, you've felt you had to\ncompromise your own principles for years now.\n\nBut you may worry that if the party so much as thinks\nabout moderating its unconditional support for abortion, then the abortion choicers will\nall reject the LP -- as some of them have insisted they will.\n\nAll right, take them on their word: What are\ntheir priorities? Libertarianism? Or abortion? Their opposite numbers, pro-lifers,\noutvoted for years, have stayed around because they figure principles are more important.\nThey have had a tough row to hoe, making clear to voters what they know to be right, and\nthat the LP Platform disagrees with them on one very important point.\n\nYou, in the middle, have it easy. If the\nPlatform were to go merely silent on abortion, leaving candidates to their own\nconsciences, you wouldn't have to compromise your principles at all.\n\nOK, but take the \"worst case\" and\nassume that the hardcore abortion choicers all leave, and there are these hordes of\npro-lifers who will sweep in and install a pro-life platform plank.\n\nIn some respects, I might love to think that\nwas realistic, but it's not. When I talk about natural constituencies for libertarianism,\nI don't mean some magical Silent Majority merely waiting a call to battle. I simply mean\npeople who are on our side in principle. We and they have lots of people to convince\nbefore we have to worry about being inundated by false friends.\n\nIf I wanted to be paranoid, I might worry about\nthe Buchananites, but he has the Reform Party as his playpen, and he and his supporters\nfind libertarianism to be anathema. There's no way they're about to sign a membership form\nthat says \"I do not believe in or advocate the initiation of force as a means of\npolitical or social goals.\"\n\nNonetheless, what about the \"worst\ncase\" from your perspective? If the hardcore supporters of abortion choice all\ndisappeared, and there were really lots of pro-lifers to replace them, then you might see\na pro-life plank.\n\nOK, then those of you in the middle would be\ncompromising your principles in a different way than you have so far.\n\nBut don't you think it will be just a little\nbit odd if the hardcore do take a walk? Why would silence be a threat to them? Is it that\nthey need the LP to ratify their views? Or is it that the LP comes in a poor second to\nabortion?\n\nSeriously, we all know very well that most of\nthe hardcore supporters of abortion choice will stay, regardless of whether the platform\nis silent on abortion. (The Democrats may agree with them on abortion, but on little\nelse.) Within the LP, they'll still be able to run for city council or US Senate or\nwhatnot; they'll still be able to leaflet and campaign for referenda; and they'll still be\nable to work to keep abortion legal, with no objection from the platform.\n\nThe big difference is that there will be more\npro-lifers in the LP working on issues on which all libertarians are agreed.\n\nThe question for you is whether you want that\nto happen. Or whether one percent of the Presidential vote, and a handful of local wins is\nas far as you want the LP to go.\n\n[*]John Walker is Research Director of\nLibertarians for Life; he joined the LP shortly after its formation, and is currently a\nmember of the District of Columbia LP.\n\nLFL explains and defends the libertarian\ncase against abortion choice.

Abortion is about CHOICE, and the RIGHT to have personal autonomy over one's body. Pro lifers make it about murder, conservatives make it about morality, but it isn't. It's about the right to do with one's body what one wants. That's all it's about. That is why limiting abortion limits women's rights. When you tell a person what they can and cannot do with their body and specifically target women for this, it becomes a way of control. How far does that slope go? We've already seen court ordered c-sections. How far can we let this slide? It's not about anything other than a woman's right to choose what happens to her body. That's all it is. That is why, even though I hate abortion and believe it's murder...I still think that the government should stay the heck out of it and the choice should be between the doctor and the woman. Period.

Introspection and confessional stuff to me is always fascinating because I can see bits of myself in it. I've always been interested in psychology, so I love reading that sort of stuff.\n\nAnd if, for example, you're romantically interested in someone, you have a natural desire and a craving to know as much about them as you can, so those who are unusually self-aware and brave enough to talk about themselves are ever more appealing.\n\nThis makes me proud of the fact that I discovered Filament all on my own, kind of (yay StumbleUpon!) and introduced my friends to it. I'm pleased to see it getting positive publicity. Also, it has naked/seminaked men with LONG HAIR. I get to see that pretty much every day in my own house, but I like that it's not all about greasy orange dudes with gelled hair. I mean, um, the photography is excellent. Or something.\n\nJust thought I would leave a positive comment before I read all the other links and burst into flames from pure rage.\nBut what about guys who like to be pursued and womyn who like to pursue?\n\nI've casually looked through a couple copies of Filament, but I've not (yet!) bought a copy for myself. As someone who really does like looking at attractive men, I think well of the project \u2013 it's a refreshing break from the endless 'naked chicks naked chicks naked chicks!' formula that most sexual media (yep, even lots of the purportedly sex positive stuff) fall back on.\n\nCo-opting female gamers to sell a porn magazine? Really? I find this insulting, I don't see why there can't be articles like this in reputable gaming magazines. It's like they're saying girls who game are deviant, and fetishizing it. Yes, that's what is bothering me about this.\n\nI think the Filament magazine is really great! It's high time women have a magazine that serves the female gaze of society. Heck, there are a lot of heterosexual guys who also like to look at naked men.\n\nBut there were some comments on Jezebel about how a flaccid penis is the most disgusting thing in the world.\n\nSo until magazines like Filament can show a fully erect penis, and I think in the US, like in Australia, if you show a fully erect penis, you have to seal it and have an X-rating on it, they might not be able to capture more of their intended demographic. But I doubt that's going to happen anytime soon, though, as I can't see a magazine like Filament wanting to be bagged as an X-rated magazine.\n\nLike Amanda said, there already is a mom on the Supreme Court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

So why the push for \"a mom\" just because Sondra Sotomayor, the third woman to ever sit on the Court, doesn't have kids?\n\nThat article on \"One Woman's Year in Prison\" BLOWS MY MIND, not necessarily because there's anything wrong with it, but because it is the best example of the difference in how different people are treated I've seen in a while.\n\nIt is obvious straight away, from the TITLE, that it's about a non-poor white woman, because her being in prison is not some criminal or similar matter\u2013it's a crazy thing that happened to someone! It's a life EXPERIENCE! Imagine if such a thing happened to you! Then there's the picture\u2013like a picture from a college admissions catalog with some handcuffs added. Then the first line just goes out of its way to reinforce all these impressions:\n\n\"The post-college years can be a tough time for young adults trying to find their place in the world. For 24-year-old Piper Kerman, who in 1993 was one year out of Smith College, it meant seeking risky situations.\"\n\nShe went to jail\u2013man, kids do some interesting stuff in their gap years! I read an article like this last week about a young adult who tried to find herself by going to India!\n\nCan you imagine for a flat second ANY article about a young poor (or even wealthy) girl of color being framed this way? The introduction's entire point is to immediately raise your sympathy and identifying curiousity, which is good, because then you can deal with the actual issues about prison life that Kerman wants to address. But if an article about a young girl of color sent to jail for smuggling drug money started this way, with a different picture, the tone of it would seem so forgiving as to be almost parody. And the comments would all be about how sure, it's nice she wrote a memoir and all, but she was involved in the drug trade and its appalling that she thinks she can get out and make money off her punishment and, what, is this supposed to be our role models now, it's disgusting that we're endorsing her behavior, she needs to learn to live like a responsible normal person.\n\nThe thing is, I definitely don't think this is a bad article, or that it's wrong of Time to frame the article like this. Just the obvious contrast with EVERY OTHER ARTICLE I've ever seen about any person of color, and the laughable impossiblity of seeing this article written the other way around, really slapped me in the face. It's a quite stunning difference.\n\nIt makes me think of a few other interesting differences in reporting, too:\n- \"One Woman's Year in Prison\" makes it a confessional, a personal experience, along the lines of a mini \"Eat, Love, Pray,\" or something, and encourages the focus on the 'finding yourself after college' storyline. If it was a man's year in prison, the experience would be societal commentary and hard-hitting insight into the truth about the social justice system.\n-I often see these things, which take such an unusual! situation, like being in jail or working for minimum wage, and purport to give you insight on what it's like, and wonder: millions of people live this. Why does it take this young white college grad to tell you about it? So I realized, if this were written about a poor person of color in jail, the voice in the article would be that of the journalist, and the person in jail would be being explored as the subject, through which we also learn something about the criminal justice system; instead, in this case, the person who was in jail is the voice, and explores the subject of jail herself.\n\nI've read the magazine that article is in, and it didn't come across as co-opting female gamers or fetishising them to me- and I'm saying that as a female gamer who has no interest in being the token girl in the cosplay chainmail bikini. Obviously people interpret stuff in different ways, but Filament's staff make a point of saying that the magazine is there to talk about pretty much everything women's magazines don't talk about. That includes female sexuality and pictures of naked dudes, but it also includes hobbies, politics and history.\n\n@timothynakayama Both Filament and Playgirl show erect penises. Filament fought a high-profile battle to be able to do so when their printers refused. Apparently it hadn't been done before in Britain. But I would disagree that flaccid penises are ugly anyway. All penises are fine with me!\n\n@Jackie The article you refer to is the exact opposite to what you think. It has nothing to do with porn or sexualizing women at all. It says there are no need for dumbed-down versions of games without violence (the industry apparently thinks that's what would get more women into games), but there is a need for game with more realistic female characters.\n\nI think the confusion comes from how porn mags have pointless articles as an excuse to read it, but with Filament the articles are all good reads that make you think.

{"text": "Justice Ginsburg Denies Racial Component to Abortion Comments\n\nThree years ago, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg gave an interview which made some unintentional news when she discussed Roe v. Wade in terms of limiting \"populations that we don't want to have too many of.\"\n\nThis Friday, the same interviewer had a second chance to ask Ginsburg what she meant, and the veteran judge somehow managed to avoid explaining the phrase at the center of the controversy.\n\nIn her interview with Ginsburg three years, ago Emily Bazelon published this exchange on abortion rights:\n\nQ: Are you talking about the distances women have to\ntravel because in parts of the country, abortion is essentially\nunavailable, because there are so few doctors and clinics that do the\nprocedure? And also, the lack of Medicaid for abortions for poor women?\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, the ruling about that\nsurprised me. [Harris v. McRae \u2014 in 1980 the court upheld the Hyde\nAmendment, which forbids the use of Medicaid for abortions.] Frankly I\nhad thought that at the time Roe was decided, there was concern about\npopulation growth and particularly growth in populations that we don't\nwant to have too many of. So that Roe was going to be then set up for\nMedicaid funding for abortion. Which some people felt would risk\ncoercing women into having abortions when they didn't really want them.\nBut when the court decided McRae, the case came out the other way. And\nthen I realized that my perception of it had been altogether wrong. [emphasis added]\n\nThis sounded a lot like a racial argument at the time. In her new interview, Bazelon attempts to clear up that misconception, saying, \"To imagine that Justice Ginsburg would endorse eugenics as a motivation\nfor supporting legal abortion, you have to be out to get her.\" Okay, then, it should be a fairly simple matter to clear up. So what did Ginsburg mean?\n\nJustice Ginsburg also made it clear today that the issue she had in mind\nwhen we spoke in 2009 was concern about population growth among all\nclasses (and races). In the end, if that concern has a legacy, it's in\nthe promotion of contraception.\n\nThis is a denial, not an explanation. If Ginsburg meant \"all classes (and races)\" why did she say \"particularly growth in populations that we don't\nwant to have too many of\"? These words clearly mean something other than everyone. They are singling out someone. The denial of the plain meaning of the words doesn't make them go away. But incredibly, Bazelon never gets an answer to the question that is the focus of her piece.\n\nIt's certainly possible Ginsburg was only describing the historical territory, not endorsing the views of population alarmists like Paul Ehrlich which were popular at the time. \"Soylent Green,\" a dystopian film about overpopulation, was released in 1973, the same year Roe was decided. If Ginsburg's comments were meant to be descriptive and not prescriptive, why not just say that? For a moment, it seems this is where Ginsburg is going, but then she issues the flat denial that she meant anything at all, which undercuts all of that. It is an explanation more confusing than the original comment"}

For example, extreme as it may be, if i stab a non-pregnant woman in the stomach, and destroy her ovaries, i have destroyed hundreds of thousands of potential human beings. The reason that I will not be prosecuted for those murders is because even though the egg cells I have killed are potential human beings, they do not have the capacity to suffer, nor to understand the future they are being denied. we consider those cells to be life, but not human life, because they lack these abilities. That is when life starts, at the moment that the being can suffer the way that a human suffers. This is the shining line that abortions should be legal before but not after."}

In todays Guardian...people really vote for this asshat BECAUSE of his stance..not sure who's worse but I am sure the planet would be better off without them on it.\n\nThe idea that rape victims cannot get pregnant is a very old medical theory\n\nTodd Akin apparently believes the body can suppress conception or cause miscarriage after rape. Historically, it was widely thought a woman could only conceive if she had an orgasm. Photograph: KTVI\n\nTodd Akin, the Republican candidate for senate in Missouri, said in an interview released this weekend that he did not support abortion for rape victims because:\n\n\"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\"The biological basis for this idea is what the historian Thomas Laqueur has termed the \"one sex system\". The one sex system suggests that women's reproductive organs are fundamentally based on men's reproductive organs, so the vagina is represented as an inverted penis, the ovaries are testes and so on. Women had \"cooler\" constitutions, and therefore lacked the heat or force to drive the gonads out of the body, to convert ovaries to testes.\n\nThinking of the sexual organs as mirrors of each other obviously led to questions about the existence of a female \"seed\" or ejaculate. There was a disagreement about the roles of male and female seed \u2013 did they mingle to create the offspring, or did they contribute different things? Whatever the female seed contributed to conception, it was thought necessary, and so in theory a female orgasm was as important as a male orgasm.\n\nNot everyone agreed with this interpretation. Helkiah Crooke, in his 17th century anatomy book Microcosmographia suggested that women's sexual organs were not simply inverted versions of men's, and said that a woman's orgasm was not always needed, although conception was much more likely, and a pregnancy much more secure, if she had one.\n\nGenerally, though, the \"absolute rape\".\n\nMedical theories of sex, reproduction and conception changed gradually through the 18th century, so that by the 19th century the female orgasm was considered much less important for conception, and the female \"seed\" \u2013 if it even existed \u2013 was of less significance to the foetus. In popular culture the idea of the essential female orgasm lingered, and seems to still exist in a mutated form today\n\nAh but if she gets pregnant its because she actually did consent to the intercourse or her body did and from that point on she/her life is secondary to the bunch of cells dividing through her unspoken consent...other wise she wouldn't have become pregnant...simples. Women say one thing and mean another.Thank goodness we have people like senator asshat to give us the true interpretation and treat women like the brood mares they are.\n\nLet's hope the Americans aren't daft enough to vote for the moron Todd Akin then! It makes me wonder how he's gotten as far as he has and hasn't been locked up\n\nYou should look into the things mitt romney believes in and he's almost president!!!!\n\nHeaven help us if he does. And as for Atkin, my feeling is that he's pretty much shot himself in the .................... foot. End of career in politics I should imagine. People won't forget a pathetic view like that in a hurry. Of course, what he says owes far more to his lack of brain power than it does to religion."}

{"text": "Some Of My Favorite Things\n\nThursday, March 16, 2006\n\nA few months back, the conservative world was in an uproar because the Supreme Court ruled that the state has the right to take any property it wants if that land can be used to generate more revenue for the state. Matt Dubay's lawsuit, in which he attempts to avoid paying child support on the grounds that he didn't want a child, has an interesting resonance with that ruling.\n\nAccording to CNN, \"the president of the National Organization for Women, Kim Gandy, acknowledged that disputes over unintended pregnancies can be complex and bitter. 'None of these are easy questions,' said Gandy, a former prosecutor. 'But most courts say it's not about what he did or didn't do or what she did or didn't do. It's about the rights of the child.' \"\n\nConfusion from the Leaders\n\nIndeed? What child would that be, Ms. Gandy? According to the National Organization of Women, the decision to have sex is not a decision to have a child. There is no child at the moment of conception. There is no child, really, until birth. How can Matt Dubay be responsible for a child he didn't create?\n\nAccording to the most modern, cutting-edge definitions of sexual responsibility, pregnancy and personhood, Mr. Dubay most emphatically did not create a child nor had he anything to do with the creation of a child.\n\nAbortion supporters insist the act of sex does not create responsibility towards a future child. If it did, no one could support abortion. Legal abortion is grounded in the idea that something which does not yet have its own existence does not yet have any rights. Thus, abortion supporters take great pains to explain why the tissue mass in the womb is not really a child.\n\nIt doesn't have a heartbeat (except it does by the 22nd day after conception).\n\nIt doesn't have brainwaves (except it does by the 42nd day).\n\nIt can't feel pain (except it can by the 7th week, in fact, between 20 and 30 weeks gestation, the tissue mass is more susceptible to pain than a born child).\n\nSo, to parrot the pro-choice position, how can Matt Dubay have responsibilities towards a tissue mass? Towards something smaller than your thumb? Smaller than a grain of rice? How can he have responsibilities towards a fertilized egg that doesn't even exist until hours after he has withdrawn from the woman, withdrawn from the bedroom, gotten dressed and gone home to wash his car? Conception happens hours, sometimes days, after having sex.\n\nEven so, life does not begin at conception, remember? One hundred years ago, fifty years ago, even a decade ago, pregnancy began at conception. Today, it begins at implantation. Today, women aren't pregnant with children, they are pregnant with undifferentiated tissue masses, tissue masses that are nearly as marvelous a source of stem cells as menstrual blood.\n\nStem cells and abortion. That's why we changed the definition of when life and pregnancy began, remember? So we could tear apart those little tissue masses and steal, ahem, borrow, excuse me, use their stem cells. What? Oh, sorry. I meant use the stem cells.\n\nConfusion in the Logic\n\nSo, we ask again, Ms. Gandy, how can Matt Dubay have any responsibility towards a child he didn't create? A child is created through the act of gestation, but what has that got to do with a man? Men don't have wombs. Men don't gestate. Remember?\n\nThis is why we can create embryos for experimentation \u2013 as long as we don't implant them in the womb, as long as these embryos don't gestate, it's moral to tear them apart. Gestation is the key, remember? Not conception, not fertilization \u2013 gestation. Without gestation, it's just potential human life. With gestation, it might become real human life.\n\nBut men don't gestate.\n\nNow, why would Ms. Gandy, who has vociferously supported the aforesaid line of reasoning, suddenly come to the conclusion that the act of sex creates responsibility towards a future child?\n\nFor years, we have been taught that Americans don't understand science, and Ms. Gandy is demonstrating that ignorance in spades. Sex does not create children. Gestation does. Only women gestate. Thus, only women create children. Thus, only women have responsibilities towards children.\n\nAccording to the logic of neo-science and legal abortion, men aren't responsible for the existence of children. At all. Nada, zip, zero, nothing, goose egg, empty set.\n\nThose are just the facts of modern biology, successfully redefined by the pro-abortion lobby and Nobel-hungry biologists. It's just the nature of the thing, Ms. Gandy \u2013 not our fault. You insisted on the definitions. We fought against those new definitions. We lost. You won. Congratulations.\n\nConfusion in the Ranks\n\nEveryone who attacks Matt Dubay assumes that Mr. Dubay is somehow responsible for the existence of a child. Even abortion supporters are making this argument. But the whole concept is negated by the new science definitions, which tells us no child exists at the moment of ejaculation, nor at the moment of conception, nor even at the time of implantation, but only some later time. It is likewise negated by the new law, which tells us the woman has no responsibility toward whatever possible child might eventually exist.\n\nSo, those who argue against Matt Dubay's claim are either (1) logically inconsistent or (2) liars out to defraud one-half of the population. And here is where the new learning concerning eminent domain ties in.\n\nTying It All Together\n\nThe idea that the joint act of sex creates a joint responsibility, and that this responsibility is created towards a specific person as yet unconceived and without existence, this is an old idea, an idea so old it no longer applies in this brave, new country. The courts have specifically repudiated the idea in the case of a woman who has begotten a tissue mass.\n\nSo, if the court rules against Matt Dubay, it will embrace the curious position that a child has the right to receive money from a man who had nothing to do with her existence, but does not have the right to receive life from the woman who created her.\n\nThis is perfectly in accord with the recent eminent domain decision. It doesn't matter who owns what. What matters is this: can the state legally increase its revenues by taking property from one person and giving it to someone else? According to the Supreme Court, yes, it can. So, the state has every right to take money from any man in order to give that money to any woman with child, and thus keep both the woman and the child off state aid.\n\nSo, Matt Dubay will lose not because he had anything to do with creating a child. According to all the most advanced thinkers (which wouldn't be us neanderthals in the pro-life movement, by the way), he had nothing to do with the creation of the child. No, Matt Dubay will lose because his wallet is subject to eminent domain.\n\nMonday, March 13, 2006\n\nThe Associated Press is taking great pains to support Dan Brown in his defense against the copyright infringement lawsuit leveled against him by Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, two of the three authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail.\n\nThe very well-named Jill Lawless, the AP reporter who brings us the story, tells us the suit is for copyright infringement, but doesn't tell us why this is important. She reports on Brown's testimony in part by saying the \"courtroom [was] packed with journalists, religious skeptics and fans\" \u2013 a phrase her editor somehow failed to strike for its inordinate redundancy.\n\nFor a court reporter, Lawless seems remarkably unfamiliar with the legal issues involved. For instance, she takes pains to note that Holy Blood, Holy Grail claims to be \"nonfiction\" while also telling us \"Random House lawyers argue the ideas in dispute are so general they are not protected by copyright.\" Indeed, she takes the time to directly quote Brown's primary defense, \"'I'd never heard of it until I'd seen it mentioned in some of our other research books,' he said\u2026 Brown's court appearance also revealed a complex and wide-ranging research process undertaken with wife Blythe Brown, whose interest in 'the sacred feminine,' Brown said, led to one of The Da Vinci Code's key themes.'\"\n\nNow, let's take the Lawless article on the law apart piece by piece.\n\nBaigent and Leigh claim their book is non-fiction. But they do not sue Brown for plagiarism; they sue him for copyright infringement. How can this be?\n\nWhile fiction is subject to copyright law, facts are not. If I wrote a novel based on the James Bond character created by Ian Fleming, for instance, I would be violating Ian Fleming's copyright, and his estate could sue me for copyright infringement. Fiction is copyright-protected. However, if I wrote a story about the life of William Jefferson Clinton, ex-President Clinton could not sue me for copyright infringement. I might get sued for libel (the written version of slander) if I mis-stated the facts, but that is about it. He cannot copyright the facts concerning his own life.\n\nNow, let's say you took existing information or discovered new factual evidence and provided a totally novel interpretation of the facts of his life, thereby completely explaining why Slick Willy has women problems and feels our pain. You wrote an outstanding article or book concerning this idea, but it failed to gain wide circulation. I saw your theory and based my biography of Clinton on your interpretation without giving you any credit. Have I violated your copyright?\n\nNot at all. I am a plagiarist, but I haven't violated your copyright because you have no copyright on facts either. All you've done is come up with a new theory that covers the facts \u2013 and I stole it without accreditation. But I don't need to accredit you. After all, I could have looked at the facts myself and independently arrived at the same conclusion through simple logical analysis, and you would have a hard time proving otherwise.\n\nIn any case, while I may be dead guilty of plagiarism, and you may well be able to prove it, the most you can do is (justifiably) ruin my sterling reputation by proving I'm a plagiarist. You can't recover monetary damages from me for plagiarism because plagiarism is only a crime when I'm stealing fictional material or lifting direct and lengthy quotes from your factual material without in any way acknowledging that you wrote it.\n\nPlagiarism is not a crime if I'm stealing facts. It may not be wise, but it isn't a crime. That's why journalists get fired for plagiarism, but they rarely get sued for it, while novelists and playwrights sue for plagiarism but only as the basis for proving copyright infringement. Inventions can be copyrighted. Facts cannot be copyrighted.\n\nBaigent and Leigh aren't suing for plagiarism. They are suing for copyright infringement. They do not allege that Brown lifted whole passages of their book verbatim. Instead, they are suing on the basis that Brown stole their \"jigsaw puzzle,\" the fictional facts upon which he built a fictional plot.\n\nRandom House, the publisher of both novels, implicitly acknowledges this. Note, Random House doesn't argue that the suit should be thrown out because Baigent and Leigh are meticulous researchers who had not an ounce of fiction in their work, thus copyright law doesn't apply. Instead, Random House argues that the ideas are so generally in use they cannot be copyrighted.\n\nIf copyright existed during the life of the Brothers Grimm, a similar defense would have been used. \"Your Honor, while it is true that the Brothers Grimm used the character of the stepmother who is secretly a wicked witch in many of their tales, the idea is so general to works of this type that the plaintiff who is suing our esteemed authors cannot be said to have originated the idea.\" It's fiction, Judge, but it's fiction that is so common everyone has used it.\n\nAnd, lest anyone read the one-sentence summary of the Random House defense and begin to suspect, the reporter-ette then goes on to re-emphasize that Brown, Baigent and Leigh engaged in research, dammit! After all, Brown's wife, a learned art historian, is so professional that she couldn't get any of the art history right. Indeed, she couldn't even get Leonardo's name right (no art historian calls him 'da Vinci', since that refers to the geographical region he comes from, it is not properly part of his name). Indeed, Brown's historical and theological research was so complex and time-consuming that essentially every aspect of it was wrong by the time it got into his novel.\n\nRandom House, Baigent, Leigh, and Brown are all interested in conducting and concluding this copyright infringement lawsuit without anyone realizing that the very fact of the lawsuit demonstrates the whole thing is an advertising setup for the May 19, 2006 movie release. Brown's novel is three years old. It couldn't get on Drudge or CNN without it. Reporters, aka religious skeptics and therefore Dan Brown fans, undoubtedly know this. However, they also know what sells papers, so they aren't going to give us the facts either.\n\nIn short, the Brown-Baigent-Leigh lawsuit is like a Stalinist show trial, but the only thing that gets murdered in this one is the truth.\n\nFriday, March 10, 2006\n\nThe National Center for Men have finally gone and done it. For over a decade, they have been looking for a test case to overthrow the child support laws in every one of the 50 states. Now they think they have found it.\n\nA man who was deceived by his girlfriend conceived a blob of tissue/fetus/child (depending on your point of view) and is now being compelled to pay child support. He's arguing compulsory child support violates the equal protection clause. Years ago, when I argued on Usenet against abortion, I would bring forward a similar contrarian position in order to shock my pro-abortion opponents.\n\nPro-life: \"Is the choice to have sex a choice to have a child?\" Pro-abort: \"No\" Pro-life: \"No child exists at conception, right?\" Pro-abort: \"Of course not.\" Pro-life:\"When would you say that a child clearly exists?\" Pro-abort: [the answer here doesn't matter. Agree to use whatever time limit they choose]. Pro-life: \"A woman may have an abortion for whatever reason she chooses, correct?\" Pro-abort: \"Of course.\" Pro-life: \"Men and women have equal rights?\" Pro-abort: \"As long as abortion is legal, yes.\" Pro-life: \"Alright. Who creates children?\" Pro-abort: \"What do you mean?\" Pro-life: \"Well, since we know there is no child at conception, the child must be created at some point X, well after conception. Now, the man only has sex. He's not there after conception (indeed, conception may take place hours after the sexual act). It is only at point X that a child exists. Therefore, the woman alone creates the child through the act of gestation. Legal abortion asserts a new thing: sex doesn't create children, gestation creates children. Sex merely creates a fertilized egg, a tissue mass.\n\nMen don't get pregnant. Men don't create children. Men simply provide sperm. They provide one-half of a set of blueprints. The woman provides not only the other half, but the building site, the construction materials, she oversees the project, and she can destroy the whole thing anytime she wants. The man has got nothing to do with it. The existence of a child is not his responsibility - he has no choice, he's done nothing to create responsibility except have sex, and we already know that the decision to have sex is not a decision to have children, nor does it create a child.\n\nSo, the idea of compelling child support from the man is really a carry-over from the patriarchy, when men were thought to share responsibility for the existence of a child. Now that legal abortion has liberated us from those archaic ideas, we should throw away the last remnants of the old oppression.\n\nIf the woman wants to have a child, fine. Why should the man pay to support her lifestyle, her choice? If she can have an abortion for whatever reason she wants, then she is having a child for whatever reason she wants. In neither case does it have anything to do with the man.\n\nGenetics has nothing to do with the problem. Is the man's twin brother equally responsible for his child? Are you legally responsible for supporting your parents? No, to both. It is equally nonsense to say that the act of impregnation creates responsibility - if the woman has no responsibility towards a child who isn't there, how much less does the man? Indeed, according to the law, an anonymous sperm donor can never be held for child support, even if he desires to be considered the child's father. What's the difference between an anonymous sperm donor and one who's name you happen to know? The second just has a slightly more personal form of delivery. In both cases, the child exists only because the woman decides to allow it to exist. You might argue that the child wouldn't exist without him, but neither would a Ford pickup truck exist without raw materials from US Steel. Yet we don't hold US Steel responsible for the existence of the pickup truck - we hold responsible the one who built it.\n\nOr consider a woman who has identical twin boys. One grows up to be a carpenter, the other grows up to be an in vitro fertilization (IVF) specialist. The carpenter gets married, and he and his wife decide to have a child by IVF. The carpenter asks his brother to do the honors, and his brother readily agrees. The carpenter donates his sperm, the doctor extracts an egg from the wife, fertilizes it with sperm, and implants it in the wife's womb.\n\nWho is the father?\n\nAfter all, the doctor used sperm genetically indistinguishable from his own and impregnated the carpenter's wife. Doesn't that make him the father? Is he responsible for child support? If not, then why is the carpenter?\n\nIf you really believe that men don't have a right to a voice simply because they don't get pregnant, then you darn well ought to support the demolition of existing child support laws. After all, as you say, this child-creation business has nothing to do with men.\n\nThe National Center for Men is using precisely this logic to attempt to weaken and destroy existing child support law. The group is adamantly pro-choice. They point out that women have the right to force men to support a child even though the choice to create the child is clearly not their legal responsibility. In fact, a woman can rape a man, conceive a child, carry it to term, and then force the victim of the rape to pay child support. This is true even if the rape victim is a minor - a child himself. Such a boy pays for the crimes of another with his life's earnings. This last is not legal fiction - it has actually happened. A 12 year-old boy was statutorally raped, yet the court found he had a duty to support the child his rapist bore. (STATE of Kansas, ex rel., Colleen HERMESMANN, Appellee, v. Shane SEYER, a minor, and Dan and Mary Seyer, his parents, Appellants. No. 67,978. Supreme Court of Kansas. March 5, 1993).\n\nExamining the Popular Reaction Now, Mona Charen and other conservative commentators are trembling with rage over this argument. They think it will somehow shock the feminists. It won't. Today's commentators will soon discover what I discovered over a decade ago. The National Center for Men is finally doing what NOW and NARAL have been in favor of for years.\n\nKaren DeCrow, former president of NOW, argues vociferously that men should not pay child support. She is not alone; a great many \"feminists\" agree that compulsory child support should be abolished.\n\nWe know that impoverished households are disproportionately led by single mothers. Clearly, the removal of child support laws would increase the child poverty problem. But that's ok. Every time another mother drops below the poverty line, the feminists have another stick to beat stay-at-home moms with.\n\nPro-abortion feminists (there's a contradiction in terms) aren't interested in helping women, rather, they are interested in re-making all women into their own image. They are interested in justifying their own life's work. Every woman should be like them, every woman should become a sterile corporate worker bee. Human beings are a glut on the planet, and anything which reduces the human population is good. Removing subsidies for child production - and that's what compulsory child support is, in their view - is a good thing.\n\nPersonal responsibility for children is precisely what they have opposed for years. If children must be raised, then do it in a commune, a kibbutz, a village, so that no one gets too attached. We don't want anyone enjoying children. They might have more."}
{"text": "Most women are either for or against abortion. I have been against it since I learned about it. Then I get asked well why are you against it?- Oh let me tell you I have my reasons. Women can be all for it, and not really care, get pregnant, oops- 5 abortions later. When you're against it though, and all of a sudden you miss your period. What is a girl to do? Say oops and shove her opinion down the toilet? All women should answer one simple question before she makes her decision on pro-life or pro-choice and that is, \"What will you do if you get pregnant?\" Some will be torn, others will deal with the consequences and stand by what she believes in, others might switch sides. These are things that need to be thought through before you decide on what you believe in. Some girls should not have children, at all, but if she is pro-life then adoption is available if she is brave. If not, you have switched. Is pro-choice wrong? To kill something that lives in you, but has yet to see the world, or even know anything. It has to feel wrong. To live with the guilt that you are killing your child. It's sad, but yet somethings have to happen for a reason. Yet I still don't understand it fully. This will always be a topic I feel strongly about.\n\nI saw that you got a tattoo on your foot [or i could have clicked the wrong theing and it not be you, if so just ignore this] but I was wondering how much it hurt\n\nOnly the top of the letters hurt a tad.

{"text": "[link] Roe v Wade at 40: what American women owe to abortion rights\n\nThe landmark US supreme court case Roe v Wade turns 40 this week, marking four decades of abortion rights for American women. In those 40 years, the US and most of the western world have seen remarkable social upheavals, including incredible progress for women. Yet, abortion remains ragingly controversial in America and illegal around much of the world.\n\nEven with \"Roe\" on the books, the promise of bodily autonomy remains out of reach for many women. And the central opposition to abortion rights isn't about saving babies, promoting family or protecting women; it's about controlling female sexuality and trying to return to a time when women were forced or coerced into subservience.\n\nTo anyone who has taken even a cursory look at reproductive rights activism, it's obvious that decreasing the abortion rate isn't nearly as much a concern for the pro-life movement as controlling women is. We know what leads to a low abortion rate: comprehensive sex education, affordable and available contraception, rights for women, and a progressive sexual culture. The countries with the lowest abortion rates in the world have that mix \u2013 plus legal (and often state-funded) abortion.\n\nOutlawing abortion doesn't lead to a lower abortion rate, and some of the countries with the highest abortion rates on the planet are places where it's illegal. So if outlawing abortion doesn't mean fewer abortions, what purpose does it serve? Punishing women and making their lives miserable, apparently \u2013 illegal abortion doesn't mean fewer abortions, it means more dangerous procedures and higher maternal mortality rates. Thirteen per cent of maternal deaths around the world result from unsafe illegal abortions.\n\nDespite knowing the key to a lower abortion rate, the so-called \"pro-life\" movement refuses to use it. Instead, they feign concern for babies while doing absolutely nothing to help children and everything in their power to make women's lives harder and more dangerous if those women dare to believe that they're entitled to a fulfilling sex life.\n\nFeatured image on post: Anti-abortion protesters gather in Washington, DC, on 22 January 1974, for the first anniversary of the US supreme court decision in Roe v Wade that lifted legal restraints on abortion.

He has no use for the religion of fear and equally little\nfor social or moral religion. A God who rewards and punishes is\ninconceivable to him for the simple reason that a man's actions are\ndetermined by necessity, external and internal, so that in God's\neyes he cannot be responsible, any more than an inanimate object is\nresponsible for the motions it undergoes. Science has therefore been\ncharged with undermining morality, but the charge is unjust.

The argument, and even this is only from the most extreme anti-abortionists, is that in saving the mother's life, it is not acceptable to sacrifice the life of another innocent person with their entire life ahead of them.\n\nTheir entire life ahead of them is mere speculation..... they can end up still born or die very shortly afterwards..... and yet that's still fine when it comes to risking the life of someone who's already proven they are capable of having a future.\n\nIt's not the mother's foetus either. Following their logic that a foetus is already a human being, it deserves legal protections from being murdered by its parents. You can say it's no one else's business, but you wouldn't be saying that if a mother murdered her three year old.I'm afraid the above is all perfectly logical, reasonable and correct if you accept the premise that a foetus is equivalent to a developed human being. If you want to refute an anti-abortion stance, you have to refute that premise. It's the only way.\n\nIt's not logical or reasonable to accept a fetus as some equivilant to a \"Developed human being\" because it's not fully developed in the first place..... it's developing.\n\nToast isn't toast until you toast it.... before that, it's just a slice of bread.\n\nA fetus isn't a fully developed human being until it's fully developed.\n\nBut I don't have a legal right, and I doubt you support granting me one.\n\nQuote by: Prax\n\nCommon sense dictates this... a 9 year old female body might be able to handle one baby.... but do you think it physically can handle two at once?\n\nThey don't hand out medical degrees based on common sense.\n\nQuote by: Prax\n\nJust goes to show how moral they truly are huh?\n\nDepends whether you accept their premise.\n\nQuote by: Prax\n\nTheir entire life ahead of them is mere speculation..... they can end up still born or die very shortly afterwards.....\n\nSo could the mother.\n\nQuote by: PraxQuote by: Prax\n\nIt's not logical or reasonable to accept a fetus as some equivilant to a \"Developed human being\" because it's not fully developed in the first place..... it's developing.\n\nGo plead your case in the \"life at conception\" thread; you'll get no argument from me.

Yes you can. Much like you can with an undeveloped 9 year old who according to medical practioners could not safely go ahead with the birth. And why should she, because a bunch of religious people hold a belief that she shouldn't?\n\nCan you assign life on the basis of survival here? Yes you can. Much like you can with an undeveloped 9 year old who according to medical practioners could not safely go ahead with the birth.\n\nYou don't have a right to kill another person to save your own life, particularly if it's not even certain that you will die if you don't. I don't, for example, have the right to kill you and steal your liver if I need a transplant.\n\nAgain, boils down to whether or not you consider the foetus a person, which is an issue not addressed by the story in the OP.\n\nYou have a 9 yr old daughter. I presume you are male, so lets says another male rapes her. She gets pregnant with twins. Probably has no idea what has happened to her, or what a pregnancy involves, only that the doctors have told you and her that it is risk for her to carry to term.\n\nCan you HONESTLY say that you would look her in the eye and say \"sorry, you have to carry to term, you might die, but hey, it's what you should do?\"\n\nHonestly, put yourself in the role of the parent, YOUR daughter...\n\nSeems pretty unreasonable, no?\n\nWhile I can appreciate your side, and can agree that the abortion law needs to be controlled, ie Teens who get pregnant for lack of using protection and abort, no that is wrong, but sometimes circumstances are not so one sided and we need to be able to look at it from the other view point and see where they are coming from."}
{"text": "20 August 2012\n\n\"Legitimate rape\"\n\nIn reaction to the Todd Akin shocker (see post below), some bloggers are focusing on his use of the phrase \"legitimate rape\", as if he meant that some rapes are \"legitimate\" in the sense of being morally acceptable. This is missing the point. It's quite clear that he didn't mean that. What he did mean is, if anything, more disturbing.\n\nRemember, he said, \"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing [pregnancy] down.\" He was re-asserting the distinction, popular among abortion-banners, between \"real\" rape (what he meant by \"legitimate\" rape) and some unspecified but putatively-large category of rape that isn't really rape, just women claiming to be raped when it was actually consensual or they're just mad at a guy or they just need an excuse to get an abortion or whatever it is that these guys (it always seems to be guys) have in mind when they make this distinction. Abortion-banners know that rape is a case that undermines their stance in the eyes of many who might otherwise favor it, so they have to minimize rape as an issue, and one way of doing that is to claim that real rape is much rarer than people think.\n\nWhat makes Akin's formulation distinctively disturbing is the claim that his (wholly imaginary) natural anti-conception mechanism operates exclusively in cases of \"real\" (\"legitimate\") rape. That is, if you want an abortion after a rape, the very fact that you got pregnant shows that it wasn't a real rape. If it had been a real rape, you wouldn't have gotten pregnant. So there. No abortion for you, and stop making a big deal out of nothing.\n\nIn addition to being a major-party candidate, he's a major-party idiot.\n\nEvery time I think I've heard a GOP pol say something wildly stupid,[think Michele Bachmann] along comes another GOP pol and blabs something more wildly stupid.\n\nThere seems to be a limitless supply of these know-nothing pols, who attracted to the know-little-to-nothing party.\n\nI think this particular dimwit just helped Clair McCaskill get re-elected.\n\n\"On Sunday night, Akin said he had misspoken, but did not disavow his remarks or explain where he had received the information on which they were based. By Monday morning, top Republican officials were calling on him to resign, with strategist Mike Murphy summarizing the sentiment in a tweet: 'Akin should put good of GOP first and resign nomination now after his idiotic comment. Senate control too important.'\"\n\nLP: Let's hope he went off the cliff with this comment and ruined his chances at the polls.\n\nAt the very least. If the majority of voters in Missouri still want him to represent them after this, sane people should probably steer clear of the place.\n\nSK: I can't imagine how anyone could have \"misspoken\" such a thing without being, in fact, an utter jackass.\n\ndid not disavow his remarks or explain where he had received the information on which they were based.\n\nProbably the same place the know-nothing party gets its \"information\" on evolution and climate change.\n\nIn yesterday's post I linked to this Republican discussion about Akin. It's quite startling to see the condescension and insults aimed at a couple of Republican women who tried to explain to the troglodytes why this is, in fact, a big deal. And they wonder why they suffer from a gender gap.\n\nMissouri is the place that just passed a constitutional amendment \"protecting\" citizens' right to pray in public, as if the First Amendment didn't already do that. They want schools & city councils to be able to link Jebus to their activities. I can't wait for a Muslim to thank Allah at a high school commencement there.\n\nLA: Yep, I know the religio-nutters are big in Missouri. Akin himself got his degree in \"divinity\", which may help explain both his troglodyte attitudes and his ignorance of biology.\n\nI hear Akin was just on Huckabee's radio program and put his foot in it again -- said he personally doesn't know any rape victims who got pregnant, as if that proved anything. He's not going to drop out of the race, though"}

{"text": "Thursday, March 7, 2013\n\nThe Actual Abortion Issue\n\nNow it is time for the vocal AtheoLeftists here to come right out and defend the killing of individuated human life at the necessary stage of fertilized human egg and throughout the further developmment of the human embryo/fetus.\n\nIt seems odd that I must defend human life from wanton killing, regardless of the stage. The fact that the AtheoLeft is so cavalier about taking life demonstrates the continuation of the standard Leftist march toward Animal Farm. The faux empathy of the AtheoLeft does not extend to the 54,000,000 humans who have been physically killed in special killing abbatoirs, generally to avoid the inconvenience of enduring a pregnancy.\n\nLet's get specific.\n\n1. Explain why it is OK to jam scissors into someone else's brain, but not yours.\n\n2. Explain why it would have been OK to jam scissors into your own brain, but just not now.\n\n3. Explain why someone else, say Peter Singer or the Emmanuel brothers, shouldn't have the moral authority that allows the decision to have scissors jammed into your brain right now.\n\n4. Explain why you are special, and exempt from the very types of death decisions which you morally authorize yourself to make for Others.\n\nI suspect that the bravery of those defending the Choice to kill someone else will fade rapidly when it comes to that Choice for someone to kill the Choicers themselves. I.e. there will be few if any honest responses to the real issues.\n\nADDENDUM:\nAn interesting political twist: Yesterday, when a Senator asked for a Sense of the Senate Resolution stating that the President should not kill American citizens in America, the Democrats led by Durbin objected. This resolution request was in response to the legal opinion by Holder that the President can, indeed, turn drones onto Americans in America. Interestingly, drones held by the Homeland Security wizards can now detect humans carrying guns. With the Homeland Security purchase of 1.6 billion rounds of ammo and a number of armored vehicles - essentially tanks - and after having identified right wing and abortion foes as terrorists, there is nothing to worry about... for the Left. The domestic army is in place.\n\n53 comments:\n\nStunned.\nsaid...\n\nStan won't answer a question about whether a three-year-old child is more worth saving than two fertilized eggs because \"To accept such a challenge and buckle to the pressure of an intellectually dishonest \"dichotomy\" is a failure of the subject, who is too weak to resist such things.\" and asking the question was \"ideologically motivated\" but will ask such insanely dishonest and ideologically motivated questions as these.\n\n\"This resolution request was in response to the legal opinion by Holder that the President can, indeed, turn drones onto Americans in America.\"\n\n\"\u2026but will ask such insanely dishonest and ideologically motivated questions as these.\n\nOh my! Such accusations in the defense of not providing any defense for your ideology \u2013 yet again. These questions are not even logic fallacies as was yours for me, so why wouldn't you answer them? If you defend the death-by-doctor procedures, then answer the questions. But you won't, because they are against \u2013 not logic because they are legitimate issues \u2013 but your ideology. And that answers the questions perfectly. \"We be Atheists; we be elites; we don't answer no questions; we just ask irrational ones\".\n\n\"One word and Rand is happy.\"\n\nIf Holder had used that word initially, instead of pretending to preauthorize \"extraordinary circumstances\" for killing Americans on American soil without warrants, the whole embarrassment for the Administration would not have been necessary. He refused to use that word when Cruz worked him over. It took a scene in the senate which brought the issue to a level even the msm couldn't ignore to force him into compliance with the Constitution. And if anyone thinks that gun-walker / fast-and-furious Holder is a truth teller with compassion for human life, they should ask the families of the hundreds of Mexicans killed with Holder's walked guns, and the family of the US agent in Arizona.\n\n\"\"With the Homeland Security purchase of ... a number of armored vehicles - essentially tanks -\n\nNope.\n\nWrong; the Homeland Security has purchased and owns armored vehicles which vary from tanks only by the rubber tires and lack of a swivel mount cannon on top. There are firing slots to shoot through with the gov't assault weapons.\n\nNow, let's get back to you. I did answer the question I was asked, after framing it properly in its full and proper logical form. You, however, have not answered the questions asked of you; you rather attack the questions as illegitimate from your ideological point of view. That is a sorry response. It demonstrates that your ideology cannot stand up to scrutiny and instead requires bullying of the questions in order to avoid answering. These questions are legitimate essay questions regarding your own ethics \u2013 as opposed to the unethical game-playing question couched in false dichotomy which was used as an ethics trap.\n\nTo me, this suggests that Atheists are moral cowards, dodging responsibility for their own amoral positions. This couples well with the Atheist avoidance of providing actual reasons for rejecting Theist arguments without any evidence or disciplined deductive arguments: that is intellectual cowardice.\n\nSo the consequence is that Atheism and these Atheists are demonstrating their lack of moral reasoning, their lack of intellectual reasoning, and their existence in the Atheist VOID, where logic is eschewed in favor of elitist ideology.\n\n@Stan: Or Stunned is a bored troll who is, indeed, an atheist, and unlikely to admit you are right. No matter how many times you counter his nonsense with reason, he only has to flip another foolish remark out there and !boom! you're off and running.\n\nThe guy is in the Void, Stan. He's happy there. You've done what you can to enlighten him, but personally, if I were you? I would just shitcan his comments from now on. I know you can do that from your control panel, even with moderation turned off.\n\nThe Void is a vacuum. These guys have become part of the Nothing. They know it.And they don't care. Don't let them suck away the best years of your life.\n\n(I wonder how many come here to honestly find out about atheism, reason, abortion and the Void, and how many come here to cross swords with you - and how many come here just to spin you up?)\n\nThere is no reason to EVER listen to an ah-theist. We Know they are wrong so why bother. They need to identify themselves so we don't have to read their pollution. ANd they don't get to ask questions. When an ah-theist asks a question it just causes trouble. It's rubbish and it can confuse people. It's your blog. If an atheist talks DELETE them. They have the government, the schools, the music, the movies, the media. don't let them have this.\n\nThe reason that I chase them to the ground is to demonstrate that they do not in fact subscribe to rational principles. Nor do they have consistent, credible moral principles.\n\nIt would be counterproductive to ban all Atheists as Storm suggests, because this is not a religious-based forum, strictly for religious commenters and readers. There are other forums for that. Rather this forum asks for Atheist participation (so long as it is civil) in order to directly address their positions, with logic and rational responses.\n\nStunned is, in fact, an Atheist troll who has not provided any real contribution which would shine positively on his Atheism as a worldview. But he has been borderline civil and he has been a fine demonstration of the type of argumentation which Atheists produce: mostly sarcastic belligerence, coupled with red Herrings.\n\nThe abortion issue always brings out the worst in the Atheists. They must grope for rationalizations which would support their personal decision on the non-value of human life and the right to decide who it is OK to kill outside any judicial declaration of guilt. Peter Singer, of course, is more sanguine about his personal right to determine who should die. His personal elitism is his claim to fame, along with his proclamations regarding who has value, and who does not and should be killed (also why sex with animals is OK and other \"ethical\" encyclicals). This arcane pseudo-morality is also internalized by the Atheists who show up here, but they don't know even know why they believe and endorse it, or why they are actually not elites but are rather merely parrots who cannot defend their own (false) elitism. So they pick away at details and try to change the focus in order to avoid their own culpability; but they run away when confronted.\n\nSo there are two processes in play here.\n\nFirst, demonstrate the rational and moral failure of Atheism as it is presented by Atheists who show up here. This entails a back and forth discussion.\n\nSecond, to challenge them to defend their beliefs, both intellectually and morally. This is always one way, because they go immediately silent when challenged to provide the physical evidence or deductive arguments to support their blind beliefs\u2026 except to berate the challenge itself.\n\nYou'll notice, of course, that except for the troll, all the Atheists suddenly vanished from the conversation when they were challenged head-on.\n\nSo I suspect that if they are approached by someone with a set of scissors pointed at their skulls, they would certainly consider their own lives to have value \u2013 thereby extending value to their previous necessary existence as children, as newborns, as preborns, as fetuses, as embryos, as pharynguli, as fertilized eggs where they were first individuated into themselves as specific humans at a specific and necessary stage of human development.\n\nAnd if not, then there is no reason not to apply the scissors, an eventuality which any rational person would try to avoid.\n\nSo they vanished back into the VOID rather than to accede to the obvious. They would rather disappear than to admit to their irrationality.\n\nThis means, of course, that they hold onto the right to determine who lives or dies even while admitting (by their behavior) that there is no rational or moral defense; then they wonder why they are not trusted.\n\nWhy would a rational person trust someone who asserts for himself the right to kill without due process, just because he is elite? Or trust a person who creates his own morals to suit his personal elitism? This is precisely what Atheists do, and is why they aren't trusted to be rational, moral people.\n\nAt this point it seems fairly clear that the Atheist supporters of the scissors through the skulls of other humans to be far preferable to scissors through their own skulls.\n\nThis puts the lie to their claim of massive empathy for other humans. They care not a whit about embryos or fetuses or preborns. It perfectly decorates their massive hypocrisy instead.\n\n\"Scissors through the skull\" of adults does have a famous Atheist precent: Stalin had Trotsky stabbed in the skull with an ice pick, a post-natal abortion based on Stalin's opinion of Trotsky's value as a human. Not exactly scissors, but close enough, and same effect: death by devaluation by a self-authorized moral Atheist.\n\nEven if a fetus can be said to have a right to life, this does not include the right to use the body of another human being.\n\nA complete, living woman, has absolute rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. You cannot require her to sacrifice these rights for any other person.\n\nA fetus exists at the cost of the mother. She may choose to surrender her values, her effort and energy, to mature this fetus and bring it to term and deliver it, or she may choose to discontinue the support.\n I actually cared?\n\nDo you think your beliefs about the start of life should be imposed on all other people in the United States, with the force of government law?\n\nDeist woman said... \"Even if a fetus can be said to have a right to life, this does not include the right to use the body of another human being.\"\n\nThat's absurd. You were an egg, a pharyngula, an embryo, a fetus and a preborn \u2013 or you would not be here. Every human must develop in a womb. You claim that no fetus has a right to be in a womb? How did it get there? Outside of rape, the woman is complicit in putting it there. Rape abortions are swamped by convenience abortions, where the woman merely refuses to take responsibility.\n\n\"A complete, living woman, has absolute rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. You cannot require her to sacrifice these rights for any other person.\"\n\nA complete woman has no responsibilities, only rights? OK I see your point. No other person can depend on any woman for anything, ever. Got it. How did your mother look at that? Why didn't she abort you? Did she take responsibility for you?\n\n\"A fetus exists at the cost of the mother. She may choose to surrender her values, her effort and energy, to mature this fetus and bring it to term and deliver it, or she may choose to discontinue the support.\"\n\nSame goes for children, right up to the age of 18. These days, up to the age of 28 when they finally move out. They could be post-natally aborted at the mother's disgression, under your rules. And exactly what values are surrendered by NOT killing her offspring?\n\n\"I'm pro-abortion. Safe abortion is a health care landmark.\"\n\nAbortions prior to Roe v Wade were rare and sometimes fatal to the mother (and certainly the offspring). Now abortions are done in abortion factories, some of which are deadly to the mothers (and certainly the offspring). There is always a death during an abortion. That is the failure of the empathy of the supporters: they refuse to acknowledge that. Those deaths are of no concern; it is the faux right to kill which is important.\n\n\" The sheer amount of human suffering averted by the availability of safe abortion is enormous.\n\nThis is unsupportable and, frankly, unconscionable given the post abortion mental issues which many women undergo. The term \"safe abortion\" is unsupportable since there is no oversight of abortion abbatoirs and thus no data for reference. However, no abortion is \"safe\" for the unprivileged minority member of the aborting party; the fetus always is killed. So the declaration of abortion \"safety\" is a ghoulish claim.\n\nPregnancy is no longer dangerous for women; delivery of a child is not longer dangerous for women. The objection to carrying a child is purely an assertion of \"no responsibility\" for the pregnancy. It is commonly purely a support for irresponsible sexual profligacy. And fairly commonly it is a man forcing a woman to kill her offspring.\n\n\"I am woo yay abortion, just like I'm woo yay antibiotics. I'm not running around forcing azythromycin down anyone's throat but damn, antibiotics are awesome. So is abortion.\"\n\nSo for you, the fetus is certainly valued at the equivalent level of an invasive bacterium and is to be treated as such. Got it. (continued)\n\n(from above) \"I actually cared?\n\nYou are a deist, so that type of deity just doesn't care, and also asserts no moral principles, so actually whoever kills whoever is just not an issue for that deity. That certainly leaves the deist in the clear, morally. And any morals that exist for the deist are just convenience-type behaviors, so it is certainly possible to wrap a personal moral theory around any possible, convenient behavior which is desired.\n\nUnder Judeo-Christianity, if that is the God to which you referred, humans are natural beings containing spiritual capacities for determining right and wrong. Right and wrong must be taught, after which it resides in the conscience as a guide for dealing with the natural world. The natural world is unconstrained by moral or ideological considerations, and that includes the human body which is imperfect and must be dealt with just like all of nature. When dealing with humans and their physical issues, the capacity to determine right vs. wrong comes into play. The JudeoChristian deity allows free will to adhere or not adhere to moral behavior within an amoral natural structure. This seems incomprehensible to those who have no moral structure outside that of their own construction for their own convenience.\n\nJudeo-Christianity presumes a moral structure, but deism has no inherent moral structure, just like Atheism which has no attached moral structure. So as a deist, you are at liberty, under your worldview philosophy, to do whatever you want, whenever you want, with no constraints. Thus, the final question below is designed to place on me, the onerous position of restraining your unrestrained freedom to do anything.\n\n\"Do you think your beliefs about the start of life should be imposed on all other people in the United States, with the force of government law?\"\n\nThere are currently impositions on wanton killing of innocent people ex judicia, rules of civilization which are imposed with the force of government law. What you want is exclusion (Special Pleading) for your particular category of devalued humans which you consider to be only the same as bacteria. You claim the right to eliminate individuals in this category of humans, because of how you personally devalue these humans. When others want to change the definition of the targeted category, well, what's to stop them from increasing the types of devalued humans? The precedent of killing undesirable humans has been set. For that reason, I think that the law must protect all human life, not just the current list of desirables. And I don't grant you any right to determine which undesirables may be killed under your personal philosophy. That is my philosophical right.\n\nYes, this goes against the kill culture currently in place; there are categories of human undesirables which may legally be and are being killed, by the millions. That doesn't make it right, any more than infant sacrifice or virgin sacrifice\n\nWhat if there was no brain yet? What if at least 98 percent of induced abortions didn't involve scissors?\n\nI do think there is an important discussion to be had on the value of a zygote. Does the mere fact that it is alive make a zygote equal in importance to a pregnant woman? No. So it is the potential to be a human being that gives the zygote value, but is it equal in value to a fully grown human? I cannot agree to the idea that this fully conscious being, aware, and experienced is of an equal value to an unconscious, unaware, inexperienced zygote. What you tell a woman when you tell her she is not allowed to obtain an abortion is that she is equal in value to a clump of cells.\n\nSome people believe the mother's life is fully realized and that she should choose what to do with it.\n\nI expect pushback on the safety of chilbirth. According to NIH studies, the safety of abortion (0.0006 morbidity rate) is greater than the safety of childbirth (0.0088 morbidity rate). Both are safe in the overall scheme - except for the fetus. Only the mothers are considered in the study. The fetuses are collateral damage.\n\nThe real morbidity rate for abortion is > 50% when the fetus is considered.\n\nDeist woman said... Due to hormone imbalances, genetic anomalies, and a number of unknown factors, between 50 percent and 75 percent of embryos fail to implant in the uterus and are passed with the monthly menstrual flow..\n\nAnd Stan, listen to yourself:\n\n\"Outside of rape, the woman is complicit in putting it there. Rape abortions are swamped by convenience abortions, where the woman merely refuses to take responsibility. ... The objection to carrying a child is purely an assertion of \"no responsibility\" for the pregnancy. It is commonly purely a support for irresponsible sexual profligacy.\"\n\nSarah said, \"What if there was no brain yet? What if at least 98 percent of induced abortions didn't involve scissors?\"\n\nInteresting. If the killing does not involve specific instruments, and it involves a specific, devalued human at a specifically devalued yet necessary stage of human development, then what if we kill it? This doesn't seem to be an actual argument.\n\n\"I do think there is an important discussion to be had on the value of a zygote. Does the mere fact that it is alive make a zygote equal in importance to a pregnant woman? No.\"\n\nReally? And your moral authority for determining the value of an individual human is what? What are your equations for determining value, and what grounding are they based on? You have asserted a moral principle without any visible reason for anyone to believe it. Is not a human = a human? Why not?\n\n\" So it is the potential to be a human being that gives the zygote value, but is it equal in value to a fully grown human?\"\n\nA zygote does not have the potential to be a human being, it is already a human being which exists at a specific and necessary stage of human development.\n\nInteresting, again. This is the exact argument made by Zeke Emanuel, who famously charted the value of all humans, from birth to 70 + years of age. Under this valuation a 20 year old has the most value, with newborns and elderly having no value to speak of. This is due to the investment of society plus the potential contribution of individuals at each age. Newborns have the least investment/contribution and the elderly have made their contribution so are worth nothing much. Only the productive are valued. Emanuel presumes the moral right to determine such values, and being an advisor to the President, there is the possibility that this valuation of humans will be given credence.\n\nSo your valuation falls right in line; a person is worth only what s/he has consumed or has been invested in by society. You did forget the potential for contribution, but that might be attributable to the fetus as well, so I understand why you did not acknowledge that.\n\nThe question remains, what gives you the right, the moral authority to value other human life? Why are others not vested with the right to devalue your own life based on their own proprietary theories of human valuation? Do you acknowledge that they have the same right to devalue you, as you have to devalue other human life? If not, then why are you specially endowed with that right?\n\n\" I cannot agree to the idea that this fully conscious being, aware, and experienced is of an equal value to an unconscious, unaware, inexperienced zygote.\"\n\nThen all children are in the same boat: unequal in personally chosen characteristics, and therefore fair game. That is the consequence of valuing human life based on personal proclivities.\n\n\"What you tell a woman when you tell her she is not allowed to obtain an abortion is that she is equal in value to a clump of cells.\"\n\nThis is false. What a woman should understand is that she is carrying a human life, at a specific stage of human development, one which every human goes through including herself. Destruction of a human life is a moral choice, not merely a practical, accounting procedure on the value of the human.\n\n\"Some people believe the mother's life is fully realized and that she should choose what to do with it\".\n\nYes they do. People believe all sorts of things, including things which they think benefit themselves regardless of the effect on others. Convenience killing merely equals convenience killing, unless there is an acknowledgement of the moral component. Denial of that is simple, convenient and self-oriented.\n\nStunned said... Deist woman said... \"Due to hormone imbalances, genetic anomalies, and a number of unknown factors, between 50 percent and 75 percent of embryos fail to implant in the uterus and are passed with the monthly menstrual flow.\".\"\n\nYou interpret the zeitgeist of our culture, which devalues the preborn, to carry over into medicine; it does not. Actual advances in actual women's and preborn's health include careful monitoring of the fetus using ultrasound (an evil device according to abortion women's rightists) and other modern techniques, and it also includes advances in in-uterus operations which even fix heart defects, spinal bifida, etc in actual fetuses which are not devalued and not scheduled for destruction. This information is not friendly to the choice to kill crowd.\n\n\"And Stan, listen to yourself:\n\n\"Outside of rape, the woman is complicit in putting it there. Rape abortions are swamped by convenience abortions, where the woman merely refuses to take responsibility.\" ... The objection to carrying a child is purely an assertion of \"no responsibility\" for the pregnancy. It is commonly purely a support for irresponsible sexual profligacy.\"\n\nOK, you think women are irresponsible sluts, we get the message.\"\n\nActually I think you like to call names in order to avoid making any actual argument. Your troll days are shortening.\n\nThe rise in abortions is not due to the life being threatened by the evil fetus: those life/death situations historically were treated in a full service hospital, not an abbatoir; they should be in a hospital, and they frequently wind up in hospitals due to the inability of the aborter to provide actual \"women's healthcare\". The rise in abortions includes many women who have multiple abortions; as many as nine abortions for one woman have been documented. Abortion has become birth control for many. The attitude shown here that a woman can do whatever she wants and any fetus that gets in the way is dead meat certainly supports what I said.\n\nNow; I have reconsidered the use of the term, complicit, and I still use it; IF the fetus is declared an illegitimate presence which limits or abrogates the \"rights\" of a woman, and is declared to be merely an invasive tumor-like clump of cells, not unlike being invaded by bacteria, and IF the woman helped put it there without being forced, THEN she is indeed complicit in its illegitimate presence in her body. That the aborters don't want to hear this in no way affects its truth value.\n\n\"\"A zygote does not have the potential to be a human being, it is already a human being\"\n\nI dare you to look at this picture.\n\nIs this a human being? How can you think a zygote has the same value as a woman? Is picture A a human being? Picture D?\n\n(a) A zygote is a fully differentiated and individuated human at that stage of development. You had to be a zygote at one point in your own life. Your denial is not rational; it is based on the desire to kill it on demand and not to be denied the Right To Kill, ever.\n\n(b) I don't give humans relative values. That is the indicator of elitism, and its presumption of superior rights and power over other people, especially the voiceless and defenseless. It is especially onerous when the rights assumed subsume the rights of voiceless, innocent, defenseless victims, to be killed on the whim of the elitist.\"\n\nYes. You certainly would not want the woman to have information. That information might contradict the false narrative that the fetus is just a blob of invasive tissue. The move to prevent the woman from having any information regarding the actual status of the life inside her is a blatant denial of her right to know the actual truth. You certainly can't allow that. And that move alone, to deny her information upon which to make an informed decision, means that you do, in fact, know that the zygote/pharyngula/embryo/etc. is a living being, which is human, and a specific individuated human at that. If the woman finds that out, she might not abort, and that would be horrible. You don't care about a powerful government, you care about denying the Right To Know.\n\nHere's what is invasive: scissors to the brain; ripping off arms and legs; smashing the skull so that it can be brought out through an undilated opening. How about discussing that, using your amazing power of empathy? No? Why not? Here's why: It doesn't fit with the entire thrust of your personal superior morality which allows you to personally decide who lives and dies. And that's all that it amounts to. It's all about you, not the woman and certainly not the living fetus, zygote or whatever legitimate stage the new life is in. It's all about keeping the Right To Kill. If it were not about that, there might be some evidence of compassion, of empathy for the voiceless victims \u2013 but there is not a shred. The total lack of compassion and empathy is astounding. That's where you should be stunnedS' funny how so many of the folks who support abortion distance themselves from the implications.\n\nThey go to a great deal of effort to deny there is anything special about humans - we're merely animals, with special social skills and really, that's all. This, despite that fact that all you have to do is look around to see this is not so.\n\nIn fact, if it were so, there'd be no point listening to them reduce men to the status of animals, since by their own account, it would no more significant than the barking of the neighbor's dog.\n\nThen they attempt to further reduce the status of men by defining where human life (no special thing) begins and where it is safe to conduct the butcher's art without appearing to be a monster.\n\nOf course, this puts them in a bind. If they have the power to decide what is human and what is not, what standard are they using, and who decides and enforces it?\n\nThe answer is: whoever has the power, and the standard is: whatever is most conducive to keeping that power. The power, in the end, is the thing.\n\nNow their authority is self-granted - these are people who claim a thing is so because... well, because they say so, and if you don't like it you end up in court Or they raise the volume and shout you down, drown you out.\n\nOr they smear you. Or any combination of those. However they do it, you now find yourself with people who will cheerfully authorize the liquidation (or 'removal' or 'excision' or 'abortion') of a human child. In the majority of cases, not because the child is woefully damaged or genetically indisposed to live a 'fulfilling' life, but simply and solely because its life is inconvenient to someone.\n\nBut the ability to kill a kid is not the end game. The point of all this is simple. If an AtheoLeftist - or indeed, anyone is allowed to define 'human' according to principles of convenience, then how long will it be before they decide that folks who disagree with them are equally 'inconvenient'?\n\nThe answer to that is: it's already happened many times in the past. We called such things 'totalitarian dictatorships'.\n\nThe difference is that now, these wonderful, compassionate folks - who are, after all, doing this 'for the greater good' - are attempting to pull it off in a democracy with the eager participation of people who really should know better.\n\nIn times past, they did know better. But we are now discussing folks who have been conditioned over the decades just as thoroughly by television and the general tenor of the mass media as any child passing through the strictest of Catholic schools.\n\nBother the folks who claim evil is just an expression of my personal preference. I can say the same of their statement concerning shades of grey. And while we argue back and forth over cells and Survival of the Fittest, the evil continues to infect.\n\nThere is no question of whether those deciding that the killing of babies is legal in this country will assume the power to decide the status of adult humans. It's a question of 'when'. Some say it's happening now.\n\nAnd the ultimate irony, as far as I can see, is two-pronged. First, all the rabid ravings of lunatics that the AtheoLeft ascribe to Theists - are ones they themselves exhibit.\n\nAnd second, the practice of killing children is, in more than one sense of the word, just another example of egoists cutting off the branch on which they sit. If they succeed, they destroy the society that tolerates them and leave only the societies that will not tolerate their kind.\n\nI can't even speak I'm so damn mad. It's just one more step in the march towards DEATH CAMPS. the DEATH FACTORYS ARE ALREADY HERE. NAzis. It's game over. THIS IS THE END. You you tell people about how Obabma is buying the tanks a nd the bullets and they know you are RIGHT but they don't even do anything. They don't even share on FACE BOOK. They could help get the message out but they can't even push the share button, morons. And these sick people (if you can call them that) that post about fetuss and zygoats WRONG it's a baby you brain dead moronic murder fucks. Femanazi baby killers whining about the government law about shoving the vagina probe are wrong thinking. They ALREADY spread their legs why should they care about one more time? The kind of people (if you can call them that) that get abortions don't care about what they shove up their dirty vaginas so why is one more thing so bad. Boo hoo. Should have thought about that before. Nothing but a good thing. Even if it doesn't make them think at least it costs them money. The liberal media tells them that these women they should have control of their bodies but they don't tell them there is ANTOHER PERSON inside. An inocent person unlike the woman. THEY DON\"T TELL YOU THAT. and they try and silence us. They yell over us. They yell we are wrong WHEN WE ARE RIGHT AND THEY KNOW WE ARE RIGHT. I WILL NOT STOP YELLING. I'll share your page so they know about the TRUTH. I'm glad I live out nowhere where there is no planned parenthood and people are real people. This is the real AMERICA not some OBAMA nonsense. Why can't they see how evil they are?\n\nRaging, Please take breath and calm yourself. Let's keep the conversation under control, OK? The point of this blog is to take the positions of the Atheist and AtheoLeft, and subject them to cold pure logic. The analysis which results is sufficient to defeat every and all elitist arguments which they present, on virtually every subject which comes up.\n\nThe subject of killing is an emotional one. But it will not be defeated with counter emotion - not on-line anyway.\n\nYes they are wrong. Yes they substitute anti-morality for morality. But we can convince the seekers with cool, dispassionate reason, because that is on our side.\n\nThe arguments they make are in general phony appeals to the several emotions (\"how could you think this lump of cells could be human?), while ignoring and dodging the counter arguments, which they never address - because they can't, unless think they can niggle at some minute detail as if disproving that detail would allow them the Right To Kill.\n\nWhat is done here on this blog does little except to showcase the irrationality of the AtheoLeft. And that is the point: they are maximally irrational and maximally emotional and maximally self/ego driven.\n\nI, for one, think humans are very special animals. I have no dispute with the idea that human life begins at conception, but I dispute that personhood does. Not just in a legal sense, but in a philosophical sense too. In my opinion, a brainless heartless zygote is alive, but not yet a person.\n\nNow I shall brace myself for another argumentum ad Hitlerum regarding Orwellian unpersons.\n\n@Stan\n\nThere are \"AtheoLeft\" people who are \"pro-life\" activists, like Kristine Kruszelnicki ( Unlike certain organized religions, atheism has no position on abortion handed down by any central authority.\n\nBy all means, try to find defeaters for pro-choice arguments. Just don't confuse that with arguing against atheism.\n\nRobin, Make an actual argument. I remember why you were banned originally.\n\nYour childish Tu Quoque is an attempt to ignore what I said: search the above comment for the word \"legitimate\"; that is the issue which you missed entirely: you want the right to delegitimize humans by placing arbitrary definitions of their legitmacy such as \"personhood\", a legitimacy which you think you can deny to them and therefore open their lives to being killed. It's the same thing as denying that they exist as living humans at a legitimate stage of human development, one which every human including you goes through.\n\nAnswer these for starters: What gives you the moral authority to declare that another human at any stage of human life or development is not a person?\n\nWhy are you a person? Why are you not subject to a third party declaration that you actually don't qualify as a person, and are therefore categorized as qualifying for killing at the convenience of the third party?\n\nThese are the issues that are raaised by the Right To Devalue and Right To Kill advocates. So defend them.\n\nYou will be the first. No other Right To Kill advocate has the stones to address these fundamentals\n\nRobin, Denial of a fallacy is exactly in keeping with Atheist denialism. Your Tu Quoque is obvious and blatant.\n\nYour denial of legitimacy is a definitional issue, one which you wish to control in order to preserve your elitist Right To Kill those whom you declare illegitimate by definition. What you have declared is a phony tautology, where you declare something is true merely because it is true in your mind (anyone can declare anyone else to be illegitimate by declaring them never to have been legitimate). That is a logical fallacy; a reason for illegitimacy must be given. You probably know that and don't actually care. Your position is indicative of your level of empathy for others who are voiceless, defenseless and innocent. And the condemnation to death is without any jury trial, judicial conviction or even accusation of malfeasance. It is causing death by merely choosing to kill. It is purely a convenience killing in almost all cases. The remaining cases should be cared for in hospitals.\n\nDeath caused by merely choosing to kill. (you will not address this of course).\n\nAt least you are honest about not needing moral authority when you decide these things. You just know that you have the Right To Devalue and the Right To Kill.\n\nThat's why Atheists are dangerous and can't be trusted. Their self-endowed superiority gives them \"rights\" which do not exist in civil societies which respect human life, positive character traits, and the concept of humility in the face of deductive reasoning and the conclusions it derives.\n\n. I predict this, because it is what got you removed in the first place. (continued)\n\n(from above) You have quoted Charles Taylor before. He has no reason other than his personal opinion and self-endowed elitism to declare what the qualities of a person are; he certainly has no authority to deny personhood to anyone, and neither do you. That's the reason for the question: your answer shows that you think you can choose whatever is convenient to yourself to use to value yourself (And AtheoLeftists think quite highly of themselves, both morally and intellectually); you then devalue others which are at the stage of development through which you, yourself had to survive, but which you now devalue, now that the devaluation does not endanger you, yourself.\n\nAtheoLeftism is nothing if not cowardly, both in who it attacks and in what issues it runs away from.\n\nFurther, your use of the term \"biological facts\" indicates two things: (a) the concept of personhood is not subject to biology, and humanity is definitely confirmed by biology, and (b) you fail to understand the basics of science: science does not produce facts, ever; science produces contingent information regarding physical subjects, only. Science never produces moral values, such as personhood, or the lack of value of certain humans.\n\nThe issue of whether your own personhood can be questioned and devalued shows your noncomprehension of your own worldview: your personhood has already been questioned by the Obama healthcare AtheoLeftist advisors and you do not qualify for 100% personhood, unless you are precisely 20 years old. I.\n\n. The AtheoLeft is completely self-unaware Robin, You are really pushing the limit again. You refuse to acknowledge your fallacies and yet you're arrogant in doing so. But in case you really don't know:\n\n\"Ah yes. The \"personhood\" dodge\".\n\nAh, yes. The crying \"dodge\" dodge.\"\n\nAnd then there is this nonsense:\n\n\" 'That is a logical fallacy; a reason for illegitimacy must be given.'\n\nNo, you charged me with delegitimization, and I rejected your implicit claim of legitimacy. So to back up your charge, a reason for legitimacy must be given. The burden is yours.\"\n\nStandard Atheist avoidance of intellectual responsibility. You reject without a reason for rejecting.You provide nothing but arrogant snark and avoidance.\n\n\"Clearly you don't know me very well at all.\"\n\nI know that you are a juvenile at whatever stage you are in.\n\n\"You would have us hold a trial for an egg, before a jury of its peers?\"\n\nPure juvenile snark: waste of adult time.\n\n\"\"The remaining cases should be cared for in hospitals.\"\n\nMore cost-effective to just stick the unwanted zygotes in a freezer, then thaw 'em out when a suitable candidate for implantation comes along.\"\n\nI was talking about life threatening situations for the mother... sheesh.\n\n\"Humans choose to kill a lot of living things we consider beneath us.\n\nAnd this is both maximally arrogant and maximally revealing of your devaluation of living humans at necessary stages of human development and your lack of empathy for the deaths of those humans.\n\nIt shows the complete lack of positive personal character, replaced by narcissism, and it demonstrates the lack of intellectual capability which got you thrown off here before. You have demonstrated that you are a complete waste of time. And it demonstrates fully this concept which I repeat:\n\n\"\"That's why Atheists are dangerous and can't be trusted. Their self-endowed superiority gives them \"rights\" which do not exist in civil societies...\"\n\nMy positions on abortion do not derive from atheism, which has nothing to say on the issue, but largely from my feminism\"I predict this, because it is what got you removed in the first place.\"\n\n\"?.\n\n---- Stan:.\n\nStandard.\n\nI.\n\nI know that you are a juvenile at whatever stage you are in.\n\nOh, be civil, Stan.\n\nPure juvenile snark: waste of adult time.\n\nOh, be civil, Stan. You decried eggs being condemned to death without a jury trial, I just took your statement to its absurd conclusion.\n\nI was talking about life threatening situations for the mother... sheesh.\n\nThat makes more sense. Do you support abortions to save a mother's life, then?\n\nAnd this is both maximally arrogant and maximally revealing of your devaluation of living humans at necessary stages of human development and your lack of empathy for the deaths of those humans.\n\nBecause I empathize only with sentient beings.\n\nIt shows the complete lack of positive personal character, replaced by narcissism, and it demonstrates the lack of intellectual capability which got you thrown off here before. You have demonstrated that you are a complete waste of time.\n\nJainists have no bearing on the Atheist war on fetuses. And your superiority is precisely demonstrated in your term, above, \"beneath us\". Fetuses are \"beneath you\" and you are superior to them.\n\n\"My positions on abortion do not derive from atheism, which has nothing to say on the issue, but largely from my feminism.\n\nYour entire worldview derives from the Atheist VOID, a rejection of all objective truths, which allows you to create your own truths out of thin air, and without any objective logic. Whatever ensues from the VOID is purely subjective and without any overweaning truth valueCertainly by pointing out your inevitable, necessary thought processing, you would consider that to be poison.\n\nI predict this, because it is what got you removed in the first place.\"\n\nNo, you removed me in the first place because I offered a proof by contradiction for the \"claim\" (your word) that \"That which can be asserted without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence.\"\n\nI'm not going to an absurd blog to deal with you. Make your case here. And that statement by Hitchens is demonstrably absurd, since it is made without evidence thereby making it dismissable without evidence: it is non-coherent.\n\n\"He has no reason other than his personal opinion and self-endowed elitism to declare what the qualities of a person are;\"\n\nOr maybe because he was a philosopher doing philosophy. You should read \"The Concept of a Person\" before you make uninformed judgments about it.\n\nAnd what is philosophy if it is not personal opinion by a self-endowed elitist? Under what moral authority does he declare the devaluation of other humans? Under what moral authority can he deny my devaluation of him? It is ALL opinion in the Atheist world, because there is no objective truth. (more below)\n\nThe following indicates the waste of time which is involved with dealing with you:\n\n\" \"your answer shows that you think you can choose whatever is convenient to yourself to use to value yourself\"\n\nWrong.\n\n\"you then devalue others which are at the stage of development through which you, yourself had to survive, but which you now devalue, now that the devaluation does not endanger you, yourself\"\n\nThat was a stage before I had a self to endanger.\n\n\"AtheoLeftism is nothing if not cowardly, both in who it attacks and in what issues it runs away from.\"\n\nMore insults.\n\n\"your use of the term \"biological facts\" indicates... you fail to understand the basics of science: science does not produce facts, ever\"\n\nNo, it doesn't. \"biological\" means \"relating to biology\", not \"produced by bioscience\".\n\nFirst, \"wrong\" is not an answer, not an argument, not even a position. If you have a counter argument then make it.\n\nSecond, your claim not to have had a self is absurd: your concept of self is a subjective creation of your own, upon which you make your subjective moral decision. If you had been aborted, you would have no self now, either, having denied yourself that opportunity.\n\nThird, your redefinition is just silly, an attempt to define your way out of an argument.\n\n\" \".\"\n\nYour first inclination is correct: You have no idea what I'm talking about. (more below)\n\n\" \"?\"\n\nIs that your counter argument? That's all you have? Not polite?\n\n\" \".\"\n\nAnd again, is that your counter argument? That's all you have?.\"\n\nFalse. You committed a blatant Tu Quoque \"you too\" fallacy, and fail to take responsibility for it. The pointer I made to your fallacy is not a fallacy! But you want it to be the answer to the question. You want your concept of \"personhood\" to be the dodge which allows you to make your devaluation of other humans which don't qualify. \"Personhood\" definitions have been the dodge used by morally self-endowed eugenicists for the past 150 years. You'll have to deny history in order to deny that.\n\n\" Standard.\"\n\nFalse. \"Baseless\" is not a counter argument; it is a meaningless label. Logic: If you claim [!X], then you must provide reasons for [!X]. \"Baseless\" is another dodge to get around giving actual deductive reasoning, much less empirical data for rejecting a claim. The Atheist commonly labels or redefines rather than directly addresses issues head-on.\n\nFurther, let's address your label, \"baseless\": What are your conditions for being \"based\"? If you had any, you would have delineated them and indicated exactly how the proposition failed your conditions for being \"based\". But \"baseless\" is highly likely not to have a counterpoint of \"based\". The reason is that it is just an excuse for rejection, out of hand, without assuming the intellectual responsibility for actual deductive or empirical refutation. I.e., it is intellectually irresponsible. (more below)\n\n\".\"\n\nAnd you assume the Right to determine who you choose to be people: standard eugenics, based on self-endowed moral authority which allows the killing of those unfortunate enough to be labeled non-people, or non-persons.\n\n\" I was talking about life threatening situations for the mother... sheesh.\n\nThat makes more sense. Do you support abortions to save a mother's life, then?\"\n\nI support the effort to save both mother and child, an effort not made in abortion abattoirs, but in hospitals. So no, I do not support the off-hand murder of an unborn child to save the mother.\n\n\" It shows the complete lack of positive personal character, replaced by narcissism, and it demonstrates the lack of intellectual capability which got you thrown off here before. You have demonstrated that you are a complete waste of time.\n\n\"That's why Atheists are dangerous and can't be trusted.\"\n\nInspire me more with your \"positive personal character\".~\n\nAnother dodge; if you have a counter argument make that. I submit that (a) you think that you can determine who is and who is not a person, and that (b) those who are not persons may be killed. This is obvious from your outright statements of such, above. These are the attitudes of eugenicism, and its consequence is wholesale death of those who are declared non-persons. You take this to be a position of Feminism, a concept which is derived after the eradication of objective principles in the VOID of Atheism, and is a consequence of Atheist subjective moral concepts.\n\nFurther, the subjectivity of moral conceptualization which occurs as a consequence of the Atheist VOID renders Atheists dangerous, especially those like yourself who have self-endowed with a false moral authority to determine which humans can be killed, merely by creating definitions.\n\nI POSITIVELY deny that you have the right, the moral authority, the intellectual case to define away another human's right to life.\n\nI POSITIVELY assert that eugenics, and your eugenic position specifically, is dangerous to other humans.\n\nI POSITIVELY assert that your position is emotional, and not rational. If it were rational, you would have a deductive case that did not involve the specious definition of \"personhood\", it would not address the false issue of \"human value differentials\", and it would treat all humans with equal respect for their existence.\n\nAnd finally, Robin: \"And this is both maximally arrogant and maximally revealing of your devaluation of living humans at necessary stages of human development and your lack of empathy for the deaths of those humans.\"\n\nBecause I empathize only with sentient beings.\"\n\nThis is possibly the most revealing statement that an Atheist has made on this subject to my knowledge. Of course empathy is limited. Of course categorization is primary. Of course the category is arbitrary.\n\nAnd of course you are able to re-classify those who receive your empathy upon your morally authorized whim, whenever it suits you.\n\n\"Your entire worldview derives from the Atheist VOID, a rejection of all objective truths, which allows you to create your own truths out of thin air, and without any objective logic.\"\n\nLike you just created that one out of thin air? I've told you on multipleoccasions that I believe in absolute truth. Real truth is objective.\n\n\"I'm not going to an absurd blog to deal with you. Make your case here.\"\n\nThat was a link to another article here on your blog.\n\n\"And that statement by Hitchens is demonstrably absurd, since it is made without evidence thereby making it dismissable without evidence: it is non-coherent.\"\n\nThen by dismissing his statement without evidence, you prove him right.\n\n\"And what is philosophy if it is not personal opinion by a self-endowed elitist?\"\n\nIn Wikipedia's words, \"Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems, such as those connected with reality, existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language.\"\n\n\"Under what moral authority does he declare the devaluation of other humans?\"\n\nHe didn't. Perhaps some more context would help:\n\n\"A person is a being with a certain moral status, or a bearer of rights. But underlying the moral status, as its condition, are certain capacities. A person is a being who has a sense of self, has a notion of the future and the past, can hold values, make choices; in short, can adopt life-plans. At least, a person must be the kind of being who is in principle capable of all this, however damaged these capacities may be in practice.\n\nRunning through all this we can identify a necessary (but not sufficient) condition. A person must be a being with his own point of view on things. The life-plan, the choices, the sense of self must be attributable to him as in some sense their point of origin. A person is a being who can be addressed, and who can reply.\"\n\n\"It is ALL opinion in the Atheist world, because there is no objective truth.\"\n\nI disagree, there is objective truth.\n\n\"your answer shows that you think you can choose whatever is convenient to yourself to use to value yourself\"\n\n\"Wrong.\"\n\n\"First, \"wrong\" is not an answer, not an argument, not even a position.

Do you never kill non-persons?\n\n\"These are the attitudes of eugenicism, and its consequence is wholesale death of those who are declared non-persons.\"\n\nThe Nazis certainly gave eugenics a bad name, but liberal eugenicists somehow manage to avoid being racist mass murderers.\n\n\"You take this to be a position of Feminism, a concept which is derived after the eradication of objective principles in the VOID of Atheism, and is a consequence of Atheist subjective moral concepts.\"\n\nSupporting equal rights for women does not derive from atheism per se, although rejecting patriarchal religion might lead one to reject religious tenets of male supremacy.\n\n\"I POSITIVELY deny that you have the right, the moral authority, the intellectual case to define away another human's right to life.\"\n\nI understand your position, but I disagree with your premises.\n\n\"I POSITIVELY assert that eugenics, and your eugenic position specifically, is dangerous to other humans.\"\n\nI didn't take a position on eugenics.

And seems to me the one getting emotional here is you.\n\nRobin, You don't really make any arguments here, so I'll address just a few of your statements.\n\n\"Then by dismissing his statement without evidence, you prove him right.\"\n\nOf course, that is an absurd conclusion: the statement is dismissed based on its demonstrable non-coherence. If you don't accept that as evidence then you are rejecting the principles of logic.\n\n\"In Wikipedia's words, \"Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems, such as those connected with reality, existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language.\"\"\n\nAnd unless those are \"studied\" empirically, then they are all merely opinions of subjective observations processed through subjective interpretations. Which is why the first thing that a \"philosopher\" does is to \"refute\" the subjective findings of some important prior philosopher, using his own subjective interpretation.\n\n\"A person must be a being with \u2026\"\n\nWho gives him the Right to declare the moral \"must\"?

The issue is precisely whether you have the Right to terminate the life of ANY class of humans based on their class. Especially those humans who cannot defend themselves. Your presumption of that Right is generated purely by yourself. However, that presumption is Classist, sexist, intolerant, elitist, arrogant and \u2013 due to the way in which it is implemented \u2013 racist.\n\nHypocritical poisoning the well noted. I did address the issue head-on, and rather than give a substantive response, you falsely charge me with dodging it.\"\n\nYou cannot claim \"baseless\" and that you addressed something \"head on\" without internal contradiction. You never defend your presumed RIGHT to declare another human to be not a person. Here is what you said:\n\n\"\".\"\n\nSo you claim the following: 1. Some category of humans is not legitimate. 2. The category actually are legitimate humans (biological facts). 3. No moral authority is necessary to declare the legitimate humans in the illegitimate categories in (1) to be killable.\n\nI think that sums up all that needs to be said. Except that on top of that you refuse to accept fallacies when they are pointed to. Your position is internally contradictory, irrational and there is no need to continue this conversation.\n\n\"Give an example of an objective moral truth which Atheists\u2026 all Atheists\u2026 agree to be the case.\"\n\nRather like asking: Give an example of an objective moral truth which Americans... all Americans... agree to be the case.\n\n\"No, I don't think that.\"\n\n\"This is still an empty claim, without giving any reason to think otherwise.\"\n\nIf you refuse to believe what I am saying my position is, and what I am saying it is not, then we cannot have a productive conversation.

Maybe you should take responsibility for your habit of inventing imaginary tu quoques.\n\n\"?\n\n\"you want the right to delegitimize humans by placing arbitrary definitions of their legitmacy such as \"personhood\"\"\n\n\"So you claim the following: 1. Some category of humans is not legitimate.\"\n\nWhich I interpret to mean \"Some category of humans are not people.\" Yes, in my opinion, brainless zygotes and brain-dead vegetables are human but not people.\n\n\"2. The category actually are legitimate humans (biological facts).\"\n\nMeaning \"The category of humans who are not people are still biologically human.\" Yes Yes, I need not be a moral authority to express my opinion that abortion and euthanasia are not morally wrong.\n\n\"Except that on top of that you refuse to accept fallacies when they are pointed to.\"\n\nNo, you refuse to accept refutations of your false fallacies.\n\n\"Your position is internally contradictory, irrational and there is no need to continue this conversation.\"\n\n.\"\n\nRobin, that is absolutely absurd. For you to claim that Hitchens did NOT mean \"deeming it false\" is ridiculous on its face. But even if the word \"dismissed\" means something like \"ignored due to lack of content\", then the statement still is self-contradictory:\n\n\"What can be asserted without evidence can also be ignored [due to lack of content] without evidence\"\n\nFirst there are no premises: this is an asserted conclusion without any premises for support; it is not an argument; it is an opinion. In no conceivable manner is it \"logical\" as you claim.\n\nSecond, it asserts the absolute necessity of EVIDENCE; yet it presents absolutely no evidence for the truth of itself as a True statement. It has no logical Truth value. It is self-refuting and therefore is in no conceivable manner is it \"coherent\" as you claim. Nor is any self-refuting statement \"consistent\"; in no conceivable manner is it \"consistent\" as you claim.\n\nIn fact your claim that the statement is \"logical, coherent, and consistent\" is presented without any evidence for support; it is an empty (not to mention false) assertion, which is certainly \"dismissable\" under the claim being made. Your very own claim is self-refuting on top of being demonstrated, evidentially, to be false.\n\nThird, your claim that a (presumption of) failure to prove a logical point \"proves\" the opposite point is an indication that you have no interest in actual logic, and you are here for the \"win\" at any cost. That is ideological and irrational.\n\nI have explained this, with reasoning based on actual logical principles as evidence, for the last time.\n\n\" \"Give an example of an objective moral truth which Atheists\u2026 all Atheists\u2026 agree to be the case.\"\n\nRather like asking: Give an example of an objective moral truth which Americans... all Americans... agree to be the case.\"\n\nYou dodge having to give your personal thought of what is objective truth with the absurd false analog above.\n\nVery, very few Atheists actually believe in objective truth, ever since Nietzsche \"disproved\" it over a century ago. So if you claim that there is objective truth, why don't Atheists as a group share your insight?\n\nMore to the point, why won't you tumble to what your insight actually is?\n\n\" If you refuse to believe what I am saying my position is, and what I am saying it is not, then we cannot have a productive conversation. You'll keep on arguing against straw men, and never actually engage my real position.\"\n\nYour position is clear. And it is clearly eugenic. Further it is an arrogation of moral authority over the lives and ability to live of other living human beings, yet it is based merely on your opinion of \"who is defined as an actual person\".\n\nYou do not want to discuss the actual issue, which is the eugenics which underlie your personal philosophy, so you term that issue a \"Straw Man\" in order to completely avoid addressing it.\n\nYou want to address ONLY the mechanism of categorizing humans into groups that are killable.\n\nYou cannot steer away from the completely amoral basis for your thought process.\n\n\" \"?\"\n\nYou have again used Tu Quoque as an avoidance tool. This is in no way about me. You have no idea what I believe specifically because this is not about me, it is about you and Atheists in general.\n\nThat said, and fallacy illustrated, soldiers are killed in battle due to self-defense, both of a country, and in the field, of individual defenders. War is a regression into pre-civilized existence for the duration of the battle. Even so, there is no concept of killing any soldier for mere convenience, as is the case in abortion: eugenics is not a part of self-defense.\n\nCapital punishment is rationalized as a valid consequence for bad deeds done, but that rationalization is falling apart these days; there is no valid logic for capital punishment that I know of: it is a moral position and is debatable as such. Further, there is no killing of any or all murderers for the mere convenience of someone else, as is the case in abortion. Eugenics is not a part of capital punishment.\n\nThe subject is eugenics and its moral presuppositions. That includes abortion.\n\nMeaning \"The category of humans who are not people are still biologically human.\"\n\nYes\n\nYes, I need not be a moral authority to express my opinion that abortion and euthanasia are not morally wrong.\"\n\nThen your opinion is a moral statement, for which you presume the moral authority to make as a moral position regarding the value of certain categories of human which you opine to be devalued and killable. Denying that you have presumed the authority to make a moral proclamation is irrational.\n\n\" YouYes. You have assumed the Right to assign non-personhood for categories of living humans. After assuming this moral authority, logic can be applied to humanity to decide who falls into the killable category. That is exactly how eugenics works. The valuation of humans is based on personal opinion which is deemed to be thoroughly logical, but only AFTER having presumed the moral authority to choose categories of humans to kill. The logic of eugenics is ineffable because it is a moral position, not a rational position; the personal assumption of moral authority to kill other living humans has no rational content. Only the choosing of those for death has any logic, and that logic is completely Consequentialist tactic: totally amoral.\n\nThe only difference between your eugenic theory and any other is in the details of who has value vs who does not and can be killed. It's all the same philosophy; only the minutia differs slightly.\n\nRobin, \"Let's be perfectly clear: It doesn't matter how you define personhood for others. Here's what matters: You have no RIGHT to define personhood as a tool to kill. How you define personhood is absolutely immaterial.\n\nThat you deny that you have self-endowed with moral authority to make moral decisions for others means one of two things: either (a) you do not comprehend your own actions, or (b) you wish to deny the obvious.\n\n.\n\nWhich would imply that for the 40 years you say you were an atheist, the VOID was your ideology.\n\nNo, atheists share no ideology. There is no belief all atheists have in common, including \"rejectionism\", whatever that means.\".\n\n\"Your position is clear. And it is clearly eugenic.\"\n\nNo, breeding better humans was not part of my position.\n\n\"\"You have again used Tu Quoque as an avoidance tool.\"\n\nThrowing around bogus tu quoques willy-nilly just makes you seem ignorant of logic.\n\n\".\n\n\"Denying that you have presumed the authority to make a moral proclamation is irrational.\"\n\nNo, just accurate. Funny how you can quote me saying I don't need moral authority, then accuse me of presuming to have it.\n\n\"After assuming this moral authority, logic can be applied to humanity to decide who falls into the killable category. That is exactly how eugenics works.\"\n\n\"Eugenics\" doesn't mean what you seem to think it means.\n\n\"You have no RIGHT to define personhood as a tool to kill.\"\n\nDefinitions don't kill people.

Your attempt again to say \"you too\" has no bearing on the truth value of the statement. You cannot argue logically by using the same fallacy over and over and over, and denying it over and over and over. Your statement has no value.\n\n\"No, atheists share no ideology. There is no belief all atheists have in common, including \"rejectionism\", whatever that means.\"\n\nAbsolute BS. The Atheist VOID leads to high degree commonality of belief due to the personal elitism and self-endowed moral authority which naturally results. Your denial of this is meaningless, because this is empirical. The number of Atheists who are willing to humble themselves before the discipline of logic is vanishingly small, as is the number of Atheists who refuse to decide their own moral principles. (continued).\"\n\nBecause you have not said what \"reality\" means in your interpretation of the universe and its origin, you have not answered the question. One is entitled to suspect that you mean to reference an entirely material existence. Further, a common use of the word \"objectively\" is to mean \"referring to objects and knowledge about physical existence\". I have no idea what it means to you, but the two concepts of \"reality\" and \"objectivity\" being material-only is common to AtheistsBecause of your attitude which indicates that you know with absolute assurance that you are correct without any contrary input, you are apparently ignorant of the intelligent arguments made by the great Atheist philosophers. This attitude also leads you to ignore disciplined logic comprehension and rather to seem to believe that whatever your mind produces is logic. This is delusional.\n\n\"\".\"\n\n\"\".\"\n\nKilling devaluated defectives which are defined by yourself is your position. Designating categories for eradication is eugenic; it is negative eugenicsYet another Tu Quoque. You cannot dodge responsibility for your position by attempting to say \"you too\" regarding my position, and presenting a false analogy in order to do it. The comparison is false. You categorize entire populations of living humans bearing certain characteristics as killable without cause other than whim. There is no categorization of soldiers to be killable without cause; there is no program to kill the entire category of murderers without cause. Further, war is descent into necessary uncivilized self-defense; executions are punishment for guilt which are individually determined.\n\nEugenic killing is by class or category, which is subjectively determined as a moral premise by those who self-endow with the moral authority to determine death for other living humans.\n\n\"\"You have again used Tu Quoque as an avoidance tool.\"\n\nThrowing around bogus tu quoques willy-nilly just makes you seem ignorant of logic.\"\n\nYour charge of ignorance is False; your charge of bogus Tu Quoques has been demonstrated to be False over and over and over, and you deny that over and over and over, without any rational rebuttal to the demonstrations given to you. Your position is merely obstinate and obstructionist.\n\n\"\".\"\n\nI have demonstrated above that you did indeed take the precise position which you denied taking: your charge has been falsified again and again and again. Your position is merely obstinate and obstructionist.\n\n\"\"Denying that you have presumed the authority to make a moral proclamation is irrational.\"\n\nNo, just accurate. Funny how you can quote me saying I don't need moral authority, then accuse me of presuming to have it.\"\n\nYou cannot rationally deny the obvious: IF [you make a moral position for the fate of other humans], THEN [you have assumed the moral authority to do so]. QED.\n\nDenial of that is merely a position of obstinacy and obstructionism. (continued)\n\n\"After assuming this moral authority, logic can be applied to humanity to decide who falls into the killable category. That is exactly how eugenics works.\"\n\n\"Eugenics\" doesn't mean what you seem to think it means.\"\n\nTempered discussions of eugenics in history include the \" Nazi atrocities based on eugenic ideas\" and \"forced abortions and sterilizations, late term aborted babies \u2026\" in China. In the USA abortions have been overly focused on blacks, with the number of black abortions plus natural deaths outstripping the black birth rate so that the black population has been decreasing numerically as well as in percentage; Planned Parenthood and its abortion slaughter facilities derived directly from Margaret Sanger (\"the Negro Project\").\n\nYou cannot redefine words to make them congenial to your image projection.\n\n\"You have no RIGHT to define personhood as a tool to kill.\"\n\nDefinitions don't kill people. People kill people. (And non-people.)\"\n\nTo deny that giving the moral permission to kill, moral authorization to kill, is instrumental in killing living humans is obtuse. You continue to deny that your position of authorization to kill certain categories of living humans is moral; now you deny that it is even instrumental.

Your question is an implicit denial of your own position.

{"text": "I was watching The Family Guy the other night and Peter Griffin had a stroke and was cured by stem cell therapy, I am also reading Michael Crichton's book \"Next\" a story about stem cell research and gene augmentation. The question I seem to have is what is wrong with stem cell research? If it's legal to have an abortion and those fetus's are used to further mans knowledge and advance medicine how is this wrong? They are not killing babies they are using aborted fetal tissue, I'm sure that there are some who have strong opinions on this so show me the errors of my ways.\n\nAll I can think is if I had alzheimers or was a victim of stroke how grateful I would be for this type of cure.\n\nMozzes\n\n06-05-2008, 06:42 AM\n\nBasically the people who wield legislative and executive powers in America don't understand dick about science. Oh, and they're afraid embryonic stem cell research will be used to pursue human cloning. So, preventative legislation, I guess? A huge crock of shit as far as I'm concerned.\n\nMainly our politicians are just idiots and don't realize they're only causing us to fall behind the rest of the international community in biological research because, you know, if it's illegal in America surely everybody else is going to follow our lead. :rolleyes:\n\nthod\n\n06-05-2008, 06:56 AM\n\nYou dont even have to extract them from a fetus. You can get them from used umbilical cords too. Its got nothing to do with research ofc its all about religion.\n\nIt doesn't matter one way or the other if the US bans it. The same research is going on in other countries and they will build the companies to exploit any breakthroughs.\n\nThere was that recent stuff with them putting a human skin cell nucleus into cows eggs to create hybrid embryos. Got all the way to parliament here in the UK, and the Catholic objectors lost the vote. There are millions of cow eggs from meat cows and scraping some skin cells has no cost. Its not like these things are going to be implanted, they just want to make some stem cells to test the theories, not to make a product.\n\nthegnat\n\n06-05-2008, 07:54 AM\n\nWhen I researched stem cell research, I found quite an interesting fact that seems to take the ethics out of it. They use embryos left over from in-vitro fertilization (That would have been eventually thrown out and they're frozen now). I say if embryonic stem cell research is unethical, then so is in-vitro fertilization. And if in-vitro fertilization is ethical, then so is embryonic stem cell research.\n\nAlso, now they can make stem cells out of adult skin cells - and the pluripotent (being able to change into anything) kind -which was why embryos were so great. The other cells weren't able to be developed that way yet. I hope that soon restrictions will be lifted.\n\nAronnax\n\n06-05-2008, 08:14 AM\n\nThe opponents are afraid if a useful application is found for embryonic stem cells that they'll have to be sourced from humans en mass. They relate that to large scale abortions, even though there are a variety of ways to source stem cells that don't involve abortions.\n\nIn other words \"I don't understand it, it frightens me and someone told me it's unethical so I'm against it.\"\n\nnotoppings\n\n06-05-2008, 09:08 AM\n\nThe three post prior to this just go to show that this group of people (mostly) are some of the most enlightened individuals and informed on the latest science and research.

As Arronax said, \"It's better to figure out a way to grow them out of somatic cells instead of fetal stem cells because it's easier to harvest somatic cells.\"\n\nScientists like doing things as easily as possible. Using stem cells from fetuses isn't that option.

I attempted to parse it into English\n\nSo, believing that it is immoral to use aborted children is trying to keep science from advancing in your view then?\nDo you believe it is immoral to use a dead fetus to advance science?\n\nSure,not killing children, Catholic control over Europe suppressing growth. Same thing. Riiiight\nNot sure at all about what this means.\n\nazelismia I thought you just said you didn't think that but then you agreed. Which is it?\nazelismia, You have made two contradictory statements, please state which one is your true position.\n\nI'm sorry but I just think that's kind a twisted world view. You want to suppress science by not letting us harvest dead babies. Their being killed anyway, why not use them? Whatever.\nI believe that the existence of something does not imply usage rights over that thing.\n\nAnd as far as what the big deal is, most of Christians don't want abortion to be legal.\nI believe that having a use for the product of abortion will encourage abortion, to which I am opposed.\n\nThe last thing we want to do is make abortion even more profitable (Planned Parenthood had a record setting year last year with $700 million in revenue - although, technicall revenue from clinics decreased).\nI believe that finding a use for something will lead to the development of a commercial market for that thing.\n\nhauteur\n\n06-06-2008, 08:16 AMAronnax\n\n06-06-2008, 08:30 AMMany of the people who are opposed to stem cell research believe that stem cell research is bad, regardless of how it's done. You may not oppose research performed with umbilical cord blood or modified somatic cells but that doesn't mean large portions of pro-life lobbiests agree with you.

The cells will die anyhow if you leave them in a dead fetus. If you have a supply of such things you may as well extract, its already dead. Whats wrong with cutting up a dead body for medical research, it happens all the time. No women thinks, \"I will get pregnant then abort so they can pursue stem cell research\".\n\nHuman beings are formed the instant sperm and an egg are combined, not in 3 weeks where glob of cells \"magically\" turn into a human being.\n\nSo what about hollowed out cow eggs with a skin cell pushed in. There is no sperm and egg contact.\n\nAbortion is wrong. Embryonic stem cell research is wrong.\n\nNah, abortion was a great advancement for humanity. Take this to the abortion thread, not here.\n\nIf you think you're so self important that other human beings should die to regenerate your (liver / heart / neurons), then you would not be able to understand this anyway.\n\nNobody is dieing.

Christians do (as a collective body) tend to be resistant to science. Today it is stem cells, before that it was organ transplants. Many extremely fundamentalist Christian even think psychology is wrong.\n\nBut the important point for you to remember is that not all Christians think this way. The far right wing and the far left wing have one very important thing in common - they are a both minorities that make a whole lot of noise.

I saw him suffer every day for years when I took him for walks knowing how the cancer would eventually get the best of him and there was not a damn thing we could do about it, how sometimes his paws would drag how he would stumble, how he every few months he would yelp in pain and become rigid but there was nothing we could do for him.

How is the definition of \"special care\" in the form of controlled environment with a nutrient bath much different than a controlled environment with a nutrient bath and a half set of chromosomes?

They are of human origin but it's like calling my Liver a human at this stage of development. You're saving an already existing life, or saving it from suffering if not death.How bad has your life been? we're you neglected? hit? Sexually abused? Have you had to go in for blood tranfusions every few days? do you bruise if someone touches you? Have you ever gone hungry?\n\nit's neglectful to bring a life into this world that can't be cared for properly. you seem to miss the point that\n\nPOTENTIAL IS NOT THE SAME AS REALITY. just because something has potential does not make it a viable life. It's a seed still. It's no different than any of the sperm and eggs in a bank. if they are there and can be combined to make a fetus then it's just as much of a crime to let them go to waste as it is to put them together and then let them not develop.\n\nis it not?how can you kill something that cannot support it's own life. at moment of conception there is no heart or lungs or brain formed. it's just a mass of cells. you can cut off nutrition and a proper environment for those cells to go on forming but you can't take a knife to it and kill it or deprive it of oxygen so it can't breath. it's like uprooting a plant.\n\nand how do you know that reducing unwanted children won't reduce the amount of abused children in the world? Unwanted children are just that, unwanted. they are far more likely to suffer abuse, directly or indirectly than actual wanted childrenYes, it does. it has the potential to be human, but it is still just a zygote that does not think feel breath or have form at that stage.\nbut, approaching this from another angle, So what if it's human at that stage, What makes it so special that it must be brought to term. it's not going to feel anything. It's not going to ever know the difference. it's a vegetable and a parasitic one at that, at this stage. What makes humans more special than other sorts of life on this planet? do you realise what it would mean for the planet if every possible conception took place??but they have teh potential to be a human life? Isn't it a crime not to make them into a human? if we did we could all drink pina colada's together...\nWhy? Why is it better to not use cells from a non-entity than it is to make the quality of life better for the already living? you're talking about not saving a life of someone already here and viable for something that would rot and never be brought to term anyway?\nHow is that ethical?\n\nSara27\n\n06-07-2008, 08:58 PM\n\nIt is not illegal to conduct stem cell research in the US. It is illegal to add any new lines of stem cells to the existing inventory of governmentally funded labs. The problem is that certain stem cell lines are better at producing certain types of cells than other lines (i.e. - nerve cells). Private labs are free to accept new stem cell lines, but they cannot have any government funding. These private labs are dead in the water without federal funding since the cost of research is so great.\n\nEthics should be part of science and everything we do. We need to keep ourselves in check and evaluate our actions. Stem cell research is a wonderful and amazing form of research. We are conducting stem cell research in this country every day. It is legal and has been helping human kind. We need to untie the arms of our researchers by allowing more stem cell lines.\n\nAbortions are not needed for stem cell lines. There are companies that cell umbilical cord freezer space for your child so that they may use their own stem cells to cure a disease down the road. Stem cell lines should be donated, of course. We are not talking about setting up a Hefty bag in an abortian clinic to further science. Just as people donate their organs to help others after death, volunteers should be able to provide new stem cell lines to properly funded labs. I would be the first one to donate a stem cell line, just as I have a sticker on my drivers liscence showing that I am an organ donor.\n\nIf abortion is wrong, than why is it a natural part of existance? I have known a number of people who have experienced spontanious abortion (a.k.a. miscarriage). It is very sad for those parents who want a child, yet it is a bodies way of regulating itself.\n\nAgain, stem cells can be harvested without a medical abortion. Abortion has nothing to do with this issue.\n\nThaiGreenTea\n\n06-07-2008, 09:11 Hence I am somewhat offended that people use whole religions and make sweeping generalizations. But, back to the point, I go to church every weekend, do the motions... don't really feel anything. I once had a strong religious feeling when I was 11 for about a year, but that subsided. I want to believe in God, but can't. Thus, I go on hope that these morals are actually worth something and all the chances I missed out on because of these codes will be worthwhile.\n\nSecond point, I disagree with embryonic stem cell research, but for stem cell research in general, go crazy. Knock yourselves out. As Sara27 pointed out, they can use umbilical cells, etc. Sure it's not much, but at least it's something.\n\nazelismia\n\n06-07-2008, 09:15\n\nwho ever said it was a death sentence to be catholic? I've known some very intelligent and open minded Jesuit priests who did question the stance of the church and what they believed in. One of the ones I talked to was agnostic even (which I'll never understand, but he was still a jesuit priest, I suppose some of them remain priests so they can teach, even if they seriously question the faith?). but, The views you put forth are those that are pushed by the catholic church, in particular. I was merely identifying a source as there were so many hallmarks of the catholic in your rhetoric. I was right, you come from a catholic home. The catholic church has never been a friend of science.\n\nSara27\n\n06-07-2008, 09:39 PM\n\nThaiGreenTea: Morals are always worth something. You don't need a god to be moral. What have you missed out on because of your moral codes?\n\nScottH\n\n06-08-2008, 01:16 AM\n\nThe simple facts, as they appear to me, is that there is a genuine battle going on over control of the minds of the masses. I think it was one day a battle for control, now I suspect it's more a batter for self-validation.\n\nThe religious right--not religious people in general--is fighting hard to force it's beliefs upon the masses. One of the key issues is the issue of life: is abortion ok (NO, they say), can we humans get too deep into messing with \"life\" (NO, they say), etc.\n\nIt's so similar to when the Catholics publicly said \"It's ok to talk about the big bang, but you cannot talk about what came before, because that would be presuming to know the mind of God\" (quotes not literal).\n\nIf we permit the result of an abhorrent (by their standards) act (abortion) to be profitable (to man, or to mankind), it provides momentum to the \"pro abortion\" argument.\n\nIf we permit mankind to delve too deeply into the process of life, it tends to diminish the position of power of God's owners.\n\nImagine the disappointment over the years as so many \"acts of God\" have been rationally explained away by science: fire, lightening, eclipses, the behavior of the planets... the \"right\" is losing power fast, and it's struggling to hold on.\n\nI understand the view, for while I don't share it (the 'right' view), I, for one, am opposed to euthanasia because I believe it is a slippery slope. How will society's perception of a \"valuable human\" change when it becomes legal, acceptable and normal for one to end their own life when they feel they are not valuable?\n\nBut, in the end, I like the impedance between the scientists and their opponents. Science can be dangerous, and it's probably a good thing that there are factions--regardless their motivation--that keep us from normalizing \"today's discoveries\" too quickly.\n\nStem cell research, and all it's wonderful results will come to pass, eventually :-)\n\nhauteur\n\n06-08-2008, 08:28 with me that abortion is murder.

It's using aborted fetuses that gets my hackles up, so I should have been more specific than just \"embryonic stem cell research.\"\n\nAlthough, I would be opposed to any idea of a \"fetus farm\" where babies are grown to a certain point in order to be harvested.\n\nSara27\n\n06-09-2008, 11:31 PM\n\nThey pay $3,000 - $5,000 for women to donate eggs. Check out any college newspaper.\n\nWith IVF ovum and sperm are harvested and introduced (test tube baby). Not all eggs are fertilized. The ones that are fertilized are placed in the woman. If multiple fetuses grow than an option of selective termination is given to the parents. Selective termination greatly improves the survival of the fetus/es allowed to develop. It is much safer for a women to bring 1 or 2 fetuses to term than 6. Our bodies weren't made for that.\n\nAntares\n\n06-10-2008, 02:23 AM\n\nThai: Yet, would it make a difference if we throw a dead fetus into the trash or extract stem cell from them? If they're dead anyway...\n\nHuman beings are formed the instant sperm and an egg are combined, not in 3 weeks where glob of cells \"magically\" turn into a human being.\n\nThen we go into an area that crosses the 'abortion' argument. Logically, does 46 chromosomes indicate superiority? Why is a zygote with 46 chromosomes superior to a, say, grown dog? The zygote can't feel pain, it can't think. It's just a human cell with the potential to become much more. Yet from your view, you would rather kill the dog than the human zygote? If we can waste an aborted embryo or use it, well, you'd think we'd 'killed' it, in your logic at least. But if the outcome is going to be the same; either way, the embryo is dead, then I'd make a good use of it.\n\nAbortion is wrong. Embryonic stem cell research is wrong.\n\nYou have some explaining to do.\n\nIf you think you're so self important that other human beings should die to regenerate your (liver / heart / neurons), then you would not be able to understand this anyway.\n\nOh, you know, think of it that this way. A lump of cells without thoughts, feelings or senses are used to serve the greater good. Fine. That lump of cells each has 46 chromosomes. So what? That's no more human than my skin.\n\nAlthough, I would be opposed to any idea of a \"fetus farm\" where babies are grown to a certain point in order to be harvested.Starylon\n\n06-10-2008, 06:36 AM\n\nI guess it (mostly) comes down to whether you consider an embryo a human or not (or your overall idea of what a human is) and whether or not you think a bad life is better than no life at all.\n\nhauteur\n\n06-10-2008, 08:18 AMThe last I checked, killing animals for food is not considered murder by anyone but the strictest vegans.

But I would argue that's why most of us wouldn't call it murder.\n\nOn the other hand, switch it to animal cruelty like dog fighting and you're likely to get a different response.

It has nothing to do with benefit and everything to do with the established definitions of life, person, and human.Legislated morality to the point of guaranteeing an individual's rights, freedoms and safety.

In more, memories of friends, loves lost, really good pizza, last Sunday's episode of Venture Bros., political ideals, you get the idea. These are merely examples, of course, but a zygote alone is not a \"human\", it is merely the makings of one.\n\nSo what do you think constitutes a human? Is it the potential for something to eventually, one day, to become an adult?

{"text": "Ms. Cutter - The point of Murdoch's comment is that the children conceived from rape are still loved by God. He was not condoning rape. Why don't we call what abortion is - the killing of an unborn child. Yes it is legally supported government killing, but it is still the killing of an innocent life. As a person, whose birth mother abandoned me while I was still a newborn, then adopted by a loving family, I do not know what my 'conception background' is, but I know but for the grace of god, I am lucky at least she did not abort me. Even in rape, which is abhorrent, if a child is conceived, they too are loved by god and should have the chance in life. This was Murdoch's point, and this is the point of most Pro-Lifers, including myself."}

{"text": "276 Comments\n\nAkin didn't just step in it. He jumped up and down in a puddle of it, then wiped it all over his face and washed his hair in it. I really, really, *really* hope it's at least December before he manages to wash that off. His comments on this topic make Sarah Palin and Michelle Bachman look smart.\n\nIt's what you get when you let the party drift so far to the extremes that reasonable people don't want to associate with you anymore. At least a few states have alternate old-school conservative parties forming because of this nonsense.\n\nPeople are assuming this will cause him to lose support. He didn't make that shit up. That old wives' tale has been a strongly held belief in the prolife movement for decades. It probably was true for reported rapes because women who get ER treatment are offered emergency contraception. Back before it was FDA approved for that use, no one was going to bring it to the attention of people like Akin who could have done something to make it illegal or something.\n\nThe topic was abortion not rape. The issue being discussed was if abortion should be allowed in the case of rape. Akin was arguing that if you allowed abortion in the case or rape, you would get additional claims of rape from women who simply wanted an abortion. Do you dispute that claim?\n\nI'm pro-choice. My mom and many of the people I go to church with are pro-life, and they all think abortion should be outlawed \"except in the case of rape or incest.\"\n\nLeave aside the fact that, as Rick points out, if those are the only two circumstances under which one could obtain an abortion, reported rape statistics would skyrocket.\n\nMy beef with the rape and incest exemption is that it's morally indefensible. If you truly believe that abortion is murder and that the life of the fetus is as important as the life of the mother, then you should object to abortion without qualification. HOW the egg got fertilized has nothing to do with the resulting fetus' right to life. If the egg got fertilized via rape or incest, forcing the mother to carry the baby to term might cause the mother extreme emotional or psychological trauma. But if we're pro-life, then we've already posited that the fetus' rights cannot be subordinate to the mother's, so her emotional or psychological trauma can't trump lil fetus' right to exist.\n\nWant to allow abortion to save the life of the mother? Fine. Then say you oppose abortion except in cases where the mother's life is in danger. But to say that you oppose abortion except in the case of rape or incest is to admit that you just don't think a woman should be allowed an abortion if she had sex willingly. And that's got nothing to do with the life of the fetus.\n\nWell I've had to revise my estimate of McCaskill's intelligence. She ran more \"Akin's the TRUE Conservative\" ads than Akin did back in the primary. Now I understand why.\n\nI wouldn't have predicted it, but at this point McCaskill has my vote. She's a Democrat, but she's been saying the some of the right things for a couple of years now. I'm going to have to break my anti-TARP pledge, but I'll take that out on Bond when he comes up.\n\nps. Gal, I can't really predict the reaction of fellow Missourians, but please don't nuke us from orbit. If you must, try to limit the damage to St. Louis please.\n\nNo. You are wrong in your assertion, and I refuse to engage your question until you correct yourself, because frankly I find what Akin said reprehensible, and your defense of such is close to, particularly if you are as dishonest as you appear to be.\n\nHe was asked \"what about in the case of rape\", and his response was to imply it was a red herring to even ask, because \"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\"\n\nNothing about rape statistics, only the comment that women can't get pregnant if they're raped, followed by the assertion that even if they are, he doesn't think abortion is okay.\n\nHe did not make the claim that rape claims would go up, unless he did it later on in the interview, and if so, you'll need to link to it. Otherwise you're dishonest and a bad person, because you're not just defending a bad person, but you're being disingenuous while doing so.\n\n.\n\nNow the full quote is (part of which you purposely omitted):\n\n\"It seems to me first of all from what I understand from doctors that's really rare,\" Akin said. \"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down..\".\n\nThe first part of is probably true. Pregnancy from rape is probably somewhat rare just because of the period of fertility during a month.\n\nI have never heard anyone claim before that there was a way to \"\u2026. shut that whole thing down\". I doubt that is true. However, Akin has said that he misspoke.\n\nIf you want to be offended, feel free. But, it is your choice. No one is making you feel offended.\n\nI'm almost 50, and I swear I'd never heard the \"a woman's body won't let her get pregnant if it was really rape\" thing before. Can't believe anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of biology, or anyone who can read, would believe that.\n\nAnd Rick, the guy clearly was not trying to say that allowing abortion in the case of rape would cause women to claim rape when it hadn't happened. He said, \"\u2026the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down\" \u2014 meaning that a woman's body won't let her get pregnant if she's raped. IOW, he really is as stupid as he sounds.\n\n\"It seems to me first of all from what I understand from doctors that's really rare,\"\n\nFirst off, no. I do not believe a real doctor told him that. If so, I'd like to know who, considering all the evidence I have, like this, shows either that the rates are the same, or that they're opposite.\n\nHe never made the point you claim he made. He made the point that pregnancy from rape is rare, as though that were 1, in any way true, which it's not and 2, germane to the point, which it's not.\n\nThe flow of the conversation was:\n\n\"What about abortion in the case of rape?\"\n\"Pregnancy from real rape is rare, and I'm against it anyway\"\n\nI am not going to address your question, until you admit that you are not using Akin's points, but rather your own. As soon as you can debate honestly, I will address the question you think I'm dodging.\n\nI know a lot of people will now try to do the \"See? Republicans are stoopid\" thing, conveniently forgetting about the Democratic congress critter who worried out loud about too many people on Guam causing the tiny island to tip over.\n\nThis is not a Republican/Democrat thing. This is a \"We're being governed by cretins and morons, in case you haven't already noticed\" thing.\n\nYeah. Anyone who can make Clarie McCaskill look like the better candidate is just tragically unfit. For anything at all.\n\nWhile, undoubtedly, there have been terrible and stupid things said by Democrats and, undoubtedly, there are assholes in every group large enough, in the case of the Guam comments, the Rep. says he was kidding. And he wasn't talking about rape victims. I don't really think the situations are similar in kind.\n\nActually, religion doesn't necessarily have to play any role in the abortion argument. There are actually atheist groups specifically against abortion (I was shocked too). The I'd say people are letting their desire for convenience trump science here. And lets face it, pregnancy is INCREDIBLY inconvenient even when you actually want it.\n\nI've given it a lot of thought after learning that my mother-in-law survived an abortion and that the doctor recommended my wife be aborted (despite her being a perfectly normal baby and a very intelligent adult). I have no religious objection to abortion except the objection I have towards murder which is both a religious and moral objection. I do not think believing that fetuses are human life is by any means ignorant or necessarily wrong. However, this means that one side believes that widespread murder is happening and the other side believes that it's just growth removal. That's quite a difference in opinion. Keep in mind during this potentially volitile discussion that I have an unusually strong background in science and agree with topics like evolution and global warning. I understand that this topic means that many of us here have indirectly or directly gotten innocent blood on our hands if true. The incentive then, is strongly to the side of abortion not being murder. Us wanting something not to be so, does not make it not so.\n\nNow, in the case of pregnency caused by rape. If you believe that this is an innocent human life then this becomes the murkiest question to ask. This is the only real dilema in my mind. I do think that rape should be punished harsher than it is in this country and I also think that rape resulting in pregnancy should have an even harsher punishment. But I could not in good conscience agree that ending an innocent human life is justified because an evil act caused it. It is a really shitty situation that will physically impact the individual for nine months and emotionally impact them for any amount of time. However, I would lean on the side of not doing two wrongs to make a right. So, on the one hand I am outraged at the cause of the pregnancy and infuriated at the struggle the woman will have to undergo because of a man's crime. But on the other hand I don't see how we can justify murder of an innocent life (unless we want to make rape a capital offense which I'm not entirely against). If we prohibit abortions in this scenario then we really need to have stronger programs in place for people in this situations to minimize the harm the rapists cause in their lives. Everything from continued eductation, stipends, work programs, etc. Perhaps these could be paid for by large fines imposed on rapists.\n\nAs a concession, I would point out where I differ from others. I say that any pregnancy that has a significant chance to kill the mother should be a candidate for abortion as long as they give it every opportunity to live (such as carrying as far to term as possible without seriously endangering the mother). This is because I believe the mother has every bit a right to her own life as the fetus does and I would not demand anyone give up their life for another. Keep in mind, that having a right to your life does not equate to having a right to your desired quality of life.\n\nAs far as women who get raped secretly wanting it? That's what we call batshit insane. I can't think of many things that could be more offensive. That's like saying if I got mugged in the street that I secretly didn't want my money or belongings and that I really enjoy getting my ass kicked/stabbed. Only, rapings are SO much worse than a mugging. The psychological distress alone can last the victim the rest of their lives. I would not want anyone who believes that women secretly want to be raped in charge of anything, let alone laws. *sigh*, the tea party and the spirit behind it (rich companies) are truly ruining any hope of a valid alternative to the democratic ticket.\n\nExactly! We are governed by the worst sort of people. The worst part is that we really don't have the ability to choose our candidates and a third party wouldn't necessarily give us better options (also, a third party would likely be too close to one of the others and cannibalize votes, giving one party an ultimate advantage).\n\nI kinda wish we had the ability to give a negative vote instead of a positive vote. I am tired of just voting for the person I dislike the least. I want to vote against the person I dislike the most or be able to cast a positive vote should I ever see anyone I actually want in office. It should be a surprisingly good indicator of how unhappy we are with our choices.\n\nnlp was remarking on Akin's comments. In his case, it is his (Akin's) religion that's the reason for his belief, and he has likely (in my opinion) never critically analyzed it as you seem to have (although I strenuously disagree with you based on multiple points, but I don't necessarily think this post is the place for a lengthy debate on the humanity of life without a nervous system or the rights of anything over another's body).\n\nBecause Akin's never critically analyzed his beliefs, let alone the evidence supporting them, he also never critically analyzes any of the things he hears or makes up if they support his position. Thus, to come back to nlp's point, because he was fostered in a culture that respects religious belief over science, he feels that he can spout whatever made-up, batshit thing he wants.\n\nNLP's statement contrasted religion with science. The correct inference seemingly being the statement of whether or not abortion is wrong. I don't know why he'd bring up science with regards to anything else (sounds like your objection to my point deals with humanity or the rights of someone else and not human life itself. Interesting, I should very much like to discuss that line of thinking sometime. I would quickly point out the plight of a person in a coma or being catatonic who does not feel anything. Note also that week 4 is when the nervous system begins to develop. So I don't think a claim can really be made there. As for rights over another person's body. That is the most interesting part in my opinion. We're talking about the right to life vs the right over one's body. Which one trumps the other? Does one siamese twin have a right to life over the other if both could potentially survive?)\n\n\"The Gottschalls do acknowledge that their study was at odds with previous research, which showed a lower rate of pregnancy among rape victimsTo summarize, you disbelieve some of what Akin says and so discount it, ignore an important adjective, ignore the implications of the word legitimate, give us a reference which the authors acknowledge is an outlier, but think you have actually provided a sound argument for your opinion. Well, my response is \"not really\".\n\nThe\n\nBy this \"scientific\" definition, a tonsillectomy is murder. Unless, of course, it's just all frosting surround the completely undefined \"organic being.\"\n\nWhile I would be perfectly happy to continue the parenthetical debate, I don't want to piss off our hosts more than I already undoubtedly do just all the time, so I will hold off addressing anything you said (although that's really hard for me to do, but while I'm pretty dang aspy even I know that if abortion starts being debated there's a >90% chance of things going the way of the previous Thread Which Shall Not Be Named). If you're seriously interested, I'm sure I can figure out a way to get you my email or IM or something. I do love me some debate!\n\nAs regards to nlp's point, only nlp can really answer.\n\nI didn't necessarily read what you read into it. I didn't feel that nlp was saying that the abortion debate MUST be about religion, but rather, that when it is about religion, as it is in Akin's case, you wind up with ridiculousness, because by allowing \"it's against my religion\" to be anything but ignored or soundly insulted in debates about rights and laws, you're allowing \"things I believe without any rational basis\" to be a legitimate point.\n\nPart of the problem with that thinking is part of the problem with the abortion debate that happens, where people hold self-conflicting views. As Kinsey pointed our earlier, you can say you think abortion is truly murder, yet be okay with abortion in the case of rape. Akin even felt the need to try to say it was a red herring, when really what his true point was that it doesn't matter.\n\nGavin, my point was made in the context of people who demand that Creationism be taught in schools, and who make other, similar demands regarding what is taught in schools. It had nothing to do with the question regarding abortion, and a lot to do with having a Congressional Representative stand up and say that women don't get pregnant from a real rape.\n\nIt was an incredibly demeaning, and remarkably stupid comment, and my real thought was that the education system in this country is getting worse all the time. Having various religious groups inject their beliefs and demands into what is already a bad situation is making a mockery of what education is supposed to be about.\n\nI'm about to bug out of this one because it looks like it's going to explode into an Abortion!!!!111 thread, but I did want to mention \u2013 I think it's unfair of pro choicers to assume, or to pretend to assume, that all pro lifers want to restrict womens' autonomy. Perhaps some pro lifers would like to see us thrown back to the days of yore when good girls didn't and bad girls could be slut shamed with impunity. However, I think more pro lifers are motivated by a genuine belief that abortion is murder.\n\nNow. Maybe one of our hosts can kick off a less potentially incendiary topic. Like, say, guns.\n\nYou have oversimplified life in your desire for a neat way to be against abortion:\n\"The argument is that fetuses are living beings (they grow/consume/produce waste and are organic beings) and human (their DNA is not anything other than human and it's the same code they'll have until their death). \"\n\nMy sperm are living beings (they grow/consume/produce waste and are organic beings), they are human (their DNA is not anything other than human and it's the same code they'll have until their death).\n\nFurthermore, every time I spit, I kill lots of human life. Cells from the lining of my mouth also fit all of the criteria you have posited. And think about the annual event where a doctor takes a blood sample to measure my cholesterol, iron, etc. The number of living human cells killed by that process is more than the number of cells in a fetus for the first few weeks of the fetus's life. I suspect you aren't against those blood tests.\n\nI suspect that you actually have some further criterion for concluding that abortion is immoral that is related to the fetus's status as a \"separate person\".\n\nThe problem withe the abortion \"debate\" is that extremists on one side think there is no moral difference between the 2nd and 38th weeks of a pregnancy, and extremists on the other side think there is no moral difference between the 2nd and 38th weeks of a pregnancy. The vast majority of people recognize the moral greyness inherent in fetal development, but don't want to deal with talking to extremists.\n\nIf Akin had said something along the lines of \"I don't think rape as the cause of pregnancy is sufficient to justify an abortion\" I could at least respect his position. It's a consistent position that I disagree with, but I can understand and respect the logic that leads there.\n\nBut he couldn't stop there, could he? He just had to pull out the old \"but she was really turned on by it, wasn't she?\" canard.\n\n\"The Gottschalls do acknowledge that their study was at odds with previous research, which showed a lower rate of pregnancy among rape victims.\"\n\nThere are links in the article. Please follow them, or this one , which is another study whose results led to the conclusion: \"Even if he was differentiating, he never made any claim about false reports rising if there is a rape exception. Point to where he made that point, please, or admit that you are wrong when you say he made that pointActually, I didn't make a claim of my own. Rather, I rejected his claim, based on a lack of evidence for, and examples of evidence against, and also said I'd like to know what doctor told him that, considering I have studies showing it to be untrue. Do you have studies showing it to be true? Does he? Does his hypothetical doctor, whose name has never been mentioned? If there were such studies, I might believe his statement. But in their absence, I'm going to maintain I find it hard to believe that a doctor told him that, and that rather, I find it more likely he said it in the same way someone might say \"My cousin's friend knew someone who got pregnant from a toilet seat!\".\n\nTo summarize, you disbelieve some of what Akin says and so discount it,\n\nActually, I discount it because even if a doctor said it, that doesn't make it true. I do not believe a real doctor would be stupid enough to say it, which is what I said, but I do concede it is possible. That in no way would necessarily make the doctor right.\n\nignore an important adjective, ignore the implications of the word legitimate,\n\nYou said he was making a point he never made. While that point might follow from his words, he never made the point. I wholly concede that he was claiming that women't don't get pregnant from \"real\" or \"legitimate\" rape.\n\nI first repudiate that claim, and second say that it isn't a hypothesis that rape claims would go up if rape were the only reason allowed for aboriton.\nYou might use that point in your own argument for that hypothesis, but he didn't make that statement, and on its own it doesn't make that point.\n\ngive us a reference which the authors acknowledge is an outlier,\n\nGave you two studies, actually, if you actually read the words of the article.\n\nbut think you have actually provided a sound argument for your opinion. Well, my response is \"not really\".\n\nWhich opinion of mine?\n\nThe opinion he didn't make the point that you continue to insist on saying he made?\n\nOr that his point about women who are \"legitimately raped\" not getting pregnant is ridiculous, and based on no science?\n\n(Here's an article that breaks those studies you didn't bother to read down a bit more for ya: here)\n\nAnd on a final note, I would point out that his \"legitimate rape\" comments were more likely referring to Forcible vs. Statutory (which is considered \"not real rape\" by some), as that's been the talking point for quite some time, and was the argument when funding for rape was allowed but statutory rape was excluded.\n\n@Narad: There is a difference between a component of an individual and the individual itself. DNA contains within it the code for an entire being by including the components of the individual. A tonsil would correctly be part of human life, but it is not itself a human life. A tonsil will never become a human and has never been one. This is a quibble on my simplification of the topic. I could have constructed a more complex statement but I thought for the sake of argument I could just make it basic and allow others to fill in the logical components that shouldn't warrant mention. Of course I don't think destroying a tonsil is killing a human life.\n\n@NLP: I hardly believe that this dickery comes from any sort of religious tenents. The idea that women don't want to be raped is pretty much as basic as saying water is wet. Raped being, by definition, non-consensual. I see any notion to the contrary as being born out of the same sort of ignorance as superstition and perpetuated by the same dummies to boot. I apologize that I assumed your use of religion in contrast to science was aimed at abortion in particular. Hopefully I've explained why I took it to be along those lines.\n\n@delurking: Is it easier to believe that someone disagrees with you only because they \"want\" to? Why would I \"want\" to believe in something like that? I'm not a republican. I already believe in evolution, stem cell research, and global warming. I make up my own damn mind and like to view things objectively. It may be easy for you to project some sort of hidden agenda on me but that's no different than this politician pushing the hidden agenda that women actually want rape (except pushing this bias on me clearly isn't evil, it's just wrong). I could just as easily say that the assumption that fetuses (note that I don't call them pre-born babies either) is born out of a desire of not wanting to live with the consequences of one's actions. The thing is, you don't have a motivation for my interpretation whereas I do for yours. The bible certainly doesn't say that wounding a pregnant woman until her unborn baby dies is necessarily murder, it doesn't talk about it at all, so I don't see where people would really specifically tie it to religion except that Christians are typically the ones against it.\n\nPerhaps I did over-simplify the points but all it requires is clarification. For example, your sperm is merely a gamete. It does not contain the DNA required to become a human being, it contains part of the DNA required. Anyone looking at it would call it incomplete, aka less than human genetically. You should understand that most biologically life shares components of DNA, some even share more than a gamete with human life. The entirety of the code is therefore necessary to distinguish between the species.\n\nA gamete is human material, yes, just like a tonsil or a hair root is a product of the human animal, but if nurtured and kept alive it will never grow into a human being. Now, combine the gamete of a man and the gamete of a woman and then you have a zygote. That does have human DNA and not just a half fragment. My original statement that it is nothing other than human DNA is merely to contrast non-human DNA and human DNA, that it is no other form of life other than human. While there is no guarentee that it will survive into adulthood or even be successfully born, there is a guarentee that it won't be born a different animal or be a member of another phylum or any such classification.\n\nAs for the 2nd to 38th weeks discussion. You are correct that this is the most heated part of the discussion. I am conflicted on this. On the one hand, I understand that my definition includes a simple zygote as human life. But I simply can't bring myself to completely view a single cell or even just a small collection of cells as human life. I'm not sure if I should just take a strong stance and call conception or the time of implanting it or not. If not, then how the heck do I justify a starting point at which it is ok? Also, how does how I \"feel\" have any impact on whether or not the human life deserves not to be destroyed? I don't think I can bring my own subjectivity in the discussion as that would be just as bad as people rejecting the notion blindly because they don't want to deal with it. Objectively, if the subjective point of murder is wrong, then killing a zygote is killing a human in the earliest stage of life.\n\nEither way, I can assure you that there's no sort of secret reason why I'd want to have one view or another. I place a premium on not just listening to what I'm told and actually thinking things out.\n\nThough I'd like to end on this, the idea that somehow a woman wanting or not wanting sex can impact the union of gametes is hilariously retarded. Sorry, I guess I mean mongoloidal. Err\u2026 dumb. No, mentally challenged\u2026. handicapable?\n\nThe fun part of abortion debates is the AMAZING frequency in which it turns out that people on one or both sides can't be bothered to learn what the other people's opinion actually IS, so they just assume everyone who disagrees with them has the exact same opinion and argue the same formula.\nTo cite an example from upthread, I would be very surprised to find that there is any significant number of people who think that removal of a live fetus is \"just growth removal.\"\n\nIt appears you were correct with regards to NLP's statement. Thanks for lending your view.\n\nYou'll forgive my ignorance of some other thread on the topic that turned out badly. I assume it took a more personal nature and perhaps someone got insulted in a way that was innappropriate. If it takes that turn then hopefully it won't be by my hands. I have no desire to do anything else than have a civil discussion on the matter. I am by no means militant in my beliefs nor do I actually chastise people for having abortions. Perhaps I should if this is what I really believe, but unless someone believes it is murder and does it any way then I can't really fault anyone for ignorance. Not when the law supports it.\n\nThe administrators have my email. I would gladly shut my trap other than offend.\n\n@James Polluck: All sides have a range of beliefs. I found this out when I studied the subject to figure out where I stand. You do find everything from \"God hates abortion\" to the \"It's no different than having a colagen injection\".\n\nThe dividing point I'm interested in where discussion is concerned is simply whether or not it's human life. What I find most surprising is that there are camps on the pro-life side that believe it isn't life and that there are camps on the pro-choice side that believe it is life. What a crazy and divisive topic!\n\nOne, the bible does mention that specifically: \".\" Exodus, 21:22,23\n\n(There's contextual arguments about what that means, in that there is a presumption as to what \"mischief\" means, and some take into account the fact that <1 month old babies weren't even counted in census, etc., but that's not the point, the point is it is totally in there)\n\nTwo, and more importantly: \"there is a guarentee that it won't be born a different animal or be a member of another phylum or any such classification.\"\n\nReminded me of this quote from the internet:\n\n\"I love the term 'we're expecting' when talking about pregnancy,\nbecause it makes it sound like there's more than one outcome.\n\nYeah, we're expecting a baby.\n\nBut it could be a velociraptor.\"\n\n(And, since the abortion debate has begun to boil despite my best efforts, I would like to say this: the relative humanity of the genetic material in question seems, to me, to muddy the water unnecessarily. Humanity is not special, in my mind; consciousness is. If a rat stood on its hind legs tomorrow and said, \"Hello, good sir, I know this is odd, but could you spare a smoke? I'm positively jonesing, and that dastardly shop proprietor will not let me into his store. There's nothing better nicotine on this fine summer's day as I contemplate my place in the universe.\", I would say that that rat is conscious, and entitled to all the same type of benefits we give to humans. The same, to me, would be said for a Turing-passing AI. And being asleep or unconscious does not negate that essential consciousness (and, indeed, we don't really know where consciousness ends). However, a 2 week old cluster of cells is not conscious, and has not been conscious, yet. It has no central nervous system. In my opinion, its humanity is irrelevant, and its potential is irrelevant, only its actuality is relevant. Once the fetus becomes an actual viable person, with a brain and all, then we start getting into murkier territory for a host of other philosophical, moralistic reasons. I come at it similarly as  does, but again, that's farther down the philosophical pipeline for me.)\n\nI find an interesting correlation between the group who vehemently support the \"castle doctrine\" concept (the right to use deadly against unlawful intruders into one's home/car/wharever) and the group who oppose abortion-in-the-case-of-rape. Cognitive dissonance, anyone?\n\nI could have constructed a more complex statement but I thought for the sake of argument I could just make it basic and allow others to fill in the logical components that shouldn't warrant mention.\n\nBut this is the point: Your putatively scientific definition is a non-definition that simply pushes the matter into the vagary of \"organic being\" with aimless hand-waving about metabolism and DNA, which are very much components that don't really warrant mention. I'm not trying to pursue a debate about abortion but rather pointing out that nothing particularly follows from this construction.\n\nI'm not going to weigh in on the actual topic of abortion or rape at this point (I've already had issues with one discussion involving my state and possibly-religion-linked controversy in the past week), but I will request that somebody please don't even nuke St. Louis if Akin's elected. I live way too close, and I don't think Akin lives anywhere near it.\n\nBesides, as the saying goes, \"If you kill him, he won't learn nuthin'.\" (despite my temptation to assault him and several others involved in the state and federal government with a variety of science textbooks after the past couple of weeks, because Missouri is developing an awful track record just from this and that stupid amendment)\n\nGavin, I should probably have been more clear, but the statement Akin made about how pregnancy cannot occur due to rape was such a blindingly stupid comment I thought others would understand. The education level in this country seems to get worse all the time.\n\n@Narad: Actually, the use of organic is to exclude technology or certain non-organic forces which may consume energy and grow. A star, for example, or a black hole. We rarely consider inanimate objects alive (per definition) and I wanted to be sure to exclude them. The idea is that organic metabolism is life. A single celled organism that is doing that is still alive. To cease metabolising is to cease to live because energy is no longer being consumed and so energy may only leave the decaying body. The point of DNA is only to express that it is human life. What follows from this is the belief that a fetus is human life at its earliest stage which should not be particularly hard to follow. This came out of an incorrect assessment of what someone here said. I thought they meant that being anti-abortion necessitates putting religion over science, something that isn't even close to being true.\n\n@Malc: Please explain how a child is responsible for its father's sins? Please tell me, if a home invader walks into a home with an infant in his arms, can the home owner shoot the invader and then the child because they both \"broke in\"? I assume your statement is tongue in cheek, but feel free to correct me if not.\n\n@Grifter:\n\n1. I stand corrected! I guess they do have a biblical reason. I will adjust my opinion of their views accordingly. Thank you.\n\n2. Hah! Dinosaurs trump human babies! As long as it's passive until after the birth\u2026\n\nRe: Gavin\nWhat? I basically said what Narad said; you basically conceded my point \u2013 that it is a fetus's status as a separate person on which you base your position (a tonsil is a \"part of human life\", but \"not a human life\"). You are trying to sound scientific by using words from science but the crux of the argument is not scientific.\n\nIt is good that you understand the 2nd/38th week dilemma. Some ethical problems have no clear dividing line. Is it morally acceptable for a poor man to steal some unaffordable life-saving medication for his child? Yes. Is it morally acceptable for a poor man to steal medication that has a 1% chance of saving his child's life? How about a .01% chance? How about a .0001% chance? And so on\u2026 Recognize that some other person's livelihood depends on the medication being sold, not stolen. There is no clear line, just as with abortion. Given how many such ethical dilemmas one can easily find in everyday life, it is obvious that neither extreme is the correct one for abortion either.\n\n@Gavin: You need think it through (and read some statutes). If a father breaks into a house with a child in his arms, the home owner (in e.g. Florida) is free to open fire on the father, AND then if the child is killed, the father (not the shooter) becomes guilty of murder, because the homeowner is absolved of both criminal and civil liability for their use of force.\n\nObviously, if the child breaks in on his own, then homeowners are free to slaughter at will \u2014 no questions asked.\n\nAnd no, it's actually not tongue in cheek.\n\nOn your other point: are you talking about a two week old baby or a two week old fetus?\n\n@Delurking: Howso? I am establishing that a fetus is a human life albeit at the earliest stage. The value of this human life is then left up to a high degree of subjectivity with the understanding that human life at some point must be held a high value. It is also a distinctly seperate being (as defined in its DNA derived from both parent's gamete). You made a point about various components of human life as if they were themselves a human life. In what way is this conceding some disagreement we're having?\n\nMy concern about abortion is that at some point we are killing human life. The fuzziness of it is extremely disconcerting. If there is a fuzzy point, then on one side of it murder is being committed and to be on that side is to have blood on your hands. That weighs heavily on me, especially where infants are concerned. On the other hand, if there is no fuzzy line, if it is wrong to destroy human life at any stage then we have done far more harm than we realize. It would be easy for me to run a pascal's wager and say that it would be better not to risk murder by quibbling over a few months of time, but easy isn't always right. Just how much subjectivity can be allowed here? I don't know and perhaps cannot know. It is a sort of philosophical angst that I can't get away from at the moment nor do I think I ever can. Still, the point of unease is not unfounded. It is a valid stance for me to take even if I can't define the particulars. I know, for example, that partial birth abortions (if the practice has been correctly explained to me) are pretty damn bad. But plan B? I wouldn't bat an eye.\n\n@Malc: You made a comparison between a home invader and a rape-derived fetus. I'm stating that the fetus is not the invader. The rapist is.\n\nMy statement is this: If a man invades a house with a captive, whom the home owners are aware is a captive, can they shoot the invader and then, after a pause, knowingly shoot the captive in the head? Not on accident. If a loophole allows that to happen, it needs to be closed. Surely you agree such an action would be cold blooded murder. I'm merely pointing out that if someone believes a fetus is an innocent human life, there is no overlap between a home invader and a fetus. The fetus is not committing a crime. So your statement just doesn't follow.\n\nIn all honesty, I wasn't sure if you were somehow being facetious, since I happened to know of such a specific example to exactly what you were saying\u2026I'm glad I didn't just miss the joke!\n\n(Just to clarify, since it seems you jumped to babies\u2026did you mean 2 week old fetuses or are you questioning whether I equate 2 week old babies to rats? If the former I'm confused by the question, if the latter, I'd say we don't know enough about consciousness to say how much the 2 week-old baby has, but it's also outside of the mother's womb, which changes the dynamics of the debate, since it's so very much about the interplay of 2 peoples' rights)\n\n\".\"\n\nI think he is distinguishing between rape involving physical force and violence and rape not involving any/much physical force. That's clear from his pseudo science statement that a woman's body precludes pregnancy in some cases (\"legitimate\" rape) but not others. Thus, if he were including rapes such as consensual statutory rape and rape of an incapacitated woman and perhaps rapes involving some level of coercion short of violent physical assault as part of \"legitimate\" his statement about a woman's body would not make any sense. He was clearly not making a distinction between rape and a false claim of rape.\n\nI'm actually strongly up to date on most theological discussions. I can talk to you forever on soteriology. But it never occured to me to look in scripture for this topic. I honestly try not to look for things that can be explained with science. But that's just me. I apologize if I seemed to be joking, I do sometimes enjoy a good joke. But in general if I ask a question I'm not trying to waste your time. I'm trying to learn. I am happy to be corrected.\n\n(I did jump to babies. Babies cannot talk either. Frankly, they show less intelligence than a baby rat. The sentience argument has a lot of holes. You mentioned them with coma's, sleep and such. But as such what is the difference between the potential for a coma patient to eventually come out of it and for a fetus to eventually grow into a coherent human? Both may take years. Now you're saying that something as arbitrary as it being on one side of a wall or the other makes a difference. Does the womb have a magic gate? How does that work out with regards to your statement that consciousness is what matters?)\n\nOh, no, I wasn't complaining, or trying to give you a hard time. It was just funny that as I was typing the reference I was thinking \"Boy, I hope I wasn't missing the point\".\n\nI don't think you'd like my positions much in a debate on soteriology.\n\n(My point about consciousness is not as holey as you think. I'm saying that there is a difference between consciousness that has never existed and consciousness that is \"on hold\". I think there's a qualitative difference between the two, particularly when it is consciousness that existed, and that is guaranteed to exist again (to use sleep as an example). Is that a point you disagree with? And as regards to the rat vs. baby: We don't know enough about consciousness, I think, to be sure that they baby truly is less conscious than the rat. Moreover, at any point, the mother can opt-out of responsibility for the child by placing it up for adoption. While it is inside her, the fetus' supposed \"right to life\" comes at the expense of the woman's autonomy. I've long held that the \"prolifers\" would have a better argument if they had artificial wombs, so that the mother's autonomy and control over her own body did not factor in to the equation)\n\nPoint of discussion: If it was discovered that being incubated in a woman's body for nine months cured terminal cancer, would you be okay with the government forcing women to serve as incubators despite significant risk to their own health and safety?\n\nIf the idea sounds horrific, consider that a simplistic parable like that doesn't have even half the issues inherent in forcing a woman to carry her rapist's baby to term.\n\nAll life is precious, but only to a certain point; I'm no one's axlotl tank.\n\nI disagree with Thompson that this argument applies to all pregnancies. But, I do basically agree with this argument when it comes to pregnancies as a result of rape. Anyways, I think someone upthread mentioned you can't logically believe a fetus is a person that should be protected and be in favor of an abortion exception in cases of rape. I completely disagree for the reasons set forth by Thompson. Not that you have to agree with this or you're an idiot. It seems to me that there's lots of room for disagreement for people of good faith when it comes to abortion. I immediately dismiss anyone as worth paying attention to who easily demonizes those whose positions he or she opposes (\"they hate women and just want to control them\" or \"they're baby killers with no respect for human life\") when it comes to abortion.\n\nI do not consider a fetus a human life; while it's genetically human and alive, I see absolutely no reason it should have sovereign rights until it's born. I consider a fetus akin to my ovaries and uterus: If I want it, you're violating my right to my own body by taking it away; if I don't want it, you're violating my right to my own body by forcing me to carry it around. Of course, that's not even taking into account the fact that one does not give birth to her reproductive organs, which do not then become sapient and have to deal with life in the outside world.\n\nBasically, the point is still that I'm no one's axlotl tank. Unless I want to be, of course. That's the point of choice. Even if I did consider a fetus a human life, it wouldn't change my opinion on being an axlotl tank; to borrow from my parable again, I'll decide for myself if I want to help terminal cancer patients.\n\nEven if reports of rape would increase if there was an exemption for rape and incest wouldn't you be punishing the victims for what might be crimes (falsely asserting a rape happened) committed by others?\n\n@ Gavin: Being related to people and having a number of friends who are against abortion (as I once was) I need to point out one thing. You state: \"I do not think believing that fetuses are human life is by any means ignorant or necessarily wrong.\" But that is NOT what they believe. They believe that a human is created when the egg is fertilized. That would make the use of things like IUD's murder. And that really complicates things (like they weren't all ready).\n\nAnd an extremist who can't see a difference between the 2nd week and the 38th week shows up\u2026\n\nOK, M. Let's say its the 38th week of a woman's pregnancy, and she decides she no longer wants the fetus. Is there a moral difference between killing it and taking it out and giving it to someone else?\n\nIt is, nonetheless, the strongest thing going. Otherwise, what's the big deal about \"human life\" in the first place? I'm willing to argue that it is only projection of one's own experience (and abhorrence at the notion of its extinction) onto others\u2013including animals\u2013that gives rise to any principled interest in the subject whatever.\n\nIt seems to me, with the state of the law the way it is, that the rational acts to take to reduce the number of abortions performed in this country would be:\n1. Fund medical research that improves the viability of premature fetuses. A fetus which can be transplanted into a willing host(ess) is one that need not trouble (nor be troubled by) its original mother.\n2. Fund extensive sex education that includes all available pregnancy-prevention methods. (Abandon \"abstinence-only\" sex-ed for the crime of not working during any of the last several thousand years. Parents, of course, would remain free to advocate this method\u2026 it's cheap and effective for some)\n3. Increase the availability of all methods of birth control, so that people who do not want to become parents may select the best, most effective method rather than the one that's cheapest right now.\n4. Outreach to women who are carrying a child they would rather not raise with the message that alternatives are available. (Some will be receptive, some not. Focus on the ones who come to agree with you.)\n4a. Make resources available to those women to assist with expenses related to carrying a child (medical care, missed work, maternity clothing)\n4B make sure there really are enough qualified adoptive parents out there to take on the rearing of those kids.\n\nTaking these steps will reduce the number of abortions performed. It won't reduce the number of abortions to zero (of course, neither will outlawing abortion, anymore than outlawing heroin has reduced the number of heroin addicts to zero.)\n\nIt's interesting having this discussion, especially with a group of people who are more willing than usual to hear other points of view.\n\nBut regardless of how strongly you feel that abortion is murder from the moment of conception, overturning Roe v. Wade is a moot point. The laws against abortion were originally created when we were diagnosing pregnancy by injecting women's urine into rabbits to see if their ovaries enlarged, and when abortions required surgical instruments (even if they were coathangers).\n\n.\n\nUnfortunately, if you try to outlaw it, you will end up with methotrexate being sold on the street by people who bought it from the spamvertised internet pharmacies in India or stole it from their relatives with rheumatoid arthritis. The quality will be questionable. Women who buy on the internet will have to purchase stock bottles, meaning there will be enough pills left over for two more abortions, all with no counseling. There will be no way to determine if the pills are from a competent pharmaceutical manufacturer or if they are placebo. Weeks or months after the drug is taken, you will get women with aplastic anemia from overdoses and you will get surviving babies with spina bifida from underdoses. You will not be able to determine if those events occurred as a result of the undocumented abortion using the unprescribed pills. And you will never be able to prosecute the successful abortions by women you never knew were pregnant whose pregnancies were terminated before the embryo was macroscopic.\n\nIf you want to stop abortions, you're going to have to change hearts, not laws. That's just the way it is. And acting like an asshat when you discuss rape victims isn't going to inspire too many people to take your point of view seriously.\n\nA fetus which can be transplanted into a willing host(ess) is one that need not trouble (nor be troubled by) its original mother.\n\nTo describe this as a \"technical challenge\" would be to grievously understate the case. One only has so much time to implant an IVF embryo for, say, placental development to occur. Fetuses are pretty much out, not to mention tje question of how one is supposed to move them from uterus A to uterus B.\n\n\"To describe this as a \"technical challenge\" would be to grievously understate the case.\"\n\nAnd yet, we've made TREMENDOUS advances in keeping grossly premature babies alive. Is it difficult? Yes. If you want to move the date of viability closer to conception, is it going to be a lot difficult-er? Yes, again. But, UNDER CURRENT LAW, transition to the point where the fetus' rights outweigh the mothers' is at the point of viability outside the womb. Therefore, advances in moving the point of viability forward advance the fetus' rights, which has the net effect of either A) reducing abortions, or B) causing abortions to be performed earlier (or most likely of all, C) both of the above). However, again assuming that reducing the number of actual abortions performed is the goal (not shaming of women or penalizing sexual activity amongst the fertiles) then that's a win. An expensive one, of course, but very likely one that has positive side effects amongst wanted pregnancies as well as unwanted ones.\n\n\".\"\n\nI'm a little skeptical that outlawing abortion would not have any effect upon the number of abortions. If it's so easy to get an abortion on your own, why do abortion rights advocates so strenuously fight current abortion restrictions like waiting periods, and sonograms? Seems like one side wants to make it more difficult to get an abortion and the other wants to make it easier. I'm kinda skeptical that they're both just wasting their time, money, and effort on things that are meaningless. I suspect that, just like drugs, outlawing abortion will make it more difficult but not completely end it.\n\nAs a person who was given up for adoption as a newborn in the 1960's, I am faced with the reality that it is highly unlikely I would be here to type this comment if Roe v. Wade had been in place when I was conceived. As you might expect, this fact unavoidably colors my perception of the moral value of a fetus, or even a zygote. It follows, in my admittedly biased opinion, that arguments that scientifically attempt to define the morality or immorality of an abortion in terms of when a fetus becomes a viable human being, fail, because the true moment of moral significance is when genetic material exists, which if allowed to develop without interference, will eventually mature into a human being. As such, IMO the best pro-choice arguments are based upon the rights of a woman to govern her own body, and I reluctantly support this position while hoping that most woman will choose to carry the children that they conceive.\n\nIf it's so easy to get an abortion on your own, why do abortion rights advocates so strenuously fight current abortion restrictions like waiting periods, and sonograms?\n\nI think it's a case that the loudest arguments are the people who have camped out on the extremes of the issue and who aren't willing to give an inch. They feel that discussing the limitations of their own position will put them on a slippery slope toward the other side obtaining total victory.\n\nThe people who don't want to see women arrested for having an abortion at 4 weeks but who also don't want abortion to be a casual decision at 22 weeks just steer clear of the fray altogether.\n\nThere's probably also a component of not wanting to educate the enemy.\n\nSeveral prominent Republicans and Republican lobbying groups are publicly withdrawing support and even asking Akin to withdraw from the race and let another candidate run.\n\nPart of me says, \"His views are not unusual in the Prolife movement. You court those people no matter what your personal beliefs and no matter how extreme their beliefs are. As the saying goes, \"You lie down with dogs; you get up with fleas.\"\n\nOn the other hand, usually even when there are murders involved, the Prolife movement is content to make terse statements saying they don't support such means and otherwise just staying silent. If people on both sides of the discussion would start publicly criticizing those on their own side who views are so extreme as to undermine everyone else's credibility, it would go a long way to making it possible to have a more civilized discussion.\n\nSorry about a delayed response. I work with computers, so when I go home, I'm just home. It looks like all sides have spoken out against this candidate's statement. Even republicans are calling for him to step down. Very good!\n\n@Grifter:\n\nI don't know if I'd dislike your take on soteriology. I find that usually if someone knows what soteriology is that they're on the other side of the fence from me. I've been published as a source against predestination and in favor of free will. Primarily against the Calvinist points of TULIP but also in general against the Westminster confession and Calvin's Institutes.\n\n(The whole I'm presenting with the rat vs baby is that there is not necessarily any significant difference between a baby at day one and a fetus on the last day. Just a few inches one way or the other. A baby may be consciousness \"on hold\" but a fetus is too, just a little longer. What I am saying is that my position is one that has been rationally thought out and not a wacky \"I'm not going to listen\" view. You know?)\n\n@M.:\nA full grown man dying of cancer is not being murdered by not letting him get into a woman's womb (in your analogy that would clearly result in the woman's death, haha, but besides that point). He's being killed by cancer. The problem here is an innocent life that will die if removed because your essentially cutting off its feeding tube and oxygen supply. Unlike a brain dead person on a feeding tube, this individual will gain conciousness (baring natural complications). Just because it presents a huge inconvenience (and I mean a HUGE inconvenience) does not mean that anyone has a right to kill it. At this moment in time, it is best described as a siamese twin in which both twins can survive their entire life but one would certainly die if removed. The difference is that waiting 9 months will resolve the issue and both parties get to live (keep in mind, if the pregnancy is particularly dangerous to the mother, I do advocate the potential of abortion, one life is not important than another and so a mother should not be forced to risk her life for her child. I do, however, request they carry the fetus to as full a term as possible and do whatever they can to preserve it as is their medical responsibility to do no harm). We must accept that the fetus is not the invader. This being did nothing to harm the recipient and in fact has no concept of malice yet. The innocence is an important concept for me, that a child is not responsible for its parents' actions.\n\n@John Berry:\n\nIUD's prevent fertilization, this is why it's a contraception, because it prevents it from happening. I'm not Catholic. I think the most valid comment here would be plan B's which only prevent implanting of the zygote on the uterine wall. I don't personally have a problem with it. Even though I accept it is a life I simply can't make myself to see a single cell organism the same way as I'd see the 4 week old fetus that already has a nervous system cropping up. Where between those times do I think it matters? I don't know. It's like a tomato plant with a flower on it. That flower eventually produces a bulb and then the bulb slowly grows into a full tomato. I wouldn't call the bulb at it's smallest stage a tomato, even though that's what it is. I do believe it's life but I have trouble really defining what the difference is between the 4 week stages. Perhaps I should take a firm stance somewhere but I am by no means so arrogant as to think that my firm stance would necessarily be correct. I would probably think that by the time one learns that they are pregnant, that it's likely past the point where I would look the other way, so to speak.\n\n@Grifter (second time):\nThe idea is that if it is human life, then doctors have no business harming it. Just because something happens does not mean we should streamline it to make it easier. Back in the day there was also a stigma about being unmarried and pregnant. Women would be cut off from society and all that. Their lives would essentially be over. There are still some small towns where it's that bad but it isn't easy on them if they go to an abortion clinic either. Today this is a delay, especially with adoption being an option nowadays. I have to weigh my concern carefully, one for the woman who has a difficult number of months ahead of her and one for the life that is about to be snuffed out. I think about people like my mother-in-law who survived an abortion (not entirely rare from what I've heard) or my wife whom the doctor recommended be aborted for reasons that never happened. I wonder about how many scientists or inventors or musicians we've lost. These are inevitable thoughts to run across once one begins to think of this as a human life. That there are real consequences to our actions and that if this is an innocent human life I would not want its blood on my hands.\n\nI am entirely not sympathetic with the couple that just had irresponsible sex and this was the result. My wife and I haven't gotten prego because we've been careful. I am very sympathetic towards the women impregnated via rape. It's like some monster has cut off her arm. The problem or murkiness of the situation comes up when I am also sympathetic for the innocent human life who didn't ask to be there. On the side of life/death vs huge inconvenience I must side with the life/death. Tough decisions are all around us. I would want us to do everything we can to make things easier on that individual, but at the end of the days it's still a 9 month problem.\n\nNo, I STRONGLY doubt that many people at all would really think that a woman can magically prevent herself from getting pregnant just by not wanting sex. I don't know anyone personally that wouldn't get offended that if you get pregnant you wanted the rape to happen. They clearly exist, I didn't know they existed, but I seriously doubt they're anything of the norm.\n\nThe Republican party is taking offense to that stance. They would agree that rape does not justify murder. But never that rape victims somehow wanted to be raped if they got pregnant. That is as ignorant and as offensive as it gets.\n\nOn the subject of soteriology, let's just say I approach the subject in the same manner I studied homeopathy.\n\nOn the subject of abortion: I do recognize that you've put thought into your position. This is a good thing; I enter most debates with the intention of being willing to be convinced. This doesn't make me any less argumentative, of course.\n\nAs I understand it, there are several arguments inherent in the abortion debate.\n\nThe first point of contention is the question: When does the mass of cells qualify as human life that has its own rights?\n\nYou agreed that there's a qualitative difference between day 2 of the development process and week 4. I am of the opinion that letting a fertilized egg not implant but instead be flushed is not really killing a human, but rather stopping a potential human, in the same way that letting that unactualized potentiality be wasted through masturbation and menstruation stops that potentiality.\n\nSome have equated the fertilized egg to sperm, and the response has been \"Well, sperm isn't fully its own organism, and wouldn't develop into one on its own\". Technically, that's true. However, sperm and the egg that would be lost during a period are two halves. You wondered how many artists, etc. we might have lost, but I say those never existed in the first place, and had the male \"pulled out\", then the same amount of waste would have happened. I don't see a difference between wasting them separately or together.\n\nHowever, at a certain point of development, I do agree that the fetus becomes an actual human. I posit that point is when there is a nervous system, which is around 4-ish weeks. Someone else can posit a different timeline; you said you were unsure of what you believed was the cutoff point, and I'd say you need to figure that out before you start debating the next point of contention. I can find no moral issues with preventing a fertilized egg from implanting, and beleive that until the nervous system develops, the mass of cells has no moral weight whatsoever, and getting rid of it is morally modern Onanism (not as its usually used, but in the literal sense from the story).\n\nThe second point of cention is the question: What obligation does one person have towards another person?\n\nOnce we've hit that point, which is different for everybody (for some, it's viability, for me it's a nervous system, for the religious who believe souls enter at conception, it's conception), where the mass of cells officially has its own rights, we have to wonder what obligation does the host have towards the thing inside her?\n\nThe thing inside the woman is, on this question and side of the debate, a person, so what are her obligations to it? Bearing in mind the difference between legal and ethical, of course.\n\nThere's the old \"fat guy on the train tracks\" analogy. Are you obliged to attempt a rescue, even though you're at the very least likely to hurt your back, and might even die? Well, while the ethical position is sticky, the legal one is clear: No. You aren't obliged to.\n\n.\n\nI don't, however, think they have the right to kill the thign inside of them per se; that is merely a secondary effect of them asserting their rights.\n\nThat's why I've always felt the \"prolife\" crowd would do well to find legitimate alternatives to abortion, like artificial wombs. If a woman could say \"I want this out of me\", and achieve that goal without the death of the thing inside of her, I think there would no longer be strong arguments for abortion. Of course, then the folks who took responsibility for that life would be on the hook for it, not the woman. But then I think strong arguments could be made for preserving even potentialities, because it wouldn't be at the expense of anyone else. We don't have that, and we're unlikely to have that.\n\nSo I believe that it is 100% okay to abort up to viability outside the womb (which used to be about 28 weeks, but is presently at about 23-ish weeks.\n\nPrior to that point, there is no way for the fetus to survive without curtailing the mother's own autonomous rights to her body. After that point, to me, is where legitimate discussions about limits to aboriton can take place, in part because not only is the thing inside viable outside the womb, but also the woman has usually been aware of it for quite some time, but hasn't exercised her rights to get it out of her. Personally, I am definitely squiggy about it at 39-and-a-half weeks. Less so at 23. I feel that, at that point, I'm not sure what my opinion is. The debate rarely focuses on that point, though, but rather on the concept as a whole. I'm definitely leery of the state taking control of another's body, which is what's happening when the state prevents a woman from exercising control over herself. I'm very curious what M. or someone else who may someday actually have to face the concept of pregnancy, thinks about the 39-and-a-half point, actually. But, in keeping with the Michigan legislature, they aren't allowed to say \"vagina\" (parum pum pssh).\n\nIn a later interview apologizing for his statement, he confirmed that instead of \"legitimate\" he meant \"forcible\". Making this a \"rape vs rape-rape\" statement. Hard to decide which is more offensive the \"real rape\" portion, or the idea that women forced physically into having sex can't get pregnant\u2026\n\n\".\"\n\nGoing back to your fat man on the train tracks analogy, if you are the cause of the fat man being there, then you certainly may have legal obligations to help get him off those tracks. Likewise, if a woman is the cause of her getting pregnant, then the argument that she has the right to do whatever with her body, even if it means the death of another person, is not very persuasive to me. This is why I think exceptions for rape are not inconsistent in the least. A woman who is pregnant as a result of rape has no moral responsibility for the fetus being inside her body, while the woman pregnant as a result of consensual sex does.\n\nThe allograft certainly is an invader, which is why the placenta has to provide an immunologically privileged site (and another reason that the notion of transplanting fetuses from one person to another is science fiction). If you kill a home invader who has a captive, you're not required to allow the captive\u2013whose very presence happens to pose serious risks\u2013to move in with you.\n\nBut don't confuse \"responsibility\" here. Not only does the man share equal responsibility (yet, until birth, none of the responsibility\u2026though there's a whole other line of debate on this subject), neither one of them (presumably) wanted that outcome, so it's not quite comparable to, say, purposefully tying the fat man to the tracks, but rather to (if we presume all measures were taken) there being a chance of him being tied to the tracks as a side effect of you doing something else.\n\nBut again, that's at the stage where you acknowledge the \"personhood\" of the thing inside, which in my view is not \"immediately upon conception\". You have to address that first point before you can start moving on to the second.\n\nI just fully noticed this comment: \"I am entirely not sympathetic with the couple that just had irresponsible sex and this was the result. My wife and I haven't gotten prego because we've been careful. \"\n\nYou can still get preggers even if you are careful, an eventuality you didn't seem to cover, but which likely covers many unintended pregnancies despite the best efforts of the \"abstinence-only\" education pushers to make sure that kids have as many babies as possible as young as possible.\n\n@Gavin: Are you saying that cancer patients are responsible for their having cancer? I'm sure that's true in the case of heavy smokers, for example, but what about a toddler with leukemia?\n\nYour concept of innocence strikes me as arbitrary. At what point does someone stop being innocent and thus worthy of risking someone else's life (yes, pregnancy and childbirth can be dangerous to the mother in ways not anticipated by prenatal screenings, which not everyone can afford anyway)? At birth? The first time they lie? Upon the loss of their virginity? At age 18?\n\nAgain, I am not an axlotl tank. If anything (or anyone) I don't want has the misfortune of growing in or on my body, I will remove it posthaste. I'm furthermore unfamiliar with pregnant women being required to take the Hippocratic Oath.\n\nThe U.S. foster and adoption system is a whole other bag of something that I don't even want to think about, much less discuss.\n\n@Narad:\nNo, the fetus is not an invader. The zygote was made in the womb by two gametes. If we could stop the sperm gamete from reaching the egg gamete (as this politician would have us believe we could\u2026) then that'd be another story. The fetus is no more responsible for the invasion than the unwilling mother is. It'd be like saying that a hole a buglar punched into the wall was also an invader.\n\n@Ktpick:\nThe only possible rationale I could think of is if he's contrasting statutory rape which is not based on consent vs rape which is entirely based on consent? I mean, any way you look at it this guy has both feet pretty firmly in his mouth. As was said earlier, this is a pretty good example of the quality of politians we have the \"honor\" of being able to choose between.\n\n@Grifter:\nI don't know what you're getting at with regards to soteriology. Are you saying you approach it atheistically? At which point soteriology is a null point. The only way I'd take offense would be if you held a non-freewill or complete predestination position at which point we'd have a side discussion. Even an atheist would agree with my position: \"You say that God didn't predestine everything that could ever happen including those who go to heaven and those who go to Hell? I agree, He didn't!\" Of course, their reasoning would then be because \"He\" doesn't exist . I don't entirely trust athiests though. The idea of believing in a negative which is impossible to prove logically is just as unscientific as faith. A deity is one scientifically acceptable theory on the creation of existence. Though it's once we go towards specific religions that it breaches the area of faith. Of course, if a Deity actually existed it would just be considered an alien of immense power. Agnostics, those guys have the right idea! They'll believe in something when they have evidence.\n\nAs far as not letting it implant, I disagree with your reasoning as I still maintain that gametes are not human life as they do not meet the DNA requirements one believes that a zygote is life, then that life is lost when aborted just as a toddler who dies is a lost life and all the possibilities of the future. In all fairness, the opposite side of the coin (the drug dealers, the hitlers, the snookys) is also lost. For me though, I have this very tangible example in my life. My mother-in-law (whom I love) survived an abortion. In one swoop I would have had a drastically different life.\n\nAs for the 4-week mark, I would definitely agree with this number. But I don't know how much before I would likewise agree with. The question is whether or not the implanting is it because the act of removing it would be the act of killing it. The problem I mentioned is that I don't personally feel any sort of sympathy for the zygote or the next few stages of cell multiplication. I know that I philsophically agree that it's life but I admit I don't particularly care in those phases and I don't know if I should. This is me being quite open about the matter. Something I feel that people on my side are hesitant to be. Like vulnerability necessitates wrongness WhoI'm happy to concede that \"responsibility\" for a pregnancy or whatever you want to call it is a gray area. My point is simply that a reasonable person can draw a distinction between a pregnancy as a result of consensual sex and a pregnancy as a result of rape when it comes to where to draw legal and/or ethical lines regarding a woman's autonomy over a fetus inside her body. I also agree with your point that it may not make any difference depending on how you view a fetus. If you don't think a fetus is a person worth of any legal protection from being killed, then it matters not, for purposes of abortion rights, whether a woman has any responsibility for it being there. Then again, if you do view a fetus as a \"person\" worthy of legal protection, then you might still recognize that people should generally have a right to control what goes on in their own bodies, but make an exception for pregnancies because you think the pregnant women has some responsibility for the situation in the first place.\n\nFair warning, it's time for me to go home. Have a great evening/rest of your day.\n\n@Grifter:\n\nThe point is that I don't feel particularly sympathetic for couples who get a baby from sex. This is the natural conclusion of it. As for carefulness, I'll be sure to speak up if my carefulness ever fails. I do not speak to the inteligence or vigilence of other people who claim to have been \"careful\". Usually its a \"we have always been careful except for that one week in the bahamas\" or something along those lines. Thankfully none of my friends have said something like, \"but we used the hole in the sheet!\" If the condom breaks or something like that, we'll know. Then it's plan B all the way, baby! Sure, there are a few other things I could do to be safer but with proper birth control the odds are in my favor.\n\nM.:\n\nThere is a large difference between forcing someone to take action to save a life and taking action to end a life.\n\nThe point of innocence is only that the fetus did not ask to be there. The fetus is not the rapist and is not responsible for its father's actions. That is the only point of innocence here. That the fetus isn't committing a crime by existing.\n\nAs for the hypocratic oath, that isn't a stake now. The issue is killing/murder. I didn't take a hypocratic oath but that doesn't mean I can just go out in the street and start harming people. Though this does present an interesting case for whether or not doctors can legitimately perform abortions anyways. Again, I'm pointing to the siamese twin concept. These aren't two entirely seperate entities in that way.\n\nThe only comparison to make would be if an evil doctor ran up and sewed two people together, without either of their consent, in such a way that removing them would kill one but not the other. How does the one that would survive have the right to sever the other? They both have a right to their body in this outlandish scenario but how would we decide this? Especially in the event that a period of nine months from the sewing would result in neither dying?\n\nThere is a misconception that women \"cum\" when they have orgasms the same way men ejaculate, and that if a woman doesn't have an orgasm, she can't get pregnant. Most people learn better by the time they get out of middle school, or definitely by the end of high school. But religious fundamentalists go to significant lengths to shelter themselves and their children from people who believe differently from them. You and I don't know any people who think that way, because we wouldn't want to be around them and because they don't want to be around us.\n\n@Gavin: You seem to view pregnancy and childbirth as some peculiar detached process by which a woman notices that she's pregnant, says \"oh well,\" and chills out for nine months. It's definitely not that simple, especially when delivery time rolls around.\n\nYou still have not made a coherent argument for the difference between forcing women to bear children and forcing them to risk their lives for the sake of any regular citizen's life, nor have you explained what makes the fetus more innocent than the cancer patient. If the fetus is innocent because it didn't ask to be there, the implication is that the cancer patient is less innocent because he asked to get cancer. Again, what of children with leukemia? Or infants with cancer, for that matter? Also, you're still choosing to ignore the fact that pregnancy can be fatal to the mother. I'll tack onto that the fact that giving birth in a hospital is obscenely expensive, and not everyone is fortunate enough to have insurance.\n\nWith all due respect, your view seems to lack critical examination of both the practical and long-reaching societal issues at hand. Or possibly you're just trolling me.\n\nTo the mother's immune system, it most certainly is, sorry. I will echo M. above: you seem to have a very simple, bun-in-the-oven notion of what pregnancy actually is, viz., a radical remodeling of the mother's physiology.\n\nThe best equivalent is what I said. A siamese twin being removed and killed when both could have survived just because one twin. This isn't just a seperate entity, this is now part of her and their lives are intertwined.\n\nAnd allow me to deal with this: Conjoined twins are the result incomplete splitting of a fertilized ovum or embryo. So are parasitic twins, including craniopagus parasiticus. Now, was it wrong, in your view, for Manar Maged's parents to have had removed the independent, partially functional, vestigal head fused to the back of her own?\n\n@ Gavin, Thanks for all of your input. I was mostly wrong about the IUD question. However, in the event the egg is fertilized, \"an IUD makes it harder for it to implant in the uterus\". That quibble aside, thanks for your responses, I am enjoying the conversation everyone is having. Usually these things break out into raging flame wars by this point. Popehat is very unlike the rest of the internet.\n\nFirst off, at the risk of being snotty, you don't seem to understand the philosophical definitions of atheism and agnosticism. One is a claim about deities, the other is a claim about knowledge regarding deities. I think you were referring to Agnostic Atheists, when you referred to agnostics as folks who'd believe things if there were evidence, but even among those there are some who would say the question is impossible to answer, and therefore meaningless.\n\nSecond, \"the idea of believing in a negative which is impossible to prove logically is just as unscientific as faith\" is absurd. Science says that if something has neither been observed nor inferred, it cannot be said to exist. While it is true that it is nearly impossible to prove something doesn't exist, if there is no evidence that it exists, then there is no more reason to believe in it than there is to believe in unicorns, leprechauns, Ra, Zeus, Zoroaster, Buddha, or anything else. Most atheists take the position that the god presented by believers is either self-contradictory, or has been disproven, or at the very least has no evidence for existence, and so they say \"Therefore I don't believe in it\".\n\nThird, there is nothing scientific about an untestable theory that cannot be observed or disproven due to its adherents ability to shift the sands of their definitions. This is not to insult the faithful, but it is just the way science works.\n\nNow, back on the main topic:\n\nAs far as not letting it implant, I disagree with your reasoning as I still maintain that gametes are not human life as they do not meet the DNA requirements you consider the fertilized egg to be exactly as human as a fully developed fetus, there is no difference between not allowing it to implant and removing it. Both result in the death of the \"life\".\n\nIf one believes that a zygote is life, then that life is lost when aborted just as a toddler who dies is a lost life and all the possibilities of the future.\n\nThat's a tautology, though. \"If one believes X is human, if X is lost a human is lost\". I can't disagree with that, but I can disagree with your premise, that a Zygote is as human as a toddler.\n\nI know that I philsophically agree that it's life but I admit I don't particularly care in those phases and I don't know if I should.\n\nThe problem is, if all that's required for humanity in your brain is the DNA, you logically must see it as the same whether it's 2 cells or 4 weeks. The fact that you don't says that you see a difference\u2026you need to find out what it is, I think.\n\nThis is me being quite open about the matter. Something I feel that people on my side are hesitant to be. Like vulnerability necessitates wrongness.\n\nFor the record, I appreciate your honesty\n\nDid you read that article I and another poster referenced, with the \"violinist\" example? The argument is that the right to life does not extend to control over another's body. If I flopped to the ground and refused to eat unless I was fed by slaves, no one would have an obligation to do that, even if I let myself starve to death. The fetus has a right to life, the woman has a right to her body. As I said, if the woman could exercise her right without killing the fetus, that would be great! But we don't have that. Instead, we have to pick and choose, and no one has the right to make a slave of another.\n\nWhoFirst off, you seem to be ignoring the fact that women can and do die in chidlbirth, and that significantly less women die from abortions. So it leads me to believe, as other posters have noted, that you may have an overly rosy picture of fetal development.\n\nThe crux of the matter is that the fetus is a life.\n\nIt may be a life, but then so is a fly. Or a pig. Or grass. So, what you mean to say is that in your opinion \"the crux of the matter is that the fetus is a life equal to a fully developed person, and so therefore killing it is the same as killing a person\". I would argue that, for portions of the fetus' development, that is not true, and that for other portions of fetal development, that doesn't matter.\n\nHere's a thought that seems not to occur to people who favor outlawing abortion: Once you give the government the power to decide things, you lose the power to make those decisions yourself. Not that big a deal when the government decides things the same way you would, but what happens when the government changes its mind? Once you decide that the government should decide who gets an abortion, you lose the right to complain should they decide that abortions aren't outlawed, but rather now that overpopulation is a problem, abortions (or surgical sterilization) are mandatory for people who already have a child. No way, you say, forced sterilization is a Chinese thing, it couldn't happen in the U.S.! Could, did. (Skinner v. Oklahoma)\n\nBefore I forget: The only form of birth control in the United States to which there is entirely unfettered, relatively inexpensive access is condoms (which aren't cheap, but can sometimes be gotten for free). Plan B is expensive and hard to get, especially in areas with a majority of fundamentalist Christians. Everything else is similarly a pain in the ass. I don't wish to insult anyone, but since females are often responsible for birth control in heterosexual relationships, it may be difficult for Gavin to appreciate the difficulty of avoiding pregnancy.\n\nUnless you want to make the argument that only those who can afford at least two forms of birth control and/or Plan B, plus prenatal care and the hospital bills associated with childbirth in case everything does go south, should be having heterosexual sex. That seems profoundly unkind to me.\n\nOh, and I could go on for a couple pages more about the unpleasantness and danger of hormonal birth control, but I feel like I'm beating the fossil of a Hyracotherium at this point.\n\nHello all, thanks for the responses. I'll bold names as usual but because of the ground I need to cover I'll split it into two posts.\n\nAlphaCentauri: Wow, that's messed up. What an idiotic position for people to hold. I wonder if they account for people under the influence of date rape drugs or other such sedatives. It is an outrage to find this sort of ignorant mentality existing in today's age of technology where you're one google search away from knowing that there's no evidence. Thanks for the information, I will now eye my neighbors more suspiciously.\n\n@M. (and Narad's first post) No, I have a \"pregnancy is a natural part of life\" mentality. You're behaving as if the woman is getting cancer or something. Every living organic thing that we see today was born. It is the only required function for survival of a species. The reason that the body sees it as an \"invader\" is the same way it views a cold or anything else that does not share the individual's DNA. The fetus is half self and half invader. Even consensual pregnency results in this kind of invader. That being said, the womb is built to handle it. The point of saying the fetus is not an invader was in response to the it being analogous to a real home invader. The fetus is not there forcefully. It was put there by the invader. The fetus did not commit a crime. That's all this was intended to mean. Getting rid of the fetus is not the same as shooting a home invader. Shooting the rapist would be the same.\n\nHaving a baby is not necessarily risking your life. Stepping outside is FAR more dangerous than childbearing, especially with today's technology. If memory serves, the chances of dying during birth (for mothers) is around 0.017% or 16.7 out of 100,000. This fluctuates according to year pretty wildly. In 1980, for example, our rate was 11 out of 100,000 and medical tech has only improved since. The current increase has been theorized to work in conjunction with an increase in planned home birthings where something goes wrong and they're not in a place equipped to deal with it. Several other deaths are related to mothers who have been warned about complications but continue to go through with it.\n\nAgain, let me be very clear on this. If the mother's life is actually deemed to be in legitimate danger, then I DO advocate the right of abortion. I do NOT believe that we should force a person to risk their lives for another. I have also repeatedly said what a pain and inconvenience child birth is. I don't deny that, but it isn't death. The issue in my mind is a question of life or death and not nine months of lower quality of life.\n\nAs for expense, if we are going to hold people to the standard of not having abortions in the case of rape, then we MUST get better at supporting them during the entire 9 months and then pyschologically afterwards and especially financially if they also decide to keep the baby. The rapist, if found, should not only recieve much harsher sentencing but should also have a large fine that goes straight to the victim and to the system in place to support other victims.\n\nI'm not saying that this isn't a bad situation. It is. But two wrongs do not make a right. As cliche as that statement is, it's there because it's true. As for the comment on a doctor's pledge to do no harm, this applies in general abortions because the mother isn't the one that does it. At no point did I intend to apply the do no harm to the general person, I just meant it in conjunction with the idea that this is ending a human life and those who would carry out the proceedure have pledged not to do this sort of thing.\n\n@Narad (other posts):\nInteresting comment on the more murky areas of this kind of conjoined twin (I just realized I've been saying siamese twins all this time, a term that has become offensive, I think) issue. In this case the head was not a seperate individual. It was just a head with no functioning brain activity or ability to EVER comprehend anything. My response to you would be this: If it had been a fully functional brain and could express a desire not to die, would it have then been ok to murder it? I would say no. A fetus may not be able to currently express an aversion to pain, but it will eventually be able to do so. In this respect, you are merely killing something that can't speak up for itself. You are killing the man in a 9-month coma before he's supposed to wake up.\n\nAs Grifter and I have been talking about, the potential of life is key. Something that will never grow into coherent and sentient life is different from something that will. I do believe that. I would tentatively agree in aborting a fetus that the doctor could absolutely verify would have no brain activity. I do suspect their ability to accurately gauge this though. Because my mother-in-law was mistakingly put on antibiotics while pregnant with my wife, the doctor advised them to abort her because she'd be born severely handicapped. She is not only perfectly healthy, but also quite brilliant in terms of IQ, well above average and not suffering from anything like autism or such. In the case of conjoined twins, they are usually only seperated if both will die without it or if both could fully function after seperation. I agree with this action as it is saving one life instead of letting both die. To save one is better than to save none.\n\nThanks for your input as well. I do not have a problem with preventing a fertilized egg from implanting. My qualm is that the act of removal is an act of killing it. I guess I'd consider the point of implanting more the point of life than conception. Only because it is then \"hooked up\" to life giving facilities. A zygote that is not implanted cannot grow into a human being so implanting is every bit as important as fertilization.\n\nAs for the direction of conversation, I'm also glad that it is an environment that is open to real discourse on the subject. I've learned quite a bit for once.\n\n@Grifter:\nI understand that people define themselves as agnostic atheists, but this is\u2026 self conflicting\u2026 for lack of a better word. It's saying that we can't know if there is or is not a God and then saying, \"but I absolutely believe that there's not one.\" It is just like saying you're an Agnostic Deist/Christian/Muslim/Hindu/[Insert Deistic Religion Here]. With the first term you're admitting that we can't know, then with the next term you're then taking a side. It is not then different from believing in a particular religion. Keep in mind, and I'm sure you already know this, that the term agnostic theists is also a term that is thrown around for others. I would say any time that anyone throws any specific belief after the term agnostic that they are necessitating faith or belief derived without any evidence and perhaps to the contrary of it. So, I repeat my statement that Agnostics are the most honest of the bunch. Note the lack of any terms following it. None of what I said was incorrect.\n\nBeing unable to prove a negative, that something does not exist, is a long standing logical conclusion. The idea is that new information could change that at any point whereas proving that something exists only requires the first point of information breaching an acceptable level of certainty. Science does NOT teach that something unobserved does not exist, as you stated, science merely teaches that you can't claim that something does exist if it has not been observed. Objects exist regardless of human perception. If the cat in the box dies, it does so regardless of human perception. The act of opening the box doesn't magically close the wavelength in real life, it just confirms or rejects the hypothesis based on millions of datapoints before. Saying that you do not believe something exists is different from saying something does not exist. I see someone already responded to the semantic error of listing Buddha in that so I'll not go further on the issue.\n\nTo the last comment on cosmological beliefs. I think some rational points may be presented to the need of a deity or unmoved mover. I'm not sold on the counterpoints to how the universe could exist without an unmoved mover. Turtles all the way down, while a fun and novel concept, does not smack of truth to me when presented in light of all observed phenomenom having a cause along with the understanding of entropy. This is why I've gone the way of theism with the understanding that a creator or mover actually existing would not technically be \"divine\" but rather a natural force of immense capabilities and hopefully sentience.\n\nNow, to the topic of abortion:\nI consider implanting to be just as necessary to the formation of life as the meeting of two gametes. We Am I incorrect in recalling articles about some eggs failing to implant until a much later date than conception and not growing into a fetus until then? If I were given the personal honor of defining the terms. I would call the zygote the seed and the uterine wall/womb the soil. The gametes merely being the components of the seed. Calling the egg soil seems to diminish the genetic contribution of it.\n\nAs for the idea of an implanted zygote being as human as a child. This demands a bit of semantics. Human as in humanity or human as in human life? A human expressing emotion and though is expressing more humanity than one in a coma, for example, but is no less a human life. Both a fetus and a toddler a equivalently a human life as far as metabolism and DNA are concerned. ButAgain, I must insist that a fetus is not just another individual. It is attached to the mother in the same way a conjoined twin is connected to its pair. It Keep@James Polluck:\n\nHuh? The government already has the power to decide things and has already made choices on abortion (most recently to allow it). The government already has the power to legislate and it uses it on a regular basis. If the government does something wacky with their powers then that's when we deal with it. A slippery slope argument doesn't make this action invalid.\n\nM.:\nIf a couple has a baby, then that is that consequence of their actions. The idea that it is inconvenient or expensive does not invalidate the principle that it is a human life. Again, you keep pointing out that it is difficult or inconvenient or that it sucks. I don't disagree at all. But my point is that human life is more valuable than being inconvenienced. You can make any point that you want about it being difficult but at the end of the day you're placing a price on human life.\n\nOn the flip side, if abortion laws change, so should how we treat mothers who would otherwise have gotten an abortion. There is a whole LOT of crap in our healthcare system that needs to change regardless of this topic. Most of the costs are inflated by the very presence of insurance in the market and the fact that hospitals are not properly exposed to market conditions (prices are not clearly listed and so it isn't easy to shop around). Currently the poor do have access to healthcare via medicare programs. Medicare typically covers the entire cost. They have 9 months to get in the program if they are poor and should they keep the baby, it will automatically qualify for medicare for the first two years, free of charge.\n\nIf there are any loopholes I am missing, they should be closed. The easy solution is to just kill them. The right solution is more difficult and as such will have complications. That does not make it any less right.\n\nIt does not contradict at all. Again, Agnosis vs. Gnosis is a position on knowledge, and Theist vs. Atheist is a position on existence. If you have no faith whatsoever, you are an atheist. If you have faith in something's absence, you are also an atheist. You are confusing what's called \"strong atheism\", the positive belief that there is no god, with \"weak atheism\", the lack of belief in a god. Commonly, that's called \"agnosticism\", but it's imprecise to say that. Rather, to say \"we don't know for sure there is no X, but I've found no reason to believe\" is an Agnostic Atheist position, and it requires no faith.\n\nAs a general rule and going through life, you find reasons to believe in something, not reasons to disbelieve. If you spend your whole life believing everything until it's disproven, no matter how ridiculous, you'll soon find yourself broke (did I mention you owe me $1,000, but must have forgotten?) and probably crazy (Aliens are abducting me, I just can't feel it! And the CIA is broadcasting through my fillings to sub bases in the soviet union, which never fell but is secretly plotting with Al Qaeda\u2026)\n\nscience merely teaches that you can't claim that something does exist if it has not been observed.\n\nYup. And that's the point, isn't it? You can claim anything exists, but without proof, the response \"I don't believe you\" is perfectly reasonable, and it is disingenuous to claim it requires as much faith as \"I believe you\". In the case of a God, that statement makes you an atheist.\n\nI'm not sold on the counterpoints to how the universe could exist without an unmoved mover.\n\nThat's a position that has been refuted numerous times. There is no logical necessity for an unmoved mover, any more than there is a logical necessity for the universe itself to be that unmoved mover (we don't know everything about the universe), or for there to be a bigger god than god that created god. In the absence of evidence, the simplest explanation is the most defensible one.\n\nTurtles all the way down, while a fun and novel concept, does not smack of truth to me when presented in light of all observed phenomenom having a cause along with the understanding of entropy.\n\nFirst off: I know it was just a simple typo, but reading \"phenomenom\" made me immediately say \"Do doo do dodo\"\n\nAnyway, you're positing something beyond all observed phenomenon. We observed nothing before the universe's creation, and have no data from that time. So we can make no statements about it. The universe could have been spontaneous. It could have been created. It could be almost anything. The response to that from a logical/scientific standpoint should be \"Not enough data\" (agnostic atheism), not \"therefore, God!\"\n\nIf you have a theory, you must actually back it with something, or you must rely on faith. I myself, don't have much love for faith.\n\nNow, to the topic of abortion:\n\n\"I consider implanting to be just as necessary to the formation of life as the meeting of two gametes.\"WeAm I incorrect in recalling articles about some eggs failing to implant until a much later date than conception and not growing into a fetus until then?

This demands a bit of semantics. Human as in humanity or human as in human life?\n\nThat's your question to answer.\n\nA human expressing emotion and though is expressing more humanity than one in a coma, for example, but is no less a human life.\n\nTo you. You have to establish that premise, though, before I'll accept it.\n\nBoth a fetus and a toddler a equivalently a human life as far as metabolism and DNA are concernedButAgain, I must insist that a fetus is not just another individual. It is attached to the mother in the same way a conjoined twin is connected to its pairItI take it you still haven't read the defense of abortion, mentioned in Wikipedia, and available here.\nPlease do so, considering that it addresses your argument fairly exactly, and gives you your fetal humanity for the sake of the argument\n\nI'm making the case that keeping the baby is inherently more risky than getting rid of it, which is something you must keep in mind when you are in this debate. You are saying the state should step in and force the woman to take that risk, make slaves of women for 9 months at a time, so that they cannot put what they want into their own bodies (risk of harm to the \"child\"), cannot get rid of the thing that's putting them at risk and sapping their nutrients, and cannot have personal autonomy. Remember that there is a difference between ethics and laws; I would be less strenuous in my argument if you were saying that to you it's unethical to get an abortion. That's fine, and if you should ever get pregnant, you can make that choice. But you're advocating that the choice be stripped away from women, and to advocate that position, you'll need to back it up with some real argument.\n\nKeepIrrelevant. You can't say to a woman, \"Well, you can't have an abortion, but buck up, the baby might die at some point while it's still up in there!\" The fact is that having the baby is more risky than not, and you're saying the state gets to decide the woman must take that risk.No, it is not. It is true to you, but you still haven't established it as a point in debate, and you still see a difference that you have failed to establish, in that you've not given any valid criteria for the difference between a fertilized egg and a full human being. Your logic leads inexorably to the idea that we should be mourning the loss of every fertilized egg which is not implanted (Since, as I noted, your soil analogy fails). Further, what you are saying is that hormonal birth control is murder, because it prevents fertillized eggs from implanting. (It also prevents eggs from being released, but sometimes they do anyway, and the hormones make the uterine wall inhospitable).\n\nLest you think otherwise, I'm not advocating abortion per se, I'm saying that the government doesn't have the right to make anyone a slave, even if it does save someone's life. It is the woman's choice whether she wants to play host or not.\n\nGavin says:\n\"Huh? The government already has the power to decide things and has already made choices on abortion (most recently to allow it).\nThe government already has the power to legislate and it uses it on a regular basis.\"\n\nDo you understand how your government works? The government's power to legislate is limited thanks to our Constitution. IF the government wants to legislate, it has to demonstrate that it is legislating in a way permitted by the Constitution which gives it authority.\nWhen the government limits abortion, it does so not by citing its (still non-existent) authority to tell people what to do with their personal autonomy, but by citing its authority to protect citizens from other citizens (yes, the state MAY act to protect the interests of unborn citizens). In the current formulation, the unborn fetus' right to life achieves primacy over the mother's right to select her own medical care occurs when the fetus is viable outside the womb. Both before AND after that point, the state lacks authority to dictate medical options which affect only the mother, including medical options which may (or will) affect future reproductive options. The government does NOT decide. You (with the assistance of your doctor, your insurance representative, and your banker, as needed) decide what medical care you will receive. Your elected representatives and police are left out of the decision-making process entirely.\n\n\"If the government does something wacky with their powers then that's when we deal with it.\"\nActually, thanks to the brilliance of the founders, it isn't.\n\n\"A slippery slope argument doesn't make this action invalid.\"\nI, um, didn't make a slippery slope argument. Where did you see one?\n\nNot true. I am positing that to take a step away from agnosticism and taking a firm stance on the position of atheism that you are in fact placing faith in the non-existence of God. The only non-faith based stance is the one saying that there is no evidence either way. Agnostic = There is no evidence either way, Atheism = I believe there is no God All observable events have a cause and since all subsets make up the set itself one could posit that the universe or set itself requires causation. We can discuss particle physics on the concept of randomness if you wish but I assure you I have given it no less thought. We have natural laws and principles the work well except in the very initial point of existence. The conservation laws, concepts of entropy and what an infinite past would mean to it, and even cause and effect principles. TheThat being said, if you accept an atheistic perspective of cosmology, you must accept only one of two possibilities. Please define anything that would fall in another camp if I've missed it. Either the universe has always existed infinitely into the past or that the universe I cannot accept something from nothing. I do not believe in magic and with my current understanding of science both explanations would be magic. An infinite past with no homogenization of energy and matter caused by entropy: Magic. A sudden existence of matter, energy and life-supporting physics: Magic.\n\nI apologize for repeatedly mispelling phenomenon. I've had a muppets song stuck in my head for days now. Oh, haha, that's what you mean by \"Do doo do dodo\". I had noticed a mispelling at some point and thought I'd gotten it fixed. Given the reason I presented above, I believe my belief in the unmoved mover is at least a valid theory and that the alternatives are contrary to current properties of the universe. That There are a lot of unanswered questions even then and it wouldn't be a sentient personal God necessarily as I explained. So unmoved mover doesn't necessarily mean theism unless you consider any cause whatsoever to be \"God\".\n\nNow, to the important stuff!What?Again, huh? Are you giving sentience to the uterine wall? If so, the uterine wall can feel fine to stop giving the fetus resources any time it wants. But at this point the baby is attached to the mother and is now part of it. Before this point, there is no connection to the mother other than the fact that it shares half its DNA. After the connection you then enter into the conjoined twin area of discussionWhat? Yes it does. A toddler cannot survive without a parent. An infant even less-so. It is just external parasitism. Do you advocate not feeding a child as an acceptable thing to do?A tadpole is just a baby frog. It is just an early stage of the frogs life. At no point is the tadpole another species. It is always a frogYou act like having a baby is the equivalent of being muggedOverall, we're talking about what justifies the action of killing. Please explain why .0017% is statistically significant number when the field of statistics rejects it?\n\nIt was just a head with no functioning brain activity or ability to EVER comprehend anything.\n\nThis is in fact false, as (at least as far as the popular reports I've looked at) the parasitic twin was able to smile in response to stimuli and make suckling motions when the host twin was feeding.\n\nMy response to you would be this: If it had been a fully functional brain and could express a desire not to die, would it have then been ok to murder it?\n\nRemember, it was the head of an infant at the time, so such expressions might not to have been expected from heads with torsos. Moreover, it didn't have a larynx, so outbound communication would not exactly be straightforward. As to your specific question, my answer would be 'yes', and the sooner the better. Referring to it as \"murder\" is needlessly begging the question.\n\nI would say no. A fetus may not be able to currently express an aversion to pain, but it will eventually be able to do so. In this respect, you are merely killing something that can't speak up for itself.\n\nI don't know why \"aversion to pain\" enters suddenly here; did you mean \"death\"? Anyway, I think I have your drift here, but given that you seem to be trying to stake out a pure position based on \"human life,\" the necessity of introducing temporal expectations, which are inherently probabilistic, to cause the whole thing to collapse. You don't know that that guy's going to come out the coma; you don't know that that head's not going to someday reach a level of mental development equivalent, perhaps, to a severely developmentally disabled child, whom nobody sane in modern society would advocate being disconnected from his essential-supply chain to test viability.\n\nI don't think the metric accomplishes its seeming goal of being a simplifying principle, in short.\n\nSorry, Gavin, but you are wrong. Agnostic is NOT EQUAL to \"There is no evidence either way\", and \"There is no evidence either way\" is NOT EQUAL to \"Therefore both positions have equal logic to themTheWhile you are correct, that it is a logically coherent hypothesis, it is not a logically necessary one. As you admit, our knowledge breaks down at the Universe creation stage.\n\nAs regards to your next logical mess: Either the god you posit has always existed infinitely into the past or that the god\n\nSee how it applies perfectly equally to your \"god\" concept? Once you accept that all things must have a cause, including the universe (which we have not seen any universes created and so therefore have no concept of what that entails), then to say \"therefore god!\" is just as unfounded as saying \"and therefore the universe!\", except it requires a superfluous extra step.\n\nI cannot accept something from nothing.\n\nYes, you can. You accept \"god\" from nothing. So obviously, you accept SOMETHING from nothing.\n\nI do not believe in magic and with my current understanding of science both explanations would be magic.\n\nAt the risk of sounding insulting, please learn more about science then. In particular, look up \"vacuum fluctuations\".\n\nAn infinite past with no homogenization of energy and matter caused by entropy: Magic. A sudden existence of matter, energy and life-supporting physics: Magic.\n\nIf it's all part of a natural process that we do not understand, it wouldn't be magic, nor would it be supernatural. Again, please learn more about science. The god you posit would be just as \"magical\".\n\nBut if we don't know something exists, and we have no evidence or reason to believe it exists, we are not going to believe in its existence. Again, I feel like you don't understand the terminology here. The term in question is \"null hypothesis\". If there isn't evidence of something, then the \"null hypothesis\" is assumed.\n\nGiven the reason I presented above, I believe my belief in the unmoved mover is at least a valid theory and that the alternatives are contrary to current properties of the universe.\n\nThey are not more contrary than yours, my friend. You posit something outside the universe (which doesn't jive with anything in our universe), that violates all the rules within our universe. It's no different than saying that the universe itself violates those rules in its birth except, again, that it requires and extra step.\n\nThatSo, \"we don't know how it started, it might not have had a cause\" is turtles all the way down, but \"we don't know how god started, he might not have had a cause\" is not?\n\nIf the universe were a pond, that analogy would make sense. Because it isn't, it doesn't. BTW, ripples can also come from wind. Or from fish. Or from boats\u2026.\n\nYou seem to have continued to ignore this point: Without a reason to believe in something, you don't believe in it. That is the case with every other god but the one you believe in, and is the case with every other supernatural phenomenon you have chosen not to believe in. \"This could be true\" is not the same as \"This is true\". In any realm of unknown principles, there are an infinite number of possible solutions. We cannot believe them all simultaneously, so therefore what do we do? We pick the one that is the simplest. Since we don't know anything about the birth of universes or beyond, the simplest explanation, for now, is that the universe is its own uncaused cause. To posit some other uncaused cause that can then cause this universe is an additional, unnecessary step. You can think it, that's fine. But that doesn't make it the simplest solution, nor the most likely.\n\nTo simplify: if you hear a crash in your house, you think \"Oh, that picture I leaned precariously on a ladder must have fallen\", not \"Oh, Leprechaun Unicorn Alien Ghosts are running wild!\" But you know what? It might be Leprechaun Unicorn Alien Ghosts. I'm just not going to think that unless I have a good reason to.\n\nNow, to the important stuff!\n\nWhat?Again, huh? Are you giving sentience to the uterine wall? If so, the uterine wall can feel fine to stop giving the fetus resources any time it wants.\n\nWell, the uterine wall is part of the mother, and the mother is sentient, so are you agreeing that the mother, who contains the uterine wall within herself, can feel fine to stop giving the fetus resources? Because that would be abortion: the mother refusing resources to the fetus and ejecting it from her body.\n\nWhat? Yes it does. A toddler cannot survive without a parentDo you advocate not feeding a child as an acceptable thing to do?\n\nOnce the parents have put the kid up for adoption (or even dropped the kid off at the nearest safe baby location), they no longer have any responsibility whatsoever for the kid, so at that point, yep, I don't think they have to feed the kid anymoreIf you admit to self-contradiction, though, then you should do your best to find out why.\n\nYou act like having a baby is the equivalent of being mugged.\n\nFor some women, it isPlease, tell me, at what point to the statistics become significant enough that women are allowed to make their own decisions about their own bodies?\n\nOverall, we're talking about what justifies the action of killing. Please explain why .0017% is statistically significant number when the field of statistics rejects it?\n\nI don't think you understand what statistics are. The field of statistics does not reject any statistic unless it's an invalid one. In terms of statistics, significant means that you may reject the \"null hypothesis\". In this circumstance, I believe that considering the wealth of data we have, we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference at all You believe that people do not have autonomy if it affects another's life. As mentioned in the essay I keep referring you to, \"If I am sick unto death, and the only thing that will save my life is the touch of Henry Fonda's cool hand on my fevered brow. then all the same, I have no right to be given the touch of Henry Fonda's cool hand on my fevered brow.\"\n\nOverall, we're talking about what justifies the action of killing. Please explain why .0017% is statistically significant number when the field of statistics rejects it?\n\nI do not think you understand what \"statistically significant\" means. One is not comparing whether the evidence for the existence of pregnancy-related death differs from the null hypothesis of \"storks are harmless.\" These are simple tallies. The number of zeros behind the decimal point doesn't matter.\n\n@Gavin: I think we're talking past each other here. I really don't give any sort of a damn whether the fetus is an invader or not. My right to decide what risks I take with my body, as well as my moral reluctance to bring an unwanted child into the world, transcends the fetus' supposed right to life.\n\nCancer is also a natural part of life, but I'm not going to insult your intelligence by assuming you're not aware of the existence of the sun and rocks.\n\nEven with an ideal medical system (which has only slightly more chance of blossoming into reality as a plush toy unicorn has of becoming a real unicorn), pregnancy still carries risk for the mother. Even after a routine pregnancy and with proper medical care, women have died of DVT, infection, or blood loss after prolonged childbirth. Statistics are interesting, albeit rarely accurate, but when gambling with my life, I'm interested in personal experience first, intuition second, and dodgy statistics third.\n\nThat being said, it seems that you're quite decided on this issue in black and white terms \u2013 if I ever get pregnant, perhaps you'd be willing to pay for my prenatal care and childbirth expenses? If not, I'll just have to get an abortion.\n\nJust kidding, I'd get an abortion even if there was a fantastic medical system in place. That's because I practice personal eugenics.\n\nI'm surprised that no-one has brought this into the \"Life debate\", but it sums it up for me:\n\"What 'right' to life has a man who is drowning in the Pacific? The ocean will not hearken to his cries. What 'right' to life has a man who must die if he is \" Robert A Heinlein\n\nWe have to make choices constantly: who to feed, clothe, how much and for how long to parcel out medical care? Whose streets are patrolled? Who is protected?\n\nYou can make the case that the essence of humanness is the ability to make choices. Growing a fetus to term is a choice. It may be the result of a choice (willing sex) or not (rape as commonly understood, meaning not what Akin was saying). And choosing your own life over that of a potential life, however you arrived at that necessity, cannot be gainsaid, else you are arguing that in all cases, innocence trumps independence.\n\nIf I follow your reasoning correctly, and I am not certain that I do, it seems you are saying that we may never penalize anyone for making any decision, ever. That, or you are presupposing that the fetus in not human, which is demonstrably untrue. (It possesses the requisite properties of being a living organism and we can be reasonably positive it will not grow into a fruit bat or an orca whale\u2026)\n\nA man in the ocean has a right to life \u2013 and a ship passing by has a duty to rescue him, if it does not put more lives in jeopardy. A man has a right to live and his children also have a right to live \u2013 if the man can rescue them within some reasonable threshold of risk, he is obligated to do so.\n\nWhen we say that a right is inalienable, we do not mean that the universe must abide by the right \u2013 just that people must (or must at least attempt to do so). If we, as a society, say that you have an inalienable right to cloud cover, it does not change the weather forecast. You could not sue the sky for being clear, or if you could, there would be no point in it.\n\nThe most compelling reason, it would seem, for maintaining abortions decriminalized status is not one of moral values (for rules against the deprivation of life where it can be avoided are beneficial to all participants) but of a socioeconomic reality (much like criminalizing drugs and alcohol) \u2026 you deter some small fraction of individuals who would otherwise engage in high risk behavior, while increasing the associated risks for the remaining majority. In this case, it would disproportionately afflict the lowest socioeconomic strata, driving them deeper into poverty and disenfranchisement.\n\n@Narad:\nFrom my understanding these are all functions that a brain dead person can occasionally perform. I'll also mention that the removal eventually killed the child too, with a brain infection caused by complications post surgery. Before this surgery, there had only ever been 9 attempts at the proceedure and all 9 had proven fatal. So at this point in time the risk of this proceedure is apparently 100% fatal.\n\nThis growth would never have developed into a human being with legitimate brain activity. I may be advocating life here, but I do not value people without brain activity. They are dead in my opinion. Removing a feeding tube or anything like that is only letting the body follow with. The biggest difference is that while these sorts of growth and brain dead people may be comprable to a fetus temporarily, they will never recover and the fetus will make marked improvements in about 9 months.\n\nIn response to you removing the head even had it been conscious, why are you ok with that? What about a 24 year-old Indian man who just wasn't able to afford the surgery. Would you be ok with them sedating the man and his twin screaming not to be killed just so that the head closest to the body may live a normal life? What if in 9 months the head would detach and begin growing into a perfectly normal human being?\n\nAs for the knowledge of whether or not a person is going to come out of a coma. Are you ok with killing people who are in a coma just because they haven't woken up for 9 months? People with fully functioning brains with all the brain activity of at least a sleeping individual? This twin head didn't seem to have even that. Again, even a brain dead or lobotomized patient can do that. This is a startling case, yes, but that head and body simply wasn't fully developed. If it was, please show me documentation and I'll agree that in the act of murdering one they accidentally killed the other.\n\nThe goal is that the fetus is living and human. This is simply to dismiss any claims that it is not. We should be debating on the point of humanity and not arguing over something that is actually scientifically on the pro-life side. I am regularly shocked if the conservative side ever errs on the side of science but this is that instance.\n\nThe legitimate points that pro-choice proponents can make are on the importance of humanity to life and on the obligation or non-obligation to the life their body is supporting. Those are legitimate concepts that can be argued. But the point that it is not a living human at its earliest stage of life is silly, like a tadpole is some other species or is nonliving before it grows into a frog.\n\nYou take my point that it is human life to be my silver bullet. It isn't. It is merely reframing the discussion to arrive at the necessary components that are the heart of the matter. This discussion has largely moved past whether or not it is a human life. That seems to have been accepted on face scientific value. But they are correct in moving onto the point that a brain dead living body is no less human life and yet is rightly allowed to die without it being considered murder. So there is yet a little more to a valuable life worth protecting than just DNA and being alive (metabolizing).\n\nMy argument is that the idea that 9 months will see the living body achieve that brain activity.\nTheir argument is that doesn't matter or at least doesn't justify forcing a woman not to remove it.\n\n@grifter I'll respond to you in a followup post.\n\n@Random Encounter\nThere is a difference between saying that we can't know God exists and therefore I don't believe in God until evidence exists and saying that there IS NO God. One is stating non-belief based on a lack of evidence, the other is stating a fact without evidenceThere are only three categories and they are truly seperate:\n\n1. There is at least one divine being.\n2. There may or may not be at least one divine being.\n3. There are NO divine beings.\n\n2 and 3 are in no way the same thing, just as 1 and 2 are in no way the same thing. To say they are is to ignore basic components. Agnosticism is the only true form of non-belief. It's belief withheld until further evidence warrants taking a side.\n\nSo, again, agnostics have the most ground to stand on.\n\n@M. This is your last post, not the longer one I'm responding to here (I'll make a longer post with you and Grifter in it next).\n\nThis is the quote of that republican. Her only failure in this comment is that she tied the statement to God. Such a statement further ties abortion to religion and were it only a religious principle then there would be no justification in making people obey the tenets of someone else's religion (yay, first amendments!).\n\nOther than that, replace God with providence, the randomness of life, nature, or any other deity or non-deity one can think of. Replace bless with chanced, luck, or anything else, even misfortuned. The statement is valid from her perspective, but it's like she assumed that her audience would be necessarily Christian. *sigh* You know, it's funny, I'm a registered republican from my high school days and yet I never seem to vote that way because of the dummies I have to choose from. If it's not trying to put laws in place that harm the poor then it's trying to force their beliefs on people (like gays, seriously, in a religion that believes that God is the one that puts people together why do they think a piece of paper forces His hand?). They have done more to harm the image of Christianity than any atheist could ever do.\n\nThe relative \"humanity\", for the purposes of \"rights\" (as opposed to in the purely informational/DNA sense), is one of the subjects up for debate. You cannot declare it true by fiat.\n\nAnd, for the record, this:\n\n\"A man has a right to live and his children also have a right to live \u2013 if the man can rescue them within some reasonable threshold of risk, he is obligated to do so.\"\n\n\n\nWhat John Beaty's quote and further statements are saying (IMHO) is more that one has a right over oneself, as that is the only right that doesn't inherently either infringe on another's right, or assert something to which nature will not assent (you can't make demands of the ocean). The fetus' \"right to life\" in this sense is absolute, but not the fetus' \"right to enslave its mother\". The fact that if the mother asserts her own rights to autonomy and ejects it, it will die, is simply an unfortunate reality, as much as if a man is drowning in the ocean. The woman is not trying to assert control over the fetus per se, as if it lived she wouldn't care, but she wants it out of her body, and it is her body.\n\n@Grifter:\nFor the sake of page length I'll continue trying to shorten things as best as possible. Let me know if there's a particular point you feel I am just avoiding. I feel that way about my analogy of the evil doctor. Brought up twice but never responded to.\n\nAgnostic is NOT EQUAL to \"There is no evidence either way\", and \"There is no evidence either way\" is NOT EQUAL to \"Therefore both positions have equal logic to them.\n\nWhat? I never said that. Agnosticism is that \"There is no evidence either way therefore belief or belief against are unfounded. One is true we cannot know which given the current evidence.\"\n\nIIt may be subtle, but it is distinct. Atheism and theism is belief. Agnosticism is reserved belief or non-belief. You can believe that something exists or believe that the thing does not exist but to with hold belief until further evidence is not either side. It's an \"I don't know\". \"I don't know\" but there is no God doesn't make sense just as \"I don't know\" but there is a God doesn't make sense. You're stating the impossibility of knowing and then making a claim.\n\nSo, to anyone who has adopted \"agnostic\" in front of their actual belief system just so they can have another big word to say when someone asks what cosmological view they have, no, that's not the proper use of the term.\n\nYou: \"Gavin, do you believe in my brother?\" Me: \"I don't know, I've never seen any evidence to confirm or deny his existence. But he doesn't exist!\" It's as if you're trying to say you can't know the truth and then insist on taking a stance.\n\nLet's go to Merriam on this, shall we?\n\n1: a person who holds the view that any ultimate reality (as God) is unknown and probably unknowable; broadly: one who is not committed to believing in either the existence or the nonexistence of God or a god\n\n2: a person who is unwilling to commit to an opinion about something\n\nSo no, you cannot commit to a side and then retain agnosticism. You may have your cake, but not eat it too. I am on the side of theism, you are on the side of atheism. That's ok. But neither of us are agnostic even if further evidence may change our side. That just means we're willing to adjust our beliefs based on new information. Being willing to change your position isn't agnosticism. It's not having a side because there isn't enough information to choose one to begin with. I know I was unaware of one particular verse. But employedWhile you are correct, that it is a logically coherent hypothesis, it is not a logically necessary one. As you admit, our knowledge breaks down at the Universe creation stage.\n\nOh, I agree completely that it is not a logically necessary one. My entire point is that one may believe in Theism based on rational scientific evidence even if that is not the only necessary conclusion. I assume you'll agree with me in the perception that people of faith are typically quite ignorant and will disagree with science that hits them in the face if they feel it contradicts their blind faith. I believe, given the evidence I have presented that I have enough evidence to choose a side. I likewise understand that this is a subjective choice and why someone might lean the other wayAgain, the idea that something created the universe implies that this something/deity/being also existed before the universe in which the laws are applicable. As you stated, we do not know the laws of any previous universe or whatever would have existed before this one so the need of cause and effect does not necessarily apply to this being. So, again, there is no need to establish the creation of a being existing before the universe we're talking about because the laws He would have created would not necessarily apply to him/it/her/them.\n\nIf He was Himself created and if His creator was likewise created all the way forever in the past, that is fine and not of concern to the creation of this Universe. Such things would have happened in a potentially drastically different universe where not even time progresses sequentially. All we can know is what this present universe's laws demand. I have no problem with universes before or coinciding with this one. Perhaps a random universe just bled into this space and that universe would then be our creator. The issue would be with the universe as it is presently understood existing without a cause either infinitely or starting at one point as both ideas are contrary to modern scientific principles, in my opinion.\n\nAt the risk of being offensively repetitious so as not to have to repeat this point even one more time, I will spell it out more clearly:\n\n1. This universe has the principle of cause and effect as seen in all observable events.\n2. No other universe necessarily has this principle in it or any other principle.\n3. The being or object that may have caused this universe would necessarily not have been part of this universe it created and would therefore not be held accountable for the laws or principles which they created after their own existence was already established through whatever means or nonmeans (unless we're stuck in some sort of truly wacky time paradox in which a future element of the universe travels back in time and creates the set/universe in which itself was created).\n\nI likewise take objection to the notion that an infinite number of universes means that an infinite number of conditions also exist. For example, a second universe where \"I\" exist as a sniper clown bent on avenging the death of my all knowing latino dog. I do not believe that an infinite number of monkeys with an infinite number of typewriters and time would necessarily ever produce a work of Shakespeare or perhaps any other work of literature. I believe that certain rules would need to be put in place to generate coherent and significantly complex results or else you could just wind up with an infinite number of duplicates or nonsense. A computer program that is not allowed to generate duplicates, for example, would necessarily eventually produce complex works, but that is a new condition. There being odds that something \"can\" happen doesn't mean that it will even when exposed to the incomprehensible notion of infinity. This is a reason why I believe some sort of rules have been put in place at least for this universe that can support life and a remarkably complex yet reliable system of laws and principles. Another reason why I would expect a creator or a creator's creator to be sentient at some point. Theory, not fact, I'll admit. But not irrationally concieved.\n\nAt the risk of sounding insulting, please learn more about science then. In particular, look up \"vacuum fluctuations\".\n\nThis is why I initially stated that I would be happy to also discuss particle physics. I was ahead of you but I didn't want to assume that you would want to delve into this stuff. I don't presuppose that people have the same education and background that I do so I let them choose whether or not they want to breach this topic for discussion.\n\nSee the quote below:\n\nBrowne, Malcolm W. (1990-08-21). \"New Direction in Physics: Back in Time\". The New York Times. Retrieved 2010-05-22. \"According to quantum theory, the vacuum contains neither matter nor energy, but it does contain fluctuations, transitions between something and nothing in which potential existence can be transformed into real existence by the addition of energy.(Energy and matter are equivalent, since all matter ultimately consists of packets of energy.) Thus, the vacuum's totally empty space is actually a seething turmoil of creation and annihilation, which to the ordinary world appears calm because the scale of fluctuations in the vacuum is tiny and the fluctuations tend to cancel each other out.\" So we have the additional problem of terminology getting in the way of what's actually going on. If we get to a point of technology where we can actually observe that something is being caused by nothing at all then that will be pretty amazing. AsWhoa, a \"full\" human life? The term \"full\" is technically a strawman A human life that will never develop into a sentient being is not what I'm concerned about. It's a human life that is already connected to everything it needs to develop all the way. TheDo you disagree with me or are you just trying to create an inconsistency? Keep in mind that I am developing my argument as we are discussing this. You are aiding me immensely, iron sharpens iron as they say. I would not have considered the necessity of implanting to human life without this dicussion nor would I have thought of revisiting the claim that a sperm is itself a seed. It's not, it's part of the makeup of a seed that it and the women's gamete make upiting the \"parasite\", the parasite would die. Do you advocate starving an infant or toddler as an acceptable practice? Or are those parents correctly arrested and convicted for doing so? There This will, of course, cause a myriad of other problems but I am not a utilitarian. At least not with regards to ending innocent human life.\n\nIf you admit to self-contradiction, though, then you should do your best to find out whyPlease, tell me, at what point to the statistics become significant enough that women are allowed to make their own decisions about their own bodies?\n\nThis is something that will have to be decided on. Currently, .0017% is not considered to be a statistically significant number. Especially when a percentage of those 17 out of 100,000 are mothers who were warned of complications and went ahead with it anyways. Some also include an unusual increase in home birthing (apparently people think that nothing will ever go wrong so they want to have the child at home with a nurse and no doctor or legitimate emergency medical equipment in sight). With this in mind, I'd put the number even lower to healthy pregnancies that end in the hospital.\n\nThere is some threshold at which it is a legitimate threat to another human life. The question really is what that number should be and how it should be decided. What is the threshold where it's ok to seperate two conjoined twins if one is all but certain to die? The number should at least be riskier than that of normal child birth. Remember, we're talking about two lifes. We're seeing at what point optimizing the outcome of life would be necessary\n\nThe government prevents people from killing eachother. The government protects the defenseless as best it can. If we are talking about human life then we should have laws in place.\n\nAgain, the only possible comparison that can be drawn is with being a conjoined twin in which one would die if removed. If left alone, they both leave and the problem resolves, if dealt with now one dies. This is not an issue of legislating what a woman does with her body, this legislates when it's ok to kill a human life.\n\n@M.:\n\nBut see, if you accept that it is personal eugenics (albeit in jest?) and that you are ending an unwanted life, then there's not really an argument here. Just a philosophical difference on the value of human life. I would personally finance and even adopt to my limit but at the end of the day I do not have faith in my fellow man (let alone the republicans who claim to be against it and yet want to diminish medical care to the poor) to step it up and do the same.\n\nAll you're confirming is that you believe that your personal lifestyle is more important than another human life. Beyond that there is only ethics to decide who is wrong and who is right and I'd say that currently society (the ultimate decider of ethics in the absence of a common deity) is on your side. So this is the impasse I expected to reach.\n\nI don't believe all sorts of things. Not believing in gods in general and yours in specific is no different for me than not believing in Gandalf the Grey.\n\nI ask again, do you actively disbelieve in Thor, or is his existence or lack thereof simply irrelevant to your worldview?\n\nThere is no need for me to replace gods with anything, because I do not have a need to believe that there is a purpose behind everything that happens. Life ain't fair, and then you die.\n\nWhat are you trying to argue against? I'm stating that atheism is believing that something does not exist, agnosticism is with-holding judgment until evidence either way is presented, and theism is saying at least one god exists.\n\nHow does anything I have said imply that you have to believe in something or replace belief with something? Why does me believing or not believing in Thor have anything to do with any part of the discussion? I don't believe in Thor. Sure, I don't have evidence that he does or does not exist, but I'm also taking the additional step of saying I believe he does not. If belief in Thor was \"Thorism\", I'd be an Athorist.\n\n@Gavin: I'm entirely serious about personal eugenics. With my genetics, it would be grossly irresponsible and probably cruel for me to have children. That's one area that pro-lifers utterly fail to address \u2013 what quality of life will the baby be afforded by not only nurture, but nature? Of course, I don't promote telling people that they can't, or even shouldn't, reproduce due to genetic unfitness; however, the world would be a much happier place if people performed that critical examination for themselves. Of course, sometimes they do and accidents happen. For those of us who don't buy the really na\u00efve idea that life is always worth living just because it's there, abortion becomes not only a freedom, but the ethical solution.\n\nThere is still nothing to make me believe an unborn fetus is any more a human life than a cancer cell is. Both are living organisms of human genesis. The argument that a fetus has the potential to become a human being not only chases its own tail, but opens up a vast can of worms as to the significance of potential both before and after birthI feel that way about my analogy of the evil doctor. Brought up twice but never responded to.\n\nI did respond to it, though, when I referenced that article that addresses that very concept, so I hope yo ufeel it's been sufficiently responded to now.\n\nWhat? I never said that. Agnosticism is that \"There is no evidence either way therefore belief or belief against are unfounded. One is true we cannot know which given the current evidence.\" IIf you do not assert \"At least one deity exists\" is a true statement, you are by definition an atheist.\n\nIt may be subtle, but it is distinct. Atheism and theism is belief. Agnosticism is reserved belief or non-belief.\nSo no, you cannot commit to a side and then retain agnosticism.\n\nYes, you can. For example:\n\n\"Hmm, I don't know for sure if Gavin has a brother, but I don't think so\" is agnostic. So is \"I am not sure, but I think he does\".\n\nAgain, please look deeper than just to confirm your own preconceptions.\n\n\"a person who holds the view that any ultimate reality (as God) is unknown and probably unknowable;\" does not necessitate that you not take a position one way or another. Again, in the absence of evidence one generally assumes the null hypothesis.\n\nBut employedThe issue would be with the universe as it is presently understood existing without a cause either infinitely or starting at one point as both ideas are contrary to modern scientific principles, in my opinion.\n\nAgain, it is in no way contrary to modern scientific principles. The laws within the universe do not apply to its birth. Any assertion you make about a god could just as easily be applied to the universe's birth.\n\nTheory, not fact, I'll admit. But not irrationally concieved.\n\nActually, it's 100% irrationally conceived. You disbelieve something you know to be mathematically true (that given infinity and random chance, every possible scenario will happen). You base that on a feeling. That is by definition irrational.So we have the additional problem of terminology getting in the way of what's actually going on. If we get to a point of technology where we can actually observe that something is being caused by nothing at all then that will be pretty amazing.\n\nWe're already at that point. The only problem is that we are forced to acknowledge that it's always possible we'll find a deeper reason.\n\nAsExcept the things we haven't, which you've discounted.\n\nWhoa, a \"full\" human life? The term \"full\" is technically a strawman.\n\nNo, it's not. I am willing to accept it may be poor phrasing, but it's not a strawman. I attempted (and I apologize for being unclear) to use the term to demarcate a human life with rights versus one without rights, because your original argument was that as soon as the DNA is combined, it's human and deserving of rights, but then you qualified it to say that that's not so until it also implants\n\nNo, it doesn't. It requires to mother's nutrients, and for her to continue to supply it with them, or it will die as surely as if it never implanted.\n\nA human life that will never develop into a sentient being is not what I'm concerned about. It's a human life that is already connected to everything it needs to develop all the way.TheThis is where your analogy fails, because conjoined twins are conjoined from birth. They don't just get stuck together randomlyAnd, again, the soil analogy fails. Either they are human lives or they are not. If they are not, you need to give a coherent reason they are notiting the \"parasite\", the parasite would die. Do you advocate starving an infant or toddler as an acceptable practice? Or are those parents correctly arrested and convicted for doing so?\n\nAs I said, there are ways to absolve that responsibility without letting the child die, so therefore doing so is negligence. As you said, there Because at that point, we can allow women to assert the rights of their own bodily autonomy without also killing the growing lifeform. That doesn't mean that, in the absence of that technology, women therefore lose their autonomyIt is, indeed, better to acknowledge the self conflict rather than tryign to pretend it's not there. However, the best thing is to admit its existence and try to resolve itThis is something that will have to be decided on.\n\nSorry if it wasn't clear, but I was being facetious. I don't believe you have the right to tell a woman \"well, this is twice as likely to kill you, but really, it's very unlikely overall, so I won't let you have your own autonomy\".\n\nWhat is the threshold where it's ok to seperate two conjoined twins if one is all but certain to die?\n\nI and others have rejected yoru conjoined twins analogy, so continuing to equate the situations is not a legitimate tactic.\n\nRemember, we're talking about two lifes. We're seeing at what point optimizing the outcome of life would be necessary.\n\nRemember, we're talking about two lives in your opinion.\n\nThe government prevents people from killing eachother. The government protects the defenseless as best it can. If we are talking about human life then we should have laws in place.\n\nIf someone will starve to death if I don't give them my food, I have no legal obligation to give them my food. Do you think there should be a law to that effect?\n\nThis is not an issue of legislating what a woman does with her body, this legislates when it's ok to kill a human life.\n\nBullshit. It is 100% an issue of legislating what a woman can do with her own body. You are saying \"for 9 months, this body is not yours\". I reject that.\n\nI was not attempting to claim it by fiat, but by demonstration. Relative humanity is an interesting concept \u2013 are some humans more human than other humans? And some are less human than other humans?\n\nBeing \"human\" is not a continuum \u2013 you will not meet someone who is ninety-eight percent human and two percent blowfish (at least not until our genetic engineering takes a few leaps forward). Human is a definition \u2013 just as being a living organism is a definition \u2013 when a thing meets the criterion, it is human (or alive, respectively).\n\nWith regards to: \"A man has a right to live and his children also have a right to live \u2013 if the man can rescue them within some reasonable threshold of risk, he is obligated to do so.\"\nand your subsequent response:\" \"\n\nAs I noted, if it is within some reasonable threshold of risk, he is expected to do what he can. You are not legally obligated to enter a burning building to save your child \u2013 but you are expected to take reasonable measures to ensure your child does not die. If you fail to do that, to my understanding, you are guilty of criminal negligence/manslaughter.\n\nMy apologies, but as I do every day, it is time for me to go home. Home where I have computers and internet but choose not to use them like I have to all day at work.\n\n@M.: I understand what you mean. The difference is that people think that the vagina ends in a magic curtain that seperates \"the world\" from \"the not world\". I maintain, as I'm sure you understand, that the fetus is already in the world, just in its earliest stage of life. I'll remind you, that the doctor strongly recommended that my mother-in-law abort her daughter because she would be severely mentally handicapped. My wife is not only the smartest of her family but also well above average in IQ. She's extremely capable and has no noticeable defect. Had my mother-in-law listened to her doctor's recommendation the world would now be that much darker. I don't think that a lower quality of life necessarily means we should just get to kill it. The world is not a better place without kids with downsyndrome, for example. They add their own touch to it.\n\nOn the flip side, you're right that some people simply shouldn't reproduce. Look at Beethoven's horribly inbred family with everyone having at least one severe disability. Even if people with \"bad\" genes are personally careful not to do so, things like rape take that control away. This whole situation is made all the shittier because that's what rape does, it makes the woman feel powerless along with so many other things and to then have to carry an unwanted child for 9 months is an atrocity. I understand this. I hate this. My claim that the fetus is a living human being is not to diminish the effect pyschologically and physically on the woman, it's simply to defend what I believe is an innocent, helpless life. The person at fault is the rapist and they should be punished all the more harsher. The person that is not at fault is the life. I get that you don't agree with me and that's completely your prerogative. I'm just trying to illustrate where I'm coming from. It's not \"My God doesn't want you doing that\".\n\n@Random Encounter:Ah, your responses to me are on the topic in general from your own response. My apologies. I thought you were responding to a specific point.\n\nIn these comments I have presented adequate reasons to consider the theory of theism. I have also explained why I feel that there is sentience behind God. What I haven't spoken to is the decision of who God is specifically. I can tell you logically why I believe God exists or existed if the term God may be used loosely. What I cannot tell you logically is why I choose Christianity in particular. Well, I can, but it would make no difference to you.\n\nI would posit that religions, even false ones, are typically created for good purposes and later used to oppress. Christianity did not enact the crusades nor the inquisitions. Spain, England, One very corrupt set of leadership in the church did. But not the religion itself. I'm sure you also see a very different lesson being taught in Christianity that you see in the actions of so many of its adherrants. This speaks to dumbassedness of man and not necessarily to any sort of corruption in the religion itself. I'd like to see your general response to this tomorrow so we can discuss it more when I have time.\n\n@Gavin: It would be patently ridiculous to say that the fetus isn't \"in the world.\" Outside of Intro to Philosophy debates and some dodgy theoretical physics, I'm pretty sure anyone would agree that the mother's body is in the world and that the inside of her uterus isn't some alternate dimension.\n\nAs to the eugenics discussion, I am not talking about aborting anyone based on what they do or don't have to offer the world. I believe that there's no such thing as a valueless, irredeemable person. To me, there was some shining fragment of good even in Hitler or bin Laden; if something worthwhile was hiding in them, a kid with Down's syndrome is most definitely worthwhile. I don't believe that anyone has to justify their existence, since being born isn't a choice made by the one being born. I don't believe in the validity of vacuous ideas like a \"a normal person\" or strict definitions of a good person, because to me variety and a certain amount of discord are what make life interesting. When I refer to personal eugenics, I'm talking strictly about choosing not to reproduce for the sake of preventing undue suffering by the individual in question. Preventative euthanasia, if you will. Obviously this isn't a serious consideration for most people, but when it matters, it really matters. My personal bodily integrity aside, that's why my right to abortion matters so much to me.\n\nI would much rather never get an abortion. Not only do I feel a little ill thinking about the procedure itself, but the truth is that I actually really want children on an emotional and visceral level; I'm not sure I would have the fortitude to go through with it, or even put the kid up for adoption afterward. Hence, I am very careful. Doctors won't sterilize me because of my age; I've actually looked into medical tourism to resolve the issue once and for all, and would probably have done it by now if not for being laid off. Speaking frankly, however, sex is one of the few things in life my complement of depression-related disorders lets me enjoy, and I refuse to give it up. If shit happens and our society would really rather I have a half-dozen abortions than one lousy hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy, so be it.\n\nMy mother (a religious individual) has a church friend whose husband and two of her three children died of Huntington's disease. By all accounts, they each led productive (if brief, when compared to the current average) lives. Yet, she feels guilty for having had children (even though her daughter does not have the mutated gene). Her second son died only two years ago. Neither of her son's had children, though they were both married (one of them twice).\n\nI find that odd. Every human dies. Every human suffers. If someone suffers too greatly and can demonstrate a sane and rational mindset for decision making, I think auto-euthanasia should be medically (and legally) available.\n\nBut terminating life because we deem its suffering too great to bear does not seem like a kindness to that life; regardless of my suffering, I would desire to at least retain the illusion of control over whether I live or die.\n\nAnyways, my point is that you do not have some grand obligation to the human gene pool; if you want children, you should have them. Diversity is actually superior to monoculture, in terms of the long-term survival of our (or any) species. Some lethal pandemic that spares only people with your particular malady could manifest itself.\n\nSo people who don't have sane and rational mindsets should be forced to live no matter how much they suffer, regardless of their desires otherwise? What of people who can't communicate? Obviously it would be monstrous to assume that they're suffering so much that they wish for death, but after watching others suffer from various chronic and terminal illnesses, I can't imagine not feeling guilty for bringing a life of what appeared to be nothing but suffering into the world, even if there was no way to know beforehand. Yes, everyone dies sooner or later, but when you suffer profoundly in life, sometimes death is no longer the worst thing. However, we must allow people to make that decision for themselves; my argument in favor of abortion (in this context) is simply the desire to not put my hypothetical offspring into that situation to begin with when I know that there's a particularly high risk. Both of my parents were gravely mentally ill, and while I don't regret or resent my entire life by any means, I often wish they had practiced my preaching. For me, the ultimate gift of love for my children is never forcing them to live to begin with, at least until gene therapy or effective treatments for the family ailments exist and are affordable.\n\nI've long been a proponent of a government-funded-and-run auto-euthanasia program, but I believe it should be open to anyone over the age of 25. I do not fit your \"sane and rational mindset for decisionmaking\" according to many.\n\n@Everyone: Thank you. I usually find myself drowning in the scorn and self-righteous loathing of others when I haul these particular opinions of mine out in public, so this is refreshing!\n\nM.:\nThank you for making it personal. It's easy to debate things on a macro-philosophical level and forget the struggles of the individuals. Forgetting that people are real and do have shit happen to them or shit to deal with is exactly the sort of mindset that creates asshole comments like what Akin said to start this article. For what it's worth, I do think you should have control of your own body. If you want a sterilization procedure and are a consenting adult, then so be it. It's just after a fetus is attached to your body that your body is technically shared in the same way conjoined twins share organs. As I said before, I do not in any way adhere to the \"every sperm is sacred\" dogma nor am I a Roman Catholic by any stretch of the imagination (though I suspect many RCCers disagree with that dogma too, if only in practice). So any sort of pregnancy provention is ok in my book.\n\nI find it interesting that you can accept that this is a sort of \"Preventative Euthanasia\". I hope you can at least understand why someone might be against you choosing death for another person. I understand that the difference in opinion of the value of that life or its right to life isn't really a gulf that we can cross since at this point it reaches an ethical quandary. I could cite the constitution or all that jazz as well as right to life philosophy but at the end of the day the current laws (albeit in conflict with the constitution in my opinion) and societal norms are on your side.\n\n@Narad:\nI'm only misusing statistically significant in that statistical significance generally applies to the liklihood something could have occured by chance. I understand that improbable is a more accurate word but I want to say something stronger than just \"improbable\". 99.99% isn't just overwhelmingly more likely than the .017%. .017% is practically a non-factor. Especially This Let's also not forget that abortion also carries risk, the same amount of risk that having a miscarriage at that stage of pregnancy (whatever stage it happens at).\n\nKeep in mind, this is most nearly equivalent to a conjoined twin scenario. Only the risk to the dominant twin is miniscule whereas the non-dominant twin's (the fetus') risk of dying in the case of seperation is the exact flip side of that. Not only that, but the problem self-resolves after 9 months and neither side has to die.\n\nThis isn't a scenario where a perfectly healthy person would have to drag around a brain-dead lump of flesh for the rest of their life.\n\nGranted, your last post wasn't directed at me, but I can't help but notice:\n\nYou keep pushing the \"conjoined twin\" scenario\u2026 you do realize there's a clear line of demarcation between the mother and the fetus, right?\n\nIt seems as you you're saying that (to use a comparable analogy), by being plugged into the electrical outlet of a house, a blender becomes part of the house, and you can't tell which part is house and which is blender.\n\n@Gavin\nI see your point.\nActually, put so succinctly, I *remember* your point.\n\nIt's just that somewhere along the line I rejected magic and the rest went with it.\n\nThough I do think that the magical viewpoint can inform our thinking in these matters, it still gives contradictory information. Few traditions actually recognize a new life as fully human before birth. Ironically it is modern medicine that has opened up the possibility of being upset about the fate of a fetus only a few weeks old.\n\nFrom the magical perspective, the important point is when does a person have a soul? Being alive is evidently insufficient or all animals would have souls. Nobody would claim that the life of an Irish Setter was more valuable than even the health of a woman, so is DNA that makes a fetus *potentially* human sufficient to tip that balance?\n\nIf that is sufficient, then there are vast swaths of activities short of deliberate abortion that it would be considered seriously immoral for women of childbearing age to participate in, because of the potential for a miscarriage or damage to a fetus she doesn't yet know she is carrying.\n\nSo that being the case, I'm of the opinion that there should be no legal restrictions whatsoever on first trimester abortions.\n\nBeyond that point I am willing to accept that there can be reasons sufficient to justify an abortion up to the point of likely viability if birth is given prematurely, though I personally think that no law is needed here and the moral standards of the medical community are up to the task of ensuring that these only happen when necessary. carry their rapist's child to term).\n\nI'm only misusing statistically significant in that statistical significance generally applies to the liklihood something could have occured by chanceI keep pretending that it means something completely different from what it actually means.\n\nFTFY.\n\nI understand that improbable is a more accurate word but I want to say something stronger than just \"improbable\". 99.99% isn't just overwhelmingly more likely than the .017%. .017% is practically a non-factor.\n\n17 deaths per 100,000 live births is not a \"non-factor.\" Do you know what the number of motor-vehicle fatalities was per 100,000 population in 2009? 11.2. Moreover, it's not even the proper number to use in this regard, as the risk is cumulative. The lifetime risk of maternal death in the U.S. in 2010 was 1 in 2400.\n\nEspecially\n\nSpare me. Quantify it or drop it.\n\nThis\n\n@Gavin: I don't know where you're from, but the societal norms around here are resoundingly anti-abortion. And pro-death penalty, funnily enough. \"Life is absolutely sacred! Always! Every life is worthwhile! I mean, unless we don't like them.\"\n\nAgain, I don't consider a fetus to be a person, and not as a matter of moral convenience. The pro-life side of the argument I've dealt with has never come up with anything more compelling than \"because we said so!\", which doesn't do it for me personally.\n\nNarad: I forgot to bold your name in my above post. Please look at it for my response.\n\nGrifter:\n\nI would have missed your post if you hadn't said thatYou literally just posted a source saying that agnosticism is the belief that we cannot know if God exists or not. It is directly a source backing everything I have said on this point.\n\nAgain, God exists/existed = Theism, God does not exist = Atheism.\n\nGod may or may not exist = Agnosticism\n\nNow, this may be the point of contention here. This could be for all the chips on the table:\n\nDo you say you do not believe that God exists.\n\nand/or\n\nDo you believe that God does not exist?\n\nThe two seemingly identical sentences have a key difference. One is just a lack of belief, one is a belief in absense.\n\nTraditionally, in broad and narrow senses, and with the etiology of the term, atheism is the rejection of belief in God. As I've stated, more recently people have begun to add the term agnostic in front of their belief and they have done so incorrectly. Again, I'll direct you to the Merriam Webster dictionary:\n\n1 archaic: ungodliness, wickedness\n\n2 a: a disbelief in the existence of deity b: the doctrine that there is no deity\n\nI am bringing this up because the newer tendency to apply it to lack of belief is innaccurate in every way. AtheUnless you mean that you're an atheist in the arcaic sense. At which case I must ask, are you coming on to me? Hah.\n\nAgain, it is in no way contrary to modern scientific principles. The laws within the universe do not apply to its birth. Any assertion you make about a god could just as easily be applied to the universe's birthNo, vacuum energy is the zero-point energy of all the known fields in space. It is not \"empty\" space, it's just the ground state of the fields. Again, particle physicists really suck at naming things. But there is supposed to be a cosmological constant with positive values thanks to the findings on cosmic acceleration in the late 90's.\n\nYou should read the zero-point energy controversy at the bottom of the page. This cannot be used in violation of conservation of energy The burden of proof on proving random should be MUCH higher than almost anything else. Because they would be claiming for the first time that there is no deeper level to go, no actual cause. This would be the end of scientific discovery in this area (very exciting, but unlikely).\n\nWe're already at that point. The only problem is that we are forced to acknowledge that it's always possible we'll find a deeper reason.\n\nThat's because this has ALWAYS been the case. What's that definition of insanity? You're pointing at an incredibly new area of science that people are still hammering out and that people still disagree firmly on all sides. There are a ton of other theories that are also still considered No, wait until things are settled or at least finally accepted. Check out consistency with the Lorentz covariance and the magnitude of the planck constant. It mentions it in the first paragraph of the link you cited to vacuum energy. They need the vacuum energy to be much higher than the 10^-9 joules.\n\nNo, it doesn't. It requires to mother's nutrients, and for her to continue to supply it with them, or it will die as surely as if it never implanted.\n\nThere is a significant difference in my position between saving a life and killing a life. Hooking a life up to the nutrients would be saving it. Cutting it off from them would be killing it. Clear?Well then, that sounds like convenient knowledge for people to know. A passive form of abortion. Like not opening a door when you know someone has been trapped on the other side. Not strictly ethical, but not murder.\n\nThis is where your analogy fails, because conjoined twins are conjoined from birth. They don't just get stuck together randomly.\n\nThis is your least sensical statement so far. Randomly? Connected from birth? It Do you personally consider a tomato seed to be a tomato plant? Keep in mind, the tomato seed does have fertilizer in it (endosperm) just like the zygote. The Zygote is still human just as a tomato seed is still\u2026 um\u2026 a plant? But it can't go anywhere until implanted just like a seed can't and just like a plant seed eventually runs out of its own stock of fertilizer and dies, so will a zygote. This discussion has helped me flesh out why I can't quite see a zygote as life yet. For that I am truly grateful to you.\n\nBullshit. It is 100% an issue of legislating what a woman can do with her own body. You are saying \"for 9 months, this body is not yours\". I reject that.\n\nAnd I reject your dismissal of the conjoined twin comparison. It is stroke for stroke identical except in the \"twin\" part. These are conjoined human beings. For 9 months, you are conjoined.\n\nDoes a conjoined twin not have a right to their own body? If one conjoined twin kills him/herself and the other dies, have they merely committed suicide or suicide and murder?I'm late to pick up my wife from her job already with my last response. Very productive work day for me too. I'll even be traveling out of town today so I can't post more this weekend even if I wanted to.\n\nI think the difference in the conjoined twin analogy is that conjoined twins are extremely rare and always unique. Ethical decisions must be made on an individual basis. No one is talking about creating legislation governing how they should be managed.\n\nThe abortion issue would be much less acrimonious if no one were trying to come up with laws to cover all women and all fetuses at all stages of pregnancy, in all states of health, under all circumstances of conception and facing all possible social situations for the mother and child.\n\nI'm impressed that as much as people here in this thread disagree, they are presenting substantive arguments and reading/responding to each other's tl;dr posts.\n\nIt isn't actually practical to try to stop women from having medical abortions by passing laws \u2014 especially since we can't seem to stop the spamvertised viagra pouring over our borders. I wish the ProLife movement leaders would get their heads out of their butts and see that. If they really want to prevent abortions, rather than just pass meaningless laws, they should be trying to get people to stop thinking of being for or against abortion as a knee-jerk position, and try to get them to seriously consider it as an ethical decision requiring personal reflection.\n\nYou put a bit at the end of your last reply that I feel should be dealt with separately, and before the rest of my response.Okay. The first thing required for me to accept your analogy is to accept the equal humanity of the fetus and the mother. As DNA is nothing but code, I do not. We don't give dead bodies the same rights as live ones, despite having identical DNA. I still believe consciousness is the first requirement of \"humanity\" in the sense we're using it here, which is to say the sense that it gets the rights we think of as inherent in \"humanity\". As such, I reject your argument on its merits for certainly the first several weeks of development, as there is no nervous system that could possibly possess consciousness. I do believe there is a qualitative difference between \"never awake\" and \"asleep for now\", particularly since the \"never awake\" doesn't possess the ability to possibly be awake, until further along in development, so that it's not even a question (as opposed to a debate about how much consciousness is present in sleeping or comatose patients, considering we know there there's at least something going on in the ol' brainbuckets).\n\nBut let's say I do accept your hypothesis, or that we're talking about a fetus more fully developed, with an actual brain. We don't know that there's no consciousness, so I'm willing to err on the side of assuming, for argument's sake, that there might be some and that therefore there IS some.\n\nI still disagree with your conjoined twins analogy because, in the case of conjoined twins, they have identical DNA, so we don't know which parts of whose bodies are whose, a point I'll mention again in the longer post to the rest of your post (I wrote that bit first, before noticing this section of yours at the end where you said we \"cannot progress further\" until this is settled). Thus, if we say they share a heart, and that one of them has it in his chest, it's only a quirk of development that it ended up there, there's no certainty \"whose it is\".\n\nBut you love your analogy, so I will try to address my own arguments against it and rephrase the analogy:\n\nLet's pretend, for the moment, that there are a set of conjoined twins with different DNA, which would therefore remove one objection to your analogy. One of the twins (we'll call him Hedwig) is just a head on the other twin (we'll call him Arnold)'s back, with a placenta-type connection. Hedwig somehow remained in a strange stasis until Arnold was 18, then grew (bear with me, of course, for the implausible bits).\n\nLet's say Hedwig has vocal cords, but no esophagus. He cannot eat or fend for itself in any way, and he relies on Arnold for mobility, since he can never be joined with the nervous system of Arnold. In fact, he doesn't even have real lungs, so while he can talk with his vocal cords, he can't even metabolize oxygen without Arnold doing the work. I think that is a less arguable analogy (though it doesn't address the 9month timeline part of the argument, but\u2026one step at time, neh? I just wanted to point out I'm aware my analogy still isn't perfect).\n\nNow we have a clear line of demarcation for whose body is whose. And since he can talk (with an undoubtedly creaky/froggy voice) we know that Hedwig is conscious, which is one step above our knowledge of a fetus!\n\nWe know that Hedwig cannot be saved at Arnold's expense, but Arnold can easily live without Hedwig.\n\nTo keep Hedwig alive and not \"murder\" him, Arnold must be a slave to Hedwig.\n\nHowever, he could starve himself almost unto death, which would kill Hedwig, or he could have Hedwig removed by a surgeon. Both solutions kill Hedwig. There is no way to change the situation except through the death of Hedwig.\n\nIf that's not an acceptable analogy, please explain why.\n\nIs the Arnold I've conjured obliged to be Hedwig's slave, in your worldview, since anything else would kill Hedwig? To repeat but rephrase: Because anything that Arnold does that prevents slavery would kill Hedwig, is Arnold required to keep him alive, even if it's incredibly painful, even if there's an increased risk of Arnold dying, and even if Arnold feels tortured by the situation?\n\nAnd here's the wall-o-text response to the rest of your post. Hope you have a good weekend and return with sharp wits!\n\nYou have to read the whole source, not just the parts that reinforce your preconceived notion.\n\nFor example:\u2026\n\n\"Philosophers such as Antony Flew[41] and Michael Martin[36] have contrasted positive (strong/hard) atheism with negative (weak/soft) atheism. Positive atheism is the explicit affirmation that gods do not exist. Negative atheism includes all other forms of non-theism. According to this categorization, anyone who is not a theist is either a negative or a positive atheist. The terms weak and strong are relatively recent, while the terms negative and positive atheism are of older origin, having been used (in slightly different ways) in the philosophical literature[41] and in Catholic apologetics.[42] Under this demarcation of atheism, most agnostics qualify as negative atheists.\"\n\n\u2026\n\n\"While Martin, for example, asserts that agnosticism entails negative atheism,[29] most agnostics see their view as distinct from atheism,[Perhaps you would prefer \"non-theist\", a term absolutely no-one uses? If that would make you feel better, we can do it, but then, the majority of atheists would then be simple \"non-theists\", considering almost all agree that it's impossible to prove a negative. In fact, I don't know a single one ever that has tried to say \"yes, you can prove a negative\". If you can give a reference, that would be great!\n\nAgain, agnosticism is a statement of knowledge. Rejecting a positive belief for lack of evidence does not mean that you say it's impossible, only that not enough information has come along to make that positive position tenable.\n\nI'm not going to post the entire article every time, it's just going to make every post twelve pages long, but if you read the whole thing you will see that while some people use the terms as you do, from a technical standpoint it lacks precision, as you can still have an opinion even if you also agree that we cannot know one way or another.\n\nTraditionally, in broad and narrow senses, and with the etiology of the term, a-theism is the rejection of statement \"there is a god\", whether because you can make the converse statement \"There is no god\", or \"There is no evidence to indicate a god\". It doesn't mean that you are making an assertion of whether you can know there's a god, which is an entirely different question, and as you said it's impossible to prove a negative. You requested to be told if I felt you were ignoring a point in your attempt to prevent these posts from becoming walls-o-text: Please refer to my \"Alien Ghost Leprechaun\" example.\n\nAnd please stop posting dictionary definitions, particularly when they already include a meaning that agrees with my position.\n\n2 a: a disbelief in the existence of deity\n\nA disbelief is not its own positive belief in the opposite.\n\nI am bringing this up because the newer tendency to apply it to lack of belief is innaccurate in every way.\n\nIf by \"newer\" you mean \"since the 1700s\", then I will concede your point.\n\nTo be fair, of course, \"agnostic\" wasn't around in the 1700s as a term, my 1700s reference was in in reference to the above quote that \"all children are born atheists\" which, of course, is not a \"positive disbelief\", but rather a \"lack of belief\" situation.\n\nIf you want to know the origins of the term \"agnostic\", look it up on the googles, where you see the original definition was, again, one of a lack of knowledge, which is where it comes from etymologically speaking. (Huxley invented it in 1869).\n\nAtheIt is not a \"belief system\" to say \"I won't believe you unless you give me reason to\". Again, the burden of proof is always on the person making the assertion, considering it's impossible to prove a negativeAgain, read your own definition\n\nBecause they would be claiming for the first time that there is no deeper level to go, no actual cause. This would be the end of scientific discovery in this area (very exciting, but unlikely).'s that definition of insanity? You're pointing at an incredibly new area of science that people are still hammering out and that people still disagree firmly on all sides. There are a ton of other theories that are also still considered Einstein spent his last years futilely seeking a unified field theory that didn't differentiate between the Quantum level and the Classical. He failed. So, while I of course cannot prove a negative (there will be no better explanation) any more than you can prove that no one will ever spontaneously become an anti-gravity node, I can say that until there's a reason to believe it will happen, I'll go with the math that makes sense and describes what I see (that of probability). You can't say it's wrong \"just because\", or even \"just because it violates what we've seen previously\". As is often said, it only takes 1 opposite reaction to disprove a theory.\n\nBut really, the only point of that was to disprove your assertions regarding \"magic\". We have seen \"something\" come from \"nothing\". And we've seen other \"magical\" things on the Quantum scale. We know that we presently know nothing about the pre-universe conditions of reality. So to posit a whole extra being that spontaneously generates violates the principle of parsimony, when instead we can simply posit the universe spontaneously generated. This does not mean that I say \"there's definitely no god\", I'm a fairly strict agnostic in that I don't think it's even possible to prove the positive (I call it the Q hypothesis, and I can explain further if you're curious\u2026suffice to say that yes, it is a Star Trek reference).\n\nBack on the original topic:\n\nThere is a significant difference in my position between saving a life and killing a life. Hooking a life up to the nutrients would be saving it. Cutting it off from them would be killing it. Clear?\n\nClear.\n\nWell then, that sounds like convenient knowledge for people to know. A passive form of abortion. Like not opening a door when you know someone has been trapped on the other side. Not strictly ethical, but not murder.\n\nNo, it would be murder just the same, if we followed your logic. Because it would be removing the fetus from nutrients just as assuredly as removing it from the uterus.The other inherent problem in your analogy is that we can't be sure where oen twin ends and the other begins, due to their identical DNA. So, again, your analogy failsI agree with that, to a certain extent. And if that was your whole analogy, you'd be golden. But it isn't. You equated a woman's body to inanimate soil. I apologize if I was'nt clear in where, precisely, the analogy breaks down. Allow me to clarify:\n\nExcept, again, it is never the zygote which implants. It's the \"Morula\", which would be more analogous to a sproutling of a plant.\n\nIt\n\nLet me clarify a little, perhaps, for you.\n\nIs it a plant the instant you put it in the soil? No? It's still a seed. It doesn't become a \"plant\" vs. a \"seed\" until it begins to sprout. In the case of fetuses, they sprout before they implant.\n\nAnd I reject your dismissal of the conjoined twin comparison. It is stroke for stroke identical except in the \"twin\" part. These are conjoined human beings. For 9 months, you are conjoined.\n\nYou ignored my call of bullshit on your claim that it has nothing to do with legislating what a woman can do with her own body. Please either concede that point or argue it, lest I assume wrongly.\n\nDoes a conjoined twin not have a right to their own body? If one conjoined twin kills him/herself and the other dies, have they merely committed suicide or suicide and murder?\n\nConjoined twins have identical DNA. It is difficult to prove one way or the other whose parts are whose, which is why it becomes morally problematic when they want to be separated, however they want that (as in your suicide example, or in the case of simple separation) and one of them will die as a result; we have no idea who has the greater claim.\n\nIn the case of the woman's body, we know quite well whose parts are whose, and who can survive without whom. Your position is that the woman is enslaved to the fetus, because you have decided that the emotional and physical risks don't justify her freedom if they result in the death of something you consider (but she might not) a person.\n\nYou base this slavery claim on DNA alone, a logical position I still don't think you or Ben have established. (Again, DNA is just a code. If you remove the concept of \"soul\" from the equation, what makes a human a human for the purposes of rights etc. as opposed to the technical jargon standpoint that makes dead bodies also \"human\" is its consciousness. If it hasn't had consciousness yet, it's not human yet from a moral standpoint. Just as we don't think of dead bodies as human because their consciousness has permanently ceased.)\n\nDouble-slit experiment, Wikipedia. Heisenberg uncertainty principle (which, while it doesn't confirm randomness, it does show there's sometimes we can't go any deeper)\n\nThere's no reason to invoke either (the latter, I'd say, is properly viewed as an epistemological statement) as a response to \"[w]e have never, in the history of mankind, accepted this notion of random\"; radioactive decay is a purely stochastic phenomenon. There is no reason whatever to think this is going to be reduced to a clockwork. Moreover, this digression into pseudophysics is even worse than the pseudobiology already on the table.\n\nAnd I do apologize about the physics\u2026I'm definitely no Neal deGrasse Tyson, so my version of \"simplifying to prevent the wall-o-text from getting even bigger than its already unwieldy nature\" leaves a great deal to be desired.\n\nNo, it was fine, I was more referring to Gavin. I should emphasize that I do think he is arguing in good faith and that I'm not arguing abortion or (now) the existence of G-d. It is the ever-widening spiral of what, as far as I can tell, is still supposed to be a simplifying framework that strikes me as a practical failure.\n\n@Gavin: When you get back, if you are so inclined, the point I would most like you to address is: carry their rapist's child to term).\n\nOn the subject of using terms for meanings well outside the definitions of those terms; stochastic, mathematically non-deterministic algorithms and subsequent use of 'randomness' do not equate with the philosophical notion of non-determinism.\n\nThey deal only with systems and the illusion of 'randomness' as it is popularly conceived (that things 'happen' free from a chain of causality). Randomness, as such, refers only to the state informational completeness (and subsequent permutations) which we cannot observe, sometimes only within a certain time frameSo it is less that we are dealing with 'uncaused' phenomenon and more that we are dealing with hidden information.\n\nFollowing up after getting home:\nThe quote is from Starship Troopers, a book filled with interesting ideas, many of which are not, IMO, fully thought out.\nMy point was apparently understood: I do not believe that anybody can determine for me, what the moral thing is to do. And duty is nothing if it is not a moral thing (Legal duty is a fiction that the whole can determine, on a heuristic basis, the correct outcome.)\nAs far as the boat example goes, let's reduce it to one man in a canoe, 10 days from shore, with 19 days of water. Without you, he's fine, but with you, both are at risk.Now, why does this man have a duty to rescue you? That's not to say I wouldn't, as a matter of choice about how I live my life, but why is it a duty to him to risk his life for yours? Does it matter if he has only enough water for 10 days? How about if he doesn't have enough even for himself?\nI'm not asking whether it is a good idea to rescue you (maybe you'll find a new way to survive together that you wouldn't have by yourself), but whether it is a duty. An obligation.\nIf the canoe is a passenger liner, does this change anything? If it adds even a small amount of risk (say, 17/10,000), does that obligate the passengers to rescue you? NOt, would they do it, but duty? As someone pointed out upthread, there is no legal obligation to add risk to yourself, although at sea you are under law to alert authorities and stand-by if requested, but not under law to attempt a rescue.\nSo, by chance or design, a woman is pregnant. Where does her duty lie? To herself. She cannot share this with the fetus/blastocycst/premie. Her duty lies where she has determined it. Otherwise, we are deciding that there is a circumstance where people not her are appropriately determining her risks and decisions. I would violently disagree that this is proper, nor that it is desirable. For once we decide that there are circumstances where, absent a freely chosen duty, there is obligation, we are no longer free.\n\nOne more Heinlein (and no, I don't believe or agree with many, many things he says, but he said a lot of things very well):As far as bringing children into the world goes, I have 2 adopted kids. One was my granddaughter, the other an open adoption. I know first hand how difficult it is to adopt, and to be adopted (I am also an adoptee.)\n\nWhen I was younger I spent time in the slums of Calcutta and Bombay. I have seen what happens to poor, unwanted children, and I still wake up sweating. I have seen young women brutalized until they will bear children, because they make more money begging with children, until they are about 1, at which point they are often abandoned outright. Most of Gavin's arguments fall apart when confronted with the non-American reality of unwanted children in the world. Enforced carrying of pregnancies to term is the leading fixable cause of poverty, IME. So, M., you have my very best wishes for being a self-controlled eugenics program: the handicapped have a very tough time of it with all the support and willing help they can get. Without that, it is exactly \"short, nasty and brutish.\"\n\n@John Beaty: Thank you. And coincidentally, that particular Heinlein was a major influence on my developing sense of self and morality as a teenager. People frequently can't tell the difference between illegal and immoral (most memorably ironic example of this in my experience was on a U.S.-based marijuana forum). Outside the issue of legality, it seems to me that personal responsibility is the only freedom we really have.\n\nI visited the Dominican Republic briefly and was deeply disturbed by the poverty I saw there. Being told that it's a lot better than Haiti didn't help, needless to say. The fact that the countries with the worst quality of life are frequently overwhelmingly Catholic, thus precluding most people from using the only easily available form of birth control, is a really, really cruel twist of fate. Even here in the U.S., I've seen things that many Americans would have you believe don't exist here. The United States is truly divided between the First World, the Third World, and the Fourth World.\n\nWell, it is an assertion in the sense that natural science asserts causality as a necessity.\n\nOne of the objections with some of the old theories was that they supposed certain systems (radioactive decay is an oft used instance) as being entirely free frm causality. We have since created more and more accurate models, quantifying various determinants in the process.\n\nThat is not to say that we can perfectly predict the outcome state from an initial state \u2013 but we understand that it is not 'magic' (or something so alien that our minds cannot comprehend) but an unbroken chain of causes and effects that yield a particular state.\n\nThanks for letting me know! I totally started reading Mrs. Grifter's copy of Starship Troopers after I read your quote; I figured it was time to finally read some Heinlein, which I've never done before. PKD had nothing but nice things to say about the man.\n\nYour canoe example made me think of \"The Cold Equations\", have you read that?\n\nOf course I am willing to explain it. I am at a coffee shop at the moment, typing on accursed phone, so apologies in advance for 'typos'.\n\nNatural science without causality is superstition. Science is a means of predicting outcomes, which is why various theories or groups of theories are sometimes referred to s 'models'. They 'model' a system by determining cause (requisite and essential initiator) and effect (requisite end state). We say a scientific model is flawed when it fails to meet these criterion; exempli gratis a cause that is not requisite ( walking requires pants) essential (socks allow walking) or causal (shoes cause walking). We do this be0ause we have obviously not identified the correct causal conditions, and thus cannot test the model to validate or falsify it (and it is therefore of no value to further scientific inquiry). Under certain testing conditions (say, legally, comfortably and safely) we may be able to test the theory and confirm (or invalidate) it. We can revise the model to achieve greater completeness in this more limited scope, but the theorem is useless where it either cannot predict or does not accurately predict the result.\n\nDoes this satisfy you I hope? I am not the best at explaining things, I know, so definitely let me know if I was unclear.\n\nBut in that model you have described, it is not necessary for all randomness to be removed. In the case of nuclear decay, the hypothesis is: this decay will happen at this rate, with an element of randomness. That hypothesis has been consistently confirmed, and the hypothesis \"there is some cause for the apparent randomness\" has no evidence supporting it as yet.\n\nSo it is less that we are dealing with 'uncaused' phenomenon and more that we are dealing with hidden information.\n\nHidden-variable theories have been considered at great length. Bell's theorem nixes local hidden variables. Put another way, this statement is false:The practical case is that reality isn't simple. This is a great annoyance to theoretical physicists, but once you dig down to the bottom you have this bubbling cauldron of randomness that is continually messing with our ability to measure things accurately at that level.\n\nOn the other hand, we are getting some results that rule in and out a lot of current theories (planck-length granular space is under assault by a recent set of observations, for instance, and of course the Higgs discovery supporting the \"Standard Model\" particle physics formulation).\n\nThe world is a messy place, but with persistent observation and continued attempts to resolve those observations with theory we have a chance of getting a handle on it.\n\nGrifter,\nIndeed, they do not require 'true randomness' in the sense of an unpredictable, causeless effect. But they demonstrate the necessity of associating cause with effect to create a usable (and refutable) model \u2013 to be a complete scientific model, it must accurately predict the resultant state from an initial state (effect from cause).\n\nNarad,\n\nThat is incorrect. As with a previous comment about the Bekenstein bound, I think the problem here is rooted in a lack of attention to what a theorem actually means.\n\nBell's inequality was used to demonstrate a paradox between quantum mechanic's predictions and the predictions made by certain subsets of 'local hidden-variable' models.\n\nIf we have perfect knowledge of an atom's initial state, Quantum Mechanics would be violated (CFD and uncertainty) and the end state would no longer be a statistical association with an observation, but the result of a dynamical and deterministic system.\n\nM., you're welcome. I agree that most Americans have zero idea what happens outside their local sphere. The reality of poverty in America is both real and disheartening. It is also an order of magnitude less than Haiti, the DR and Africa.\nBen, if you can't do the math, you can't understand the underpinnings of Heisenberg and therefore why Bell's theorem does, in fact, preclude locally hidden variables. 2nd semester Partial Differentials to start. Also, it is sufficient for a model to predict a range of ending conditions from an initial range of starting conditions. There is no necessity that either be precise the way you appear to me to be stating. A \"complete\" model would actually be the entire system. And the HUP dictates that it is in fact impossible to determine perfectly the initial state. Unless you are willing to falsify it, I think you're stuck with it.\nGrifter, The Cold Equations was the first SF story I read that had me in tears, nearly 50 years ago. I let people read it who don't believe the SF deals with real events and real people. Currently, C. J. Cherryh is my favorite author, running neck and neck with Harlan Ellison and Ursula LeGuin.\nWhat a fabulous conversation we're having!\n\nAlright, I'm back from the weekend and going to do my best to give every response a fair turn. I don't know how long you guys monitor these article comments for afterwards but hopefully some of these responses will reach the inidividuals they're intended for. I'll respond in order unless there's a particularly long post to respond to separately. Please let me know if I have missed your post.\n\n@Random Encounter: (you get your own response)\nKeep in mind that the old covenant laws were also a work intended to govern, like a constitution (the covenant components are actually in the form of a suzerain treaty, between a Ruler and his subjects). Even today if someone beats or kills a pregnant woman they can be considered to have killed two people. Perhaps the main difference is that they wanted the kid, or perhaps to reflect the more heinous act of beating/killing a pregnant woman just like we have harsher laws for harming old people or children. But I do not think it is unreasonable to say that a \"life for a life\" is clearly on the side of it being life. Typically though, in biblical times this means the mother was beginning to show. I would guess.\n\nI understand that you think religion is necessarily magic. Just keep in mind that if such a creator exists then it is a \"natural\" being. It may not belong in this universe since it wasn't created here but that would just make it a sort of alien. I see human kind constantly racing towards the ability to make universes. We see the most clear expression of it within computer development in gaming and computer generated movies but games are the best example as they're dynamic 3 dimensional environments that you can travel in. As those games get more and more complex, it will get closer and closer to making legitimate universes, perhaps to the point that individual lines of code will eventually think for themselves without even knowing that they're in it (hate to get all matrixy but our big bang could have been some developers starting our program and this is how far the program has developed. I hope they make regular backups if that's the case. This joke brought to you by: a computer nerd). It is not then, unreasonable to suppose that a being with sufficient know-how and means would do so. It is also not unreasonable to think that this being would pay closer attention to the areas of the universe supporting life, especially if those areas only support life due to intervention on its part.\n\nNone of this, thought of in this way, would be magic. Any being that can manipulate energy well enough, for example, could also be able to convert it into matter. At some point we should be able to do that ourselves if we haven't already since we do know that energy can be converted to matter and vice versa. I would say that if God exists, that there is a reason why He would be powerful enough to create a universe. So it doesn't have to be magic.\n\nUnderstand also that without religion there is no actual morality. There are laws or ramifications for actions imposed by society or perhaps physics (e.g. jumping off a building means you'll likely die depending on distance fallen, this ramification is supplied by gravity and biology, not society) but no action is good or bad except in the survival of your lineage which is the only important part of evolution. Passing on your genes. So, without a moral framework for ethics then the morality of abortion is a null discussion. \"But it's a human life\" can be most easily countered by \"so?\". Technically, you're just making my genes more fit for survival by limiting competition in the next generation in that scenario. But this line of thinking diminishes the value of human life and really any actions we take. Such toughts and motivations are sociopathic by way of an extreme dose of utilitarianism. Again, without a moral construct/framework then that's not necesarily a bad thing.\n\nNow then, I have made every effort to state that my position is not based on religion. It was interesting to see the verse that Grifter presented but by no means any evidence that I'm using here. Perhaps if everyone here was of the same faith I could explain that our moral framework makes it so, but my personal reasons are based on how I identify life (organic metabolism, primarily said this way to rule out a.i. programs which could eventually qualify as life anyways, albeit constructed) and how I identify humans (DNA, the ultimate identification system). There is nothing that would indicate that a fetus is not alive, nor that it is not human. It is clearly human life and I think we're all pretty much in agreement on this. The differentiator is apparently humanity and this is the point being argued.\n\nMy point is that there's really not much difference between a one-day old baby and a fetus. Neither presents any of the elements of humanity that we would really associate babies as having. Babies are still parasites on those around them in that they can only take and anything they produce you wouldn't want. The only real differences is that it is no longer connected to another human being. Yet we would clearly define killing a baby as murder, and egregious murder at that.\n\nTell me, at what point do you think it's ok to abort a fetus? You stated after the first trimester, but a lot happens in the first trimester. By week 4 the fetus' heart is already pumping blood and has nerves. Arms, facial features and the shape are also clearly developing here. That's less than a month. It is first actually called a fetus in week 9 after conception, after the genitals have formed (eyelids have fused, ears have set). The last week of the trimester is when the fetus grows fingernails and the face is clearly human in appearance. Please note that this is 10 weeks after conception, some sites may say 12 weeks because pregnancy is not counted from conception, the previous period is where it's counted from. The information I got above was from the Mayo clinic.\n\nI strongly agree with the idea that if abortion is made illegal that society needs to step up and take care of the expenses. I do not think that abortion should ever be made illegal in the case of risk of the mother's life due to complications. Let me be very clear on this, if my wife and I were to get pregnant and we learned that there was even a 10 or 5% possibility of her death due to complications I would have the pregnancy terminated if she'd agree to it. We spoke about it this weekend. We may consider going to the point of viability and inducing birth then if the risk is significantly lower a month ahead of full birth, but I do not believe that my wife's life is worth less than a child's life nor should she be forced to risk her life for anyone else including the child/fetus. I would not impose this on anyone else either. I don't think that the actual risk of normal pregnancy is a legitimate cause for concern (in comparison, even a 1% chance of fatality is 100 times more likely that you'd die than the normal risk). I would consider even a 1% chance pretty high and I'm not a gambler. Well, I am, but with money and at a table amongst friends. But even then not with a lot of money, $20 tops and I usually win.\n\nIf abortion is ever made illegal across the board, even in the case of complications and increased risk, then I will see it as an egregious miscarriage of justice. Absolutely no pun intended.\n\nPregnancy does begin 2 weeks before conception. It always has in the medical community. As I stated in the post before reading your next comment, that's where doctors count the 9 months/40 weeks from. If the doctor tells you you've been pregnant for 2 months, it's more likely 1 and a half months that you've actually had a zygote.\n\nThat being said, any previously existing laws should be changed to reflect this change in terminology. There is an additional thing to consider, that the confusion of terminology just needed to be clarified and that this is already what they intended with their claims. Does the language of the previously existing laws say pregnancy or conception? Because conception would always remain the same point and this law wouldn't change it. Now, if they say conception starts two weeks before conception, that will be VERY interesting.\n\n@Gavin\nI see your point, and we are clearly doomed to disagree on the point at which an embryo or fetus deserves legal protection.\n\nI am relieved to see that you understand my view of the full social contract implied by making abortion illegal, I wonder how many others who hold the same opinion see the contract the same way? From my perspective it appears that few could be persuaded, though I hope that they could argue their case as effectively as you do.\n\nOn the last point, enshrining a medical rule-of-thumb in law as a basis for rulemaking that can adversely impact the rights of a particular class of people is something that gives me chills. You realize that should the law stand it would make it perfectly reasonable to make it illegal to serve alcohol to women of childbearing age? I leave it to you to come up with other ways such a well-placed fulcrum could be used.\n\n@Narad:\nIt is a statistic, and I'm saying it is not significant. Not only is the number itself not likely to happen at all, but of the 17 per 100,000 there is a decent chance that many of them were the people who did not have proper medical care or were the ones that went ahead with the pregnancy despite being warned. Any major complication can be identified well before the \"big day\", such is modern technology.\n\nHmm, I found new results: I'm getting some conflicting data. Other sources list 6.5 deaths per 100,000 (0.000065). According to The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Between 2000 and 2006 they collected data on 1.5 million deliveries. 95 of which resulted in death. 27 of those deaths were deemed preventable (17 were caused by doctor mistakes, 10 by non-doctors). It doesn't include the number that had been warned not to continue but did so anyways or the number that were too far away from the hospital (silly home births, 20-40% of births can have major complications that can be almost entirely taken care of in hospitals but not at home).\n\nThe CDC listed 13 per 100,000 in 2006. So I don't know which is right. I haven't seen the CDC's study parameters, just the journal one with the 1.5 million sample size.\n\nThanks for making me research the topic, I wouldn't have found real information if I wasn't pushed to do so.\n\nSee, home birth has had an explosion in the states. I already knew this because of people I'd met in New England and Washington State. It isn't just religious people, hippies too (for lack of a better word). According to the link it has grown 29% from 2004-2009 to 30,000. Though the study says that it's really difficult to nail down solid figures (since there's no registry for homebirthers). What's worse is since fatalities involving the mother are so rare, only the infant fatalities are ever listed as far as I can tell. All I see are comments like in wikipedia where it says, \"much higher risk for maternal deaths and perinatal mortality.\", very technical. However, it stands to reason that any complication that would otherwise just involve a change of rooms in a hospital will result in a trip across town or perhaps a trip into town.\n\nIt seems that if the midwife is a fully trained medical professional (they usually aren't and just need to pass a single multiple choice test to be a certified midwife), if they get prenatal care, and if the city's transportation is up to par, that the difference in safety is not noticeable. These three things are not always the case. In fact, a family friend just had a home birth without ever doing prenatal care stuff or even having an ultrasound (much to my dismay). The child turned out fine but I can't imagine what it'd have been like if it'd gone the other way.\n\nThe most significant risk is to the infant.\n\nThe lifetime risk of maternal death in the U.S. in 2010 was 1 in 2400.\n\n0.041%? So if you're a woman there's a 99.96% chance you'll die from something other than pregnancy? That would be the equivalent of women have an average of around 3 or 4 children in their lifetime. I think the 2000 US survey was under 2 children per household so it should be lower than that. The number should be figured out this way. If the average number of children per household with children is 1.86 (probably down from 2000 though) and the risk of dying from child bearing is .017% (a number I now believe to be high as is), then the liklihood of death in your lifetime from child bearing in America should be .032%. The ratio of this to .41% is 1.32, multiply that times 2400 and you get 3174.\n\nSo the lifetime risk would be 1 in 3174. This will differ according to the 2010 census average number of children per family with children but that number is supposed to be going down. To put this into perspective to the car statistic you mentioned. More people die by car crash in the US in one year and three months than will die in their entire lives (80 something years since we're talking risk in lifetime) by child bearing. Your risk of dying in a car is about 1 in a 100. You have a 1% chance to die in a car. The odds are only increasing, especially with text drivers, those assholes. I would expect a significant leap from 2006 to 2016 in driving related deaths thanks to just that demographic.\n\nThis number doesn't increase the risk of having a single child. The risk remains the same but the risk is still there each time (actually subsequent pregnancies are more risky, especially if the previous one had a c-section or other complications).\n\nListen, there is a danger to most everything we do. But you can't say that the only necessary evolutionary trait (passing on genes) that makes any species successful is dangerous. Let me present some interesting things that are more likely\n\nThat article may hold the key. We have the highest teen pregnancy rate amongst these developed nations I listed and giving birth younger than 20 years of age is significantly more risky. It also states new definitions of maternal death in the states as contributing to higher numbers (death while pregnant or within 42 days of birth/miscarriage from any cause caused by or made worse by the pregnancy, e.g. suicide).\n\nPart of the religious issue is the concept that humans have a spiritual component in addition to the physical one (\"soul,\" etc.). Some faiths believe all sentient beings possess it. The question then becomes, at what point in development does the developing embryo become a member of the human community by virtue of its spiritual existence?\n\nOne thing to consider is identical twins. If you split the zygote in fragments before 8 days gestation (from fertilization), you get multiple separate humans, who are clearly not a single person. After 12 days, if the embryo survives at all, it is only if it is a partial division, as conjoined twins. Something changes in that interval from a biological standpoint that defines that developing embryo as a single human rather than a cluster of cells that can all individually become different humans.\n\nRandom Encounter:\nI was just stating possible reasons behind what they did. I didn't read enough to see what the actual implications of that decision is for existing laws. If it is something sneaky they did, then shame on them. If major changes are to be made to such volitile laws then they should be done publicly, not in shadows. It is not doing a service to the people you govern (in a democracy!) if they do not agree with it. It is failing to do your job.\n\nAs for social contract. I doubt anyone could give a good argument for why society should enforce their view at such a great cost to the individual without also providing every available assistance to them.\n\n@Grifter/Random Encounter: I am not Calvinist by any means.\n\nMy comment is one of ethical framework, completely void of religion and solely steeped in philosophy. Religion establishes a persistent and objective (perhaps subjective at the time of creation but objective to those who follow) moral framework. Without religion there is no such thing. There are laws, but they can easily change and aren't necessarily moral (think of laws in Muslim countries that harm women and allow murder of people who switch faiths to anything but Islam or pro-slavery laws in America pre-1865 and Jim Crow laws later on). Now we clearly see these laws as \"wrong\", but by what standards? What's to say society won't cycle back at some point or find something we're doing now unethical or things we aren't doing now ethical? Then there's just a personal code of ethics. Entirely subjective as well without any necessary correlation with another person's codes.\n\nBut even if we think of a hypothetical religion with unambiguous terms, we still run into the problem that you could have a religion which said baby rape was the moral thing to do\u2026would you really say \"well, that's objective ethical framework!\"\n\nAs has been said: \"With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.\"\n\n@Gavin I look with a jaundiced eye whenever lawmakers get into trying to define technical issues as a matter of law. When to count the start of a pregnancy is very much a technical issue for doctors, and setting a definition that precedes conception as a matter of law opens up a can of worms that in my opinion is best left closed and buried under at least 10 feet of good solid basalt.\n\nThe reason for having a legal definition of gestational age is that you have to determine how to enforce laws that are based on gestational age, such as the limits for legal abortions. If one person is saying 23 1/2 weeks and means 23 1/2 weeks since conception and another person means 23 1/2 weeks since the first day of the last menstrual periods, you've got problems.\n\nI'm responding to more recent posts first because these are the current debates. I should mention now that I have a 5-day holiday starting on thursday.\n\n@Grifter:\nThe slavery happening in Jerusalem in new covenant times (the covenant Christians are part of) wasn't supposed to be the same as American slavery. It was still bad, but the Bible actually didn't impose its philosophy on laws, it just taught how to live amongst those laws (give to Casear what is Casear's, Romans 13:1-2, and 1 Peter 2:13-17: all phrases or verses that tell Christians to obey the laws of the land). Slavery typically occured through bondsmanship, not kidnapping. In fact, kidnapping is forbidden in scripture (old testament demands death for a kidnapping a man and sells or uses him as a slave, Exd 21:16 and the new testament also condemns them 1 Timothy 1:9). The old testament does have a precedent for slaves acquired through battle, but the alternative was usually to kill them. You can decide which is better, to be dead or to be alive but captive.\n\nAmerican slavery as we think of it was purely kidnapping. We did have bondslavery early on for people to get to America. But anyone who advocated theft of people from Africa to be held as slaves for the entirety of their lives or any time at all were merely ignorant of what it was supposed to mean back in those days. A person had a debt and was unable to repay it so they had to work it off. Credit and credit cards are the same thing nowadays, just in a different way, thankfully.\n\nAlpha Centauri:\n\nWith regards to the spirit aspect, this is exactly the sort of thing I want to avoid getting into. We're not only talking about something that can't really be quantified, but something that is personal belief-based.\n\nI think you're making a reasonable case against the individuality of a zygote not being established, but I have also claimed that the zygote is the equivalent of a seed with all the components of a seed. Seeds and Zygotes/embryos are analogous, containing all the same components and features and yet we don't call a seed a plant, just a seed. I would be willing to accept this distinction ourselves and call life at implantation rather than conception.\n\n@Grifter:\nYou are pointing out the potential flaw of having a bad moral construct. It's a very real problem and I don't deny it. Look at Islam, one of my areas of specialization. The Qur`an gives you the appropriate steps to punish your wife (1. Warn her, 2. Refuse to lay with her. 3. Beat her) with modern translations being so kind as to add the word \"lightly\" to the \"beating her\" step. The murder of a convert away from Islam is demanded and regularly carried out today. The burning of a book results in legally sanctioned death, a twelve-year old girl is recently making headlines because she did that (dumb girl\u2026 *sigh*) and is about to be executed for it. Then there is freely allowed murder of anyone who isn't a Christian, Jew, or Sabian and the murder of any of those faiths if they don't pay the taxes demanded of them. Those laws aren't as readily enforced, it seems, but the law often looks the other way in such situations.\n\nAdditionally, the Prophet of Islam (whose actions are held as holy and perfect) married a 6 or 7-year old girl named Aisha and consummated at the age of 9. This is heavily documented with only one disenting source claiming she was 10 and they have no special information to be the only correct one and come on, it's still a 10 year-old child. This was a 50+ year-old man having sex with a 9 year old girl and this is to be considered a righteous action by Islam.\n\nSo yeah, you get into a situation where the moral construct could be bad. This is usually when the scripture is also part of the legal system. Christianity can avoid this because it isn't, it puts itself inside a foreign environment and not in the leadership role. The worst thing that happened to Christianity was when the western church (Rome, as opposed to the other 4 members of the Pentarchy: Alexandria, Istanbul/Constantinople, Jerusalem, Antioch) assumed the role of government when the Roman Empire created a power vaccuum by falling. This suddenly meant that the pope was also emperor and thus began mafia like violence for the next several centuries since the church positions became powerful and thus attractive to non-believers and non-faithful (non-believers being non-Christians, non-faithful here being used to imply that they believe but don't follow the faith) with aspirations of ruling.\n\nKeep in mind that the Christian religion is adherant to the New Covenant. If a Christian insists on enforcing Old Covenant law to you, feel free to point out the scriptures of modern contention or the idea that it was a covenant designed to rule a nation in violent times, but most of all point to our own scripture where it blatantly says that we have a new covenant and the old one is no longer ours (Hebrews 8:13 = By calling this covenant \"new,\" he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and outdated will soon disappear.).\n\nThis seperation is why you get renowned Atheists, Agnostics, or even members of other faiths who find themselves liking the words of Jesus even though they don't believe in his deity or abhor the way religion has been used despite its peaceful message.\n\nThe point is that while there are bad constructs and good constructs, at least they are attempts at moral absolutes that laws and societies don't necessarily have the \"authority\" to impose on individuals. These then become rules and subjective points that then change from area to area. Sure, pedofile activities like a 50-year old man having sex with a 9-year old girl are illegal here? That's great, they're also legally acceptable elsewhere. Is it right? Who knows [/sarcasm/jest]?\n\nBut they aren't objective. They're completely subject to the interpretations placed on them.\n\nFor example:\n\nYou can say, now, that \"oh, well, it was different slavery!\", but the bible still says \"slaves, obey your masters\". You can say \"oh, what's better, slavery or death\", and I can respond \"that's a false dichotomy, better would be neither, like we presently do with prisoners of war\".\n\nYou can say \"oh, we're under the new covenant, but then Matthew 5:18 says \"For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.\" (Yes, I know there's better translations, but \"tittle\" is a funny word).\n\nThe \"moral framework\" you are advocating as \"objective\" is: Subjective initially (created in theory by your God), and subjective in application (since there is nothing to prevent someone from saying \"This is what it says, but this is what it means\", which happens all the time.\n\nIt would only TRULY be objective to the practitioner of the moral framework if there were oversight, which there is not. There is no way to prevent someone from being mistaken through religion any more than there is with rational philosophy. Especially since all religions come from a \"revelation\", which in theory could be repeated, which allows for whatever books to be \"corrected\" by anyone with a sincere belief.\n\nThat's twice that my responses have gotten lost thanks to power outages. Hurricane Isaac or whatever it is isn't even raining on us and the sun is even shining through breaks in the clouds. My company has large generators that should be handling this.\n\nI'll wait a bit on responding so I do not continue to lose lengthy posts. My current attempt is to respond to M.\n\nGrifter, I was trying to come from the other direction. Gavin seems to think that without religion, all acts are permitted, including those that he deems evil or good. What I was trying to ask was, what are those acts, which, with religion, would be unacceptable, while being acceptable in a self-derived moral framework, which acts are not strictly religiously prohibited ones.\n\nGavin, please do not fall back on the No True Scotsman fallacy. And what Islam does is irrelevant to the current discussion.\n\nIt seems that if the midwife is a fully trained medical professional (they usually aren't and just need to pass a single multiple choice test to be a certified midwife)\u2026.\n\nI'm not planning to pursue this much further, as it's quite tangential, but there are a number of midwifery categories, just as there is quite a bit of variation in state licensing requirements. I'm familiar with the homebirthing set; the genuine frontier types who just put a kiddie pool in the living room and hope for the best have not struck me as being in the majority. It looks as though only two states recognize the CM credential, which would seem to be the test-only option that you identify above as being \"usual.\"\n\n@M.: Ah, where I'm from pro-choice/abortion is the norm or the pro-life category is so ridiculous as to not warrant any attention. As for the pro-life groups. I think the comparison is so striking because of the term \"pro-life\". The idea is that a fetus is inherrently innocent just as a man in a coma cannot commit a punishable crime due to a lack of motivation and means. This is true. So, I can understand someone (who believes it is a life) speaking up for a fetus but not speaking up for a serial killer. Due to the difference of criminal activities that demand justice I don't see any necessary conflict. The apparent oxy moron of a pro-capital punishment pro-lifer is fun to point and laugh at, but not really mutually exclusive from eachother.\n\nI'm not particularly in favor of or against capital punishment. As in, I'm not a proponent of either side. I think our prison system is largely broken so I'm not really happy either way and there is so much moral dilema everywhere in between. I think that justice needs to be had, but what that entails has plagued human kind's various legal systems since they began. I see every side but the most reliable person on the matter I've seen is largely in the anti-capital punishment side of things.\n\nHis name was John Howard Yoder. I hesitate to bring him up only because of the sex scandel he got wrapped up in at some point. I find that church's have been really bad at accepting sex as a normal human function. I trace it back to Augustine who wrote a lot on the subject as it was his own vice and his words ended up being abused by the Western Church to great harm. This is why we now see priests that are forced to be celibate for the rest of their lives or leave the job they love. We also see pastors that are extremely repressed and don't know what to do when tempted sexually because they've avoided the subject like the plague. I guess groups like the Roman Catholic Church just throw out scriptures that require leaders of the Church to have only one wife and children that are well behaved (1 Timothy 3:1-12). It is because of all of this that we see people who are otherwise good men fall to really crappy stuff for which there's really no excuse on the individual level even if the institution has created a breeding ground for it. Still, it is remarkably sad that a renowned Christian Ethics scholar fell to this. Hypocrisy is something I hope I never understand on a personal level.\n\nAnyways, back to Yoder. He taught two things that I really spent a lot of time on. One, that the job of Christians isn't supposed to be taking over government or forcing their beliefs onto others, but rather just being the Church, taking advantage of good opportunities to show compassion and good will. I particularly love this philosphy and try to live it out.\n\nThe second that he dealt with is the point of his mention here. Capital punishment. It is intended as two things, sacrifice and deterrence. His point on sacrifice was that the notion of blood for blood is an antiquated component of the Old Covenant that was abolished by the sacrifice establishing the New Covenant (the sacrifice of Jesus). That's an acceptable explanation for Christians and combining that with forgiving others of debt would also go a long way to insist only on captivity to keep the threat away from society. But that doesn't help society which is not necessarily Christian. So I applied it to the topic of the need for sacrifice as reparations for victims. Much the same way that life insurance can't indemnify the holder of the claim by restoring the life so it just gives the people lots of money.\n\nAre victims of heinous acts owed sacrifice? Is it justice to repay blood for blood in reparation for the victims? This is something I cannot answer and hope I'll never have to make a personal judgment call on.\n\nThe second component, that of deterrence is an interesting one. Yoder mentioned that if the purpose of capital punishment was deterrence then it would serve to deter (duh). He presented statistical evidence that showed no correlation between increases in capital punishment and the acts they're meant to deter. There is a much stronger tie to local economies. He also went on to say that if capital punishments were meant to deter, they should be as violent and public as possible to reach the intended audience and instill fear. But that violent and public is something we as a society have certainly moved away from so they cannot currently serve in that capacity either.\n\nAlphaCentauri:\n\nWhat does conjoined twins being rare and unique have to do with the conditions of a fetus being attached to the mother's body organically being similar to two humans being attached and potentially sharing such life saving functions too? If there was a really common form of conjoined twin defects would that form somehow not be conjoined?\n\nThe child and the mother are biologically attached for the entire pregnancy after the implantation stage. They both impact the other immensely though only the fetus relies on the mother for life (though the pregnancy does increase the mother's immune system). This is directly comparable to a conjoined twin scenario where one twin has all the \"goods\" that the other twin would not survive without. The difference is that those situations usually result in a severely handicapped second twin and that the first twin is usually likely to die if the second one is not removed. That is not the case here. Not only is the mother extremely unlikely to die, but the second twin/fetus will be naturally removed in a matter of months and then both lives can survive and go their seperate ways.\n\nAs for laws, what do you mean? There is a ton of legislation regarding conjoined twins. It is a really difficult area with a lot of concern placed on the possibility of one conjoined individual committing a crime. Would you be ok with two otherwise perfectly healthy conjoined twins being seperated if it means that one will die? How is that not comitting flagrant murder just to improve the other's quality of life? I understand if they'd both die if not seperated, but not if just one would.\n\nAs for the discussion not blowing up, I'm pretty impressed with the caliber of responses for what that's worth. I've really enjoyed learning and developing my train of thought. Perhaps it is docile because I just want to explain what I believe rather than force other people to believe it too. I'm also genuinely interested in what your side thinks.\n\nI understand that the viability of enforcing these beliefs is low. I fully expect people to find ways around it. Difficulty in enforcing something shouldn't mean we should just allow it though. That wouldn't make sense at all. Theft in general is illegal and it's still going to happen.\n\nOk, recent responses first then it looks like Grifter's magna post will be next on the list. Looks like a job for tomorrow though! Sorry.\n\n@Grifter: (your recent one, not the two bigger posts yet)\n\nThere are several areas left for interpretation, yes. I'd be an idiot not to admit that. But laws don't resolve that problem either. There are some clear things and some ambiguous things anywhere you look. The problem I'm presenting is the lack of legitimacy of any moral construct of good or evil in the absence of a deity or framework that is considered to be an absolute. I'm just saying that morallity is a uniquely religious term. You can say personal morality which serves no purpose to society or you can say social morality (where breaching social contract is the only \"bad\") but not only does social morality morph but it can often accomodate egregious acts of what we'd currently agree is civil injustice. Likewise, why should another person accept social contract like you may? I have the golden rule as a reason to follow social contract but another person would only have your word to accept or reject.\n\nThis is just a philosophical problem of ethics when completely divorced from the idea of any absolute truths. Do you agree or disagree with this premise?\n\nNow then, to scripture. The idea is that the New Testament was not meant to create laws, not like the Old Testament or the Qur`an or so many other religions. It was intended to describe how to be a Christian in a world that is not Christian. This world included slavery in many forms and so it explained how to deal with it. It also is quite clear against the action of kidnapping individuals. So we should be able to assume that with \"kidnapping\" being brought off the table that the discussion would have been left on bondmanship, something we still have today in the form of debt. It's just now we pay it off over time while working for someone else while still getting money to tend to ourselves. MUCH more convenient!\n\nThe explanation of the verse from Matthew is typically that His death was the completion of it. There's also the concept that the Law still exists but has been made obsolute (i.e. there are now two covenants). But ultimately this only proves the point that there are many \"explanations\" just like you're stating.\n\nEven then, there are many points that are not in contention. Murder, for example, bad. Most of scripture is not ambiguous.\n\n@John Beatty: It's a concession of the point Grifter made about the potential of a religion that teaches negative things that would be considered quite bad by society (I believe he stated baby rape). Islam is a fantastic example of a religion that is quite popular and yet has remarkably violent commands that are still being carried out. So it is very pertinent to the religious sub-conversation to point out the fact that some religions can have VERY different moral structuring behind them.\n\nMy main use of it was to contrast a religion instituted to govern and one that was not. If you find it offensive for me to present beliefs and verses of a religion that I can actually cite, please let me know.\n\n\"This is just a philosophical problem of ethics when completely divorced from the idea of any absolute truths. Do you agree or disagree with this premise?\"\n\nI do disagree with that premise. InWe figured out the laws of physics without religion. We figured out celestial mechanics despite the religion of the time. We figured out the constitution without having to refer to biblical passages. We have come up with some pretty good ethical systems without religion, too.\n\nTo respond to this:\n\n\"The problem I'm presenting is the lack of legitimacy of any moral construct of good or evil in the absence of a deity or framework that is considered to be an absolute. \"\n\nI would respond: Even if you're religious, you operate in the absence of a deity. God doesn't come down daily and say \"Uh, Gavin, you were thinking of beating up a gay dude, perhaps you didn't understand me, I didn't want you to do that\".\n\nYou can never prove your \"absolute\", and it's always up for debate even among people who use the same book! (vis. Protestant vs. Catholic vs. Mormon vs. Jehovah's Witness, et al.)\n\nTo return to what I said before: Either God sets the morals and could make anything moral, or there is a principle higher even than God that sets them, which removes the religion necessity from the argument. Your framework, in theory, could require baby rape/murder. And even if you knew it was wrong, you'd still do it because it was an \"absolute\".\n\nReligion in an ethical context is nothing more than a filter between reason and action that adds one more opportunity for corruption, like a game of telephone. Reason can lead you wrong, true, but so can religion.\n\nMy quote from earlier is still true: \"With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.\" There are people, devout Christians, who don't want to hate the gays, yet who think it's required of them by their deity.\n\nAnd, more, even if there was a God, what gives him moral authority except reason? \"I created all this, therefore I get to be a dick. Prepare to be tortured\"? I find the God of the bible to be a morally repugnant creature who rewards evil capriciously (the Jacob/Esau story troubled me a lot as a kid, as did a lot of others), and requires worship on pain of torture.\n\nAs regards to your arguments about the Testaments: I won't really bother engaging with them, sorry. Because the point is not whether your interpretation is valid on its own, but whether another interpretation can be made that is valid on its own. It can.\n\nEven then, there are many points that are not in contention. Murder, for example, bad. Most of scripture is not ambiguous.\n\nBuwahahahahahaha. Sorry, but I find that hilarious. \"Murder, for example, bad.\" Unless God commands you to do it, right? Abraham's willingness to murder his son is why the Jews were the \"chosen people\", if I recollect. The fact that he stopped it at the last second isn't really germane to the fact that Abraham was rewarded for not saying \"WTF? I'm not murdering my son!\" And that's just the first example that sprang to mind. Of course, there's also a nice laundry list of capital offenses in the bible, which I guess aren't \"murder\", but still show that life wasn't particularly cherished by God, considering you could die for just being a disobedient kid, or approaching the tabernacle, or not being a virgin when married.\n\nAnd don't forget that when you're at war, rape and child murder are totally okay, at least according to Isaiah 13:15-18:. Be.\"\n\nI'm not trying to attack your religion, though I'm sure it seems that way. You should believe whatever you see fit. But you can't claim an objective truth and reference the bible.\n\nArguments like the one you presented remind me of the recent debate I saw between Dan Savage and Brian Brown (of NOM). A lot of Brown's arguments were basically \"No, my views should be law because other Christians are wrong.\"\n\n(And, for the record, not comparing you to Brown\u2026just saying it's a similar type of argument, that seems to take my \"This interpretation with awful things is also valid based on the book you claim is so great\" and respond with \"Well, you can't disprove my interpretation, therefore yours is invalid.\"\u2026again, the point is not that yours is invalid, but that the one I presented is equally valid based on the same source documents\u2026the fact that you've chosen one interpretation over the awful ones shows more the good of your own reason, than it does the good of the bible). sometimes and believe fundamentally No, two things:\n\n1. I maintain that the zygote is completely comparable to a seed and have already stated a belief that implantation is required for the \"seed\" to actually begin to produce a plant.

I maintain that the zygote is completely comparable to a seed and have already stated a belief that implantation is required for the \"seed\" to actually begin to produce a plant. Please note that the embryo wrathI'm reading your reply on my phone, so won't bother to try to reply for real until I'm home, but I wanted to correct someting real quick. My faster than light comment was in direct relation to yours. I was just extending your analogy. You said if we ever found something that in some way violated causality it would be like if a group claimed to find something that went faster than light, and something we've want to confirm more on. I was trying to say that would only be true if things which violated the speed of light had been seen and verified for decades, since the probability aspects of quantum theory have been seen for decades, and no hidden variable has been discovered.\n\nI think I'll try to approach your response a. It piecemeal. On the subject of definitions, what would YOU call someone who says \"I lack an affirmative belief in god. I don't know for sure there isn't\".\n\nI don't KNOW you don't have, for example 4 nipples. I suppose it's possible, and I haven't seen you shirtless. But unless/until I hear otherwise, I'll assume you don't. That doesn't mean I have faith you don't, though.\n\nOn the subject of defintions, I did note that agnosticism didn't exist at the time of my 1700s quote. Doesn't make it any less valid; you can't say \"that's not what atheism's ever meant before, it's a new thing!\" when I can give you a quote from the 1700s where it is used in exactly that way. You seem occasionally to find fault without actually reading the whole thing you're criticizing, which gets kind of frustrating.\n\n\"Agnostic Atheism is not a valid category.\"\n\nFunny, because if you search the googles for \"agnostic atheism\" you'll quickly find the Wikipedia article on the subject. (Like I said before, I decided to stop actually linking 'cause I'm tired of being tagged for moderation.) Check the \"Agnostic\" article in its entirety, as well as the \"Agnostic Atheism\" article in its entirety. Then come back to the discussion once you have a better understanding of the history and overall usage of the term, both etymologically and philosophically.\n\nTo quote:\n\n\"Bertrand Russell uses the example of the celestial teapot. He argues that although it is impossible to know that the teapot does not exist, most people would not believe in it. Therefore, one's view with respect to the teapot would be an agnostic \"ateapotist\", because while they don't believe in the existence of the teapot, they don't claim to know for certain.\"\n\nIf a man has failed to find any good reason for believing that there is a God, it is perfectly natural and rational that he should not believe that there is a God; and if so, he is an atheist\u2026\u2026 while, then, it is erroneous to identify agnosticism and atheism, it is equally erroneous so to separate them as if the one were exclusive of the other\u2026\n\nThis one's one of the references:\n\nHarrison, Alexander James (1894). The Ascent of Faith: or, the Grounds of Certainty in Science and Religion. London: Hodder and Stroughton. p. 21. OCLC 7234849. OL21834002M. \"Let Agnostic Theism stand for that kind of Agnosticism which admits a Divine existence; Agnostic Atheism for that kind of Agnosticism which thinks it does not.\"\n\nYou'll note the second to last one was 1887, the last one was from 1894.This is just tripe. One doesn't have to calculate the mathematical likelihood of something that has no proof to dismiss it. The one making the claim has the burden of proving themselves.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\"Huxley identified agnosticism not as a creed but rather as a method of skeptical, evidence-based inquiry.\"'m going to just say that until you do a better job of proving Bertrand Russel wrong, you should stop trying to assert things based on reading only halves of definitionsPerhaps if you read the entirety of things, you would make less stupidly confrontational comments.\n\nI don't believe that anything was thrown out. Only that the laws in this universe did not necessarily apply to anything before the universe.Yup! Which is how you get to \"Therefore God\", and I get to \"Therefore, wedunno\".If, for a moment, I buy this \"seed\" analogy, I'd ask: If I remove a tomato seed from the soil before it has sprouted, is anyone going to say I \"killed a tomato plant\"?\n\nThe best part is this: \"It isn't just her body anymore.\"\n\nIs the seed fundamentally merged with the soil? I don't think so. And you ignored my expansion of your analogy, I noticedThat article is my reasoning.\n\nI do not believe that someone has to be a slave to another. You do.\n\nBut the \"twin\" part isn't the focus. It's the conjoined part.\n\nFine. But then don't say that \"the situation is the same\", then get huffy when I point out differences to the situation.\n\nThe point isn't to discuss the soil's right to take a seed,\n\nYou're right, that's not the point at all. The \"soil's right to take a seed\" has never been the poitn. The point is can you require to soil to take the seed, if we buy your analogy?\n\nIt isn't just her body anymore.\n\nYes, it is. Just because she is connected to someone else doesn't mean it's not her body. She had it before the fetus, she'll have it after either way.\n\nLetIf we know for a fact that no matter how we remove the fetus from a body it is going to die, it seems mere sophistry to claim that removing it using saline is different than pulling it out with tweezers.\n\nOnce again, this pairing is exactly the same as being conjoined when one pair has all the vital goods and the other pair does not\n\nYou called me silly for pointing out that there are differences in the situation you are describing, even as you say the situations are identical.\n\nThis is not \"slavery\" in any more of a way than a coinjoined twin pair may find themselves forced to live with their twin in their body until a time where it may be healthy enough to be removed and survive.\n\nAnd if it never is? Let's look at that. You claim that the timeframe matter, so what if it's never going to be healthy enough to be removed? Does that mean that the other twin is obliged to a life of servitude?This is just pure stupidity. Are really claiming that there is no difference between something that is CLEARLY NOT CONSCIOUS and something that's asleep? Newsflash: Your brain is not nonexistent or \"off\" while you're asleep. In a barely-implanted fetus, it's nonexistent. There are points where I am willing to err on the side of caution as regards to consciousness. When the thing has no nervous system, I feel confident saying there is no way I can reasonbly think it's conscious.\n\nUltimately, why does the mother get to just kill the life? Why does her convenience override the life?\n\nBecause she has the right to do whatever she wants to her own body.There is a difference between conjoined beings and conjoined twins. I suspect you have oversimplified in your mind, equating conjoined beings to conjoined twins, when conjoined twins biologically have a very specific set of circumstances, which has been my issue with the analogy from the beginning.\n\nFirst off going to try to close some tags by using all the ones listed in \"allowed tags\" and closing them off (which should hopefully be invisible\u2026the periods are just to see which one fixes it if any do\u2026)\n\nI was requoting you, however, I will be more specific (considering, if we're going to consider non-philosophical truths in our absolute truths, then the bible is just CLEARLY wrong in multiple ways). I think there are very few absolute moral truths.\n\nI would consider murder being evil to be an absolute truth (where killing and murder may be differentiated by justifiable reason for killing).\n\nBut different cultures may define murder differently, which changes whether it's \"justified\". Regardless, I can concede that point if I accept the \"you know what I mean\" argument from you.\n\nThat's still 1. 1 is a \"very few\" number.\n\nI think that absolute moral truths may only be reached through religion, whether that religion is a construct or based on a real deity because it gives inherrent authority to the laws given that transcends government or society based laws.\n\nAhem.\n\nFirst off, you believe that it doesn't matter if the religion is true or not? Is that what that \"whether it's a construct\" statement meant? WTF kind of authority can a nonexistent deity provide to an ethical framework?\n\nSecond:Do you believe god can make Child rape/murder okay? I've said it multiple times, and you've ignored it. If god said to do it, would that make it moral?\n\nI maintain it would not, and that therefore it is not God who sets the morality, but rather reason.\n\nI'm not talking about say, mathematical truths. Please explain to me how 2+4=6 translates into a moral truth which is the topic of discussion.\n\nI never said it did?\n\nThereI already gave you a quote where rape was okay, from the bible. You try to dismiss it further down, but fail miserably considering the prophecy specifies it is \"the Lord\" and \"the weapons of his wrath\".Exactly. Reason and religion can both be flawed. But I can find no examples of things that religion finds immoral, but reason finds neutral, that aren't stupid (despite it being an abomination, I wear clothes made from more than one type of fabric). I can, however, find many examples of things that religion finds moral that I find despicable. Slave ownership is only one example, but lets go away from your religion for a moment, since it makes you so defensive. The Scientologists think that you can lie, cheat, steal from, or kill a \"suppressive person\". Now, we can look with our reason and say \"Um, no, that's still shitty\", but their religion has led them to think that it's okay...so they could steal that donut. If you divorce your reason from your ethics, then things which you know to be bad can be \"good\".Bullshit. You don't get to speak to your religion as a whole's rules of play. You don't speak for every Christian, and to pretend otherwise makes you a liar. From a debate standpoint it is perfectly legitimate when discussing the religion to go off of the ACTUAL WORDS, as opposed to the spin you choose to put on them. A spin which, I might add, still doesn't excuse the justifications for murder. Not every Christian believes what you do. Which was my point....the Lord and the weapons of his wrath\n\nSo? They are \"the Lord and the weapons of his wrath\", I would think the Lord would have responsibility for himself and his weapons, yes?\n\nAs for Isaac, three things:\n\n1. God did not allow it to happen.\n\nAs I stated, doesn't matter. Abraham didn't know that, did he? The point is that Abraham was willing to kill for no reason, and had he done so, it would have been straight-up murder of his son.\n\n2. This was, according to the Christian view, to be a foreshadowing of what God was going to have to do.\n\nBullshit again. According to your Christian view. And the views of many others, I'm aware. But not EVERY Christian. I mentioned the similarity of your arguments to the Brian Brown ones...stop playing \"no true Scotsman\".\nYour examples don't apply at all, and you're being disingenuous. This would have been a killing for no reason. Not a killing in battle, not killing for justice, but killing just because God told him to. So, are you in favor of every nut who's said God told him to kill? Do you believe that they haven't committed a moral wrong?\n\nOn the topic of Atheism:\nI do not believe in God, I also do not believe in Spiderman.\nYet if I saw a guy in a red and blue suit run out in front of me, shoot something at the side of the building across the street, and leap swinging away at high speed I'd believe in Spiderman.\n\nIf some event that I currently cannot conceive but admit to the possibility of occurred to convince me that there was indeed a deific entity that matched up with the Judeo-Christian God, I would then believe in Him.\n\nThat is no guarantee that I would then choose to worship Him, but I would believe.\n\nI certainly don't worship anything or anybody else, I'm just not built that way.\n\nI'm back, super long holiday weekend and birthday, buddy's bachelor party, traveling out of town is done! Apparently failing to close a bold text causes the rest of the page to be bolded. I tried closing it here. Other than that. I'll try to respond.\n\nThe point of atheism being a belief that God does not exist is that you believe you have enough \"evidence\" to say that there is no God.\n\nThe point of agnosticism being a general absense of belief in the existence or absense of God is that with hold actual belief in any position as evidence cannot be presently obtained to rule out any option.\n\nSo, whether or not you'd change your view when presented with conflicting evidence doesn't really have any bearing on which one you are.\n\nLet me explain further:\n\nJust because new information can change your mind doesn't make you any less of an atheist or theist, it just means you're willing to listen to new evidence.\n\nAgnosticism doesn't just mean you're willing to listen to new evidence. It means you refuse to take a stance until such evidence is recieved. Huxley (the creator of the term) specifically meant it as a point between belief in God's existence and belief in God's non-existence. It is the non-belief in existence/non-existence until either side proves true.\n\nIf you believe that God does not exist. You are an atheist.\n\nIf you do not know what to believe and so with-hold judgment until information should pop up either way then you are an Agnostic.\n\nSaying you have a lack of belief in God is only half the answer. The other answer needs to include whether or not you have a belief in Him not existing.\n\nPosition: Belief in Existence Neither Belief in Non-Existence\nTheism: YES NO NO\nAgnosticism: NO YES NO\nAthiesm: NO NO YES\n\nUnless Atheism is being used to cover agnosticism too (something that Huxley and agnostics adamantly disagree with, like atheists are their Mormons), then it can have no part with agnosticism because a stance has been taken. If it is being used as a synonym with agnosticism which I have shown is an incorrect use after the acceptance of agnosticism as a distinct term, then saying agnostic atheist is like saying agnostic agnostic. It is not just redundant, it is redundant redundant\u2026\n\n\"which I have shown is an incorrect use\"\u2026You have made many statements. But have not \"shown it\" to be an incorrect use. Again, the Wikipedia article on Agnostic Atheism, which includes my favorite Bertrand Russel quote, would seem to contradict you, as does.[5]\n\nAnd, of course, Huxley himself:\n\n\"Agn 'Try all things, hold fast by that which is good'; it is the foundation of the Reformation, which simply illustrated the axiom that every man should be able to give a reason for the faith that is in him, it is the great principle of Descartes; it is the fundamental axiom of modern science. Positively the principle may be expressed: In matters of the intellect, follow your reason as far as it will take you, without regard to any other consideration. And negatively: In matters of the intellect,.\"\n\n\"\u2026Not a creed, but a method\"\n\n.\n\nSo, while one can assert that in one's opinion at present there does not seem to be information to support the positive assertion of a god, so long as one says \"but we don't/can't know for sure\", one would be agnostic by Huxley's definition, while also atheistic in the sense that when asked, the response to \"do you believe in god\" would be \"no\".\n\nAh, I see, you're saying that it would be like that. I disagree. If scientists for the past 60 years had been able to repeatedly send particles faster than the speed of light then that would be the current scientific belief even if wrong. The fact that everything in our universe has always had a cause and effect should not be thrown out because we have just found a process that we're unaware of the cause of. As far as I can tell, none of the scientists are saying that there is no cause. Again, the terminology they use to name these processes are extremely confusing to anyone who hasn't researched them deeper but the principle of causality is still very firmly established.\n\nRead the wiki on causaility and it'll explain to you that special relativity is married to it and currently making little causality/relativity rosey cheeked babies that grow into full grown iron fisted principles of their own.\n\n\"It is considered to be fundamental to all natural science, especially physics\"\n\nIf cause and effect fall, then so does everything else, including particles being able to travel faster than the speed of light or faster than instananeous. This is great for time travel but really crappy for modern understanding of all science.\n\nFrom the link above:\n\n\".\"\n\nSo you see, to violate causality is to violate special relativity. Keep this in mind when reading new scientific discoveries that use words like \"random\", \"net zero\" or \"uncertainty\".\n\nIn fact, keep two principles in mind:\n\nConservation of Energy and Causality.\n\nThere is a lot in QFT which may appear at first glance to conflict with one of those rules but if you actually research them you'll find out that there is no conflict whatsover.\n\nPresent the single strongest QFT experiment that you feel discards either of those and I can pretty quickly provide you with a link to the contrary defined with fancy diagrams and explanations. I recommend using google first, yourself, before presenting any such experiment because this is a common misconception and so regularly rebutted by physicists. There is often a claim, \"This violates causality\" and the it is either explained why that is not the case or why the results are incorrect.\n\nPost 2 Aug 29, 2012 @5:24 pm\n\nSomeone who lacks belief in God and doesn't know for sure if He doesn't exist isn't entirely defined yet. The question of whether or not they then believe in His non-existance needs to be answered.\n\nFor example, you can believe that God doesn't exist even if you don't know for sure that He doesn't.\n\nThe point of agnosticism is that you don't know either way so you are with-holding judgement until such a time as adequate evidence could be presented.\n\nThis is what the advent of agnosticism did. It created a seperate category where before had only been theism and atheism. Now there is something inbetween. It is not for or against theism. Again, I presented Huxley's own words on this.\n\nYour nipple example is exactly the point. You don't know whether or not I have four nipples. If you believe I have four nipples or believe I don't have four nipples then you have crossed the line out of indecision based on a lack of evidence to a belief in something regardless of lack of evidence.\n\nI do not understand why this has been difficult to understand.\n\nPost 3 Aug 29, 2012 @7:35 pm\n\nI'll agree that Atheism has included the area of non-belief, but the moment that Huxley's term became accepted over a century ago the distinction seperated itself out. It is specifically designed to not be atheist or theist by his own words. So no, atheism has NEVER been meant to include agnosticism. The moment agnosticism was created it was meant to be it's own seperate thing. Atheism may have included it befure, but Huxley correctly pointed out the need for such a distinction and so one now exists and is now being abused by people who don't know any better.\n\nIt's fantastic that you can cite people who have incorrectly used the term agnostic or agnosticism. I have presented, for you, the original creator and his own definition as a distinction away from atheism. The quote I presented even included \"atheism\". Here, I'll post his quote again:\n\n\".\"\n\nSo you should be able to clearly see his intention and the understanding of the word Atheism in his day as the belief that God does not exist. It's just that anything other than theism was thrown into that term before he came up with the term. To use agnostic in any other way is to fail in the understanding of the history and intention of the term. It is cute that people would use agnostic as a prefix that is synonymous with the word \"weak\" or that they would suffix atheism or theism to imply which position they side with, but that is just wrong. The entire point of agnosticism is to withhold siding with either and so to do so is to missuse the term.\n\nAgain, how would you define agnostic atheism. The definition I presented from the wikipedia pages you just told me to read (as if I hadn't already done so) is exactly the definition of agnostic. So what difference does throwing the term atheism on the end of it? The best that you can arrive at is that you are being redundant in usage if you wish to say that agnosticism is part of atheism, the worst you can arrive at is that you are simply misusing the term. My belief is that you are doing both, misusing the term and being redundant.\n\nI did not say that this term is not being used in this way, my claim is that it is only being used incorrectly. Perhaps so that people can use two big words when defining their beliefs to sound more intelligent. People like using big words, it makes them feel better about themselves.\n\nNote the ambiguity mentioned in your quote:\n\n\"while, then, it is erroneous to identify agnosticism and atheism, it is equally erroneous so to separate them as if the one were exclusive of the other\u2026 \"\n\nIt seems to say that they are not the same thing and yet cannot be seperated, lending to the idea that he doesn't know what the Hell he's talking about, saying that you're wrong either way. The only reason why it is difficult to divorce agnosticism from atheism is because atheism included agnosticism and all things non-theistic (some religions are atheistic) previous to the distinction. In the sense that atheism may mean absense of belief you can find agnosticism within its ranks. What you should not be able to find is agnostic atheism due to the redundancy.\n\nThis is what we have, we have me citing the creator of the word and its intended use and then we have you citing people who then immediately misuse it and me freely admitting that people misuse it. So, to me, it's like you're citing people who use it incorrectly as evidence that the word means something that it doesn't. Your claim that I have to do better than Bertrand Russell pails when I make the claim that you have to do better than Huxley, the word's creator.\n\nIf I created the word \"spork\" to define an item that is neither fork nor spoon and yet both of them, you would be incorrect to say that it means spoon. No matter how many times you say that it means spoon it doesn't change the definition. It is still its own thing, in between both (though it fails in that agnosticism is neither whereas a spork is a combination of both).\n\nHowever, for your sake I will do better. I'll see your Betrand Russell quote from 1952 and raise with a Betrand Russel essay from 1953:\n\nThis is a particularly good link as it also includes some discussion on morality in the absense of theism.\n\n.\n\nBetrand shows the same distinction I've been making. He goes on to establish though that an agnostic may be very close to atheistic in that the probability which he may esteem theism could be so low as to almost not be considered but there is the firm line of throwing it out vs. leaving it there as a very unlikely thing. The moment that line is crossed you have breached into atheism.\n\nI could have merely left the quote at this though:\n\n\"Are agnostics atheists?\n\nNo\"\n\nCan they be very close to atheists in their beliefs? Yes. But they are not atheist.\n\nPlease note that Betrand is comparing the specific religions here because his main audience are Christians. He is correct that faith in a specific deity is not intrinsically different from faith in a different deity in as much as there are no clearly contradictory tenents (for example, scientology was started by a man who stated that he could make a lot more money by starting a religion than he could by continuing to try and make money of publishing literature. This is actual evidence that could empiracly place this religion on a lower pedistal than ones where no clear motive were expressed and then carried through with). The problem with this lies in ignoring the concept that some deity we do not know of has created the universe. Something that doesn't require the same sort of faith to consider that picking a specific deity does. As I said, the belief in a deity much as a belief in any particular scientific process believed responsible for creation of the universe may be arrived through reason. It is the next step to ascribe specific properties to the deity that then breaches faith. I am, admittedly, guilty of faith in that respect as much as I am a Christian. But my belief in theism as the correct theory of the universe's existence is no less thought out than any other process in as much as I do divorce the logical conclusion of theism from the faith based acceptance of Christianity. Any Christian who would tell you that Christianity may be arrived at by anything other than faith is at best ignorant and at worst a liar (poor Occam and his less known theory of Christianity by nature).\n\nI think, in the end, that the advent of agnosticism saw the greatest loss of theists and atheists when both sides lost all the members who don't actively believe in a creator or that a creator does not exist. Huxley, in my opinion, accidentally created a term for one of the largest segments of society there is today and subsequently diminished the larger two that came before him.\n\nPerhaps if you read the entirety of things, you would make less stupidly confrontational comments.\n\nOh damn, I failed pretty bad at that attempt at humor. I thought the \"haha\" got me out of Poe's Law. My apologies. I was in too much of a hurry to get something out before my extended vacation.\n\nOnto Science!I can say it a little louder I guess (As loud as typing goes anyways):\n\nI said: \"Only that the laws in this universe did not necessarily apply to anything before the universe. \"\n\nStrawmans are super fun to use but not really condusive to the discussion. I am claiming exactly what you have said. That the laws of this universe may or may not have carried on from before our universe's inception. This is not me saying that the laws did or did not apply previously, only that you can't make a claim one way or the other. You demanded that any \"unmoved mover\" of this universe would themselves need a mover according to the principles of our universe. This makes no sense as I've clearly stated that the laws of our universe do not necessarily preceed our universe.\n\nThat being said, for all we know God, if He exists, may have a family and a birthday, may be more than one person, may be many things. But at some point the principle of causality will need to not apply as well as the conservation of energy and the principles of thermodynamics. Causality and conservation of energy are inherently self-conflicting (every effect must have a cause and yet energy cannot be created) and yet both are fundamental to nearly every area of scienceYou made the claim \"something from nothing\". The burden of proof is absolutely firmly on your shoulders.\n\nRemember that matter=energy and vice versa. There is a conversion between the two. To create anything from nothing is to create energy.\n\nNow then, please explain to me what principle actually proves that energy may be created and by all means link me to the large list of articles of buzz generated by this overturning of all science everywhere.\n\nOf course Agnosticism isn't a creed. It's an expression of NON-belief in the absense of evidence. It is withholding an acceptance of creed. It's the method of not believing either side if no evidence exists.\n\nIt would be logically illogical in that light to be a creed. Are you trying to say that it is not a cosmological position? It most certainly is. There are agnostics, I believe in them even if they aren't sure if they believe in me or other things/people/places!\n\n\"Are you trying to say that it is not a cosmological position? It most certainly is.\"\n\nAccording to the originator, which I quoted, it most certainly is not.\n\nIt is a method of arriving at an answer, wherein one does not pretend to know what one does not; where one allows one's reason to go as far as it can, and no further.\n\nHowever, Bertrand Russell actually agreed with you, in some of his writing, but at the end it becomes clear that it doesn't really make sense even to him to differentiate in the manner you are trying for:\n\n\".\"\n\nTo be honest, this is a long debate on terminology that I think we can both prove has been used differently by different people over time.\n\nNeither of us is truly \"right\", since we can both prove our cases to a certain extent.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, I believe mine is more \"precise\", allowing one to make clear one's position on both knowledge and existence of god using only two words, while I find fault with yours because it means that there's probably about 5 atheists in the world, since I've met no atheists who don't at least acknowledge both our lack of certain knowledge, and the possibility of the existence of god(s), making them agnostics, with no more clarification regarding the position they take on existence.\n\nRussell's point as he clearly states is that Agnosticism may be so close to Atheism that it is functionally the same thing thing, not that it is. This correctly adheres to my claim that Atheism is belief that God does not exist rather than just uncertainty. Russell's statement also fails to encompass all the agnostics who do not consider the \"chances\" to be unnecessary to consider or extremely unlikely. He's just pointing to the idea that they may be very similar. His answer is still no and he is right, agnostics are not atheists. Some may be very close to atheists but with the advent of agnosticism atheism became a belief system now that a term to describe non-belief or indecision due to unavailable evidence exists.\n\nThe originator intended it to be something other than atheism and theism. He specifically mentioned them as things his belief was meant to be contrary to.\n\nAgain, agnosticism is not a creed because it does not have any set of beliefs or tenets except that without evidence no position should be taken. It is very much a cosmological position. There are agnostics. These are individuals who do not believe in God and yet do not believe God does not exist. If you fit both of those categories, you are agnostic.\n\nThere are not set tenets of belief to go along with it.\n\nYes, there are much fewer atheists in the world, that is true. Dawkins pointed this out with his scale making even himself a de-facto atheist but not actually an atheist. Atheists in contrast with Agnostics are making that step from leaning towards to faith in. This is in line with what Russell was saying. The individuals he's saying that are close enough to atheism to practically be atheists (while not being atheists) are the \"de facto\" atheists that Dawkins placed in his scale. I would suspect he's read Russell quite closely. But in distinguishing between atheism and de facto atheism even Dawkins has admitted that atheism is now used to define 100% belief that God does not exist.\n\nSo you see, this means the Russell, Dawkins, and even Huxley would not call an agnostic an atheist nor would they call an atheist and agnostic.\n\nYou may think that agnostic atheism is more precise, but it isn't. It's two conflicting beliefs in that one is a belief and the other isn't. Huxley didn't believe it was a creed because it's a statement of non-belief. I don't know why that statement isn't making sense.\n\nCreed: Statement of beliefs.\nAgnosticism: Statement of not believing.\n\nErgo, agnosticism =/= creed.\n\nIt does mean you don't adhere to theism, atheism, or pantheism (don't know why Huxley felt the need to distinguish theism from pantheism) as Huxley stated.\n\nI am, to a certain extent, beginning to lose patience with this. It is a debate about definitions, not concepts, and has gone on far too long.\n\nI showed how the originator of the term stated it was not its own creed. (Therefore, not an alternative creed to Atheism/Theism, but rather, a different way of approaching the question). I have given several examples (including ones contemporary to the formation of the word) that support my position that \"agnostic atheist\" is a legitimate term. I have pointed you to the gorram wikipedia article on \"agnostic atheism\". And I've granted that your position has a certain degree of validity, however, I explained why I felt there was more precision in mine, in that for both theists and atheists there are those who claim to KNOW there is/isn't a god, and those who do not claim to KNOW it.\n\nAnd your response to my evidence is \"you're wrong\". Sorry, but rather, your statement that it does not exist, and/or is a \"wrong use\" is what is wrong, and you are wrong to continue to make it in light of the contemporary sources and encyclopedia entries on the subject.\n\nI will say this: I apologize for my initial statements that your position was wrong, in light of the fact that the word has been used in the manner you described. However, it has also been used in the way I describe (and I still maintain that, both etymologically and philosophically speaking the way I prefer to use it makes more sense, but that's a different debate).\n\nI have proven that multiple times. Go argue with the mods on the wikipedia article for \"agnostic atheism\" that the thing they have defined does not exist. In the meantime, you are flatly and completely wrong when you try to say that the term does not exist when it clearly does. You keep pretending that I made this concept up. I did not.\n\nHey Grifter \u2013 YouTube is the only way I know to embed a pic into a post here on Popehat. Unless someone can pas along instructions otherwise so I can post it properly. I know it can be done \u2013 just not how.\n\nI am under the impression that you can't embed in WordPress unless the mods install the plugin that allows it, so using Youtube is solid concept\u2026but I'm not a mod, so, undoubtedly they know more than me.\n\n@David:\n\n(Since you mod\u2026) how is it that one poster can frack up the other posters, but they can't unfrack it? I tried to close all possible tags (including, obviously, b), and yet everything stayed bold\u2026.is there a way for us humble posters to try to help, at least for posts going past ours?\n\nIt has been my point this entire debate on the nature of the word that it is when you go a step further to actually take a side that you cease to be agnostic and this is because you are now adherring to a creed or belief system.\n\nSo agnosticism is by definition not a creed because it is specifically the position of not holding a creed.\n\nMy response to your \"evidence\" was more evidence.\n\nI cited the word's creator stating that he is not an atheist, theist, or a pantheist but rather an agnostic and then going on to define the term. Meaning that the term conflicts with any of the previously listed creeds and ergo should not be combined with them.\n\nI cited one of your own sources, Russell, whom you admitted did not believe that agnostics were atheists and answered the question with a no.\n\nI cited Dawkins, widely considered the current foremost \"atheist\" or at least the most public one at the moment whose scale puts atheists at 100% and thereby distinguishing them from the rest of the field. Dawkins even considers himself to not be an atheist but something very close to it.\n\nI don't think you could ask for more evidence from me. This in no way sounds like a \"you're wrong\".\n\nAs for the wikipedia page, read the talk page. They are very much aware of the poor sourcing and incorrect citations. I've never edited wikipedia before but I think I should contribute for once. The most I should probably do though is cite Huxley (not even mentioned on the page) and perhaps even Russell's essay. The page is very poorly cited and Robert Flint was known to be extremely anti-Agnostic.\n\nFrom the Talk page:\n\nRegarding Robert Flint being a terrible source:\n\"The present work, then, is not an historical, colorless estimate of the part played by Agnosticism in modern thought; it is a partisan work, destined to refute the agnostic. source = P. E. Winter. \"Agnosticism by Robert Flint, Review\". The American Journal of Psychology, Vol. 14, No. 2 (Apr., 1903), pp. 254-255.\"\n\nRegarding the page in general:\n\nThe article is almost wholly unsourced \u2013 and the sources that are mentioned are very poor indeed. un\u262fmi 21:37, 13 December 2011 (UTC)\n\nRegarding the Bertrand Russell quote that you accidentally used and so led you into a debate folly:\n\n\"Try as I might, I can't find mention of either agnostic or ateapostist in the source, the relevance to the current article seems very dubious. un\u262fmi 02:54, 16 June 2012 (UTC)\"\n\nNow that I see that referrence, I read the link it used to cite him and also did not find the term ateapostist or ateapotist.\n\nPlease feel free to browse the Archive pages which seems to include everything we've talked about here but in an inflamatory manner. For example,\n1. there is a discussion of an article about the term being an oxymoron. Both sides are taken in much the same way we're doing here but with no sources.\n2. There is a quote of Dawkins stating that he's agnostic only to the extent that he's agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden which is why he made a scale that weeded out agnosticism altogether because it unfairly weeds out those who are de facto atheists and would otherwise have them be just agnostic which is a pretty vague term. Dawkins has recognized the oxymoronic use of \"agnostic atheist\" and so his proposed scale was to remove agnostic from defintion and proposed de facto atheists or de facto theists as those who believe but do not claim to know. I believe in God but He hasn't come down and told me that He exists, I'm not a theist in this scale but a de facto theist. I'd say Dawkin's scale is the most accurate to date.\n\nThis page needs a lot of work. If I was to edit it I would present evidence on the alternative definition but have to include the allowance of ambiquous definitions of atheism that lead people to think the two are compatible.\n\nBut until then, I think it's pretty clear from what I've established that this wiki page is really FAR from correct in any light.\n\nI readily accept that my belief in the Christian God in particular is faith based. In light of that, my rejection of the other deities is likewise faith based since I believe in the one and not the others. I will say that I have certain reasons why I would hold the Christian faith in higher esteem than other faiths, including a paper I wrote affirming Christianity as the betting man's religion or giving a person the greatest chance of making it to Heaven if such a place exists. But my reasoning is not something I would be so arrogant as to assume that others will hold in the same esteem nor that they should.\n\nMy comments in this thread were to espouse the idea that the belief that a sentient being (i.e. God) is not an unreasonable position or necessarily one held out of faith. It can be believed in as much as any other theory or hypothesis and should be possible without any degree of ridicule.\n\nMy comments in this thread were not to say that any specific quality or believed interaction with the sentient being are likewise are likewise reasonable. They aren't, that step requires faith and cannot be defended scientifically. I accept that my step into that realm is entirely personal choice and a gamble that disregards other feasible possibilities.\n\n@Grifter:\n\nIn reference to Huxley on it not being a creed, the following is the context:\n\nIt appears that Mr. Gladstone some time ago asked Mr. Laing if he could draw up a short summary [ 362 ] of the negative creed; a body of negative propositions, which have so far been adopted on the negative side as to be what the Apostles' and other accepted creeds are on the positive; and Mr. Laing at once kindly obliged Mr. Gladstone with the desired articles\u2014eight of them.\n\nIf any one had preferred this request to me I should have replied that, if he referred to agnostics, they have no creed; and, by the nature of the case, cannot have any. Agn \"Try all things, hold fast by that which is good;\" it is the foundation of the Reformation, which simply illustrated the axiom that every man should be able to give a reason for the faith that is in him; it is the great principle of Descartes; it is the fundamental axiom of modern science. Positively the principle may be expressed: In matters of the intellect follow your reason as far as it will take you without regard to any other consideration. And negatively: In matters of the intellect.\n\nSo, hopefully you see that he does believe it to be a \"faith\", but that it cannot be a creed like other religions hold. He would state that the Atheist creed is only that God does not exist.\n\nI have done as you recommended and presented my case to the Wiki page.\n\nHe didn't invent the term atheist, so, hard as it may be to believe: he may not be right. He believes, as you do, that to be an \"atheist\" is to make the statement of certainty: There is no god. Etymologically speaking, that is not necessary. Simply lacking the belief in god is enough. The belief in anything's nonexistence is, by nature, rarely a certainty. I'm no more certain that there are no real gods than that there are no real unicorns; this does not mean I have faith there's no god, but rather, that the faithful are positing something, and until they prove their case, I will not believe them, because logically the burden is on the one making the assertion. It does not take faith to reject the positive hypothesis.\n\nI did not say Huxley created the word Atheist. I said that he created the term Agnostic and defined what it was intended to be and what it was intended to not be and Atheism along with pretty much all other isms were on that list. The definition of Atheism is largely debated to this day. I can say that the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy both definitively put Atheism in the explicit denial of God category while Oxford seems to bridge the gap and include the broad idea of non-belief. There is no consenses as far as I can tell. Huxley may be wrong, but he may be right. The exact definition of Atheism is not what I'm debating here, it's the definition of Agnostic.\n\nThe problem is that the use of Agnostic in the wiki page and in general is the theological term. If it were just the colloquial term (I could be agnostic about string theory, for example) then it would be acceptable to say but not a \"belief\" system.\n\nIn any event, the term Agnostic Atheist is not definitionally different than Agnosticsm. Both definitions are that they \"do not believe in God and don't believe we can know if God exists or not\".\n\nYou are correct. It does not take faith to reject the positive hypothesis. It takes faith to reject the positive hypothesis AND accept a negative hypothesis when there is a possibility, small or otherwise, that the positive hypothesis is correct. If I am a poker player and have cards that give me a 90% chance to win, believing that I will win is a step of faith that makes up the remaining 10% and may leave my belief firmly in the wrong category once all the cards have been dealt. If you have 99% certainty that God does not exist (a number that may already be arrived at by faith, mind you) but 1% doubt and yet believe that God does not exist then your faith is bridging that 1%.\n\nI'd put myself at around 60-70% certainty that God exists with a 20% \"faith\" bridge that would put me in the De Facto Theist category. The 30-40% uncertainty comes with the understanding that while I absolutely believe that the universe was created by something, it could have been a non-sentient but identifiable process. Even though I proposed a loose definition for God that may include non-sentient causes I do not myself adhere to that.\n\nI disagree that saying \"I shall behave and believe that which is most likely, while acknowledging other possibilities\" requires any faith whatsoever.\n\nAnd, you said \"He would state that the Atheist creed is only that God does not exist.\", which is what brought that into the discussion. If that's what he would say (and I'm not disagreeing he would have said that), I would argue he would be wrong. Just as being a Theist doesn't speak to how much certainty you have necessarily(though it usually does), neither does atheism. If his word was created to create something that already existed, then it would seem to make sense that the definition would change enough to account for that.\n\nFrom an etymological standpoint, \"gnosis\" means knowledge. A-gnosis means lack of knowledge; the prefix (in this case)means \"without\" or \"not\".\n\nPerhaps we should be discussing the nature of \"belief\". For me, I don't believe things which do not have some kind of legitimate evidence. I'm as much an \"aunicornist\" as I am an \"atheist\"; I lack any affirmative belief (and, again, the burden is on the asserter to prove their case). This doesn't mean there aren't unicorns somewhere in the Congo, or a god somewhere in the universe, but that since I don't know they exist, and they are not a prediction from any hypothesis that has any proven reliability, I will tentatively say \"No\" if asked whether they exist. Using your terms, what does that make me? I have no faith in any position, but that doesn't mean that they are all equally likely.\n\n1., 2., and 4. Hmm, I see what you mean. You'll accept the most likely option so long as it is the most likely option. In my scenario of poker, I would most likely bet a lot as the odds of me winning would be very high but that doesn't necessarily mean that I reject the possibility of losing due to the 10% of scenarios that could play out to spell my loss.\n\nIn this respect, I say Agnosticism views Theism and Atheism as binary. 100% or 0%. Actual decisions affirming or rejecting God with nothing inbetween. You seem to agree that this was the intention of its creator but reject that the intention should impact the use.\n\nI say that Atheism may include in it, only two options if you accept every main definition (except the use of it in antiquity where it could mean anyone who doesn't adhere to your particular deity).\na. The belief that God does not exist.\nb. The lack of belief in God.\n\nNow then, if you believe that God does not exist then you have taken a side. Agnosticism would then be naturally contradictory to this definition as Agnosticism in its theological sense (as opposed to colloquially like a Cosmologist may be agnostic towards string theory, wikipedia defines it using the theological/religious definition) as Agnosticism carries in it the lack of decision in the absense of real proof (boy oh boy does this infuriate Dawkins, he calls them fence sitting cowards!).\n\nThen, perhaps you'd prefer the defintion that Atheism can contain within it the absence of belief. In this case the addition of the word Atheism to Agnosticism carries no difference in definition.\n\nPlease explain the difference between Agnosticism and Agnostic Atheism.\n\n3. Yes, Huxley explained why he made the term that way. Is there any specific point you wish to add to a belief system he very well could have called \"Huxleyianism\"? It isn't like this is a word created in the ancient latin speaking world. This is the late 1800. It's relatively new.\n\nThe difference in my mind between agnostic atheism and agnosticism is that agnosticism does not necessarily take any position on the existence of god.\n\nEven without certainty, there are 3 options: Believe it should be considered true until disproven (agnostic theism), believe it cannot be considered either true or untrue (Huxley/traditional agnosticism), believe it should be considered untrue until proven (Agnostic atheism).\n\nThe argument \"you can't prove there isn't a god\" (and therefore, belief makes more sense) would be a type of \"agnostic theist\" argument.\n\nThe argument \"The burden of proof rests on the one making the claim, and until they have proven their point I will not believe their argument\" is a type of \"agnostic atheist\" argument.\n\nBut that's my point, an Agnostic by definition does not take a position on the existence of God. Agnostics do not believe God exist nor do they believe He doesn't.\n\nIf you combine either theism or atheism with the term agnostic it ceases to be agnosticism if a stance is taken. Agnosticism is truly fence sitting. In my opinion, it is functionally atheism and combining it with theism would be even worse but Agnosticism is more specific of a term in that it specifies non-belief and the belief that we cannot ever really know (at the very least not presently).\n\nAs for your definition of Agnostic Theism: \"Believe it should be considered true/untrue until disproven\"\n\nPlease, by all means, cite the source for that definition. Try as I might I cannot find any such definition accompanying agnostic anything with the word \"believe\" as taking a stance is specifically the part that agnosticism is trying to avoid.\n\nYou are making the error that J.J.C. Smart mentioned in the source you listed earlier:\n\nScottish\n\nBelieving in something but not ruling out the possibility that you're wrong isn't agnosticism. It's just not being stubborn. I believe in a ton of things that if evidence countered I would recant. If you believe that God does not exist then you are Atheist, no Agnostic about it. There is nothing wrong with that, you don't need to tag the word \"Agnostic\" on the front of it to let us know that if evidence ever cropped up to the contrary that you'd change your view. That's not the point or definition of it.\n\nThis is why I like Dawkin's scale so much. It takes into account the variance in degrees of agnosticism without combining contradictory terms.\n\nIf you really want to express the inability to know God while affirming that you do not know him, you may want to look into the term: Epistemological Atheism and its four subcategories (Primarily Objectivist Atheism or Skeptical Atheism). It appears to be functionally the same thing you intend to say with \"Agnostic Atheism\" but sidesteps the pitfalls of using another belief system as an adjective for a belief system it was meant to counter\n\n (this source actually mentions the use of agnosticism by atheists and views it as the same as saying \"I'm open minded\" and as such is not useful and not accurate.\n\n1. ETHICAL ATHEISM or EXISTENTIAL ATHEISM (Sartre, Camus):\nBecause life is absurd, there is no god. The idea of god is inconsistent with the idea of freedom.\n2. PSYCHOLOGICAL ATHEISM (Feuerbach):\nIdeas of god are simply of psychological origin.\n3. SOCIOLOGICAL ATHEISM (Engels, Bakunin):\nIdeas of god are false because they have caused social repression.\n4. PRAGMATIC ATHEISM:\nIdeas of god are not useful, therefore they must be false.\n5. METAPHYSICAL ATHEISM (d'Holbach, Marx):\nSince only matter exists, god \u2013 being immaterial \u2013 cannot exist.\n6. EPISTEMOLOGICAL ATHEISM:\nKnowledge of god is impossible.\n\nThere are several subcategories [of Epistemological Atheism]:\nKEPTICAL ATHEISM: (based on Hume, although Hume was not atheist)\nSince one cannot be certain of knowing anything, one cannot know of the existence of God.\nLOGICAL-POSITIVE ATHEISM (Ayer):\nAny statement about a transcendent being is fundamentally meaningless.\nLINGUISTIC-ANALYSIS ATHEISM:\nSince the term \"god\" cannot be defined, it cannot have meaning.\nOBJECTIVIST ATHEISM (Ayn Rand):\nProof of anything about god has never been satisfactorily given.\n\nDo you not have access to Wikipedia at your work? It seems that it would have naturally followed from our discussion, though you mispasted when you asked your question\u2026I said an agnostic theist position would be (but not that it is THE ONLY agnostic theist position, of course) to believe until disproven (and, I suppose I didn't include that within that is to say \"and it hasn't been/can't be\"). I didn't say that \"Believe it should be considered true/untrue until disproven\" was the agnostic theist position, as that would encompass both theism and atheism.\n\nAgain, from my perspective (I can't defend agnostic theism effectively), I feel that those positing an idea must defend it, because otherwise I am stuck believing all the contradictory religious beliefs of the world. I don't believe it requires faith to go to the Null hypothesis until/unless more data comes along. Thus, while I believe the question is uknown in answer (and, further, I believe it's IMPOSSIBLE to know if god exists), if asked I would say that I have no reason to believe in god's existence, and therefore I do not believe in god.\n\nIt always has been when I've seen it before. I looked at the time, and the offending tag was <b />. Note the space: it's the hallmark of an invalid auto-inserted self-closing tag. WP can do this when it sees nested formatting tags (i.e., the orginal would have been a second <b>), but the tree eventually runs wild. I didn't run the page through a parser at the time, but that's my guess. This \"autocorrection\" can be turned off, IIRC.\n\nIs there a way to just fix the problem? ItYes, you get somebody who can redact the thing from on high. I've seen user-level dorking around remedy similar problems, but never on WP.\n\nItI think the issue is a conflation of XHTML, which allows any tag to self-close, with HTML, which allows this only for void and foreign elements. So, if the platform is thinking XHTML and serving HTML, one can spray invalid <b />'s and so forth.\n\nYes, the foundation of apistemological atheism is agnosticism. How does that become \"therefore agnostic atheism\"? It doesn't, it means that there are actual terms that include agnostic tendencies for atheists that grew out of the agnostic movement. If anything, it saying that it has roots in agnosticism without bringing up the term \"Agnostic Atheism\" and even talking about it's problems should indicate all the more the fallibility of its use.\n\nHah, the Agnostic Theist page is actually better than the Agnostic Atheist page. I would not have expected that. I guess I am just biased against Agnostic Theism because I consider believing the affirmative to be an even more egregious act against agnosticism than believing the negative. I do believe that Agnostics leaning closer to Atheism are just being more honest.\n\nMay I ask why you consider Wikipedia to be a legitimate source though? I picked apart the Agnostic Atheism page pretty thoroughly but that was easy since the talk pages already included those criticisms and I needed only to list them. This particular page, for example, only has three sources and only one is directly talking about agnosticism being theistic or atheistic. I don't see why this single source should be particularly authoritative though, especially when I have cited much more popular sources than this \"George H. Smith from 1979\". Is he more authoritative than Huxley, Russell, and Dawkins?\n\nThe Agnostic Theist page is riddled with the same problems:\n\n2.It is questionable how coherent this position is. \"I believe X but I don't know that X\". Well if knowledge is justified true belief, that expands to \"I believe X, but believe that either X is false, or that I don't believe X, or that I am not justified in believing X\" \u2013 all three options seem to commit some variant of Moore's paradox. Believing something, but admitting you aren't justified in believing it, is somewhat paradoxical. Are there any reliable sources containing this criticism? Since I would be surprised if no one had made it, it seems clear to me.\n\nAnd\n\nThis position may be seen as a logical fallacy because the agnostic theist is holding a belief, even though he/she is in a state of doubt. In order to believe something, you give a conviction made on knowledge about something you find to be true; in which an agnostic does not do. Additionally, to be in a state of doubt, you make no conviction.\n\nThese terms are logically illogical. In this scenario you are saying \"I believe despite not having evidence\". Belief requires personal evidence (even if that personal evidence is wrong). Again, Theism IS the belief in God/gods. Where atheism may include individuals who just don't believe in God while not denying his existence, Theists must believe that He does exist.\n\nFaith is generally considered to be belief WITHOUT (or, in some cases, IN SPITE OF) evidence.\n\nAnd you did not pick apart the wikipedia pages \"pretty thoroughly\". For example, the page on agnostic atheism lists a contemporary of Huxley. You didn't like that source, but it certainly supported the idea that that's how the word may be used. I am not taking the position that your use of the words in question are wrong, but rather, I am just as right, if by \"right\" we define it as \"this is how these words have been used\", as opposed to \"I made up this definition just now\".\n\nI used Wikipedia, but I could just as easily link to dozens more; Wikipedia was just easy. Google it yourself, since if I include the literally 100s of links I could, I'd get stuck in moderation limbo. My use is by no means uncommon.\n\n@Grifter @Gavin- like and enjoy posts from both of you but am reminded of a post from Robert White a ways back about there being a point of diminishing return after which you realize you will not convince the other person to your viewpoint. Question \u2013 are you both there yet?\n\nAs much as I respect Robert White, I don't have that philosophy. As long as there COULD be progress, I'm willing to keep going\u2026 I assume I'm just not doing a good enough job explaining myself, plus, in theory I could always be convinced.

Then I dyed easter eggs and learned to play canasta! yay!\n\ni've also been thinking about a controversial type thing and i'd like to hear some opinions on it. :) In bible class we were talkin about euthenasia (however you spell it) But our main focus was on people who were in the last stages of cancer and in a lot of pain and they wanted the doctor to basically help them commit suicide by pumping them with drugs. Now i can understand why that would definately be wrong, but I got to thinking of a similar scenario and confuzed myself. What if a person was only living because a machine was keeping them alive. Without that machine they couldn't breath or anything and they were basically a vegetable with little to no hope of recovery. Would it be wrong to want to pull the plug? would that necessarily be suicide? The reason I ask is because if i were ever in taht state I would hate to be a financial burden on those paying the medical bill, but I wouldn't want to make a decision that may condemn me to hell either. I don't know.. what are your thoughts? :)\n\nNo, that would not be suicide because you are already dead at that point...just living only because a machine. And furthermore you couldn't make that decision for yourself...you would be a vegetable.\n\nI think it depends on what kind of tests they run to decide whether or not you are a vegetable. I mean, if you are absolutely brain dead then you are just a body. Terri Schiavo, although I don't want to open a can of worms, was not brain dead. In fact, she could learn to communicate. The \"life support\" she was denied was food and water. So ironic that she should die when not having it...\n\n\"Euthanasia (from Greek: \u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 -\u03b5\u03c5, eu, \"good\", \u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, thanatos, death) is the practice of terminating the life of a person or animal in a painless or minimally painful way.\" \"Life support, in the medical field, refers to a set of therapies for preserving a patient's life when essential body systems are not functioning sufficiently to sustain life unaided. Life support therapies utilize some combination of several techniques: feeding tubes, intravenous drips, total parenteral nutrition, mechanical respiration, heart/lung bypass, defibrillation, urinary catheterization and dialysis. The same techniques are also used for intensive care or in some cases during surgery, though life support is employed to stabilize a patient and is typically not sufficient to allow full recovery from their condition.\" I think that that \"pulling the plug\" is not committing sucided becuase you have no brain activity what so ever. Remember in bio 238 when talking about the madulla oblongata and the pons? well the Pons is in control of your breathing, if that is part of your brain is dead you can not live. and your pherenic nerve controls your diaphram which is connected to your spinal cord, which runs up through your madulla oblongata to your pons, will not help you at all if it is dead!"}

If you don't want the people who do it to be punished, if you believe that it's an issue between the person and God, why make it illegal?\n\n(and on a side note via JESUS CAMP: if you believe that Jesus can improve your bowling score, why can't He just make abortion something that doesn't exist and never has?)\n\nIt's quite likely that the higher-ups in the 'make abortion illegal' camp HAVE given thought to the suitable punishment for those who have abortions once they're made illegal -- but that levying a punishment proportional to their \"abortion=murder\" concept means stating that you want women who have abortions to be treated as murderers (death penalty? lifetime in prison?).

{"text": "Oklahoma Abortion Law: Going Too Far\n\nPosts\n\nThings get tricky when the question is phrased like 'do you oppose abortion.'\n\nProbably because nobody enjoys abortions. For most people even a zygote has a nonzero value. I don't value it as much as children, cats, and to a lesser extent, shrubbery, but it's still a nonzero value. That's why the position is called pro-choice and not pro-babymurder. It's also why late-term abortions are ickier than early term, because I think a lot of people feel a fetus accrues intrinsic worth as it becomes more like us.\n\ntl;dr: Well, duh, nobody likes it, but it's the lesser of two evils.\n\nEdit: To be clear, I'm not being patronizing to RedShell, but to the moron who phrases a polling question so broadly.\n\nLast I checked, you're in the minority (as a man or a woman) if you want to further restrict abortions in the general sense. Things get tricky when the question is phrased like 'do you oppose abortion.'\n\nI mean in reference to the section of people who want to ban abortion. Of that group women outnumber men. I don't mean that the majority of women want a ban on abortions, just that they're slightly more likely to want to than a manWell, I'd say it's much more complex than \"do I want a baby?\" There's the issue of knowing yourself well enough to predict how you'll feel in the future.\n\nOf course, then I have to point of that there've been several pyschological studies that seem to show adults across the board are not very good at predicting what will make them the happiest in the futureThere are those woman who act as though having an abortion ruined their lives, however, whom you see at Pro-Life ralliesThe worst case scenario of a hasty abortion is just \"some regret\"?\n\nWhen my best friend had an abortion, back in those halycon days of teenagerdom, she slumped in to a HUGE depression. She probably would have come close to a suicide attempt, if she hadn't gotten a kitten soon after, who she transfered any care-taking urges on to. Horomones are a LOT more affective than you think, and add to that the fact that teenagers simply lack life-experience, and no ammount of rational book knowledge, or what have you, can make up for that.\n\nTeenagers are not emotionally prepared to deal with certain situations. Heck, many twenty-somethings aren'tI'Twould be ideal, but pretty much impossible unfortunately; especially when done at the state-levelAnd in fact this decision isn't made in a vacuum. Most clinics have a waiting period of at least a day before the procedure is performed, and will always give the patient as much information as they can to help her make a decision either way.\n\nSo yeah, teenagers are capable of making this decision, even if the situation is not ideal, without their parents' guidanceIt's worth fighting for, IMO, and parental consent laws are NO substitution, since they create a whole new barrel of issues.\n\nEdit: the way to do it would be to do it through the \"industry\" itself, rather than through law. Have clinics agree on such counseling being considered as an industrial standard, or something.\n\nIn the absence of themselves from the future to consult with, teenagers have toIf you're talking about the Baby Boomers, they look back and think how stupid they were to use drugs while high on antidepressantsYou say that as if the same thing doesn't apply to middle-aged people looking back on their thirtiesIt has been said already, but I am pretty damn sure that this will be struck down sooner rather than later, due to the medical necessity billing clause of HIPAA if for no other reason.\n\nI thought someone earlier said that the only consequence was that you had to pay $10,000?\n\nIf abortions start costing medical practices an additional 10,000 dollars to perform due to violation of federal law due to a state law, you bet your ass the courts are going to fix this... and they ain't changing HIPAA for this.\n\nOh, I thought it was levied on the person getting the abortion. I know nothing about HIPAA.\n\nHIPAA, as a general rule, protects the patient and fucks the practitioner.\n\nJust my personal experience as a medical software developer\n\nThis is correct, it's levied against the practice per instance. And if you just pad the expected bill by 10k for fines from breaking federal law, it's all sorts of fraud.\n\nOccasionally HIPAA does something right. Most of the time it regulates the wrong shit. Such as this being against federal law for fucking BILLING reasons, not the patient's right to not have unneeded medical proceedures.\n\nedit: to clarify the stupidity of the clause, this only fines you if you bill the proceedure to an insurance company, not a patient. If it's an uninsured thing that shows up on the patient's door, there's no protection against unneccessary proceeduresLines have to be drawn in the sand somewhere. Some age has to be picked as thae age at which we assume people have had enough life experience and learning to be accountable. Our society picks 18, for whatever arbitrary reason.

I have been very clear that the choice blongs to NO ONE other than the woman, regardless of her age.\n\nedit: I'm done with you. If all that you're going to do is accuse me of having ulterior motives, and follow me between threads trolling me without actually reading what I've posted, then you've made it clear that you've got nothing to contribute, and are only dragging the threads off course. Don't bother responding to any of my posts in the future, because I won't be reading yoursIt was brought up as an argument in favor of the claim that teenagers are not mature enough to make decisions for themselves. Actually given the particular choices made in that analogy it was more brought up to mock the idea that teenagers can make decisions for themselves than to argue anything. Despite your claim that you oppose parental consent laws you are arguing in favor of them and doing a pretty abysmal job of it. And \"loltroll\" still does not constitute an argument, imbecile. change the more they stay the same in regards to maturity. (or at least anecdotally) changing, the more they stay the same in regards to maturity.\n\nAnd so then my claim that your remark wasn't really relevant is spot-on. I don't see how you're finding something to argue with."}
{"text": "Abortion United States Supreme Court in the 1973\n\nThe loss of a fetus before it is able to live outside the womb is called\nabortion. When abortion occurs spontaneously, it is often called a miscarriage.\nAbortion can also be intentionally caused, or induced. Induced abortion is\nregarded as a moral issue in some cultures. In others it is seen as an\nacceptable way to end unplanned pregnancy. Abortion is a relatively simple and\nsafe procedure when done by trained medical workers during the first three\nmonths (first trimester) of pregnancy. Abortion is less safe when performed\nafter the 13th week of pregnancy. Before the right of a woman to obtain an\nabortion was affirmed by the United States Supreme Court in the 1973 ruling on\nRoe vs. Wade, many abortions were performed illegally and in unskilled ways.\nThis caused the deaths of many women from infection and bleeding. It also caused\nmuch sterility, or the permanent inability to have a child. The usual surgical\ntechnique of abortion during the first trimester is to insert a metal or plastic\ntubeinto the uterus through its opening, the cervix. A spoonlike instrument at\nthe end of the tube is used to gently scrape the walls of the uterus. A suction\nmachine at the other end of the tube removes the contents from the uterus. This\nprocedure is called vacuum aspiration and is done primarily in a medical clinic\nor doctor's office using a local anesthetic for the cervix. During the second\ntrimester, abortions are usually done by means of dilation and evacuation. This\nprocedure uses forceps, curette, and vacuum aspiration. Although rarely sought,\nthird-trimester abortions may be performed when the fetus has severe genetic\ndefects or because continuing the pregnancy would be a threat to the woman's\nhealth. A controversy began in 1988 over a drug, developed in France, called\nRU 486, which, when taken during the first 7 weeks of pregnancy, causes the\nembryo to become detached from the uterus. The drug was reported to be safer and\nless expensive than surgical...\n[continues]"}

{"text": "that infants do not feel/experience pain. Before the mid 80's \u2013 they have been subjected to invasive medical procedures like surgery without any form of anesthetics. Because people simply thought (and I am not talking about common people \u2013 I am talking about medical professionals) that if the child don't talk about what they feel \u2013 then apparently they don't feel pain.\n\nThere has been tests done that shown without a doubt that circumcision is an extremely painful experience for the infant/child during and after the procedure. When preformed without anesthetics (which happens often still \u2013 especially in the undeveloped countries where circumcision is connected to ritualistic, religious or cultural practices) It cause changes in the behavior of the child after undergoing such procedure, and the child will most likely develop symptoms of a post-traumatic stress disorder. Not to mention that such children don't have any say in getting such a painful and unnecessary procedure that will scar them, and which consequences they will to live with and accept for the rest of their life.\n\nNow, there are two kinds of pathological, sick, psychopathic, and evil \u2013 let's call it \u2013 manifestations in this world (as I am referring to all kinds of things, phenomena, relationships, philosophies, accepted behaviors etc. that are existent in our world). There are evil manifestations that are obvious and in plain sight, visible for most, that generally 'no one can deny' \u2013 and if someone does, it is a result of a very intense brainwashing that is done to them by their environment, or that they do to themselves through their back-chat. The other type of evil manifestations, are those that require an in-depth understanding of how exactly and specifically they work, to understand how they are evil \u2013 while seemingly they look pretty harmless. But when adding up and in the context that they exist in, they consequently create extreme harm and abuse.\n\nCircumcision is in the first group. It's obvious, and in-the-face abusive practice. It's really hard to deny that it is sick to subject babies to such trauma, scarring them for the rest of their lives against their will. And as Ingrid Bloemheuvel on her blog said \u2013 if we don't see anything wrong with circumcision, then why don't we tattoo infants?\n\nAnd so, the question still remains. Why do we accept and allow circumcision? I understand that there might some rare situations that it is required to do that procedure because of medical reasons. But I mean women get their breasts amputated on occasions as part of cancer treatment \u2013 and it doesn't mean that breast amputation is a good thing. So, why is it acceptable? It's hard for me to imagine, how doing a totally unnecessary surgery that is involving amputating (any) part of the body can be accepted just because it's a part of culture, religion or custom. But I surely would consider that a culture, religion or custom (or anything or anyone for that matter) that is encouraging abuse being done on a defenseless infants is something that is nothing less then evil.\n\nAnd it's not only that it shouldn't be done, it should spark a curiosity and a serious investigation on to understand how have something/someone got to a point of encouraging such acts of abuse. Because it just speaks about the nature of that something/someone. And I don't mean necessarily pointing to specific cultures or religious groups. I mean to rather quest the whole concept of what is culture, what are customs and what is religion. Because if such things support abuse, and people just because it's a custom/cultural/religious thing aren't capable to recognize that it's sick \u2013 then there is something worth really looking at and that requires a solution. As finding faults and looking for scapegoats is not a way to solve the problem.\n\nSuch practices should simply stop and be prohibited, and a parent shouldn't be able to abuse their child in such a way, just because they are fucked-up in their head for some reason, and believe it's ok or even good to harm their children like this (for whatever sick reason they've conjured up in their mind).\n\nThere's also one very dark side of circumcision that I am not sure is being mentioned often. As the circumcision itself is used as a way to make it harder for someone to leave their culture, religion that they've been born into. Because if they deny the spiritual/ritualistic meaning of circumcision, they will realize that they have been physically scarred and abused by their family, religion, culture. So it's a very twisted way of causing a submission in the child. So that the child's mind for it's own protection will rather go into the acceptance of the belief that is connected with the circumcision, then allow themselves to realize the fact they've been mutilated by the allowance and will of their family and religion. So in a way circumcision plays also a part in 'breaking down' someone into accepting the rules of the group that they've been born into. As the person breaking out of that, will have to face a severe resentment and frustration \u2013 in realizing that they've been mutilated and abused by the one's they trusted in. Which is extremely cruel and twisted.\n\nTo end this blog post, I'll just leave you with a quote I've found on Ingrid's blog. A quote by Karl Menninger (a psychiatrist) : \"What's done to children, they will do to society.\"\n\n2 Responses to 2012: Infant/children circumcision still accepted in the world\n\nI am completely dazzled by people believing baby's do not experience pain \u2013 which was common belief as you stated \u2013 how did they explain the baby's crying and screaming when being hurt??? I really do not understand how they were able to completely ignore such obvious reaction to pain. Nowadays many people still believe animals aren't experiencing pain like we do\u2026\n\nThanks for writing this blog and expanding on the abusive practice of circumcising infants. Circumcision in many cases is indeed actually a way of marking the child: see, you are a Jew or a Muslim, or you look exactly like your father and grandfather; be proud of that, don't question it; by questioning what your parent did to you, you will be hurt and outcast yourself. What a fuck up\u2026\n\n\"I am completely dazzled by people believing baby's do not experience pain \u2013 which was common belief as you stated \u2013 how did they explain the baby's crying and screaming when being hurt???\"\n\nAt first I couldn't imagine that also, but there are always possible justifications like: \"infants aren't conscious, so if the don't think \u2014 they don't experience\". But still I find it hard for someone that is a parent to believe in/accept such a thing \u2013 as they had direct experience with infants."}

Their argument is literally \"I'm pro-choice! I have personal autonomy! I have the right to kill people!\" Like no that's not how autonomy works.\n\nI believe you have a right to life starting from the point where you can sustain your life. A woman doesn't have a right to kill per se, but she surely can kick someone out. It's not moral - like kicking someone else from your property when they need your water or food wouldn't be- but it's not murder, or else someone else's needs would obliterate your property rights over yourself or your land.\n\nWhat do you consider self-sustaining? A newborn, left alone, will die. A newborn cannot support itself, provide it's own food, etc. Yet, it is considered murder to end the life of a newborn. Also, a baby who is born with medical problems might be dependent on oxygen or even a ventilator to sustain it's life. Does this person not have a right to life, because they are not independently sustaining their life?\n\nChildren need food, shelter, clothing, education, etc., which can cost the parents money while these children are living under their roof. Yet it is not considered ethical, moral, or legally permissible to terminate the life of your children on the grounds that their needs are costing you. Why do you feel it should be different for unborn children?"}
{"text": "Are Embryos Persons? Philosopher considers the question at the heart of the stem cell research debate\n\n\u2014Lynne Rudder Baker\n\nillustration by Nicole Caulfield\n\nAMERICANS ARE IN A QUANDARY about stem cell research. On the one hand, research holds promise for treating debilitating diseases, such as Parkinson's; on the other hand, stem cell research destroys pre-implantation embryos in pursuit of the hoped-for medical advances. I've made it my task to consider what kind of beings preimplantation embryos are.\n\nMy interest in this topic springs from my work on the nature of persons in a book Persons and Bodies: A Constitution View. I thought that the reigning views of what persons are\u2014simply animals, or animals plus immaterial souls\u2014were inadequate. So I developed a third alternative. I argued that the relation between persons and bodies (or organisms) is constitution: A human person is constituted by a human body without being identical to the body that constitutes her\u2014just as a marble statue is constituted by a piece of marble without being identical to the piece of marble that constitutes it. After all, the piece of marble existed before the statue did.\n\nJust as exists a difference in kind between pieces of marble and marble statues, so too is there a difference between human bodies and human persons. The difference is that persons have first-person perspectives. Nothing that lacks a first-person perspective is a person; if a person ceased to have a first-person perspective, she would go out of existence.\n\nA first-person perspective may be robust or rudimentary. A robust first-person perspective is the ability to think 'I', to evaluate one's desires, to think about the past and future. A rudimentary first-person perspective requires that a being be conscious and engage in behavior that can be explained only in terms of beliefs and desires. A being with a rudimentary first-person perspective is a person only if it is of a kind that normally develops robust first-person perspectives.\n\nWhen an organism develops a rudimentary first-person perspective, a new being\u2014a person\u2014comes into existence. Although no one knows when a human organism comes to constitute a person (there is no exact moment), it must have a fairly developed brain that can support consciousness and intentional behavior in order to constitute a person. Recent research suggests that a human fetus cannot feel pain until about week 29. So, it is clear that no human embryo, what we call a fertilized egg and ensuing cell cluster up to ten weeks after fertilization, constitutes a human person. In that case, the destruction of a human embryo is not destruction of a human person.\n\nBut is it the destruction of a human organism? In the first weeks after fertilization, it is possible for a human embryo to \"twin.\" As long twinning is possible (whether it happens or not), an embryo is not a human individual, but simply a cell cluster. Since an organism is an individual, a frozen embryo that is still capable of twinning is demonstrably not yet an individual\u2014a defining quality of a human organism.\n\nThere are good reasons to be cautious about stem cell and other biomedical research. For example, we must have reason to believe that we know what we are doing and not just opening a Pandora's box. But I don't believe that stem cell research should be curtailed because of destruction of pre-implantation embryos. In my view, destroying embryos is not the same as destroying human persons, or even human organisms."}
{"text": "3 years ago I had just woken up at my mom's house. I had very recently come to stay with her for the summer since my semester in college was already over. I remember walking into the living room, somewhat bleary-eyed, and my mom (knowing me very well) just told me \"They got him\".\n\nI asked who.\n\n\"Tiller,\" she said, \"he was shot today\".\n\nUsually when people are shot dead in their churches, surprise is the first thing that hits you. Or at least, shouldn't it be? That's not what I felt. What I felt was the opposite of surprise, because I knew that one day after repeated attacks his luck would have to run out. That's just a numbers game.\n\nI also felt scared, because I know people who work in clinics that provide abortions. Scared because of my own ideals and desires to work as an advocate for reproductive rights and justice.\n\nThat hasn't waned. The numbers game is still continuing.\n\nAnti-choice terrorism is still going on. I almost feel as though it's getting worse. The attacks in the legislature are not enough for these people. Although pro-choice advocates know that anti-choicers who support and pass laws that restrict abortion have the blood of those who die in back alleys or even hospital waiting rooms on their hands, it seems as though that's not enough. They seem to want to be able to see it. To make it real, to make it actual. To stand in a church - the place where many of them get these ideas of being \"pro-life\" - and put a bullet in someone else's skull.\n\nToday is a sad day for me and for a lot of pro-choice advocates, I imagine. I didn't know Dr. Tiller, I never needed his services. But I've watched interviews with him and seen his dedication to his practice and seen his dedication to women*. He should be remember for the bravery that it takes to be aware of those that want you dead in the name of life yet still push on and do what's needed and what's right. He should be remembered because he was a fully aware sentient person who was killed for making choices others disagreed with - not only a martyr for the pro-choice cause but nearly a metaphor for it.\n\nHowever, he should be remembered most for the two words most associated with him and most forgotten by legislators who think they're qualified to micro-manage the very biology of others - \"Trust Women\" - although we must remember to trust everyone who is capable of becoming pregnant.\n\nThere's little more powerful than that, and that is why Dr. Tiller will and should be remembered by pro-choice advocates and the people that used his services.\n\nIf only God-fearing people who gun down others in churches could have had that much faith. If only.\n\nBlog for Choice Day, a letter of thanks/apology to Roe vs. Wade\n\nDear Roe vs. Wade, that3 - After 3 more hours, put another 4 tablets under your tongue for a third time.\n\nWithin 4 hours you can get cramps, nausea, chills, diarrhea, bleeding. If you soak more than 2 maxi sanitary pads per hour for more than 2 hours; if you have a fever or severe pain you have to go to the doctor (you can say you had a miscarriage). After 3 weeks do a pregnancy test.\n\nvia Jessica Valenti's Facebook page (I asked for permission to post this to Tumblr and have yet to see a response, so well, I think it's important so I'm just gonna do it anyway Edit: got the ok to post it today!).\n\nThese instructions (from Women on Waves, a fantastic organization that helps people capable of becoming pregnant in countries in which abortion is illegal) on how to induce an abortion at home before 9 weeks of pregnancy were removed from Facebook. Apparently, rape is totally cool with Facebook, but helping people makes choices about their bodies? Nope. Not ok.\n\nAnyway, the instructions are great, although a friend of mine added that you might want to wait 4 weeks to take a pregnancy test, otherwise you might get a false positive. Please spread this around so that people in countries in which abortion is illegal can access this information!\n\nIn doing (more) research about fetal development for this hiatusy project\u2026\n\nI've realized just how many websites spout of problematic language about conception and pregnancy.\n\nFor example, the first thing said in a flip book about fetal development from Pregnancy Today is this:\n\n\"It will be around two weeks before your partner's sperm fertilizes your egg and creates your baby\"\n\nThis is just another example of male dominated language when discussing pregnancy. Apparently, all that needs to happen to create a new human is for a man to ejaculate with good timing. Man gets off, baby gets made. You can't explain that.\n\nBut in all seriousness, why would someone ever say that? Do they not realize that it actually takes 9 months to create a baby? 9 months of feeding off of a woman's body, 9 months of a woman sharing her body space?\n\nIt's all tied together. When men get all the credit for creating new humans, why can't they dictate what the people who simply exist for carrying them (for what must be some frivolous, unexplained reason) do with their bodies?\n\nIt's really no wonder that we have anti-choicers spouting off at the mouth about embryos being more important that women. According to the dominant discourse, zygotes are the creations of men. Creations of men must be protected. It's only after a woman's work has been put in and a baby is actually born that these same men begin to not care.\n\nSo happy to see it go. The \"lol, when I say I'm a pharmacist I actually mean I'm a misogynistic zealot, slut\" clause used to really chap my hide. There was nothing pro-life about it, and anyone who could deny a woman Plan B or her birth control has no conscience, either.\n\nFirst, Alice Paul wasn't just a \"famous feminist\". Alice Paul is prettymuch the reason why women in this country can vote. She is the mother of women's suffrage. She also started the National Woman's Party and took part in hunger strikes in prison in order to get the rights she knew women deserved. She also didn't care what women did with those rights once they got them. In fact, she didn't really touch the abortion issue because she knew back then it was too much of a political hot potato, and she was just as politically savvy as she was driven by an extreme passion for women's human rights.\n\nI mention all of this because the small amount of information given about her in the reblogged post is indicative of how little the person who posted this quote probably knows about her. I bet they also don't know that Paul was the original author of the ERA, or Equal Rights Amendment. You know, that amendment that would have put women's human rights into the Constitution for good so that they wouldn't be subject to the whim of whatever attitude the congress at any given time might have toward women? That little old thing? The thing that was killed in the 80s by Phyllis Schlafly and her women-working-as-public-speakers-that-tell-women-not-to-work-brigade?\n\nYeah, Alice Paul wrote that.\n\nAs I said before, it is true that Alice Paul originally did not want to link abortion rights to the ERA. However, it wasn't because she was necessarily morally against it. She knew it was a divisive, hot button issue, and she actually wanted the amendment to get ratified. So, she left it out. Funny that conservative fauxminists worked to make sure the amendment Alice Paul wrote died, yet now anti-choicers (especially anti-choice fauxminists) want to quote Paul to try to make her out to be anti-abortion as well! No shame, truly. There's actually no record of Paul even saying this supposed quote. But hey, that doesn't stop those without shame or commitment to ethics from makin' shit up anyway, amirite?\n\nSo either way it goes, this supposed quote from Alice Paul doesn't prove anything, other than an anti-choice commitment to misinformation (and dismissing women's actual contributions/individuality/beliefs/humanity).\n\nNo really, anti-choicers, if you're going to try to pretend like you're not misogynists, it's probably best not to quote women out of context (or to just put words in their mouth that they never said!) as if they support your goals. Are you really that desperate?\n\nLet's just be honest with each other (try really really hard): It's time to stop bolstering your bad arguments with a philosophy you hate anyway.\n\n_____________\n\nYeah, I know I've been posting about abortion a lot, but people seem to be heaping the most bullshit onto abortion rights recently. I can't help it, I have an allergy!\n\nAs requested: Rebloggable version of the last post\n\nAsked: Do you believe it's possible to be a feminist, believe a woman has full autonomy over her body and the government should not interfere, but still think abortion should be something women use sparingly and in extreme cases after all other options are considered?\n\nI think that a person can only be a feminist if they still allow women the option of abortion, completely unrestricted and unshamed, yet offer every preventative method available more so.\n\nFor example, getting your teeth pulled isn't something anyone wants to do and people try to do it sparingly, yet no one is shamed for having to do it (well, not generally, there are some classist jokes/attitudes about folks who are missing teeth, but it's not as taboo as abortion). Getting your teeth pulled is available on demand and without apology (albeit only if you can pay for it, but still, no one is legislating restrictions on the procedure). Yet, folks still try to push for prevention of tooth decay and the inevitable teeth pulling that would result not only by giving folks the tools to keep up with their dental care (toothbrushes, toothpaste, floss, mouthwash, etc) as well as the education they need to use these tools (dental hygiene tips, etc.).\n\nWhat I and what I think anyone (self-IDing as feminist or not, really) should want to see is a world in which abortion is treated like getting a tooth pulled - something no one wants to do, yet something no one is barred from doing when and if it's necessary, and also something that folks have every tool/method available to prevent.\n\nEach year, the abortion industry receives millions of our tax dollars to advance its destructive agenda. And, each year, more and more Americans demand that their hard-earned paychecks not fund the killing of preborn children, the wounding of their mothers, and the advancement of a culture of death in America. Last year alone Planned Parenthood Federation of America collected $363 million in taxpayer dollars.\n\nAnd that's not the only way the abortion lobby is funding its gruesome business.\n\nAbortion is not an industry, it's practically a charity. I've read estimates suggesting doctors who perform abortions make around $60,000 to 70,000 a year. An abortion provider could've been a dermatologist and made around $300,000/yr, or even been an ob/gyn but not focused on abortion and made over $200,000/yr. Any doctor who goes into abortion is not doing it because it's some lucrative ~industry~ where they're going to get filthy rich and live a comfortable life. They're not going to make very much and their life will be threatened on a daily basis by anti choicers (who call themselves pro lifers, hah). They're doing it because they care about women and about protecting their right to choose and access to abortion.\n\nAs I've said before, Planned Parenthood and other government funded efforts prevent up to 800,000 abortions every year. But who cares? Obviously preventing abortion is not the Republican/anti-choice agenda.\n\nAs Requested\n\n1. They have a video of an abortion/abortion images on the front page of their website, complete with dramatic music. DRAMATIC MUSIC. Just\u2026lulz. Not necessarily at the images, before you clutch your pearls, but really? Dramatic music? Why? You can't just let the images speak for themselves if they're really supposed to be that arresting?\n\n2. The Genocide Awareness Project. I've come against these folks twice in my stint as a pro-choice advocate. The first time, one of the folks that they had who was obviously one of their organizers and not a student (which means he was probably paid to boot) couldn't even best me an an argument (I was 18 and a freshperson at the time).\n\n3. They legitimately think the birth control pill is abortion. This one is almost as laughable as the dramatic music on the front page. You want to talk about what most scientists have agreed upon as factual basis for your arguments? How about the fact that pregnancy begins at implantation, which means that there's no possible way, even if the pill does cause the body to reject a fertilized egg, that it can be considered an abortion. Sorry, but the science you claim to love proves you wrong (especially) in this instance.\n\n4. They think Plan B is abortion, too. Yet the same principle applies. This one is particularly cruel, considering this is often the last ditch effort a rape victim has to prevent a pregnancy from occurring in the first place, not that they give a flip about rape victims.\n\n5. They think abortion is genocide. This would be hilarious if it wasn't so offensively inaccurate and culturally insensitive. Sorry folks, but just because a large number of supposed folks are dying and you need a powerful word to get your cause some more attention doesn't mean you can misappropriate the actual cultural sufferings of other people.\n\n6. When they show their giant dead baby billboards, they don't even care that they could be triggering women who miscarried pregnancies that they wanted. Mostly because they don't care about women. They have tiny signs (in comparison) up like 5 feet from the billboard sized signs. REALLY EFFECTIVE.\n\n7. As stated previously, they are against condom use, even though it will prevent abortions.\n\n8. The GAP demonstration is an enormous waste of money that could be used to support pro-woman remedies to ending abortion, like birth control (which is not abortion) condoms, and comprehensive sexual education (which includes abstinence). Oh, but wait, again, they'd have to care about women to support that.\n\n9. The GAP demonstration billboards don't even show women as being part of the equation. It's like these people think that uteri float in peaceful, unicorn filled wonderlands until evil, mean (but misguided and ill-informed because they have stupid lady-brains) slutty women come and kill them in their tiny, exploitable slumber. Sorry, but uh, you can't have an honest conversation about abortion without including the woman involved in the equation.\n\n10. The pictures have been called into question more than once. Not necessarily for being fake, but for being mislabeled, which is just as bad, and totally not surprising since almost all anti-choice propaganda prefers to use pictures of fully grown infants in place of fetal images.\n\n11. Why do we have to include Bible quotes in our abortion related articles? Oh golly, maybe be cause this is a religious crusade against women's reproductive agency?\n\n13. They spread the million-times-over disproved myth that abortion causes breast cancer. Basically these people just don't know how to science. Basically, if our big giant signs don't scare women enough, we'll just scare them with a heavily gender-biased disease that doesn't actually have any connection to abortion! Totally ethical!\n\n14. They partake in bullshit campaigns to \"expose\" Planned Parenthood a la Lila Rose and her idiocy, yet they fail to realize that the efforts of Planned Parenthood actually prevents up to 800,000 abortions per year. Basically, Planned Parenthood has the ovaries to do what groups like the CBR don't - they give a shit about women and trust them enough to allow them to make informed decisions about their bodies and sexuality. That means that these women, who are not stupid unlike what anti-choicers think, make healthy choices which lead to them requiring less abortions. What a concept! If you respect women, abortion rates go down! Huh. Unfortunately groups like this have never thought to try that approach.\n\n15. Basically, not only do they take the exact wrong approach, but they willfully spread lies. Folks at their demonstrations told me with straight faces that condoms don't work. This is a lie. Everyone that isn't anxious about other people's sex lives going unpunished knows that. An organization that can't put aside it's problem with sex long enough to give out truthful information about condoms really isn't reputable or trustworthy as far as reliable information.\n\nThey gasp and clutch their pearls about the number of abortions in this country, yet I've been to one of those giant dead baby billboard events held by the Center for Bio-ethical Reform. First of all, the signs are huge and I'm sure it takes loads of money to construct and maintain them, plus the salaries of all of the folks they have to keep around when they have their little \"debates\" on campus in which they won't allow certain people to ask questions (i.e. someone like me who knows what they're talking about). All of that money could go directly to efforts that prevent unwanted pregnancy rather than triggering displays that don't actually do anything to lower the abortion rate.\n\nNot convinced as to the fake nature of this supposed discomfort with the abortion rate? Well here's something - as president of my college's pro-choice student group, I led my group to hand out at least 500 condoms during the most recent demonstration held by the CBR at my school.\n\nCondoms, you know, the things that are 97% effective in preventing pregnancy if used perfectly every time.\n\nThe folks representing the CBR got almost more upset that our group was handing out condoms than they were at any of our other (amazing!) signage. Even the one that said \"fail\" and had an arrow that we pointed their way. I was told numerous times that condoms don't work (!). I mean, on this ridiculous link they claim that the birth control pill is an abortifacient (which is a lie, everyone knows that), but even if they conveniently forget that abortion is the termination of a pregnancy and pregnancy only starts at implantation, condoms shouldn't bother them. Condoms don't even allow for the sperm to get close to an egg if used properly. So why the big fuss?\n\nGolly, ya think it has anything to do with their actual motivations/apprehensions about women's sexual and reproductive agency?\n\nHere's a pro-tip, folks: If you want people to take you seriously, maybe you shouldactually, oh I don't know, take steps to prevent what you claim to hate?\n\nGuess that might require NOT being misogynists and thinking of women as more than uteri with legs.\n\nPS - Abortionno.com has got to be the worst place to get any kind of reliable information. Try not using really really awful sources next time. D-:"}

Thanks for clarifying\n\nmdresch said: The UN estimates over 18,000 children die of malnutrition every day.\n\nSo the argument from the religious and right wing position is: It's better to let six million, five hundred and seventy thousand children starve each year,(750 each hour) rather than allow abortions for mothers who cannot feed their offspring.\n\nJeep1965:\nAs a used car salesman how do you justify trying to get every dime of commision you can out of a customer & then laughing about it with your co-workers about how you \"really reamed\" that one?\n\nSimple - no one makes the customer buy the car - they CHOSE to buy the car. The customer also has the ability to negotiate the deal and accepted it as well. A baby doesn't have a say in its termination.\n\nThere is no justification for the other 90% of abortions - it's indefensible. Not convenient? Not financially a good time? I didn't plan it - I don't want it? It will mess up my lifestyle and free time?\n\nI understand the used car reference is an analogy but you brought it up."}
{"text": "Abortion and thinking AmericansMany people who consider themselves to be \"thinking Americans\" dismiss pro-life arguments as being based on someone else's view of morality. The people to whom I refer are well-informed citizens. They are concerned about the poor; they give to charity; and they take care of their families.\n\nPro-life representatives are often religious figures, and they tend to speak in those terms. When, however, they reduce the abortion issue to one of morality, the \"thinking Americans\" find it easy to ignore them. They have resolved the abortion issue to their own moral and religious satisfaction. So, we are often left with two groups talking past each other.\n\nI would suggest that there are many solid pro-life arguments that are unrelated to religious beliefs. As bioethicist Hadley Arkes of Princeton University explained, the pro-life case \"is grounded finally in principled reasoning, the kind of reasoning that could be understood on its own terms without any appeal to religious faith or personal beliefs.\"\n\nGeorge Orwell recognized the pro-life position need not be rooted merely in religious and theological views. In his book \"Aspidistra,\" Orwell's main character, Gordon Comstock, went into a public library and found a book on human embryology. In it he saw pictures of a six-week and a nine-week-old fetus. He recognized the humanity of the unborn child, identified with working class values, and \"oppose[d] abortion out of a commitment to reason and moral conscience alone.\"\n\nToday, that conclusion should be even easier to reach. That \"blob of cells\" in the womb has DNA that is distinct from the mother's DNA. The same cannot be said of any other group of cells in the mother's body.\n\nRoe v. Wade purportedly was based on science and the age at which a fetus was thought to be viable. That science, however, is outdated. Modern science has made it possible for younger and younger babies to survive outside of the womb. In fact it is not inconceivable that biomedical technology someday will produce an artificial womb, enabling a fetus to live \"outside the mother's womb\" from conception until birth, making the viability point conception itself. The Supreme Court did not consider such scientific advances.\n\nIn situations other than abortion, American law recognizes the personhood of unborn children. Consider the not too uncommon situation of medical operations on, say, a 21-week-old fetus still in his mother's womb. Obviously the mother, the surgeon, the manufacturer of the special instruments, the insurance provider, and numerous other people associated with this type of work view the fetus as being an unborn child, not something less.\n\nThe legal system, with the sole exception of matters related to abortion, treats unborn children as persons. For instance, because of the unwritten right to privacy, a woman and her doctor have an absolute right to kill the fetus, with very limited interference from the state. At the same time, if someone else kills the fetus, it will likely constitute some form of homicide-- probably manslaughter but perhaps murder. Similarly, in most states, an unborn child at some point in his or her development is considered a person for purposes of a civil wrongful death lawsuit.\n\n. We do not take it as a justification for homicide, for instance, if an elderly parent strains the finances or psychological balance of a household. In no situation other than abortion does an individual or group of individuals have a right to kill based upon status alone.\n\nAt the end of the day, science, history and law all point in the same direction. Religion aside, abortion is a bad thing. Thinking Americans need to contemplate that. I believe that at some point in the future, people will look back in horror at this era of abortion. At that time, as people now do with the civil rights era, they will ask where various individuals stood on the great moral issue of the day. Thinking Americans may want to think about what they will be able to say when that day comes.\n\nComments\n\nPlease report offensive comments below.\n\n\"It is true that an unplanned pregnancy can be an embarrassment, create a severe financial strain, and cause parents (especially the mother) to drop out of school early.\" Dismissive, much? I can't accept your claim to be speaking for \"thinking Americans\" until I see proof that you have been trying to be one. Here's what we know: The *woman* is a person. The fetus uses her physical resources to survive and grow. The woman has the right of physical autonomy to deny the process. When the artificial womb has been created, your arguments will have merit.\n\nRR: \"I believe that at some point in the future, people will look back in horror at this era of abortion.\"\n\nWhen contraception is perfected, we'll look back at the abortion era and say \"isn't it great we don't have to go back there.\"\n--------------------------------\nMost of Rychlak's arguments above come to saying \"The question of fetal personhood must have one answer. Since the answer is 'yes' in the case of a wanted pregnancy, it must be the same in the case of an unwanted one.\" This argument is usually based on one or both of the following threads:\n\n1) God must have an opinion, and since God's opinion is yes in the case of the wanted pregnancy, it can't change based on the mother's preferences\n2) Pregnancy is not an active process. \"Wait nine months and see what you get\" or \"We could artificially support a fetus outside a womb, so a pregnant woman is morally compelled to perform the same function.\"\n\nAll this comes down to saying that some agent (God, medical science, society) has the jurisdiction over a woman who does not want to go through completing a pregnancy and giving birth.\n\nAs a pro-choice \"thinking American\" I appluad you sir. We may not agree, ever, but we have opened up to the greater possibility that we might find common ground.\n\nOn to the argument!\n\nFirstly, I admit to never having read \"Aspidistra\" but the point stands that any person reading a book of scientific fact and coming to, as you said, a point of \"moral conscience\" is necessarily adding to that scientific fact their own interpretation of how to use that scientific fact for their own end. A hammer can help build a house or bash in a skull, the fact is it is still just a hammer. Thus the logical weight of scientific fact does not translate to the moral position taken through interpretation of that fact.\n\nSecondly: Unique DNA showing an organism as distinct from the organism it resides in does not make the case for that DNA having a right to exist within the other organism. Viruses. Need I say more? I take it you are using that scientific evidence of unique DNA to make a case for personhood and/or individuality of fetus from mother? This also runs into problems in determining personhood along an arguably arbitrary point along a continuum and from the standpoint of individuality in both physical points (not only viability but also the fallacy that the DNA is truly unique when 1/2 is the mother's) and the metaphysical (what is an individual and how is that defined?). This follows on to your next paragraph in that viability outside of the womb is not the sole point at issue here.\n\nNext, your argument that a legal double-standard somehow weakens the position of a woman to choose an abortion can be argued with through analogy of other legal double standards that serve a similar purpose. Perhaps something akin to the various laws that allow a parent or guardian to make legal, medical, what-have-you, important life-altering decisions on behalf of their children when it would be not only inappropriate but illegal for someone else, regardless of competency, to make that same determination. I can already foresee the counter of \"false analogy: Parents still can't kill their kids (legally).\" That point on it's own is granted but then brings up the issue of the moral justification of killing. That is also before we have even come to a clear determination, based on previous argument as to exactly WHAT IS being killed. Legal analogy could be just as easily made to the destruction of property or laws regarding animal treatment.\n\nFinally, we come to the highly arguable statement in the second-to-last paragraph: \"In no situation other than abortion does an individual or group of individuals have a right to kill based upon status alone.\" Just in that statement alone, it begs for the clarification of the terms \"individual or group of individuals\" \"right\" and \"status.\" Is a state not a \"group of individuals\" that has a \"right\" to kill based on the status of \"legal standing?\"\n\nAt the end of the day, these do NOT point to the same thing. Contemplate that.\n\n\".\"\n\nAll of the above are true, however pregnancy and childbirth is much more than an embarrassment or a financial hardship to a pregnant woman.\n\nPregnancy causes real physical changes in the mother and can be life threatening. One third of all pregnant women will pegnancy realted medical complications and 2-3 women in the US die every day as the result of pregnancy or childbirth.\n\nWe do not compel any other person to risk his or her life for the life of another. We may think it moral or ethical, but we do not compel it.\n\nA parent is not required by law to donate an organ to a child, even if the child will die without the donation.\n\nDownplaying pregnancy and childbirth as merely an embarrassment or a financial hardship dismisses the woman who carrys the pregnancy.\n\nI have studied developmental biology in Iniversity and I don't find your appeal of using a scientific basis for deciding whether a fetus is equal to a human being very compelling. The qualities that make us human only emerge after fetus has developed significantly.\nAs you say, abortion is bad, and it is a terrible choice to make. But if you want to make early term abortions illegal that means that you wish the State to force a women to bear a child that she does not want. That is no way to begin a life.\nI personally feel that a women should have that choice early and that it should be restricted sometime after the first trimester."}

{"text": "Well ladies, here's your the-world-is-full-of-insane-assholes news item of the day: Susan G. Komen For the Cure is cutting off its funding to Planned Parenthood. And the funding wasn't for something controversial like birth control or abortions. Nope, it was for breast cancer screenings.\n\nThe cancer charity claims the move is due to Planned Parenthood being under investigation by Congress, but Planned Parenthood rightly contends that the real reason lies with anti-abortion groups, who have been giving Komen grief for this affiliation. (Coincidentally, the congressional investigation was launched by Cliff Stearns, a conservative Republican who was egged on by a \"report\" from Americans United for Life.) Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, has responded thusly:\n\nIt was incredibly surprising. It wasn't even a conversation \u2014 it was an announcement... It's hard to understand how an organization with whom we share a mission of saving women's lives could have bowed to this kind of bullying. It's really hurtful.\n\nAccording to Planned Parenthood, Komen provided $680,000 in breast cancer screenings and breast health services to at least 19 of its affiliates last year, and $580,000 the year before. The two organizations began their partnership in 2005, and Planned Parenthood says it performed nearly 170,000 of its four million breast exams over the past five years with Komen funding.\n\nLuckily, Planned Parenthood has already recovered some of the lost funding through a $250,000 donation from the family foundation of Dallas oilman Lee Fikes and his wife Amy. (Can I please get a rousing rendition of \"You're the Best Around\" for the Fikes?) Richards says the group is intent on raising the rest of the missing money so that women in need can still receive breast screenings.\n\nThis should go without saying, but since Komen hasn't come out and said, \"Just kidding! We're not actually dicks,\" someone needs to put it out there: this is pure and utter bullshit. I can't even begin to describe how disturbing it is that the people cheering this split would deny women life-saving screenings just to stick it to Planned Parenthood. Excuse me while I weep for humanity, and look into a new charity to affiliate with my debit card.\n\nI'm looking forward to a perfect society where law protects the potential life that swims around in my nutsack. I want Rick Santorum and his ilk to start dealing with the real issue: uncontrolled masturbation, killing billions of potential humans every second that God makes! Oh Onan! What crimes are committed following your wretched example!\n\n@observer: Where do you get that from? Roe permits states to outlaw third-trimester abortions. Third-trimester fetuses are (usually) viable, and if there is some urgency to ending the pregnancy because of risk to the woman, the baby (usually) can be delivered alive.\n\nAnd if your line of reasoning makes you feel better, go for it, but a tautology is a tautology.\n\nNo kidding. I never would have given them a cent anyway; they don't even pursue research into environmental causes of cancer (probably because they don't want to piss off Ford and KFC, among others...). If you want to support breast cancer research that isn't bought and paid for by corporations, there are much more deserving organizations out there like Breast Cancer Action: \n\nPlanned Parenthood PREVENTS more abortions than any other organization in America, bar none.\n\"Anti-abortion groups\" prevent approximately nothing - except rational discourse - and exist only to give meaning to the otherwise empty and failed lives of their members.\nKomen is simply a corporate entity designed to produce positive PR.\n\nHard to face facts are still facts, Observer. Planned Parenthood has for many years supplied women with education, birth control counseling, and birth control itself, all of which help women - young and old, well to do and impoverished - plan their parenthood (get it?) which, by preventing unwanted pregnancies, also prevents abortions. Many abortions. The fact that they also assist women - who , Christian fundies as well as \"bad\" girls, will all get less safe abortions anyway - through abortions, does not diminish the FACT that they prevent more abortions than all the screaming, moralistic, self righteous, and hugely self congratulatory \"anti abortionists\" in the country put together.\nCall that names, hate it, struggle to discredit it; it remains so.\nAll the anti abortionists I have ever met are far more interested in feeling like they are making an \"important\" stand than in actually solving real problems.\nGo be moral if you want: it means nothing.\nIf you fight against real solutions that make the problem worse instead of better you're a baby killer, aren't you?\n\nDon't you wish abortionists would just fess up and tell it like it really is....a fetus is not a random bunch of cells say like cancer.....it is a human being that is killed in the womb and they are ok with that...\n\nI'm going to give to SGK for the first time, not because I'm glad they snubbed Planned Parenthood, but because I still appreciate their efforts to raise funds for breast cancer treatment. If people don't want to give, they don't have to, but parting ways with a highly stigmatized organization is smart fundraising."}

{"text": "WHY is abortion \"wrong\"?\n\nThis is a question for pro-lifers. I have heard so many say abortion is \"wrong\". That God is against abortion and the Bible says its wrong. Yet the bible says many things that people do not take literally and I'm pretty sure no one has had a speed dial conversation with god in a while... So how do we as humans KNOW it's \"wrong\"?? How do we know that God would give two shits that people have abortions. Many people thank God for giving humans modern medicine to cure medical issues... Can we not apply the same thinking to thanking God for giving humans the idea and medical knowledge to have abortions?? Many people say god has a plan for which reason they can't explain.. Such as multiple miscarriage, cancer, ect. So why do we as people try to condemn something that might just be Gods plan?? Explain WHY abortion is wrong.\n\nComments for Post (274)\n\nWhy not give up the baby to a woman who isn't able to have children rather than abort?\n\nAdoption is a solution to parenting, not pregnancy. Many women who would have an abortion would not be willing to give up their childA zygote or fetus is not a child. When you put batter into a pan, it is not a cake. You have to bake it first. No one owes anyone a babyNo they aren't, by having an abortion you give up a zygote, embryo, or fetus. There is no child, only the potential for a child to develop. A woman who has an abortion is not taking anything away from others by aborting, it is no one's else's responsibility to provide babies for those who can not have their own.\n\n\" Funny, I delivered both of my kids in a Catholic hospital and this was so NOT their policy, it was my OB's and my own decisions all the way\"\n\nThere are some hospitals that are culturally/historically affiliated with Catholicism (i.e. mayo clinic) but are not officially Catholic institutions and therefore not bound to the aforementioned protocol.\n\nIf OB's in officially Catholic hospitals violate these rules, they can be fired. This has happened. There are also cases where a violation or number of violations were notable enough to result in the Catholic status of the hospital to be stripped.\n\nI think claiming that a fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus is a child is really disrespectful towards women. It totally discounts the work that goes into pregnancy as if ejaculation makes a person and pregnancy and labor are totally trivial^^^ No, they're \"giving up\" being pregnant and all the economic, emotional and social repercussions that that entails.\n\nYou'd think people have never heard of workplace discrimination, abusive relationships, economic hardships, or any number of other reasons people have abortions. Pregnancy is not a walk in the park physically for many women but the toll it can take in other areas of life is just as big. Abortion is an alternative to being pregnant; adoption is an alternative to being a parent. Those are two very different things."}

{"text": "share this story\n\nIn a spectacular act of complicity with the religious right, the Department of Health and Human Services Monday released a proposal that allows any federal grant recipient to obstruct a woman's access to contraception. In order to do this, the Department is attempting to redefine many forms of contraception, the birth control 40% of Americans use, as abortion. Doing so protects extremists under the Weldon and Church amendments. Those laws prohibit federal grant recipients from requiring employees to help provide or refer for abortion services. In the \"Definitions\" section of the HHS proposal it states,\n\n\"Abortion: An abortion is the termination of a pregnancy. There are two commonly held views on the question of when a pregnancy begins. Some consider a pregnancy to begin at conception (that is, the fertilization of the egg by the sperm), while others consider it to begin with implantation (when the embryo implants in the lining of the uterus). A 2001 Zogby International American Values poll revealed that 49% of Americans believe that human life begins at conception. Presumably many who hold this belief think that any action that destroys human life after conception is the termination of a pregnancy, and so would be included in their definition of the term \"abortion.\" Those who believe pregnancy begins at implantation believe the term \"abortion\" only includes the destruction of a human being after it has implanted in the lining of the uterus.\"\n\nThe proposal continues,\n\n\"Both definitions of pregnancy inform medical practice. Some medical authorities, like the American Medical Association and the British Medical Association, have defined the term \"established pregnancy\" as occurring after implantation. Other medical authorities present different definitions. Stedman's Medical Dictionary, for example, defines pregnancy as \"[t]he state of a female after conception and until the termination of the gestation.\" Dorland's Medical Dictionary defines pregnancy, in relevant part, as \"the condition of having a developing embryo or fetus in the body, after union of an oocyte and spermatozoonThe other rarely discussed issue here is whether hormonal contraception even does what the religious right claims. There is no scientific evidence that hormonal methods of birth control can prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the womb. This argument is the basis upon which the religious right hopes to include the 40% of the birth control methods Americans use, such as the pill, the patch, the shot, the ring, the IUD, and emergency contraception, under the classification \"abortion.\" Even the \"pro-life\" movement's most respected physicians cautioned the movement about making these claims. In 1999, the physicians -- who, like the movement at large, define pregnancy as beginning at fertilization-- released an open letter to community stating:\n\n\"Recently, some special interest groups have claimed, without providing any scientific rationale, that some methods of contraception may have an abortifacient effect...The 'hormonal contraception is abortifacient' theory is not established fact. It is speculation, and the discussion presented here suggests it is error...if a family, weighing all the factors affecting their own circumstances, decides to use this modality, we are confident that they are not using an abortifacient.\"\n\nAs the HHS proposal proves, the absence of fact or evidence does not slow anti-abortion movement attempts to classify hormonal contraception as abortion. With HHS' proposal they have struck gold. Anyone working for a federal clinic, or a health center that receives federal funding -- even in the form of Medicaid -- and would like to prevent a woman from accessing most prescription birth control methods has federal protection to do so. As the HHS proposal details,\n\n\" As discussed above, both definitions of pregnancy are reasonable and used within the scientific and medical community. The Department proposes, then, to allow individuals and institutions to adhere to their own views and adopt a definition of abortion that encompasses both views of abortion.\n\n\" (emphasis mine)\n\nSo HHS proposes that anyone can enforce his or her own definition of abortion \"within the bounds of reason.\" And, it would seem the bounds are pretty far flung. Most dangerously, perhaps, this new rule establishes a legal precedent that may eventually be used as a basis for banning the most popular forms of birth control along with what is, in fact, abortion.\n\nAll of the above points and arguments are the reason why I deeply believe that the government should NOT play any part in the abortion/right to life discussion. The government should not be spending a single dime supporting either side. Until one side or the other can PROVE that: 1. abortion IS murder, or 2: abortion is Not murder - and I mean PROVE, not plead, enjoin, argue, believe, feel, sense, etc., etc., the decision one way or the other is in the hands of both the mother AND father and their god and/or intellect. (After all, it took both of them to produce the fetus.) This will be a much quieter discussion if both sides would just stop trying to stuff their opinions down someone elses throat, especially by resorting to violence or threat of violence, or by using the power of government. Just because you think you're right doesn't mean you can force someone else to agree with you. Let's try intellect rather than invective, discussion rather than diatribe, reason rather than rabidness. Please?\n\ncan't be done. we all already know how life is formed, but we disagree on when it's actaually \"life\" - that's a matter of opinion and it depends on what criteria you're using. to some, it's when the egg is fertilized, to others, implantation, to others, when the fetus is viable enough to live on its own seperate from the mother, and to others, it's life after it's been born.\n\nLoading comments\u2026\n\nAbortion involves death of innocents.\nWar involves death of innocents.\nDriving involves death of innocents.\nSmoking involves death of innocents.\nAlcohol involves death of innocents\n\nSo when your sitting in your Laz I Boy with an American flag pinned to your lapel having just returned from driving to the corner store to pick up cigarettes and beer and you turn on the tv to cheer Foxnews support of the war, you just might want to think before you open your mouth about abortion and someone else's freedom and choice.\n\njfor: Abortion involves death of innocents.

Yet that is just as much of a \"crisis of conscience\" as it would be for someone hired for a gynecology clinic who deliberately refuses, as a \"matter of conscience\" to write prescriptions for birth control or refer to abortion providers.\n\nmirrimatmlw: Besides all the other problems with this \"new rule\"...it places\n\nLoading comments\u2026\n\nWhen Bush appointed pro-abstinence/anti real sex education Susan Orr as head of HHS, I think we all were waiting for shit like this to happen.

{"text": "Let's say we ban abortion. All abortion is illegal. Now, historically when abortion is illegal we have the following things:\n1. An increased birth rate overall which means more babies, many of whom being born into poverty.\n2. Women attempting to get abortions illegally, sometimes being done by people with minimal to no serious medical training which then leads to either the deaths of the mother and/or child, or at minimum, need for serious medical care to cover up for the poor quality of the abortion.\n\nSo, please answer me this:\nIf you think abortion is wrong and then also think things like socialized healthcare is wrong and welfare is wrong and pretty much all social programs are wrong and you don't want to pay high taxes, etc. etc., then exactly WHERE is the money and infrastructure supposed to come from to care for this new, enlarged segment of the population? Where will the medical care come from to help poor people with babies that they couldn't be terminated in pregnancy because abortion was illegal?\n\nPro-lifers love to quote vague statistics about how abortion being legal for roughly the last 30 years resulted in the deaths of something like a few million people. (just to grab a figure). So, looking at the US now and the state that it is in with a terribly flawed health care system, a very flawed welfare system, an economy tanked by the Iraq War, record level unemployment and all sorts of problems with labor, exactly what would we do with that extra few million people? What jobs would they be doing? What taxes would they be paying into the public system if, indeed, taxes were further lowered since taxes are horrible and evil? Again, where would the infrastructure come from to make things better than they are NOW for this extra population in our country if you don't want things to change for the better at ALL (remember, government care for people = COMMUNISM).\nWho will be taking care of all these people? What about the poor? What about families who cannot afford healthcare?\n\nThis will lead to a massively increased mortality rate as babies and children die from either poor or no medical care or simply the state of their existence. As it stands now, social services are bursting at the SEAMS from having to deal with abused children, mistreated children, unwanted children. Children from broken homes are often moved into situations that are even worse. Read some of the stories on POEN about children in foster homes. Hardly anyone adopts in the US (gotta have those novelty children! HEE HEE IT LOOKS LIKE ME SORTA!), so our adoption system is absolutely overflowing. Where would you propose to put the extra thousands and babies that making abortion illegal would produce??? (and that's likely a very conservative figure, I wouldn't know the actual figures)\n\nSo, I am legitimately curious as to what the pro-life solution is to all of these things because I havent' seen any of the major players in the pro-life movement do anything whatsoever to provide for infants in this country who are currently dying in poverty. I haven't seen pro-lifers contribute anything to any causes forwarding improved medical care or improved overall state welfare for poor children. I haven't seen pro-lifers actually DO anything to move society forward in ANY way. You complain about abortion and advocate killing people who provide legal, valuable medical services to people nebulous reasons about how \"life is precious.\" Apparently it can't be that precious because I guess once the baby is out of it's mother's womb, it's no longer your problem. It's supposed to be someone else's.\n\nSorry I know this is TLDR bullshit, but this video made me fucking mad.\n\nThis clip cuts off way to short, though. This continues where the woman accuses him of putting down people who don't agree with him (cuz calling people Nazi's is a mild compliment I guess) and he's like \"Well, yeah, I guess I did put you down cuz you're stupid, but other than that I have been respectful.\" Awesome.\n\nI love how this segment of the population who would love to deny all sorts of basic rights to everyone suddenly get all FIRST AMENDMENT when someone ridicules them for saying something that would get them punched out in most public places.\n\nFor the most part, yes. When he was still a struggling pulp fiction writer, he was well known the sci-fi/fantasy community as someone who said that his idea for getting rich would be to create a self-help religion where people paid for therapy dressed as a form of religion. He actually told several people that and there's considerable evidence that much of the backstory of Scientology (Xenu and thetans and all that) was just shit from notes he was working on for a sci-fi novel.\n\nIt think this woman is so honestly stupid and ignorant she didn't realize what she was doing. Presumably, she thinks that healthcare reform supporters=Nazi is a legitimate comparison (because, well...she's stupid), so the Heil Hitler thing was meant as a reference to that and she honestly just didn't understand why it was such a dumb, offensive thing to do because these kinds of empty minds can't process it in quite that way.\n\nThis is not a defense of her but rather an observation at just how truly moronic the people in this country are. What's funny is how many people lately are trying to pull that \"I'm not really with an ideology, I just completely support the right\" thing and they do it to avoid the embarassment (in their minds) of admitting they were 100% behind Bush, which is awkward to get into now that he is no longer around.\n\nIn fairness to Tarantino, since most of his whole persona is absorbing things from movies all throughout the 60s and 70s and then recycling them in some fashion or other for his own movies, having to pick movies from after 1992 must have been one of the hardest things he's ever done. I'm guessing a few he just threw in for good measure.\n\nThe original 9 part submission doesn't work anymore, I don't think, and anyway the last part actually didn't show him killing himself.

{"text": "Monday, April 11, 2011\n\nWe always try to get the original statement in its full context rather than an edited form that appeared in news stories. About PolitiFact\n\nThe issue:\n\nThe fact checkers:\n\nWilloughby Mariano: writer, researcher\nJim Tharpe: editor\n\nAnalysis:\n\nLet's dive right in with PolitiFact's explanation of the issue:\n\n\"When Margaret Sanger - check my history - started Planned Parenthood, the objective was to put these centers in primarily black communities so they could help kill black babies before they came into the world,\" Cain said during a talk in Washington, D.C., at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative group.\n\n\"It's planned genocide,\" Cain added. He wants the U.S. Congress to yank funding for Planned Parenthood, which receives about $75 million a year to provide non-abortion health services.\n\nWas Planned Parenthood founded to help kill unborn black babies?\n\nCain went on to talk about today's Planned Parenthood working to fulfill its \"original mission,\" so it's probably fair to infer that Cain is, at minimum, linking the killing of black babies with that original mission.\n\nThe line about killing black babies prior to birth accounts for my agreement with PolitiFact on one aspect of Cain's claim: The early incarnations of Planned Parenthood didn't do much to push abortion. It was too controversial at the time.\n\nBut before we move on, please note that we do not have Cain's comment in its original context. We have PolitiFact relying on a news account of Cain's speech. PolitiFact claims that it \"always\" tries to work from an original version of a claim to allow consideration of the surrounding context. If it isn't important to consider the surrounding context, then why assure readers that searching out the context is standard practice? And if the original context is important, then shouldn't any fact check lacking the original context make special note of that missing feature?\n\nIn Cain's case, the original context is missing, and PolitiFact fails to emphasize the potential significance of missing material.\n\nThe ensuing fact check emphasizes that there is no good evidence that black babies were killed and that the evidence that Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger was personally racist is of the poorest quality.\n\nI'm already on record supporting the former point. But Sanger's personal beliefs are largely irrelevant to the implicit argument that Planned Parenthood has a history of targeting blacks.\n\nThe PolitiFact story offered a fleeting glimpse of the elephant in the room:\n\nEugenics was once a wildly popular theory that the human race can be improved through better breeding and genetics. It drew together backers as diverse as President Theodore Roosevelt and black intellectual W.E.B. DuBois.\n\nAt its best, the U.S. movement pushed for better prenatal care. At its worst, it enabled forced sterilization laws and let claims that blacks and immigrants were inferior to masquerade as science.\n\nSanger welcomed some of the movement's more notorious leaders onto the board of a predecessor to Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe question any journalist should have sought to answer after a statement like that is why Sanger welcomed some of the most notorious leaders of the eugenics movement into leadership in her organization.\n\nDorothy Roberts summed up the relationship well in her essay \"Margaret Sanger and the Racial Origins of the Birth Control Movement\":\n\nThe eugenics movement supported Sanger's birth control clinics as a means of reaching groups whose high fertility rates were thought to threaten the nation's racial stock and culture.\n\nSanger herself was more directly concerned with the disastrous effects of a Malthusian population bomb. British scholar Thomas Malthus, back in the 19th century, had theorized that exponential population growth led inexorably to an extinction or near-extinction disaster. Sanger bought the idea. But unlike the eugenicists who wanted to explicitly adjust racial demographics, Sanger primarily wanted fewer people generally rather than a smaller number of any particular race or set of races, though it is also true that she believed in the power of eugenics to better the human race as a whole by allowing poor genetic lines to die off.\n\nBy moving the emphasis to Sanger's personal beliefs, PolitiFact ends up presenting a whitewashed version of Planned Parenthood's history and a misleading evaluation of Cain's claim. Cain, after all, claimed nothing about Sanger other than calling her the founder of Planned Parenthood. As a result, aspects of the fact check such as the following miss the point:\n\nBut we found no evidence that Sanger advocated - privately or publicly - for anything even resembling the \"genocide\" of blacks, or that she thought blacks are genetically inferior.\n\nEvery academic PolitiFact Georgia consulted said that Cain's claim is wrong.Engs at least extends her defense of Sanger to \"others,\" but uselessly bases it on a lack of the desire to \"kill black babies,\" which in turn obscures the varieties of racial motivation found in the ranks of the eugenicists who supported Sanger's birth control initiatives.\n\nDespite pointing out Sanger's association with eugenicists, the PolitiFact Georgia team can scarcely imagine why eugenicists would want birth control for the undesirable population:\n\nReally, calling the Negro Project a genocidal plot defies common sense. Why would Sanger try to destroy a race of people by giving them access to the very thing she thought could make life better?\n\nSanger probably wouldn't, but her eugenicist allies would. Roberts succinctly fills the journalistic hole left by Mariano and Tharpe:\n\nEven if the Negro Project did not intend to exterminate the black population, it facilitated the goals of eugenicists. Eugenicists considered southern blacks to be especially unfit to breed on the basis of a theory of \"selective migration,\" which held that the more intelligent blacks tended to migrate to the North, leaving the less intelligent ones behind.\n\nRoberts goes on to note that North and South Carolina instituted state-run birth control initiatives while the use of contraceptives remained unlawful in enlightened Massachusetts.\n\nSanger's view that fecundity resulted in poverty and thus lack of reproductive fitness was not a popular view among eugenicists. The overtly racist eugenicists could see a benefit to giving contraceptives to an undesirable class of persons. And the non-racist eugenicists most likely to ally with Sanger likewise saw a good result in limiting the population of the unfit:\n\nThese close allies of birth control held more rigidly deterministic views than Sanger did. As Kevles notes, what distinguished these men from other social reformers was their firm belief that biology mattered. In disparaging the racial prejudice of mainstream eugenics, they did not dispute its goals, only its methods.\n\nCarole R. McCann, \"Birth Control Politics in the United States, 1916-1945\"\n\nAs with the lending practice of redlining, preventing the births of black children to a greater degree than preventing the births of others is not necessarily a racist practice. And if Cain erred by referring to killing black babies, he was at least correct that Planned Parenthood's roots contain a concerted effort to reduce procreation by blacks, especially in the South.\n\nPresumably the media experts at PolitiFact have no real knowledge of this, so we can't be surprised at the conclusion:\n\nCain's claim is a ridiculous, cynical play of the race card. We rate it Pants on Fire.\n\nCain's claim was only ridiculous to the extent it is restricted to the method of limiting the reproduction of blacks. The PolitiFact team exhibits difficulty in restricting its evaluation to that point and provides a distorted picture in the end.\n\nAnd it's worth noting that calling Cain's claim a \"cynical play of the race card\" is a outright editorial judgment, rather than a check of the facts.\n\nThe grades:\n\nWilloughby Mariano: F\nJim Tharpe: F\n\nIf the original context is important then treat it that way. Otherwise, revise the descriptions of PolitiFact's process.\n\nIt seems that fact checkers had a pair of facts they wanted to check (\"Was Margaret Sanger a racist?\" \"Did Planned Parenthood kill babies fetuses back in the early days?\") and used Herman Cain as their excuse to check those data points. In the process, the validity of Cain's point about the unseemly origins of Planned Parenthood received short shrift.\n\nAfters:\n\nThis fact check provides yet another example of PolitiFact's practical immunity from the standards it applies to others. PolitiFact's \"burden of proof\" criterion allows PolitiFact to rule a statement \"False\" if the claimant fails to substantiate his claim. Yet we're supposed to trust PolitiFact's ruling despite the apparent lack of a complete record of Cain's statement.\n\nAs well, one could note the lack of a strictly objective criterion for ridiculousness that would allow PolitiFact to distinguish between \"False\" and \"Pants on Fire"}
{"text": "An interview with a late term abortion provider ago, largely out of what he says was concern for women's needs going unmet. Parker is primarily based in Washington and Philadelphia, but also travels monthly to see patients in Alabama.\n\nMany late-term abortion providers do not identify themselves largely due to safety concerns. (One late-term doctor, George Tiller, was murdered by an anti-abortion activist in 2010). But Parker made himself available for an interview on Friday afternoon. Here's a transcript of our conversation, edited for clarity and length:\n\nSarah Kliff: What would it mean for Washington to outlaw abortions after 20 weeks?\n\nWillie Parker: The reality is that, a small percentage of overall women who have abortions have them beyond 13 weeks. It's about 1 percent. Those cases do happen in D.C. like they happen everywhere else. There are unplanned pregnancies, people who are in poverty who might delay their diagnosis and might end up in this group of people. Those are the women who could be affected.\n\nSK: Who are the patients you tend to see for late-term abortions?\n\nWP: The reality is that unplanned, unwanted or wanted but flawed pregnancies can occur to all women of any race, class or economic status. The women who tend to disproportionately find themselves [having a later-term abortion] tend to be at the extremes of reproductive age, maybe women over 40 who are more likely to have genetic anomalies. There are also women in poverty, with limited access to medical resources or education.\n\nThere are some difficult circumstances. I also think elective is a bit of a difficult term. I saw one teenager who was 12, when her parents found out that she'd been molested. For a woman to decide to discontinue a pregnancy in that situation, that's not quite elective.\n\nSK: Six states now ban abortions after 20 weeks, and all of those laws passed within the last two years. What do you make of this wave of late-term restrictions, and what do they mean for women?\n\nWP: It's a gambit around public opinion. Because of the later stage of development, these are people who are banking on blurring lines around viability. I think it's a very calculated strategy that fails to take into account the complexity of these cases. I think it's also unfortunate, because it vilifies the women who might need an abortion the most.\n\nSK: What do these laws mean for abortion providers? I know the number of doctors who perform abortions has declined over the past few decades. Do you think that has to do with these kinds of restrictions?\n\nWP: These laws put providers in a position where they have to turn away patients who have great need. I also think they create this impression that abortion providers are callous, and allow people to conflate murder and abortion. People feel morally justified to say \"this is wrong\" because they're led to think it's close to murder. I think that jeopardizes us, by conflating abortion with an issue that would cause moral outrage.\n\nWP: For the first 12 years of my medical career, I didn't provide abortions. I did think about the moral complexities and I also thought a lot about what Dr. King has said about having concern for other people. I was more concerned about waht might happen to them, than what might happen to me. And I feel like that's an appropriate value system to operate around.\n\nWhen I decided to do it, it allowed me to think about it and not be oblivious to the risk. Logically, I have concerns about my safety. But I choose not to think about that too much. I'm mindful and I'm vigilant, but I choose to focus on the important service I'm providing to women. I became convinced that what could happen if I wasn't providing this service, to women, was more important that what might or might not happen to me.\n\nSK: Can you talk a little bit about your work in Alabama? Why was it important for you to work there?\n\nWP: That's primarily because that's where I'm from. The reality of abortion is that women who are most likely to have one are women of poverty and of color. So this was a decision to serve women where I'm from, and an effort to go where the need is greatest"}
{"text": "Why are so many atheists pro-abortion?\n\nIs it just for the sake of disagreeing with the religious? Is it because they see being anti-abortion as being a strictly religious viewpoint? Are anti-abortion atheists worried about fitting in? Is it just a coincidence?\n\nReplies to This Discussion\n\nI think its more to do with atheists believing that religion-free beings should have the choice of how to manage their own bodies. Even if they would or wouldn't abort themselves, we should have the freedom to decide that for ourselves.\n\nReligious groups want to remove even the choice of abortion, make it into a crime which could send you to prison. How fair is that to the woman, who was maybe raped, or for whom abortion may be a life saving procedure? I think this is what atheists think about.\n\nI'm not pro-abortion. I am pro-choice. Just wanted to clarify that for you.\n\nWhy are atheists pro-choice? I believe because generally atheists aren't interesting in interfering in what is a very private and sometimes painful decision. I find that atheists tend to believe in personal liberties and the less the state is involved in our personal decisions the better.\n\n\"Pro-choice\" is a meaningless euphamism. \"Pro-abortion\" does not mean you think abortion is good; it just means you think people should have a right to have an abortion. Just like pro-gun and pro-gambling. A pro-gambling person could think that gambling is stupid and a waste of money, but they still support the rights of others to waste their money however they want.\n\nAnd a man about to kill his daughter to collect on insurance may be making the hardest decision in his life, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't stop him.\n\nAnd nothing that involves a victim is a private decision. A man who rapes and/or beats his daughter and/or wife cannot claim privacy rights.\n\nI disagree emphatically that \"pro-choice\" is a meanlingless expression. In contrast, I find \"pro-abortion\" to be somewhat offensive and entirely misleading, as I would with the examples of \"pro-gun\" and \"pro-gambling.\"\n\nPro-anything generally implies that you are in favor of the \"anything\" in question. I don't know anyone who is \"pro-choice\" that thinks abortions are a great thing. What they do think is that someone who gets pregnant should have the choice of whether or not to maintain the pregnancy or terminate the pregnancy. Note that I said \"pregnancy,\" not \"child.\" I'm not of the mindset that \"life begins at conception.\"\n\nThat said, for those who DO believe that life begins at conception, continuing the pregnancy would probably be their choice. For those who do NOT believe that, continuing the pregnancy could also be their choice, but it need not be. The concept of \"life begins at conception\" is, I think, the sticking point. When \"life begins\" is more philosophy (or dogma) than fact, especially when you're talking about human conciousness.\n\nI don't want the government enforcing non-factual philosophies, especially those born of religious dogma, on its citizens. In matters such as these, the choice of philosophy and actions should be left up to the individual.\n\n\"Pro-choice\" is meaningless because it does not say what is being chosen. By your very logic, \"pro-choice\" should mean you think choice in general is good, and you don't see pro-abortion groups protesting every company merger and traffic law.\n\nAlso, life begining at fertilization is a scientific question; I think what you're thinking of is personhood.\n\nAnd the immorality of murder is a non-factual philosophy. Almost nobody would argue the KKK should be allowed to lynch people because their philosophy says blacks are not morally equal"}
{"text": "If it weren't so fantastically disgusting, it would be hysterical. If it wasn't so sleazily, politically opportunist, it would remind me of the classic meme from the old Home Improvement show of the 90\u2032s: the hapless Tim \"The Tool Man\" Taylor, once again in trouble for not understanding a situation, goes at talks with the sage behind the hedgerow, Wilson. Wilson shares a bit of his wisdom, quoting Descartes or sharing a story about hiking the Himalayas with Buddhist monks. Then Tim returns to his wife with a litany of word-salad nonsense to prove to her and the entire audience that he never listened to a word that was spoken.\n\nIf it wasn't so fantastically disgusting, it would be hysterical. But it's not. Let's go to the tape:\n\nWell, you know, people always want to try and make that as one of those things \"well, how do ya slice this particularly tough sort of ethical question.\" It seems to me, first of all from what I understand from doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\n\nYes, Congressman. The \"female body\" does indeed have ways of \"shutting that whole thing down.\" More correctly, the process of fertilizing an egg requires that cells (sperm) from outside the body enter the correct fallopian tube. Female bodies \u2013 shockingly similar to male bodies \u2013 are not open to this kind of thing. In fact, they have what is known as an \"Immune system\" which is designed to prevent all foreign bodies from entering.\n\nAnd yes, despite the fact that reproduction is a necessary component of life, that same immune system goes to work in the reproductive system. Of course it does: how does the body differentiate between a potentially-lethal infection and the \"miracle of life?\" Your body's defense systems do not sleep and they do not prejudice themselves, one foreign body from another.\n\nMoreover, the pH of the uterus through which sperm must travel is considerably more acidic than sperm can survive, on average. The uterus is lined with cells that will trap and destroy sperm, or else get them lost on their long, long journey to the fallopian tubes. And there are, of course, two fallopian tubes, spaced very far apart indeed. Even if some sperm actually make it to the entry of a fallopian tube, that's not the same thing as being at the correct fallopian tube. Odds are, half the sperm that survived the journey are knocking on the wrong door.\n\nThese are just some of the impediments to pregnancy. The easy ones, really. Don't be so foolish as to believe that fertilization comes within even a mile of a successful pregnancy, either. The idea that \"life begins at conception\" is as laughably naive as it is face-smackingly insulting. Ask anyone who knows.\n\nYes, Congressman. Pregnancy after rape is rare. But only because pregnancy itself is shockingly rare. Or did you think you just kept getting lucky every time you got laid?\n\nAnd there is no \u2013 I repeat absolutely no \u2013 biological difference between rape and any other form of sex.\n\nDid you happen to notice that this guy is on the House SCIENCE Committee? Al Franken is right: Republicans run on a platform that says \"government doesn't work,\" and then set about getting elected so they can prove it."}
{"text": "Thoughts from the interface of science, religion, law and culture\n\nAkin's Fellow Travelers on Rape and Pregnancy\n\nSarah Kliff writes at the Washington Post that Todd Akin is hardly the first Republican politician to advance the idea that women don't get pregnant when they're raped. This myth actually goes back a long way and comes up fairly regularly among the religious right.\n\nBut while Akin is wrong in his assertion about rape and pregnancy, he certainly isn't alone. His remarks tapped into a strain of thinking that dates back to at least the 1980s, with anti-abortion politicians from Pennsylvania to Arkansas making the case that the trauma of rape can often prevent pregnancy. The argument does not come up frequently, but when it does, it nearly always leads to political controversy.\n\nPennsylvania state Rep. Stephen Freind (R) was an ardent abortion opponent. He authored legislation that included one of the the nation's first abortion waiting periods, and the case went all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nHe also looks to be the first legislator to make the argument that rape prevents pregnancy, arguing in the late 1980s that the odds of a pregnancy resulting from rape were \"one in millions and millions and millions.\"\n\nHis explanation? The trauma of rape causes women to \"secrete a certain secretion which has the tendency to kill sperm.\" Reproductive health experts immediately denounced those remarks. One told the Philadelphia Inquirer, \"Boy, if I could find out what that [secretion] was, I'd use it as a contraceptive.\"\n\nThe argument was dormant for about a decade, until the late 1990s. That's when a North Carolina legislator, whom Garance Franke-Ruta points to, extended the argument to question whether there should actually be a rape exception from abortion restrictions,given that \"The facts show that people who are raped \u2013 truly raped \u2013 the juices don't flow.\"The argument was most recently \u2013 and perhaps most fully \u2013 articulated by National Right to Life president John Wilke in a 1999 essay titled \"Rape Pregnancies Are Rare.\" Wilke made a pretty similar case to Akin: That the \"physical trauma\" of rape has a way of preventing pregnancy.\n\n\"To get and stay pregnant a woman's body must produce a very sophisticated mix of hormones,\" Wilke wrote. \"There's no greater emotional trauma that can be experienced by a woman than an assault rape. This can radically upset her possibility of ovulation, fertilization, implantation and even nurturing of a pregnancy.\"\n\nThere are several things going on here. First, there is the kind of virulent ignorance that I spoke about on C-SPAN in 2007; it isn't just that these people don't know what they're talking about, it's that they have swallowed whole a bunch of false claims that make them think they are educated on the subject. Second, we have classic motivated reasoning \u2014 they are emotionally committed to their anti-abortion position, so any factual claim that helps them advance that position is accepted as true upon mere assertion.\n\nThird, we have the routine advance of false memes that become part of this organic body of knowledge, things that everyone just \"knows\" even when they don't really know them. There are lots of other examples, of course. The one that comes to mind immediately, and that I have heard repeated so often that I just shake my head when some ignorant dolt says it, is the old canard that we only use 10% of our brains.\n\nShare this:\n\n25 comments\n\nslc1\n\nA prime example of this type of thinking was exhibited by whackjob Gary Bauer at the end of the Reagan Administration. Bauer claimed that abortion increased the chances of a woman getting breast cancer and demanded that then Surgeon General C. Everette Koop investigate the claim. Koop, who was a noted opponent of abortion, came back some months later and informed Bauer that he could find no evidence in the peer reviewed literature claiming any such thing. That, of course, influenced Bauer not in the slightest and he then attacked Koop for not being on the team, much like Ann Coulter attacked Judge Jones for not being on the team relative to his Dover decision.\n\nPhillip IV\n\nany factual claim that helps them advance that position is accepted as true upon mere assertion.\n\nAnd in this case the claim is particularly seductive because it also deals with the thorny theological issues raised by the rape/pregnancy question \u2013 How can a benevolent God allow people to become pregnant from rape? Well, he simply doesn't! And as a further boon, it also gets you out of having to feel any sympathy for the victims \u2013 if they get pregnant, they've obviously just lied about being raped. While there is not even the shadow of the faint hint of a shred of evidence supporting the idea, it's just so goddamn convenient \u2013 we can be pretty sure that this claim will never, ever die.\n\neric\n\n[Wilke] There's no greater emotional trauma that can be experienced by a woman than an assault rape.\n\nNote that here again, we have a conservative explaining that some forms of rape are less bad than others.\n\nI suppose there's a philosophical sense in which chopping off my arm while you rape me is worse than just raping me. But that is not really what they mean. Wilk and folks like him mean to imply that women are secretly okay with any form of nonviolent rape.\n\n8\n\ntomh\n\nAnd, of course, Romney is tied to Dr. John Willke also. Wilke endorsed Romney in 2007 when Romney was running for the GOP nomination, and Romney welcomed the endorsement. \"I am proud to have the support of a man who has meant so much to the pro-life movement in our country\u2026 I look forward to working with Dr. Willke and welcome him to Romney for President.\"\n\nPhillip IV\n\nHow can a benevolent God allow people to become pregnant from rape? Well, he simply doesn't!\n\nThe actual rape ITSELF, he has no problem with\u2026of course.\n\nOf course not, after all he can't interfere with the free will of the rapist! But don't worry, he'll punish him later with an eternity in a lake of fire\u2026unless the rapist happens to accept Jesus Christ as his savior a few seconds before his death.\n\nBen PAnd just to make the point that ideology tends to supersede common sense and education. Fay Boozman is the older brother of one of Arkansas' current senators John Boozman. Fay Boozman was an MD and was a practicing Opthamologist. John Boozman practiced with him as an Optometrist.\n\nFay Boozman challenged Blanche Lincoln (a conservative democrat)in 1998 for one of Arkansas's senate seats and was defeated 55-45. His remark about abortions and rape came in the context of that campaign.\n\nJohn Boozman challenged Blanche Lincoln in 2010 and won the election by a 58-37 margin among a very hard fought democratic primary against a liberal challenger Bill Halter.\n\n13\n\nsivivolk\n\nGiven I've heard a distinguished elderly neurosurgeon pass on the 10% of our brains thing, a man who must know this is false, I think some of these things become so embedded in our culture that it's less ignorance and more just automatic talking, like people saying bad things come in threes or 'blood will out' and stuff like that.\n\nD. C. Sessions\n\nThe 13th-century hypothetical female analog to male semen, which presumably could not be released without orgasm. Real big on symmetry back then, except of course where it might have given women better treatment.\n\nThis is what happens when people don't get sex education. It's a lot like teenagers who come up with all sorts of crazy ideas about contraception and STD prevention. Same sort of thing with teens coming up with alleged ways to beat sobriety tests, like sticking a penny under your tongue for the breath analysis.\n\nIt's a way to manufacture the illusion of security with ignorance. It lets them rationalize risky or illegal behaviors because they think they have a handy trick to avoid the consequences. These urban legends also tend to fixate on how not to get caught or otherwise avoid the consequences, ignoring the moral principle behind the prohibitions.\n\nAs Ed's anonymous friend discussed, it goes to scary places if adults in power continue to believe their urban legends picked up as children. A rapist gets off scot free thanks in part to politicians being uncomfortable teaching children the truth about sex.\n\nbusterggi\n\nSo conservative Christian whack-jobs believe women who are raped can't get pregnant.\n\nThey also believe in;\n\ntalking snakes & donkeys,\n\ninvisible demons\n\nfossils are either artificial objects created by the devil & planted to confuse believers OR are the remains of animals that died in a world-wide flood 4000 years ago that somehow didn't affect several ancient civilizations\n\nTrue, but these people are in a position to potentially make or change laws based on this particular idea. Also, rape culture has flourished in part because of ideas like this being passed around as urban lore. While the idea is not as crazy as the other stuff, it's still having a horrible impact.\n\n20\n\nd cwilson\n\nTrue, but Koop also believed that the way to reduce abortion was to reduce unwanted pregnancies through education and contraception, not criminalizing it. This was one of many issues that put him at odds with his bosses in the Reagan administration. He naively believed that public health policy should be guided by good scientific data, not what conservatives really, really wanted to be true.\n\nNomad\n\nI've been particularly interested in this whole topic because I kind of crossed paths with it a while back, and want to report that it's perhaps a bit more varied than is so far being reported.\n\nAn ex-girlfriend of mine who came from a fairly religious family once told me that some process involved in medical rape investigations would either prevent pregnancy or destroy it. The idea gave me the mental image of a rape investigation kit that includes an upright vacuum cleaner with a vagina attachment, and I immediately scoffed at it. She angrily retorted \"well how do YOU know?\"\n\nI believe she specified that she was taught this in church.\n\nI doubt she believes this any more, during the time I knew her she was seemingly first coming into contact with feminism and was starting to question various things. But I report this anecdote for addition to the collection of tales that have been told. It has at least a whiff of the \"legitimate rape\" air about it, in that it might be suggested that if you don't report the rape to the police and get checked out then you must not have been really raped.\n\nI can only assume that there are further variations on this theme out there. As with other forms of science denialism the specifics don't particularly matter when you're not starting with reality in the first place. The true believers won't stop to realize that they're being told mutually exclusive stories because they're so relieved at having been given a way out of the problem of evil contradiction of forcing women to carry the children of their rapists. If along the way they have to slut shame a woman who was impregnated by their rapist to maintain the solution then so be"}
{"text": "December 03, 2005\n\nYes, I'm Watching C-Span\n\nI admit it: I am largely apolitical. A lot of people consider me a bad person. I'm not affiliated with any party, I consider myself a political moderate, and I see so little difference from politician to politician that politics largely disillusions me. But I've heard things on the radio about this law in New Hampshire that requires doctors to notify parents 48 hours before the abortion of a minor. I became fascinated with the details of this case, and as I was flipping through the TV channels this evening, I found the debate before the Supreme Court on C-Span. I decided that I couldn't afford to change the channel, because I was actually interested about something in the realm of current affairs. Continue reading if you wish, but my views expressed here are all my own and largely controversial. All angry comments with no real debatable quality will be deleted.\n\nImagine a seventeen year-old girl. She's beginning her senior year in high school. She's been accepted to a good college, will be majoring in pre-medicine, and has her whole life ahead of her. Sometime around Christmas she misses a period. She goes to the doctor in secret a day after school in January, and she finds out she's pregnant. She talks to her boyfriend of two years, and he tells her that they only thing neither of them can afford to handle a child. She goes to Planned Parenthood and asks for an abortion. They tell her she has to tell her parents first. The girl is obviously terrified. Her parents could have any number of reactions, and she doesn't like most of them.\n\nI am nearly 23, recently graduated from college. I can't even imagine going through the terror of discovering I'm pregnant, five years older than the age of a minor. Even though I live by myself in my own place, even though I have an excellent health care program through my employment, even though I have a stable pay check and could support a child if I needed to, I am still afraid of my parents' reactions if I became pregnant. Five years ago, if I were still in high school? Forget about it.\n\nBut fear is not the issue here. The issue is parents, being aware of what their children are doing.\n\nParental notification for minors' abortions is absolutely necessary, without exception. No justification exists for a girl to be able to have a legal abortion before she can legally purchase cigarettes. What is more harmful for a child? The very idea is preposterous.\n\nA core issue in this debate is the fact that kids are having sex younger and younger. This fact can be related to multiple issues, but those reasons are not important. Even when people are having safer sex, the possibility for pregnancy is always there. Abstinence is the only 100% effective birth control, but teenagers just won't listen sometimes. Preaching can only go so far; children will make their own decisions. But when children make these decisions, for better or for worse, parents should be aware. Many kids try to hide the fact that they smoke from their parents, but too often parents know. They smell it on the child's clothes or in their hair. Pregnancy is a life-altering, earth-shattering event in the life of a woman. If parents can trust the government to take care of their children by not selling them drugs and alcohol, parents should also trust the government to take care of their children by upholding the parents' other wishes. If a parent thinks it's ok for their kid to smoke or drink, parents buy their children cigarettes or alcohol. If parents think it's ok for their children to have abortions, they can support their child's decision. If a parent knows their child is having sex, they can buy birth control.\n\nThe debate challenging the New Hampshire statute is a health exception, if the girl is immediately in danger as a result of her pregnancy. If delaying an abortion for just a few hours would harm the girl's health, should the parents still be informed? My answer is yes. The debate the Supreme Court is having shows how much variability the doctors' opinions can be for what exactly a \"medical emergency\" would constitute. If a minor is sexually active, he or she should be aware of the consequences. We are not holding children responsible for their actions. This is not a \"women's health\" issue. This is a parent/child issue. Parents have the right to know.\n\nDecember 01, 2005\n\nA Pastry by Any Other Name\n\nI am a sucker when it comes to food. Stick the phrase \"free food\" on an invitation, you can pretty much bet I'll be there. I grew up in a food house. My mother cooked in both high quality and high quantity, so I grew up with a distinct love for cooking. My mother's baked goods are phenomenal, and I typically can't eat others' baking without being disappointed\u2014it's just not my mom's. They had a bake sale at work for a really good cause, so I bought things that my mother doesn't normally cook, namely baklava and lemon poppy seed bread. The following morning, a co-worker was sharing her bake sale bounty when I spied a distinct shape. It was a chocolate chip cupcake. But it was still early in the morning; I couldn't eat a cupcake for breakfast. Right next to it was a muffin, apple strudel or something of the sort. Then I started thinking\u2014what made one pastry a cupcake, and the other a muffin?\n\nThe line between cupcake and muffin is a thin and wavy one. One might say that cupcakes have paper while muffins do not. This chocolate chip conundrum did not have paper. Other definitions may indicate that cupcakes are dessert while muffins are for breakfast. I had no idea where this pastry fell, since it was chocolate chip I leaned toward cupcake, but it didn't have frosting, making it largely un-cake-like. To make myself feel better, I called the mystery food a \"chocolate chip muffin\" to make myself feel better, for they do exist.\n\nFurther investigating this concept (since I am truly a scientist, and have nothing better to do with my time besides investigate\u2026 and knit), I went to dictionary.com to see if the website could give me definitive differences:\nCupcake, n: A small cake baked in a cup-shaped container.\nMuffin, n: A small, cup-shaped quick bread, often sweetened.\nAha! This was the start of something. Cupcakes are like cake (logically), while muffins are like bread. Cakes and bread are totally different baked goods. Once they are transformed into the cup shape, however, their differences diminish slightly. To my knowledge, chocolate chip cake and chocolate chip bread can both exist. And why shouldn't they? Both contain chocolate and therefore are equally tasty. Most of the breads that we normally think of when we hear the word \"bread\" are typically yeast breads, anyway. Using the phrase \"quick bread\" skews the definition just enough that the difference is small.\n\nI needed to know, pound for pound, what the core difference was. So I pulled up a pair of recipes to compare...\n\nI considered doubling the muffin recipe so it would \"make\" about the same. For those of you who don't know, the amount of flour the recipe calls for is the best predictor of how much the recipe will make. By doubling the muffin recipe, you get 2.5 cups flour compared to 3 cups flour, which is slightly closer. Then it becomes two eggs to four eggs (double the eggs for cupcakes), one cup butter to half cup oil (double the lipid for cupcakes), but one cup chocolate chips to two cups chocolate chips (twice as many chips in your muffins). The amount of liquid becomes equal, the amount of sugar in the cupcakes is still higher, and the amount of baking powder becomes significantly larger for muffins. What does all of this mean?\n\nWhere the muffins lack in sugar they make up for in chocolate. The muffins are most likely drier, too, due to the lesser amounts of moisture, especially eggs. But these are just two recipes. There may be muffin recipes that call for butter and plain old milk. I've seen cookie recipes take several different kinds and amounts of flour, not to mention all manners of lipid. When it all boils down to it, perhaps the only real indicator of muffin versus cupcake is the taster's nomenclature.\n\nTherefore, I say, eat cupcakes for breakfast. You can call them muffins and feel better about yourself. Then, serve your guests healthy muffins for dessert. If you call them cupcakes, they'll never be the wiser. Though no one's pastries will ever match my mother's, I still enjoy the occasional non-Mom-sanctioned dessert (especially Otis Spunkmeyer cookies, which they serve in the cafeteria at work). Enjoy your pastries, no matter what you deem them.\nFor further muffin madness, feel free to visit Muffin Films."}

{"text": "The incest justification for abortion is just a distraction. Of the million or so US abortions every year, how many involve pregnancies resulting from incest? I'd be surprised if there are as many as ten in a year. Incest doesn't involve an unidentifiable stranger. The father is known, and his responsibility can be proved by DNA testing.\nForcible rape by an unknown rapist is certainly possible, and using a weapon to \"persuade\" the victim to submit is still forcible even if no bodily injury is inflicted. However, Akin's use of the term \"legitimate\" was intended to distinguish rapes that happened from rapes that are claimed but never occurred.

{"text": "Welp.\n\nMain menu\n\nMonthly Archives: August 2005\n\nYou know, coming from the crowd who thought it was the funniest, most clever thing to draw purple hearts on Band-Aids and put them on and giggle about how wounded veterans are all whining little babies, any criticism on how people should feel about soldiers\u2013especially mothers for their children\u2013is pretty fucking ridiculous, to say the very least. I'd be more moved by words from people who actually seemed to give a shit.\n\nMaybe they'd be a little more convincing without the pure, unbridled hatred of a woman mourning the loss of her son, regardless of how she feels about the war. Maybe then their claims of \"culture of life\" might come a little closer to seeming at all believable.\n\n\"Insofar as sensible political labels might be applied to these three positions, it would seem plain that the first (pro-abortion) position would be labeled liberal (with the Roe version of that position being radical), the second (pro-life) would be labeled conservative, and the third (neutral) would be labeled moderate.\"\n\nEd Whelan, of the National Review\n\nBefore I get to the meat of this, I'd like to address the terminology used. There are EXTREMELY FEW PEOPLE in this world who are ALL GUNG-HO AND CHEERY about HAVING AN ABORTION. It's not the abortion itself of which people are supportive, it's the option. Just because you can't see in anything but black and white extremes doesn't mean that all things are somehow opposites of each other. The opposite of not wanting anyone to get an abortion would be wanting everyone to get an abortion. And the only people who support that concept are either insane, or dipshits who think the best solution to all of the world's problems is the xenosuicide of humanity, leaving all the other forms of life to deal with problems we've created. (How noble!)\n\nIf we're going to make these kinds of extrapolations\u2013of claiming that the opposing perspective is in fact literally opposite\u2013, then anyone who isn't pro-choice is pro-fascism. They want some authoritative entity to make every single choice for every single individual. In fact, their idea of a perfect society would be one in which nobody ever made a decision. Think that's a fair description, jackass?\n\nDo you honestly think, Ed, that there's this large movement of people who go in to hospitals and tell pregnant women who want their children that they really ought to get abortions? (I'm not going to claim it never happens\u2013see \"crazies\", above\u2013but that if it does, it's rare and in no way representative or illustrative of the non-\"pro-life\" perspective as a whole.) Do you really believe that there are women who go out and get pregnant just so they can drop several hundred dollars to induce miscarriage? \"BOY OH BOY, I just CAN'T WAIT to HAVE A DOCTOR PROBE AROUND IN MY VAGINA so I can HAVE A BLOODY EXPULSION THAT MAKES MENSTRUATION LOOK LIKE A PAPER CUT.\" Yeah, I'm sure it's only a matter of time before they make that a ride at Six Flags.\n\nWhat we support is the RIGHT to have it, not the actual act itself. In fact, I'm sure there are a good number of people who are pro-choice because of rights issues, but against abortion because of personal reasons. (\"While I don't agree with what you say, sir, I'll fight to the death for your right to say it.\")\n\nNow, for the rest of this idiocy. As clearly illustrated, every thought this guy\u2013and his ilk, it seems, in general\u2013has is oversimplified into \"left\", \"right\", and \"center\". You're either WITH us, AGAINST us, or NEUTRAL. While this is in itself extremely flawed\u2013this \"opposites filter\" way of thinking\u2013, there's a more profound problem with this that seems to often go overlooked.\n\nIn these kinds of discussions\u2013and this is true for both the right and the left\u2013it seems that the issue or argument itself is often judged not by content, but by origin. \"Pro-choice\" is a \"liberal\" thing. \"Pro-life\" is a \"conservative\" thing. Where this seems to appear the most is in conservatives' claims of \"liberal bias\" in the media. The actual truth itself doesn't matter as much as whatever \"side\" reported the story. What scares me is that the \"truth\" is becoming\u2013mostly for the right, at least, though I'm sure it happens on the left as well\u2013more about how what is reported coincides with a particular viewpoint or preconception than about how what is reported coincides with what actually happened. It's not \"right or wrong\", it's \"right or left\".\n\nEverything is politicized, and in doing so, we keep ourselves distracted from what the real arguments should be by the wrestling match of politics. Instead of figuring out whether an idea would or wouldn't work, or would be beneficial or harmful, we just keep arguing about liberalism vs. conservatism. It ends up being not about whether, say, a bill about mercury pollution would be helpful or harmful in and of itself, but about how greedy and business-favoring the conservatives are, or how tree-hugging and sissy the liberals are. Which ultimately makes everything remain a discussion about which \"side\" is right: liberals or conservatives. It becomes a competition over who can win in the Pass a Bill game. There may as well be a betting pool on which bills will pass or be rejected.\n\nIn short, let's start focusing on the utility, and not the origin. Oh, and Ed Whelan can fornicate himself with an unsanded broom handle.\n\nOkay, so, if these \"Intelligent Design\" people have it right (which they don't; see tomorrow's post), then none of the defects that exist within mankind could have emerged without initially being written into the plans from the start. That is, nothing of which man is capable could exist if it wasn't allowed within the framework of the initial \"design\". If the capacity for flaw wasn't initially put into the plan, then that flaw would not be able to come into being in later implementations of the \"design\". (See also: Plato's Forms and Ideas)\n\nStill operating within the framework of the fundamentalist universe, here, why did God supposedly \"design\" defectiveness? One could argue that it's to give people a challenge to overcome, or to allow them to appreciate, by experiencing negatives, how great the positives can be. Which has merit, I guess, but sort of calls into question the real \"intelligence\" of the design when one looks at some of the defectiveness that's been supposedly \"designed\" into the \"plans\". Especially in frogs\u2013hell, those things will grow two heads if you look at them funny. Yeah, really \"intelligent design\", that\u2013something that'll grow twelve extra legs if someone so much as accidentally spills some Coca-Cola into their habitat.\n\n\"Intelligent Design\" folks, if they truly believe in that crap and aren't just using it as a tool to wedge full-on creationism into classrooms, have to come to terms with, among other things, the following:\n\n- Everything that man can possibly become\u2013that is, every difference that exists from one person to the next (yes, including homosexuality)\u2013must have been part of the \"designer\"'s \"plan\". This undermines any arguments they have against homosexuality being a \"choice\". If this is all \"designed\", and homosexuality exists, then homosexuality is a part of that \"design\". If it wasn't allowed for in the initial design, then it couldn't have come into being. And how can you be expected to just, like, will yourself to be something other than your \"design\"? Blind people can't will themselves to see.\n\n- If man is to follow the example of God, then it's perfectly all right for man to intentionally create defectiveness in any given thing so that the non-defectiveness will be appreciated. For instance, \"the mufflers on this car rot off after about six weeks, but we figured that you'd hate the muffler, but love the rest of the car that much more.\" Or, \"yeah, we decided to make the middle half-hour of the movie extremely shitty and cliche so that the audience would appreciate how good the beginning and end were.\"\n\nAnyway, in tomorrow's update, I'll explain why \"Intelligent Design\" is misdirected (in addition to many other words beginning with the same three letters).\n\nHey, Bernard Goldberg, you know who's really \"Screwing Up America\"? People who write books about the hundred people they think are screwing up America.\n\nCome on, Jimmy Carter at number six, because he only helps people who are suffering in certain countries? What, you expect him to save everyone? I think it's more important that he, y'know, um, HELPS PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING.\n\nI'd like to do a point-by-point response book to your little hard-cover shitfest, and call it \"Bernard Goldberg Is Full of Shit\"."}

I can't imagine the pain he and his family went through but that can happen during pregnancy. Yet, he remains staunchly against ALL forms of abortion.\n\nIgnoring the blatant hyperbole and partisan nature of the article itself, I think the meat of the story should bother more Americans. Rick Santorum doesn't care about your wife, but he's allowed to break his own beliefs to save his. I mean, he even alluded to it, he loves his wife and therefore it's different.\n\nDo people really like this kind of attitude from their leaders?

Telling a woman to \"deal with it\" is exactly what should be done. Step up! You already gave your body away when you shared it. Deal with the consequences. Yes, it's hard, yes there are changes and risks, but it'll be over in 9 months.\n\nYou know that a baby is born in 9 months, right? It's not exactly 'over'\n\nOn the one hand I agree that people need to learn to handle their consequences much better than they do now, but saying \"just deal with it\" is not entirely what this is about. Abortions can be necessary to save a woman's life as with Santorum's. He is saying that he doesn't care if your wife dies, he only cares about his. So basically, he can break his own proposed laws because it's in his best interest.\n\nNormally those that choose to abort don't want the child meaning they would likely choose to give it up for adoption (or at least I hope). No one likes that people could risk their life in childbirth....yet same woman risks her life contracting STDs, or walking across the street.\n\nDan Savage had written a blog about this, and it's my understanding this is where this \"source\" got it's information.

{"text": "Birth Control Recall Is God Telling Men to Get a Vasectomy\n\nBummed out about the birth control recall? Worried about the safety and effectiveness of your pill? Welcome to the I-hate-dealing-with-birth-control club. There were plenty of reasons not to love the pill even before this latest debacle. There's the hormones, the puffiness, the mood swings, the cancer risk, the forgetting to take it. Ugh!\n\nIt's enough to make you just want to give up on birth control altogether -- almost. Except that there's that whole getting pregnant thing. Which most of us don't want to do every nine months. But here's a radical idea: How's about the guys worry about the birth control a little? Time for us to remind the men of the world about what a huge favor they'd do us if they'd just get a freakin' vasectomy.\n\nYeah guys, get the ol' snip snip. What's the big deal? If you're in a committed relationship and you're done making the babies, what's stopping you? I really don't understand why more guys aren't into this idea. SEX WITH NO BABIES. You want that, don't you?\n\nI'm gonna say something that's probably way too personal, but here we go: On our 10th wedding anniversary, my husband got a vasectomy. And you know what? BEST WEDDING ANNIVERSARY PRESENT EVER. This is the same guy who survived a car accident that broke his back and feels squeamish if he's even 10 feet near a doctor's office. But he did it anyway. Why? Because of the no more babies, that's why. P.S. everything still works just fine.\n\nI am amazed every time a woman tells me that she and her husband or partner are finished having kids but that her guy won't get a vasectomy. It's never because he's still holding out for the possibility that they'll change their minds. It's because it sounds scary. Jesus! H! Christ! We're the ones taking the pills and putting all manner or wires and sponges up our hoo-hahs month after month. We're the ones who birth the babies. Who looks like a wimp in this scenario?\n\nMan up, guys. Get a vasectomy. You'll love it.\n\nAre you done having babies? Has your man gotten a vasectomy? Why or why not 18\n\nUmmm... Actually, if women want to empower themselves AND avoid pregnancy, then they should LEARN about how their body works...Natural Family Planning DOES work to avoid pregnancy. And (other than the cost of a class) it's free! No hormones, no surgeries...\nSounds like a better solution to me.\n\nI am childfree and my first husband had a vas shortly after we were married. My 2nd husband came already snipped. I'm glad I haven't had to worry about hormone-wrenching birth control in a loooong time.\n\nWow, lucky women with the natural method! I've done a ton of research, even had fertility tests run to track my cycles, and every time I have had unprotected sex (even at the optimium times to not conceive) it resulted in a pregnancy. Worked horribly, and my drs said I'm very lucky to be so fertile (my ass!). So I do birth control, though I don't like to, because I've had issues with condoms breaking (three times) and even with the use of spermacide (HA! love that word!) I got pregnant.\n\nSo, now I'm with a guy who neither of us actually want any more kids (ok, I day dream, but am not serious) and still, he's fertile, and I'm on birth control. As a side note? My aunt and mother both had TUBAL PREGNANCIES after having tubal ligation to prevent further pregnancies. After their tubal babies, they both had their ueterus and ovaries removed, for no other reason then to stop having babies! WOW!\n\nI plan on getting the Paragard after the next baby is born. Set it and forget it! I just don't like th idea of the permanence. My mom had her tubes tied after my sister was born, but that sort of thing just isn't for me.\n\nNFP works if you have a good rhthym. I used it for a couple years before getting pregnant (we were trying at that point, it wasn't an oops). I never had a problem!\n\nI personally was on birth control for 11 years - started on depo then went to seasonale. I speak from experience that birth conrol isn't the \"cure\" for avoiding pregnancy that we think it is. There ARE side effects. I had to go off the pill because it caused hypertension. We can't afford a baby or a vas... So we do NFP. I've never felt better being off pills and so in tune with my body. So it is a legitimate option that is too often disregarded."}
{"text": "I submit that contraception is the worst scourge to ever afflict mankind, the costliest by far in both blood and treasure, absolutely ruinness to women in particular and mankind in general. Since it's acceptance, divorce rates have soared along with pornography, STD's, homosexuality, exploitation of women, abortion, breast cancer and now government attacks on freedom of expression. Paul VI was particularly prescient in predicting government pressure in HUMANAE VITAE in explicating the Church's beautiful teaching in this matter.\nUsing contraception in the marital act is akin to flipping a hand grenade with the pin pulled into the heart of a marriage.\n\nContraception= preventing people from being born. How is that \"costly in blood and treasure\"? Think how overpopulated the world would be if everyone got married at sixteen, and every time the man came, it HAD to be inside his wife and she HAD to have a child, which is what the Christians seem to want.\nThe other things listed are either nothing to do with contraception, existed before it, or, like STDs, are actively reduced by it.\n\nOh pish. When the first people entered Pompeii after its destruction by Mount Vesuvius they were astonished to discover the sheer amount of pornography; scrawled on walls, artfully depicted in mosaics and used as instructive diagrams in the city's many brothels. Brothels that actually outnumbered the bars.\n\nAnd this was in 79 CE, which is concurrent with the writing of the New Testament or even considerably pre-dates it.\n\nThis is a huge pile of correlation not implying causation. So what if contraception is against the Church's will? That's why we live in a society and not in individual bubbles. Can you honestly say that you agree with everything your government has done? What with the torture in Gitmo and rendition of foreign nationals and all? If not, then you shouldn't pay taxes to support them either. You're only getting pissy about they particular violation of your beliefs because it's got 'God' involved.\n\nHomosexuality...hmm...How about we let people be people, and not judge them because they like the same gender? Contraception doesn't really matter for a same sex relationship, unless one person is dirty or unknown and you want to protect yourself.\n\nExploitation of women...Yeah, no. Contraception actually goes against that, since it empowers women with the ability to choose who to fuck, how often, and if she wants kids or not."}

{"text": "Mommy, Where Do Political Debates Come From?\n\nThe first seven days.\n\nWednesday's New York Times car\u00adried an arti\u00adcle by Pam Bel\u00adluck, \"Abor\u00adtion Qualms on Morning-\u200b\u200bAfter Pill May Be Unfounded\". The arti\u00adcle details the ongo\u00ading debate over the use of so-\u200b\u200bcalled \"morn\u00ading after\" pills, mar\u00adketed in the United States under the brand names Plan B and ella, and how that debate may be pred\u00adi\u00adcated on bad or incom\u00adplete science.\n\nThe debate over these drugs has strayed from the realm of health and med\u00adi\u00adcine into the region of politics.\n\nThe newest of these drugs is ulipristal acetate, which is being sold as \"ella\".\n\nFirst, let's look at how babies are made, then we can dis\u00adcuss how these drugs work.\n\nCon\u00adcep\u00adtion\n\nIn an ideal world, a woman of child\u00adbear\u00ading age expe\u00adri\u00adences a burst of hor\u00admones from the pitu\u00aditary gland, a pea-\u200b\u200bsized gland under the brain at the roof of the mouth, about 14 days after the begin\u00adning of the last men\u00adstrual period. Luteiniz\u00ading hor\u00admone (LH) is named because it stim\u00adu\u00adlates release of an egg (ovu\u00adla\u00adtion) and what's left behind in the ovary turns into a struc\u00adture called the cor\u00adpus luteum (\"yel\u00adlow body\" in Latin). The cor\u00adpus luteum, in turn, begins secret\u00ading hor\u00admones like prog\u00ades\u00adterone (\"in favor of preg\u00adnancy\" in Latin) which plump up the uter\u00adine lin\u00ading and pre\u00adpare it for the arrival of the fer\u00adtil\u00adized egg. Once it arrives, the fer\u00adtil\u00adized egg bur\u00adrows into the uter\u00adine lin\u00ading where it remains for the next 39 weeks.\n\nImplan\u00adta\u00adtion: Day 6 after sperm meets egg.\n\nThis process both occurs faster and slower than one might expect. Stud\u00adies have shown that after inter\u00adcourse, the first sperm reach the uter\u00adine tube (Fal\u00adlop\u00adian tube), where fer\u00adtil\u00adiza\u00adtion usu\u00adally occurs, in about 20 to 30 min\u00adutes. That these tiny swim\u00admers can make their way so far so fast is a tes\u00adti\u00admony to the tenac\u00adity of con\u00adcep\u00adtion and the con\u00adtin\u00adu\u00ada\u00adtion of life. The sperm can live for two to three days. If just one of the 300 mil\u00adlion sperm reach the egg, then fer\u00adtil\u00adiza\u00adtion can occur. Yet, after fer\u00adtil\u00adiza\u00adtion occurs, the zygote's jour\u00adney to the uter\u00adine lin\u00ading takes about six days, dur\u00ading which time it's divid\u00ading into a ball of cells which can implant in the uter\u00adine lining.\n\nThere are sev\u00aderal ways of stop\u00adping this process.\n\nBar\u00adrier meth\u00adods such as a con\u00addom or diaphragm phys\u00adi\u00adcally stop the sperm from trav\u00adel\u00ading to the uter\u00adine tubes. A diaphragm works even bet\u00adter if a sper\u00admi\u00adci\u00addal (\"sperm killing\") jelly is used to seal the con\u00adtact between the diaphragm and the cervix (the lower open\u00ading of the uterus).\n\nGrounded, in reality.\n\nHormone-\u200b\u200bbased meth\u00adods block the LH sig\u00adnal and keep ovu\u00adla\u00adtion from occur\u00adring. This is illus\u00adtrated, in a fash\u00adion that's a lit\u00adtle twee for my tastes, in a car\u00adtoon on the ella web\u00adsite. The con\u00adven\u00adtional forms of birth con\u00adtrol pills also work in this way but must be used con\u00adtin\u00adu\u00adously and are inef\u00adfec\u00adtive if started after inter\u00adcourse occurs. Plan B and ella work even after inter\u00adcourse, so they obvi\u00adously are more use\u00adful for pre\u00advent\u00ading unwanted pregnancies.\n\nMeth\u00adods that trig\u00adger inflam\u00adma\u00adtion in the uterus either block the fer\u00adtil\u00adized egg from implant\u00ading or stim\u00adu\u00adlate the uter\u00adine lin\u00ading to reject the embryo after it has already implanted. Sci\u00aden\u00adtists esti\u00admate that this process actu\u00adally occurs nat\u00adu\u00adrally in about half of all preg\u00adnan\u00adcies; because the implan\u00adta\u00adtion takes place about a week before the next men\u00adstrual period begins, women would be unaware that implan\u00adta\u00adtion had occurred and failed.\n\nEach per\u00adson who has an opin\u00adion in the abor\u00adtion debate has a posi\u00adtion on each of these. For exam\u00adple, if one believes that life begins at con\u00adcep\u00adtion, then bar\u00adrier and hormone-\u200b\u200bbased meth\u00adods are accept\u00adable because they pre\u00advent sperm and egg from meet\u00ading (see car\u00adtoon at right). Inflammation-\u200b\u200bbased meth\u00adods are unac\u00adcept\u00adable because they pre\u00advent implan\u00adta\u00adtion of a \"per\u00adson\" (if the pro\u00adposed \"per\u00adson\u00adhood\" amend\u00adments are successful).\n\nThe Catholic Church, on the other hand, has taken the posi\u00adtion that any inter\u00adfer\u00adence with the process of con\u00adcep\u00adtion is unac\u00adcept\u00adable. Recently, Pope Bene\u00addict changed the Church's posi\u00adtion on the use of bar\u00adrier meth\u00adods. What used to be a blan\u00adket ban now has an exemp\u00adtion if the con\u00addom (for exam\u00adple) is used to pre\u00advent the spread of dis\u00adease. How\u00adever, the Church is still opposed to the use of bar\u00adrier meth\u00adods for con\u00adtra\u00adcep\u00adtion. Since the use of all forms of birth con\u00adtrol is unac\u00adcept\u00adable to the Catholic Church, it has trig\u00adgered a debate on government-\u200b\u200bmandated insur\u00adance for con\u00adtra\u00adcep\u00adtives that DC and I have writ\u00adten about previously.\n\nBelluck's New York Times arti\u00adcle details how incor\u00adrect infor\u00adma\u00adtion was added to both the drug infor\u00adma\u00adtion insert required by the Food and Drug Admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion (FDA) and the National Insti\u00adtute of Health's web\u00adsite entries on lev\u00adonorgestrel (Plan B) and ulipristal (ella).\n\nAn open ques\u00adtion is how this infor\u00adma\u00adtion came to be added to the FDA-\u200b\u200bmandated infor\u00adma\u00adtion sheet. Bel\u00adluck reports exten\u00adsively on this issue, and it appears that evi\u00addence of a polit\u00adi\u00adcal debate within the FDA, if any, has been lost. It is clear that the drug com\u00adpa\u00adnies which pro\u00adduce and mar\u00adket these drugs asked repeat\u00adedly for the infor\u00adma\u00adtion to be removed, to no avail.\n\nWe might never know how the wrong sci\u00aden\u00adtific infor\u00adma\u00adtion made its way onto the label. Clearly, in the face of over\u00adwhelm\u00ading sci\u00aden\u00adtific data which fails to sup\u00adport an effect of Plan B or ella on implan\u00adta\u00adtion, it's time to remove the incor\u00adrect infor\u00adma\u00adtion, but now even that rea\u00adson\u00adable step is fraught with polit\u00adi\u00adcal meaning.\n\nWhere do you stand on the ques\u00adtion of when life begins? Is it con\u00adsis\u00adtent with your views on these drugs?\n\nRegard\u00adless of where we stand on abor\u00adtion, we should be angry that the gov\u00adern\u00adment is basi\u00adcally requir\u00ading the drug com\u00adpa\u00adnies to lie to Amer\u00adi\u00adcan women about what the drugs do. A woman who takes ella or Plan B after ovu\u00adla\u00adtion is not pro\u00adtected against preg\u00adnancy, and she deserves to know that so that she can use other means to pre\u00advent an unwanted preg\u00adnancy in those cases.\n\nThe mess we find our\u00adselves in with respect to abor\u00adtion is the fun\u00adda\u00admen\u00adtal belief of where the divid\u00ading line should be with respect to \"life\". It's a mess because one side looks at it pri\u00admar\u00adily from a spir\u00adi\u00adtual per\u00adspec\u00adtive (i.e., when is the \"soul\" founded), while the other looks at it from a bio\u00adlog\u00adi\u00adcal per\u00adspec\u00adtive (i.e., when is it bio\u00adlog\u00adi\u00adcally \"alive\"). That makes it effec\u00adtively impos\u00adsi\u00adble to achieve agree\u00adment through com\u00admon ground.\n\nFrom the Seat\u00adtle Times arti\u00adcle cited above: \"By 2002, stud\u00adies pro\u00adduced evi\u00addence that Plan B did not inter\u00adrupt implan\u00adta\u00adtion.\u2026.Later, in 2007, 2009 and 2010, researchers in Aus\u00adtralia and Chile gave Plan B to women after deter\u00admin\u00ading with hor\u00admone tests which women had ovu\u00adlated and which had not.

Certainly an uptick in diagnoses of things like ADHD, autism, etc have contributed to their soaring rates, but there may also be environmental factors, including fertility treatments and older parents. And we know that chromosomal abnormalities are significantly more common in pregnancies conceived by older people. It is important to talk about all of that. At the same time, there are myriad benefits to having children later. Children of older parents tend to do better in school. Older parents tend to spend more time (and more quality time) with their kids. Children born to older parents are more likely to be raised in economically stable households with lower divorce rates.

And I am given to understand - though I may be wrong - that the woman's body DOES try to prevent conception in those circumstances. It is also absolutely true that it sometimes fails. That also doesn't take into account non-violent rape (like date rape, where a woman is drugged rather than forced into compliance) which, because it is non-violent, doesn't trigger the stress mechanisms and is more likely to result in pregnancy.\n\nAll of that said, abortion is abortion, regardless of how the woman got pregnant. It is an atrocity that a child ought to be killed just because the mother finds it inconvenient. I won't claim \"empathy\" for rape...\n\n... victims because I'm neither a woman nor a rape victim.

He is an innocent baby.\"\n\nOkay, I'm going to implant a large, obtrussive device in your abdomen. If it is removed prematurely, it will kill someone you don't know.

I'm sure she'll be a well-adjusted, 11 year old mother.\n\nFeel good that you were excommunicated from that group of short-sided idiots. The stories that I usually see involving Cardinals would lead me to believe that there is a good chance Alfonso Llopez Trujillo was the sperm donar.\n\nHow many eleven-year-olds can safely deliver what could very well be a full, normal-size baby? Apparently she's well through puberty, but I'd have to think this would count as a (physical as well as mental) health-of-the-mother exception.\n\nOn the other hand I'm glad they now apparently find the idea that believers' sins have been washed away by a ritual sacrifice of an innocent child of God appalling and also have abandoned the concept of original sin.\n\nHuh?

Why should he be in charge of anything more important than a half a glass of tepid water?\n\nI'm pro-life, but in cases like this, common sense would tell you to abort. First, the girl is not at fault for the rape. Why does she have to suffer and spend the rest if her childhood as a mother if it wasn't even her choice? Second, the fetus isn't technically a \\\"baby\\\" until it grows a brain and a beating heart. I don't support abortion for no reason, but to make a kid suffer for something she didn't do, and to make her spend her childhood nurturing a baby, AND to put her life at risk by making her have a baby at a premature size and age, ALL for the sake of a few cells who haven't even become self aware, is the most evil thing in the world.

I guess if Bill English was unsuccessful in using his position as minister of health to punish the evil sex having women, then Peter Dunne probably won't do much better - but it's a bit of a worry.\n\nI've heard mumblings that there's an unwritten clause in Peter Dunne's deals - so Labour won't be making New Zealand's abortion law less ridiculous and hypocrtical (for those who don't know New Zealand's abortion laws were considered the most restrictive in the Western world when they were passed in 1977; they don't quite work as intended). If either side in parliament wanted a full on abortion debate we would have had one by now, but America has shown how many different ways you can fuck with women's reproductive rights without directly changing the law, so I'm nervous.\n\nI've been vaguely folowing the supreme court stuff in America. To the surprise of no-one Harriet Miers, Bush's latest supreme court nominee, is anti-abortion and about as close to corporate America as NZCTU is to the Labour party. I'll just curl up and die from not surprisedness.\n\nThe religious right in America were opposing Harriet Miers, for reasons that seemed to amount to 'you can't trust those uppity women'. They really are batshit crazy, they can't keep their misogyny damped down long enough to get exactly what they want.\n\n2 comments:\n\nInteresting what you say about the 'unwritten clause' with Peter Dunne not to change the abortion laws - if anything like that does exist its probably more of a verbal understanding.

Things could get messy if he attempts to convince Labour to vote them down, but that would not look good for Labour MPs at all.\n\nWell he can and he can't rely on them. If there was a single Labour MP with any passion for women's right to abortion then we would have had the repeal of the Contraception Sterilisation and Abortion Act 20 years ago.\n\nThe thought of three more years in power can probably supress the burning passion that the Labour caucus has for women's rights.\n\nThe main pressure for abortion law reform is the Abortion Supervisory Committee. ALthough their proposed reform is the worst of both world's and failed in 1990 because there was no support for it anywhere.\n\nBut if the anti-abortion people succeed in their current law case against the Abortion Supervisory committee, then there might be some more pressure for the law change.

{"text": "Killing Babies On Account of Future Suffering\n\n1. It is a simple fact that everyone who lives for any substantial length of time experiences pain and confusion. These are inevitable consequences of living in a fallen world. Yet, few people today will claim that it is unacceptable to reproduce, and that one should try to prevent human beings from being brought into the world and experiencing pain and suffering. Antinatalists (who are an extreme minority, to be sure) are consistent in this sentiment, but most who espouse the above view are not. How much future pain and suffering justifies the killing of an unborn child? It might seem reasonable (following this train of thought) to end the life of someone who will live with a lifelong debilitating disease. But what about lesser pain and suffering? What about someone who is genetically predisposed to developing cancer? Going through cancer is a painful and confusing experience \u2013 why not perform abortions in cases where it is likely that the child will develop such a condition? Or, consider societal circumstances. A baby born into a war-torn and hunger-stricken part of Africa is going to experience much pain and confusion early in life, by virtue of his environment. Should such babies be aborted, to prevent their future pain and suffering? Are their parents somehow being \"irresponsible\" for giving birth to such children? If it is \"better to end the lives\" of children with genetic diseases before they are born, why is it not \"better to end the lives\" of children who are born into impoverished circumstances, or who are predisposed to certain medical conditions? Where does one draw the line? And how does one know where the line should be drawn?\n\n2. But this raises another question: who are you or I to determine whether or not it is \"better to end the life\" of this unborn child or that? As all life is created by God, only God has the authority to state under what conditions man may justifiably take life from man. And God has nowhere stated that a life lived with a debilitating disease qualifies as such a justifying circumstance. Given the Biblical prohibition against murder, it would behoove us to find positive support from Scripture that eugenics is justifiable, lest we find our hands to be stained with innocent blood.\n\n3. But even leaving the moral dimension aside, as human beings, we are woefully ignorant of many of the relevant factors in these kinds of situations. Most of us would espouse the Golden Rule: that we should only treat others as we ourselves would want to be treated. Yet, no one can say, with any degree of certainty, whether a child with such a condition, growing in the womb of its mother, would prefer to live or to die. Yet, killing others when they would prefer to have lived is a gross violation of the Golden Rule. Given that we do not know what the child would desire, or would come to desire, would it not be more prudent and upright to choose on the side of life, lest we be found to have deprived someone of a life that they would have desired to have lived? Presuming to know what the unborn child would desire (or come to desire) with respect to his own life, and terminating his life based on this presumption, reveals a monstrous arrogance towards those who cannot speak for themselves.\n\n4. In addition to being ignorant of what the child would desire, we are also woefully ignorant of what specific pain and suffering will be experienced by the child, and most importantly, how the child will interpret and process that pain and suffering. While pain and suffering is never easy, life is often deeply enriched by having experienced and overcome pain and suffering. Overcoming pain and suffering often produces a deepness and richness in one's life, in the area of that suffering, that those who have not undergone such suffering cannot hope to understand. Abortion robs these individuals of a potentially-richer life experience than any \"normal\" person could ever hope to have. How is depriving them of this in their best interest?\n\n5. Perhaps the most troubling aspect of the above sentiment, however, is that there is no reason to apply it merely to the unborn. Indeed, the sentiment is that \"when it comes to diseases, it might be better to end their lives\". If it is \"better to end the life\" of an unborn child than to let them suffer through a disease, why would it not be \"better to end the life\" of a toddler who is diagnosed with cancer, than to let them suffer though that disease? What about a ten year-old who develops leukemia? Or a thirty year-old who develops ALS? Terminating the lives of such individuals without their consent is unconscionable to all but the most hardened of heart. Yet this is the logical conclusion of the above sentiment.\n\n6. Even more troubling however, is the following: if it is acceptable to kill someone (without their consent) in order to spare them suffering, why would it not be acceptable to kill someone (without their consent) for some less ostensibly-altruistic reason? Why would it not be okay to kill someone, because they are \"feeble-minded\" (a term used by 20th-century advocates of eugenics)? Why would it not be okay to kill someone, because they cease to be useful to society and the State (per the view of George Bernard Shaw)? Or why would it not be acceptable to kill someone for reasons of ethnicity or religion? Once it becomes acceptable to kill someone without either their consent or input on the matter, it becomes tenuously difficult to see why killing people for reasons other than their own \"benefit\" would not also be justifiable."}

If you or I were destroyed at any\ntime after our zygote stage by chemical or surgical\nmeans, neither of us would be reading this now.\n\nSince\n1.4 million abortions are performed annually, 4300 every\nday, shouldn't this pill not only be condoned but\npromoted? First we must clarify a common\nmisunderstanding. The Morning After Pill, as well\nas the common birth control pill, Norplant, Depo-Provera,\nand the IUD are abortifacients. This means that\nwhile some of them at times prevent ovulation and do act\nas contraceptives, all of them cause abortions, mostly by\nmaking the uterine wall impossible for the tiny human to\nattach to following his journey down his mother's\nfallopian tube. This rejection causes the death of\nmany tiny embryos without their mothers even\nknowing. The pharmaceutical industry has kept this\nsecret for years.\n\nBut\nis this abortion? There are three ways to answer\nno, and all are easily refuted:\n\n1.\nIt's not abortion at such an early stage.\nFalse. Many people have chosen arbitrary points\nbetween fertilization and natural death to claim the\nonset of personhood and each has sounded sillier than the\nrest. Science makes it clear when we\nbegin.\n\n2.\nAbortion has to be surgical, and must attack the pre-born\ndirectly.\nNot true. Chemical abortions are no less deadly\nthan surgical ones (see Dr. Kuhar's powerful\nbooklet, \"Infant Homicides Through Contraception,\"\npublished by Pharmacists for Life) and killing the embryo\nby attacking its life source is akin to killing an adult\nby intentionally starving him.\n\n3.\nSince a percentage of embryos is discarded naturally by\nthe mother's body before uterine implantation, then\nmaking sure other embryos follow this fate is OK.\n\nTwo\nimportant things to say here. First, we don't\nknow exactly why such a percentage of embryos are\nnaturally discarded. One scientific postulate is\nthat severe abnormalities disable the proper chromosomal\nmix that would create a true human zygote. Such\nnon-human moles die naturally hours after\ninception. And even if, hypothetically, these are\ntrue human embryos dying before implantation by a mystery\nof nature and God, does this make it right to\nintentionally kill others destined for adulthood?\n\nOf\ncourse not.\n\nBut\nwouldn't such early stage abortions be better than\nlater ones? Objectively, no. You as a tiny embryo\nare no less valuable than you in your fetal stage, your\nchild stage, or the adult stage you're in now.\nWhether we die as an early embryo or later as a fetus,\nour future is still erased.\n\nSome\nwould claim a political victory for the pro-life movement\nif abortifacient drugs lessened the number of surgical\nabortions performed. If you look below the shallow\nsurface, however, you'll see this only substitutes\none way of ending lives for another.\n\nRecognizing\nthis evil in no way judges individuals. Crisis\npregnancy centers like the one I founded 13 years ago\ncontinually offer help and compassion to women. But\nwe recognize these same women themselves began at\nconception. We can't forget that females in\ntheir embryonic stage are equally as precious as females\nin their adolescent or adult stage. That so many\npeople today can't see this simple truth is\nconfounding.\n\nIf\nwanting to protect all human lives is considered radical\nin today's culture of death, then \"radical\"\nis where sanity is found. Governor Romney's\nveto, even if nothing else comes of it, can make a\ncritical statement about intellectual integrity, justice,\nand the value of human life."}
{"text": "Rick Santorum on The Netherlands and it's euthanize/abortions policy! LMAO\n\nSample reply from a guy named Guustaaf\n\n\"Ok for the record, let's just check what he is saying:\n\nThere is a \"do not euthanize\" bracelet In the Netherlands, because half the people that are euthanized are euthanized involuntarily\n\nFalse, no such bracelets exist, and every euthanasia case must start with a request from the patient. Neither the family nor the doctor can initiate the procedure, which has very clear rules:\n\nthe patient's suffering is unbearable with no prospect of improvement\n\nthe patient's request for euthanasia must be voluntary and persist over time (the request cannot be granted when under the influence of others, psychological illness or drugs)\n\nthe patient must be fully aware of his/her condition, prospects and options\n\nthere must be consultation with at least one other independent doctor who needs to confirm the conditions mentioned above\n\nthe death must be carried out in a medically appropriate fashion by the doctor or patient, in which case the doctor must be present\n\nthe patient is at least 12 years old (patients between 12 and 16 years of age require the consent of their parents)\n\nMore on the wiki.\n10% of all deaths are from euthanasia\n\nFalse.\nIn 2010, 136058 people died in the Netherlands, of which 3136 through (reported) euthanasia. That is 2,3%. Of course not every case will be reported, but I assume most of them will, because when a doctor does not follow the guidelines that have been set in Dutch law for euthanasia (including reporting it to a review committee), it is still illegal, so that would be a huge risk to take for the doctor.\n\nElderly people in the Netherlands don't go the hospital, they go to another country, because they're afraid, because of budget purposes, that they will not come out of that hospital\n\nWhile it is true that a growing number of people go to Belgian and German hospitals for non-urgent treatments, this is because of the shortage in healthcare professionals in the Netherlands, because of the population ageing, resulting in waiting lists in Dutch hospitals. This is still a fairly small amount, around 2% of operations on Dutch patients is done in foreign hospitals. But it certainly has nothing to do with 'budget purposes'. The Netherlands is in the top20 for both life expectancy and on the WHO ranking of healthcare systems, well above the US, which I assume would be harder if we were just killing old people left and right.\"\n\nLets not even give in to his whining for the good old days of abortions in the shadows where they belong.\n\nRe: Ron Paul and Jessie Ventura?\n\nOriginally Posted by jmervyn\n\nWell, the \"partisan\" stuff from the Left I mentioned is illegal bordering on treasonous, but at least we concur.\n\nSo it's treasonous when it's done on the left, what is it when done on the right? Either way, it seems we agree on a solution, I just wish you didn't turn everything into a GOP/Dem issue, because that partisan thinking is a big part of the problem.\n\nI think you're getting a little tin foil cappish here, who in particular supports more abortions? Name them. Also, the point was that the church just up and changed it's mind on early term abortions. so the new policy isn't even the historical one. it's not the \"god given\" one, it's completely made up. I'll grant that that's only tangentially related, but it's not a strawman. If the church says this is our position because god said so, but god apparently had different thoughts previously, then either god changed his mind or their just making it up as they go along. Either way, it takes some of the weight out of their argument.\n\nPatently false. I don't know why you keep banging this drum. Furthermore, you're showing your Progressive slip by illogical, unreasoned claims of causation; removal of a Federal falsification of a \"right\" just because there's a slim chance that some voter populations will criminalize it makes no sense whatever. If you compare Civil Rights, as you're probably itching to do, it would not make a difference because the situation is in no way the same. Progressives don't really give a rat-feck about the (hypocritical claim) sanctity of a woman's body; they're more than happy to invade people's body under Obamacare. The ONLY other thing it's about is the pipeline of tax money provided by murdering black kids. The first reason is why PP facilities are targeted for inner cities:\n\nI'm banging that drum because it's true. They want it repealed so they can ban abortions. They want them banned because they were told by a guy in a pointy hat that god doesn't like them. Okay, not all the church leaders where pointy hats...\n\nThe target for inner cities is because that's where people can't afford the care.\n\nEven if there was some merit to your claim that pro-choice = kill all the black people, and there is not. It doesn't matter. Allowing the woman and her doctor to deal with her situation individually is still the better (more true conservative too) option.\n\nThanks for accidentally destroying your own strawman. But if you wanted to bother distilling any truth from that poll, it boils down to people not wanting to <outlaw> abortion, just to ensure that what PP's current modus operandi is gets banned (abortion as a State-supported industry).\n\nMy you are frothy. There is a law against the federal government paying for abortions. If you can find a case where it has happened, please report it to the police. thanks.\n\nAnd stop trying to change my position, I put up a link that clearly indicated a recent poll where the majority of the country supported a woman's right to choose.\n\nYou mean, as you do? Or are you trying to refer to me in some diseased fashion? Because, after all, nothing says \"individual liberty\" like state-mandated funding of infanticide.\n\nNice try. I'm talking about the woman's right to choose. you're still dodgy a week later. Please quote me where I said i want the state to pay for abortions. Oh, that's right. i didn't. Your bad.\n\nWait, so let me get this straight. I'm a liar because the system will never work under your \"ideal\" conditions, and my belief that infanticide is \"murder\" doesn't meet your biased standards of accuracy?\n\nMy ideal conditions are that individuals purchase their own health insurance, and make their own decisions with their doctors. That works perfectly. Also, I put up the suggestion that the church not pay for health insurance if it rubs them the wrong way. they can instead pay their employees more (in the current system--or the ideal system)\n\nThat you see abortion (even the pill) as murder was not the falsehood you're putting up. you're saying that right now the government is paying for abortions. that is untrue.\n\nThe government does take tax money to murder people though. Remember that cadillac in every driveway? We both support collecting taxes for defense. Further, the government currently pays for all sorts of stuff I don't agree with, supposedly for the betterment of society. If it did help cover the expense of abortions for the poor, I don't think that would be a big deal. We pay for all sorts of medical procedures. Did i tell you about my grandfather's heart surgery? He's doing well, but it was exceedingly expensive and I don't think it was necessary. He's still having the dizzy spells in rehab (so nothing has really been fixed). i really think the doctors wanted to make some money, and they convinced him he'd be able to run and jump and click his heels and all that afterwards.\n\nAnyway, my point is we spend a lot of money on things some people find objectionable. Later on, you bring up bacon. Well there's no law against the government buying bacon. I bet that somewhere, some government money has gone to bacon. so muslim tax payers paid for bacon! OMG!\n\nSo just because the massive Gov't funding stream that props Planned Parenthood up, maintained through their incessant dishonesty about operations, doesn't actually show a child being murdered at a particular price, it's just made up? I see. And here I thought my jibe about selling you bridges was a bit harsh.\n\nIf you feel the accountants who keep track of these things are doing a bad job, feel free to put in a freedom of information request and audit them. I have a feeling that they're checking things rather closely since the right sees this as such a big issue when it shouldn't be.\n\n\"Current\" law meaning Obamacare, correct.\nNo, all the hoo-ha is about freedom, which you are openly hostile to. That's what seems weird, considering your purported stance.\nYou really ought to understand these discussions before you argue in them. The term 'abortifacient' means a drug which essentially causes a miscarriage - and that's what you Progressives are falsely claiming is \"the pill\" in this argument. RU486 is not a preventative; it's a poison. You want a drug which induces miscarriage to be considered equivalent to a prophylactic, because it basically erases the concept of a baby's humanity. Putting kittens in a sack is just as rationally termed \"birth control\", and Sanger's folks have already been caught at the modern-day equivalent of such behavior, but for a substantial number of people that sort of \"birth control\" is just a little too unpleasant to condone.\n\nThat's not the pill, that's the morning after drug. The pill, or daily oral contraceptive, or whatever you call it, is considered by the catholic church to be a form of abortion because some of the time when it works, it works after the egg has met the sperm and done their thing. the pill (the daily oral contraceptive one, not RU46), creates a situation (I'm trying to not get too graphic here, hence my vagueness) where it would be very difficult for the fertilized egg to be implanted. Most not crazy people think of the pill as stopping you from getting pregnant, not an abortion. Catholics think the soul is implanted at the very instant of conception, and therefore taking the pill is the same as the \"infantcide\" you keep mentioning.\n\nYour link to Ann Coulter actually makes a great point (one I've been making) in that we don't need to have these things covered by insurance. i agree. However, it is included because the pill prevents pregnancies, which are fairly expensive, and thus is considered preventative care. it would be great if you'd read my posts though because I'm repeating myself here a lot.\n\nSteve's plan: individuals buy their own insurance and not through their employer. government doesn't tell you what plans should cover.\n\nObamacare: Plans must cover things that have been identified to lower healthcare costs at the macro level, everyone has to buy it, whether from employer or individually. Employers have to offer insurance, but are not forced to pay for any of it. Just to re-iterate, this is DIFFERENT from Steve's \"ideal\".\n\nLike the way that it does and that I've cited has already been proven, right.\n\nI see what you did there. since you think the pill is abortion, you're right...\n\nbut as for a real instance, you have nothing. There is federal law against state funded abortion. you posted a link that might have discovered a legal loophole, a yet untested legal loophole.\n\nSo if I only buy the gun, load bullets, place it in your hand, and tell you to go kill Saro, the argument is still pretty weak that I'm inciting murder. I see.\n\nspeaking of strawmen, I'm not even sure how that's relevant.\n\nOh, so you know different from my factually supported evidence yet again? Particularly considering that my wife was refused a mammogram (on grounds of cost!) at the same time as this first was discussed in the post hospital? Wow, your omniscience is staggering. I'm sorry, but since when is someone being too old to get it up a \"legitimate medical condition\"? Your claim of fraud is false, but it's no different from the claim that prophylactics are somehow legitimate medical expenditures, like Aspirin.\n\nSo they had a medical condition that was covered by their insurance, and they were prescribed medicine to alleviate said problem....so it's not fraud then, you're just mad that it's covered because you don't think old people should have sex. Okay.\n\nAgain, separating employers and health insurance would resolve this issue. but since that's not what's happening, you do understand that it is not unusual that viagra be covered under insurance right?\n\nI was wondering when the aspirin joke would show up in here.\n\nI most definitely think that women should have the individual liberty to determine what they do with their own bodies. If their choice involves unprotected sex, however, I ALSO believe they should pay the price for their choice, and that I should not. If more women chose not to be sluts, if being a welfare mom was recognized as a horrible choice, if Progressives were forced to choose to donate their own money to Planned Parenthood rather than stealing mine through the IRS, well then heck, we'd have a far healthier society. But you somehow imagine that <I> am a totalitarian and a horrible person because I think these choices shouldn't default to your set of decisions.\n\nAgain it is currently against the law to have federal money go to paying for abortions. if you think it is happening somewhere then please by all means call the police and let them know, otherwise, please accept that no federal money is going towards abortions.\n\nPP also deals with contraceptives, education/awareness, STDs, and other sexual medical stuff. Your hostility stems from the fact that you don't like that they perform abortions. I don't even think you really believe they exist to kill black people. This is all just a giant smoke screen because you want to shame women who are \"sluts\". BTW, the fact that you post that another conservative is harassing PP only further proves my claim.\n\nAnd here's the real tickler. if they broke the law, and they did comngle funds, then someone is in big trouble. If this is just another BS-capade then it blows over and you never acknowledge you were wrong. I'll wait until I hear something more real than something drummed up from some \"news\" organization that uses \"faith\" as one of their news categories. Also, they have no sports section? No international section? No science section? It goes like this: The stories, business, faith, tech, real news (the other sections aren't real?), blogs.\n\nFurthermore, the story is from 2009 and still nothing has happened? Or did they just not want to include the new info? Nothing has happened since October 2011 when they last got kicked out of court. C'Mon. I haven't posted up one BS link. Not one. I'm shooting straight with you and THIS is what you bring me?\n\nAnd let's say for instance that this was all true. then why aren't there other cases of this all over the country? Don't you think this would be the exact kind of story that a major media company would be all over? Hell, at least Fox. I mean if they won't touch it, there's nothing to it.\n\nI won't continue to bombard you with facts, since you're obviously immune to them. But by your logic, I should use StormFront for grounds of any of my opinions on American fascism.\n\nI certainly don't feel \"bombarded\". You essentially did go to a no-name rag that lists \"faith\" as one of the five news categories it covers. Hardly impartial.\n\nI'm sure that over the many years, you've had some client or customer of whom you thought was just a beast of a person. I've worked with some real nutbars in my day. I had one guy who i actually kinda liked, but he was just a terrible guy--politics wise anyway. racist, sexist, more homophobe than you even. He would say things that just made you cringe. I'm pretty sure i only got his business because his other bank's branch had no white men in it, and I happened to knock on the right door at the right time. Anyway, I never told him i agreed with him, but I listened to him rant on and on about whatever, and i am pretty sure he knew he was making me slightly uncomfortable. i think it was a sport for him. What can i get the kid to agree to, and can i get him all riled up. Anyway, we took his money, and i handled just as well as i would have for anyone else. It was not my job to be political. i would have loved to have debated with him and put him in his place--even though he was terrible about his politics, I still didn't mind talking to the guy for the most part. instead though, I came back here and argued with you and llad. As much as i don't blame scott walker for getting caught by the gotcha, i don't blame any of the PP donation people for it either. I'm sure they're paid or graded in some way by what they bring in. i imagine they probably all got a good chuckle after they got off the phone. I'd love to listen to some of those phone calls. awkward like a \"the office\" episode.\n\nYes, Lila Rose is hot.\n\nyeah, but word has it she doesn't put out...hmm, poor taste?\nFOr those of you not reading all the links, she started a pro-life foundation that has supplied half of Jmerv's links in this post, here's a bio: \nnotice that \"liveaction\", does that seem familiar?\n\nI'm sure you'd prefer your blatant misdirect to be the question, obviously. That way you don't have to recognize, much less admit, that you're supporting an abomination that flies in the face of what you claim to believe. Any organization with a goal of 3 abortions per woman is something I wouldn't be proud to support.\n\nI don't see that goal in your link, but there's a properly vitriolic \"news\" article that apparently the employees at PP have the audacity to throw an Xmas party.\n\nI love how you Progressive Statists claim that not being given money to do something means not ALLOWING someone to do it. No wonder people like you aren't actually willing to put your money where your mouth is, when you can bully someone else into putting THEIR money where YOUR mouth is. Me, I call that 'evil'.\n\nLOL, you just didn't like that I got you there. BTW-- I never said you should have to pay for it. I've been saying for several pages that you DON\"T have to pay for it so stop whining. This trick that lets you say you're paying for abortions is this daily birth control pill is abortion BS. No one thinks that way but religious nuts. Religious nuts who's own religion didn't even back them until later when they changed their mind.\n\nSo the Church paying an insurance policy really isn't paying for it, employees really don't have to use the policies which the Church is being forced to pay for, and who really gives a feck what you fascist/racist Xians really think anyway? You're going to bully me into agreement whether it's legal or not.\n\nIf the law says this is the insurance coverage you have to provide, then that's the law. you can't just self insure, that's the whole mandate issue. Otherwise I would merely \"self-insure\" for my policy and save myself the much larger premiums from Obamacare. There is the option to offer but not pay for the health insurance. i don't believe there is any set percentage the employers have to cover, they just have to offer it (which is dumb, but is the law).\n\nAgain, I didn't write this law, and contraception is not abortion. you're conflating again.\n\nAs you have done throughout this thread so far?\n\ni spent paragraphs explaining why they are different, so that wasn't me (see above).\n\nCool. So when it becomes a matter of settled law that you Atheists are to be shot on sight as criminal threats to the society (particularly under that theocracy you keep insisting we're on the brink of), I don't need to worry about that silly Constitution or the Freedoms it contains? I can just lock & load? Cool!\n\nMore of her huh? Like I said above. If that were true, then she's in big trouble for fraud.\n\nAlso, if you read the details it wasn't the abortion that was paid for anyway it was the post-abortion follow up meeting. That meeting is not supposed to be covered (by law--shock!), because the meeting relates to an abortion. So basically, you failed on the source--iffy at best, you failed on the scandal (not really for an abortion, but close), and your source confirms that the feds are not allowed to pay for abortions, which proves me right.\n\nNow, if you could find me a better source that proves me right, i'd appreciate it, because while i totally know I'm right, it would be nice to have it from a more legitimate news source.\n\nI do really appreciate you doing my homework for me though.\n\nWhat would be even MORE nifty is if we can pretend for just a second that funding of an organization dedicated to race-based infanticide is something NOT worth funneling massive amounts of tax dollars into. You know, like with the whole America's looming bankruptcy thing?\n\nI'm not going to agree to any of that drivel.\n\ninstead of re-typing it I'll just copypasta:\n\nOriginally Posted by Steve in the post above\n\nMy stance is that when the decision on what to do with a pregnant woman should be decided by the pregnant woman. Ideally, there would be some place (like planned parenthood) where she could go and talk to a person knowledgeable about sex and pregnancy and all that jazz. Since the country spent less on this than we lent to solendra (about 100th of a percent of our budget), and the service is used by 20% of women (10% of the population), we're not talking about the first place i would go to start cutting spending. I mean, we spend thousands of times that on war. I'm for a smaller government, and I think there's a lot of waste, but this whole let's go for planned parenthood and all the money spent attacking a woman's dominion over her womb is religious nutbaggery. I mean, who gets abortions? Women who are going to have a disabled baby, Rape victims, and the ones that really rile up the GOP base, the ones who are young and unmarried and frightened and embarassed and ashamed that they made a mistake or the condom broke or whatever and they know that they really can't take care of it. It's incredibly callous to call it a \"scraping\", and I would hope you'd have the decency to not refer to it that way in front of one of them.\n\nSure. You just keep sucking that Kool Aid. Meanwhile, since after my wife & I spent over a year trying to conceive, the first thing the Doctor did was suggest an abortion, I think I'll just stick to those nasty facty things...\nSocial Reasons (given as primary reason)\n- Feels unready for child/responsibility 25%\n- Feels she can't afford baby 23%\n- Has all the children she wants/Other family responsibilities 19%\n- Relationship problem/Single motherhood 8%\n- Feels she isn't mature enough 7%\n- Interference with education/career plans 4%\n- Parents/Partner wants abortion <1%\n- Other reasons <6.5%\nTOTAL: 93% (Approx.)\n\nokay...I don't get your point. but that's a nice little survey you got there. Looks like a lot of reasons why you might get an abortion...\n\nMy sister had one. She mourns her part in the murder every day. I would, just as I refuse to use any other Politically Correct Happy-Speak to disguise the blatant evil that you and the Progressives pretend you don't advocate.\n\nI'm sorry to hear that. I wish her he best.\n\nYou're demonstrably pro-abortion, given your claims here.\n\nUm, no. I don't think we need to be telling women to get abortions, I'm merely saying they should be legal and available. I'm pro-choice. I understand you want to be able to put word in my mouth, but I will not allow that. Also, I reject the term infantcide.\n\nin\u011afan\u011ati\u011acide/in\u02c8fanti\u02ccs\u012bd/\n\nNoun:\n\nThe crime of killing a child within a year of birth.\n\nThe practice in some societies of killing unwanted children soon after birth.\n\nI'm not talking about infantcide. I was talking about abortion, and occasionally I've clarified things when you confuse/conflate contraception with abortion. Most people do not consider the birth control pill to be abortion. in fact some don't even think RU46 (the morning after pill) is abortion, but for our purposes we'll wrap it (RU46, but not the daily oral) in there.\n\nOtherwise you'd not be desperately avoiding the truth I've cited here. I accept that any society will practice infanticide; it's been in the social lexicon for millennia. I'm just not at all interested in you holding a gun to my head to pay for it, particular when the solution is in no small part for women to be less immoral and self-destructive.\n\nI too reject infantcide. However, when the baby cannot support itself outside the womb, it is the mother's decision on what to do with her own body. If she makes the choice to keep it then great. If she feels she cannot do that, then i would rather there were places she could go to discuss that with a medical professional. in that sense, i support planned parenthood because many young women have support systems that are lacking--like you know calling them sluts or telling them they have to keep it because god said so.\n\nMy GOD if you could only comprehend how insane that sounds! We live in a more anti-Christian, religious-mocking, secular-cheering time than ever has existed, and look at the devastation your demands have caused - yet you're claiming that the religious have declared war on \"the rest of us\"?\n\nOh please. changing the christmas party to a holiday party doesn't make for \"anti-christian\". Religious folks have their own news network (that we've seen some of today), ridiculously unfair taxbreaks, Tim Tebow, and you basically control the one of the political parties. The religious nutbars have plenty of power over the rest of us. Sure it's not as good for you as it was a few hundred years ago, but really, it's time to get over that.\n\nBecause it abrogates the rights of the majority and supports the tyranny of the minority, maybe? Just like the claims about queer rights?\n\nLegal abortion does what now? What right is abrogated? (good word, don't hear that one much)\n\nThe ironing is delicius.\nDoubly ironic, per above.\n\nnot sure what you're grinning at, you don't like statistics, and apparently you have had people close to you go through some things--I won't pry about your sister--but you don't care, because...\n\nNo, but maybe you could have discussed putting the baby up for adoption rather than smashing in the skull and hoovering out the remnants. No invading the sanctity of the woman's body there, for sure.\n\nThat is an option, some women will choose that and some will not. Most abortions happen in the first trimester, the site with your cute little friend there even refers to later term abortions as \"rare\", \"relatively small group\". They quote 88%, but then say the numbers are iffy because definitions vary. \"late term\" is often considered to be well after the first trimester, so there's a gap there. \n\nWhat you are describing is a partial birth abortion. This is an extremely late term abortion where it is possible for the fetus to survive outside the womb (though it may not necessarily be ready, so a birth could result in all sorts of medical issues). Partial birth abortions are not something we've discussed here. For the most part, we've been discussing very early term abortions, or at least i have been. You've been using the term \"infantcide\" which means they've already been born up to a year ago...\n\nAll for the point of people being responsible for their own decisions, which you obviously can't stand.\n\nYou want to hold homosexuals \"responsible for their own decisions\"? Nah, I'll drop that one.\n\nSo you've banned abortions. What would you do with the woman who broke that law? Would you put her in jail? How would you \"hold her responsible for her own decision\"?\n\nI'm not super shocked that an organization devoted to teaching women feminism and standing proud and doing things on your own and all that jazz would support women's rights. You might be shocked though, to find out I had nothing to do with that, being I'm not in the girl scouts, and have only cursory knowledge of the organization. I DO know that many of their scout leaders stay up very late counting all the proceeds from selling those cookies. I also know that they make a lot of counting errors, and when i called them to fix their deposits, they are much less friendly than the retail stores.\n\nThe existence of the girls scouts is partly just because there were boy scouts and the boy scouts didn't want to let them in. So it's already an activist group anyhow. I imagine that over the years though, they've probably moved farther center.\n\nI thought I'd already mentioned my queer boss in Philadelphia, and how he pleaded with me to crash at his place with his lover?\n\nYou must be far more attractive than me, in a ghey type of way.\n\nWhich is why your continuing to conflate the two makes no sense in this argument. A Flaming parent won't be allowed to hang out with the boys in any capacity, but there's plenty of other conduct-related reasons a boy (or leader) would be dismissed. One of the most reprehensible reasons was when my old Scoutmaster was dismissed for the crime of being a London \"Bobby\", because some new dads from Bechtel Corp. didn't like the troop being 'boy run' and wanted to make us all good little corporate automatons under their leadership.\n\nYou're losing me on the london bobby thing--aren't those cops? Anyway, I can understand that no one should be alone with the kids. But being a *** parent shouldn't disclude him from the trips with his son.\n\nTouche. However, Atheism IS a religion; agnosticism is not. Despite all the disgusting word-games and self-important fluffing that Atheists do with themselves, theirs is a positive belief in NO God, rather than a negative belief as they pretend.\n\nOkay but is \"Theist\" a religion? I don't think so. it's more a category. I think Atheism is more like that. Not all atheists are the same, but supposedly all (roman) catholics are. You could argue that a skeptic (like myself) is an a-theist. Or person that doesn't believe in a god(s). but lack of belief doesn't necessarily mean positive unbelieving on faith. If you took an atheist and showed them proof of a god, some (the skeptics) might switch, others (the positive type) would not. I have known far more of the skeptical variety than the ardent atheist kind.\n\nRight, just like being a Mets fan. Stick with \"agnostic\".\n\nThat implies that the answer is unknowable. I don't think it is.\n\nSure they do; it's just as I expressed above.\n\nIf by above you mean like 5 pages ago (or more), I found that page lacking. \nYou might say that atheists have a idea about creation--but i don't think science is a religion. if they came up with new evidence that the big bang happened differently, I'd change, but the religious would not. so #1 is iffy.\n\n#2 is a big no. There's atheists that think all sorts of crazy stuff. Lenin and Rand were polar opposites, and i don't consider myself a follower of either.\n\n#3 again we don't meet, nor do we have a body of agreed upon tenets, practices, rituals etc.\n\nSo like I said, while i do think we should have the same rights as religious people, atheists (if you must call me that) really are so because of a lack of belief, not a particular religion. You may not like that answer because you see the world as out to get you, but that's how it is.\n\nInterestingly enough, it is the grounds for what you demand - recognition of your views as being protected by the Gov't. See, otherwise the States COULD be those evil, nassty theocracies you imagine are lurking under every bed. If you don't know about it, you can research some history.\n\nWell, \"religion\" or not, those nasty theologies are always trying to weasel their way into our lives, into the laws, trying to tell others how to live their lives. Look at this thread. The whole thing was about a woman's right to hold dominion over her own body, and you a self-proclaimed \"true conservative\" won't even back her in that.\n\nYet you fail to recognize why people would object to a queer \"father figure\"?\n\nI'm not sure why it would need to come up....If there was a *** father in my son's troop, I'm not sure I'd know or care unless they made it an issue--or when there was a ceremony and the kid brought other dad. I don't see how it would affect anything really. I mean, if it weirds you out, let him bring his own tent. If i remember, the dads/scoutmasters all mostly had their own tents most of the time anyway--unless we were hiking somewhere where weight was an issue.\n\nPrecisely - so why would a Scoutmaster sneaking off into the woods with the Senior Patrol Leader somehow be less of an issue?\n\ni think you know why that would be different. but we're not talking about a pedophile. We're talking about a committed (married possibly depending on the state) *** man who adopted a child. He's not a pedophile. He just wants to be there with the kid, the way many dads don't get the chance.\n\nSee, we're back to \"terrible\". Why is it that not supporting queer proselytization is terrible?\n\nBecause you're assuming he's going to diddle the kids just because he's *** and your boss hit on you once.\n\nThat's also dishonest, as well as untrue. If you think there were no queer soldiers during my time in the Army, to say nothing of centuries previous, you're just deluding yourself. The whole point is to keep it in their pants and behind closed doors, which is precisely why the ACLU had to destroy it - anything to destroy U.S. cohesion, the ACLU has a good chance of endorsing.\n\nYes, there were gays in the military, i acknowledge that, but it's unfair that if they don't sneak around and hide it they get fired. that's wrong.\n\nIt would most definitely be grounds to keep them from running Scout units.\n\nAre you kidding me? You've got to be kidding me.\n\nBut why not take your claim to the logical grounds of polygamy?\n\nI don't have an issue with it in principle, but then i don't think the government should grant any benefits to being married at all. I'm not sure why the government is policing marriage. I do worry that some of those polygamists you hear about are cultists with all these young girls--but that's a different thread.\n\nRe: Ron Paul and Jessie Ventura?Re: Ron Paul and Jessie Ventura?\n\nOriginally Posted by krischanWell normally, when unemployment is high and people are feeling pinched economically, the sitting president doesn't do well. plus there was this big hubub about him spending too much etc. But I thin in this case, especially since the election is months and months away, i think we'll see Obama win another term unless he screws something up bad. Obama is proven to be good at running for office, and the tea party groundswell has tapered off.\n\nPlus, look at the political fights that have been going on in swing states. Wisconsin had the big mess with scott walker which superceded all the government running away and camping out in rockford. Wisconsin is a little more blue than red, but could have swung if walker hadn't mishandled his spending cuts.\n\nThere was a similar, but not quite as crazy mess in Ohio. People went crazy there and we all know how important Ohio is. The list goes on, but basically, the GOP have not managed their surge well. They could have taken the tea party thing to a new era of fiscal responsibility, but instead they spent much of their political capital on the debt ceiling debate. I don't think they came off winners there.\n\nNow coming bak to the social issues is another tactical mistake. All that's going to do is turn off the other half of the party. People who actually vote on the issues Jmerv and i have been going on about are always going to vote GOP, or stay home. they're easy to rile up because look how passionate they can be about something that affects them zero like abortion or *** rights. you can pretty much just count those votes now. What the GOP is in trouble of losing though is their support from the fiscal conservatives. If come election day the choice is between obama and someone that looks like they're going to spend about as much, then they are going to lose interest. Blame Bush2 for that I suppose. Sure Obama's record is worse, and that's good for a 30 spot, but i don't think romney is scoring points by going to detroit and saying wouldn't have bailed out the car companies (people from the mitten are crazy about the auto industry). He's going to let people think, well obama spent that money to save the economy. he's basically giving obama a pass on his spending, and that's a bad bad move for him.\n\nI'm a swing voter, i'm a little more republican leaning than democrat, but as I'm sure you've noticed, the positions republicans take on social issues is really...unsettling. I want a good fiscal conservative that's not going to turn the country into a theocracy. I'm thining I don't have one, so all i can do is ask is this guy going to have better foriegn policy than Obama? I'm not sure. Obama didn't do it all the way i would have, but he has been fairly successful in foreign policy.\n\nHe got UBL, and did it with a strike team. (he then proceeded to publicize the details about it which I'm not happy about)\nHe handled the egypt mess very well, spending very little to take out mubarak, and leading from behind the scenes so we dont look like we did with bush.\nHe's maintained pressure on Iran, and set us up to make some headway there. I don't know that it'll work, and then we'll have a tough question, but certainly the economic pressures are going to probably squeeze Ahmadinejad out of office. We'll see about the guy who seems to be primed to take his seat. I think he'll be a hardliner.\nI also like the handling of isreal. give them a little grief knocked them back to their place (they were over-reaching), but still willing to support them as an ally if iran gets a nuke. I think that was the right take. I'm not a big Isreal supporter, but as Jmerv has intoned, the muslims there are definitely worse.\n\nI'd still like some more work to be done on the chinese. there haven't been many tangible wins there, we've been talking about getting them to float their currency for years (longer than Obama has been around for sure) and all we've really ever gotten were steps towards where the market price would be. I do know that trumps negotiating tactic will not do well against the chinese. If i get a hint of that from one of our candidates it might give me some pause.\n\n...\n\nAnyway, i am sure I'm not the only swing voter thinking about these things. That's a lot of hoops to jump through to get a fiscal conservative. If I have to stomach their bad social policies, and potentially bad foreign policy, then Obama's weaknesses might not seem that bad. The GOP better wake up or their going to push themselves right out of relevancy, just when we need them the most. If they let Obama get another four years, and he doesn't fit their mold of the crazy spendthrift (and he won't because there won't be bailouts and stimuluses to do, plus as the economuy improves revenues will rise), then he'll come out looking all shiny and it won't be hard to pass the torch to the next dem. The GOP need to find out how to not marginalize themselves. The party needs to come into this century. I fear if they don't lighten up on the social issues, and better communicate their plans for debt reduction, we'll be stuck with an era of big spenders. You think it's bad now, just wait.\n\nRe: Ron Paul and Jessie Ventura?\n\nI can't believe they are actually starting to go down the social crusader road! I'm flabbergasted! It seemed like they had a pretty decent strategy harping on the economy and spending, although I think both of your impressions are right: Obama likely has 4 more coming his way unless something goes off the cliff. However, social conservative thinking has been losing ground by leaps and bounds over the last couple of decades. I can't believe they are trying to ride that! I thought Dems were masters of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, but perhaps the GOP is taking a stab at snatching catastrophe from the jaws of defeat? They have to drop this immediately, this isn't grandpa's electorate anymore. If they don't drop it, they could lose massively in the legislature. Furthermore, they have to drop this kinda stuff for the long haul, because the only people (en masse) who give a crap about these issues are going to be dead in 20-30 years and the GOP risks going into the ground with them.\n\nI don't think this will last though. I think they *generally* know better, the primary voters are just going back through their exes since Newt has trailed off. Republican operatives have admitted that since this recent war on women/sex has come up, their internal polling has shown independent women FLEEING the GOP. I don't think they are suicidal."}

If they do not dispose of the medical waste they create properly, it would cause them plenty of problems, maybe even force them to close. I have to assume that abortion clinic medical waste disposal is a small part of Stericycle's business, meaning they could easily refuse to service abortion clinics and not have any major affect on their bottom-line. There are no laws forcing Stericycle from refusing to service abortion clinics. If Stericycle refused to provide services to abortion clinics, it could cause lots of difficulties for the clinics. Alternately, Stericycle could have demanded that the abortion clinics it provides services to treat fetal remains as if they were fully human remains, which, I'm pretty sure they do not cart off to the incinerator willy-nilly. Stericycle, rightfully, treats aborted fetuses as \"less than\" human remains. This should not sit well with a pro-lifer who thinks all fetuses are fully human.\n\nAnonAmbientLight:1.

{"text": "Actually, that's fine if they want to call it evidence. Since people can't be evidence, it's their assertion that unborn fetuses aren't people.

However, given the language of the bill and Brown's staunch pro-life position, it is clear that her goal is to target abortion doctors to shut them down and put them behind bars.

Once the baby is born, mom can raise them in the slums without federal assistance or healthcare for all they care.\n\n mindysan33\n\nI don't know\u2026 I think I disagree about (some) of them not caring about women. I think you are right that they don't ACTUALLY care about women. I mean clearly they don't, especially if they are not virginal and white. And rich, don't forget rich (or at least upper middle class), as blueelm points out below. If they cared, they would listen. They would work to protect our rights. They don't do that. BUT I do think there is a subset, a rather large subset- who are activists, if only at the grassroots level \u2013 who thinks that anti-choice laws protect women \u2013 they really buy that stuff. In their mind, a liberated woman is an oppressed woman and we live in an age where the proper god ordained roles have been turned upside down, in all ways (the gender order, the racial order, the religious order, etc). As to their view of women, we are so weak and fragile, we need to be led down the proper path in life\u2026 Because god said so. It's like the people who try to convert atheist, not out of malice, but because they believe that they know best because god told them so in a book that was translated and retranslated to fit one political context or another\u2026\n\nNow, I agree that the politicians who pass these laws and many of the people who support them/vote them into office are deeply misogynistic and racist. All they care about is staying in their jobs and they do that by appealing to their base, some of whom are the people who craft this legislation\u2026 They also skate this fine line of racism, because they know they can get that vote by doing so.\n\nBut of course, none of these laws protect women. We all known that here. And of course, if you are rich, white and elite, the laws don't matter anyway, because there is a whole different reality you live in then, where you pretty much can do whatever.\n\nI don't know. The whole thing is depressing, whether people are passing these law out of \"trying to protect women\" from themselves or out of misogyny and racism.\n\nEDIT: FYI, not to say this is an excuse for them. No, in a way, I think this makes them all the worse. Because they are doing it because they think it is the right thing to do.\n\nIpo\n\nNew Mexico doesn't have white majority.

I can't figure out any other way to see it. And don't say they're just dumb and ignorant. \"Sufficiently advanced stupidity is indistinguishable from evil.\" Being that stupid is an explanation for why people do evil shit, but it's no more an excuse than, say, having too much testosterone is an excuse for being violent.\n\nPetzl\n\nIsn't it cool how anti-abortion republicans keep coming up with novel arguments that insult the intelligence and disgrace our humanity?

{"text": "No, Bei, everyone knows (except possibly you) when a fetus becomes a person. It becomes a person when it is born.\n\nSo it is NOT a party, and HAS no interests to be considered at any point during gestation.\n\nAren't I good at predicting the future? I think I am. I have a serious question for you, have you ever read the text of RvW or PPvC? It's hard for me to believe you have, because if you had you'd notice that both of those cases plainly state that the issue of fetal personhood is unresolvable.\n\n...And I'm not going to mention to you, yet again, how a ZEF is classified as a person in some states, as I've done that one before.\n\nRoe specifically said that a fetus was not a person under the fourteenth amendment. Not sure which websites you're readingBirth is the absolute bright line, Bei, the point at which a human fetus becomes a human life. At that point, it is vested with all rights. Before that, it is not.\n\nI don't believe women have any right to have a say in a male's reproductive choices. His are limited by biology. Don't like it? Speak to the guy in charge. Snip it or bag it.\n\n\"Choice\" is NOT granted by biology. Biology doesn't dictate a thing. \"Choice\" is granted by the law. Therefore, a man's \"choice\" is limited by what the law chooses (Hah!) to grant him in terms of \"rights\". A woman can make a man become a father against his will or prevent him from becoming a father against his wishes. Conversely, a man can't make a woman a mother if she doesn't want to be, nor can she stop her from becoming one. But, see, in your world, that's equitable.\n\nYou have a weird definition of equality.\n\nSex selection belongs to the female and she can decide (under ordinary circumstances) whether she is willing to accept sex with a male unwilling or incapable of impregnating her under those circumstances.\n\nlolwut? This makes little to no sense. No sense, actually.\n\nThe male can also ask a woman about her feelings on the issue of abortion, and not put himself into a position where 'his' fetus is likely to be aborted.\n\nBecause, you know, a woman isn't allowed to, nor never does, change her mind at a whim. Did you ever hear of the case where a married woman got mad at her husband, stormed out in anger and had an abortion to teach him a lesson?\n\nWhat he doesn't have the right to do is interfere with her right to decide whether or not she will bring a particular pregnancy to term. At all. Ever. It doesn't matter whether he is pressuring her TO abort or pressuring her NOT to abort. He is taking no physical risk in the pregnancy, and simply doesn't have a say in it.\n\nAnd, yet again, the majority of abortions are simply not done because of some type of \"risk\" to the mother's health. Everyone knows this, and continuing to state as much doesn't do anything for your argument except make you look totally dishonest. If an abortion is going to kill a woman or negatively impact her health, then she should be allowed to get an abortion regardless of the protests of another. But since the majority of abortion performed as outside of that then, no, it shouldn't be \"her decision\".\n\nI don't know how you feel about your mother or about your sister or about your girlfriend. Have you had the chat with her about her position on abortion? Since that IS your only option, you probably should.\n\nI know for a fact that my mom, my sister and my sorta' kinda' girlfriend are all pro-life. Just so you know. I have no idea about my grandmother, though.\n\n...And I love how you ignord the whole RvW and nine male justices thing\"Why wouldn't a woman report a rape?\" and sent to sea. All of this happened before medical tests came back showing that she'd been drugged. (That took several months, thanks, Navy!)\n\nThis is a case where I can see why a woman would have regretted reporting a rape, and which might discourage others from reporting assaults as well.\n\nSo, going back to the original discussion, if the law were that a woman must prove rape before she can have an abortion, it could easily have been too late for that to be a reasonable or viable optionFortunately, I DON'T feel that such a restriction is the appropriate way to address abortion, so I don't end up chasing my tail.You don YouWhen the time comes, I alone have to undergo labor and delivery, and perhaps undergo major abdominal surgery just to end the pregnancy. And then the young neonate is dependent upon me directly for nutrition for a year or more, and is a one of the most dependent young organisms in nature for another 18 years or more.\n\nIf I choose to do this, I do it because this intensive dependency is my best shot at getting my genetic code into the next generation. Mothering is built into the mammalian reproductive strategy. 'Fathering' beyond the sperm donation is an afterthoughtBiologically, that's where we stand.\n\nHowever, legally, women are being considered independent beings with rights, darn them, in this brave new Constitutional world. And they get to say no to sex, and no to pregnancy, tooRoe specifically said that a fetus was not a person under the fourteenth amendment. Not sure which websites you're reading.\n\nI see your reading skills are as good as ever. Care to find me where I said that Roe said that the fetus was a person under the 14th Amendment. No? Didn't think so, because everyone knows that the courts decided that the usage of the word \"person\" in the Constitution couldn't be applied pre-natally (Which is the same rationale by which Dred Scott decision came down under, but we've over this before). What I said was that the courts decided that the issue of fetal personhood was unresolvable, and as a result the state could not impose restrictions on abortion throughout a pregnancy.\n\n.\n\nThe issue of personhood is left up to the invidual to determine. That's the basis (Well, that and the whole privacy thing) upon which legalized abortion rests. Seriously nowWow... No. Just no. Why do you argue stuff if you don't know what you're arguing. It's maddeningOh... My... Friggin'... God.\n\nWhat am I typing stuff out for if you're not going to read it? I'm going to use one of my favorite phrases: \"What the F?\". See, this is why I twitch. In our system, persons are entitled to protection from being killed and from other forms of private violence. Prior to Roe v. Wade and dating back to the 14th Amendment, the word \"person\" had been used to denote a \"human being\". Therefore, the only way for the courts to deny ZEF's such protections afforded to all humans was to presupposes that they weren't persons, thus creating a distinction between \"person\" and \"human being\" where no distinction existed prior. So, of course the courts didn't have to answer the question of \"When does life begin?\" in so many words, as it merely sidestepped that issue and created two new classes of humans (Human persons and non-human persons) where previously all humans were persons.\n\nDidn't I say this once before? Yes, I think I did and I'll probably have to say it ten or so more times.\n\n...Oh, and I'm just going to point out that by the time the 13th Amendment was ratified, more states and territories had bans or restrictions on abortions than did states which had outlawed slavery. To say they've never had recognition under the law as persons is poppycock. To say that they've never had recognition under the law as full persons is even more poppycock, as the courts make no effort to define what constitutes a full person.\n\n...And, just to throw this out there, the \"compelling interest\" is whether or not a fetus will be able to live a meaningful life. Yeah... Guess what concept that is most commonly attached toDear God. No. I am so sick and tired of you saying this, because it's still not correct no matter how many times you state this. It's entirely impossible for someone to simply \"not get it\". Entirely. It defies all logic. So, let me state this again:\n\nFETAL HOMICIDE LAWS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MOTHER.\n\nUnderstand? I don't know how many times I've said this, but I've said it enough times to the point where it's becoming ridiculous. All fetal homicide laws have an exception for abortion. This is a \"No, duh!\" thing. However, what you FAIL to address, even though I've pointed it on an ungodly number of times now, is that a woman can be prosecuted under fetal homicide laws for killing her own fetus as can anyone else. They do not exempt women. Jeezuz. This isn't hard to understand. Like... At all. It's incredibly super simple. The only way to not understand is to want to not understand.\n\nDo you remember when you went and tried to link to that site entitled something like \"Mother-fetal conflicts\"? Obviously not, 'cuz you've forgotten what's written there.\n\nBirth is the absolute bright line, Bei, the point at which a human fetus becomes a human life. At that point, it is vested with all rights. Before that, it is not.\n\nI don't even know how you can type these things out in good faith. A \"human fetus\" is always a \"human life\". Yeah... Shocking, I know. But, hey, facts shouldn't get in the way of ideology, right?What year is this? ...Yeah, that's what I thought. What year was I born? ...Yeah, that's what I thought. What does past history have to do with me? ...Yeah, that's what I thought.\n\nWho says women can't be sexist? Obviously, you prove that they can be. And, since you want to mention changing times, fewer and fewer people believe unrestricted abortions to be a \"right\". Doesn't that make you feel good? It makes me feel good. I 'spose we'll just have to wait for the super-abortion supportive (Relatively speaking) generations of the 50, 60's and 70's to start dying off.\n\nOh, and biology doesn't dictate anything. That's the realm of the law. How many times am I going to have to state this?\n\nYou don\n\n???\n\nYouYeah... This is so wrong on so many levels, I don't even know where to begin. \"You\" don't do jack squat. \"Your body\" doesn't even do that much, aside from providing someplace for the ZEF to gestate. Hell, you don't even need to go out of your way to accomodate a ZEF, as a ZEF is responsible for mainting it's own internal equlibrium and development (Seriously. Learn what homeostasis is. It's pissing me off how you continue to misuse a term). The only way a ZEF will start negatively impacting your nutrional health is if you go out of your way to change your eating habits, at which point it'll start \"stealing\" calcium from your bone and teeth, for example (Actually, I think your body will divert these minerals to the ZEF. I'm not sure).\n\nWhen the time comes, I alone have to undergo labor and delivery, and perhaps undergo major abdominal surgery just to end the pregnancy.\n\nAnd...? That's due to an enlarged cranium.\n\nAnd then the young neonate is dependent upon me directly for nutrition for a year or more...\n\n100% false. And I'm surprised you can even type this out with any manner of seriousness.\n\n...and is a one of the most dependent young organisms in nature for another 18 years or more.\n\nIt's not dependant on *you*. That's something you totally fail to address.\n\nIf I choose to do this, I do it because this intensive dependency is my best shot at getting my genetic code into the next generation. Mothering is built into the mammalian reproductive strategy.\n\n'Fathering' beyond the sperm donation is an afterthought.\n\nReally? Because, you know, humans are unique among primates in that the men are actually invested in raising their children. Just thought I'd throw that out there for you, since we're talking about biologyThis argument AGAIN?!?!?! Logic would then dictate that no women would ever have an abortion, then, because it could be their one-- How did you put it-- \"Bite into the apple\". Why would a woman have an abortion when she doesn't know whether or not she'll ever become pregnant again?\n\n...Yeah. Think about that.\n\nBiologically, that's where we stand.\n\nYour continued misuse of biology and using biology to try to rationalize abortion is appalling, to put it mildly.\n\nHowever, legally, women are being considered independent beings with rights, darn them, in this brave new Constitutional world. And they get to say no to sex, and no to pregnancy, too.\n\nYou want to say no to sex and pregnancy? Then don't engage in sex and you won't have to worry about getting pregnant. What you fail to point out, is that some women don't just want to say 'no' to pregnancy-- They want to say 'no' to potential motherhood and it be considered a right, while simultaneously arguing that any man who wants to say 'no' to potential fatherhood to a deadbeat and/or loser who should of kept his legs closed.\n\nIt makes sense when you think about it. Not really, but it does in your worldBecause, you know, what happens is that a woman will just say no to a child during pregnancy, thus meaning she'll never get to the \"once a child is born\" part. The man, on the other hand, has no such recourse. Would it surprise me that the male is the one who typically wants to back out when the baby is born? No. Why? Because he's given no \"choice\" before the baby is born, unlike the womanBut that's why they're considered anecdotal. Because they do not constitute the majority, or even a significant, portion of all cases. You can find a fringe occurrence for anything. and sent to sea. All of this happened before medical tests came back showing that she'd been drugged. (That took several months, thanks, Navy!)\n\n.\n\n...And ugh GHB stays in the system for a few hours and gets flushed pretty quickly. I'm fairly sure that after a 3+ weeks it'd be impossible to tell if someone was drugged or not.\n\nThis is a case where I can see why a woman would have regretted reporting a rape, and which might discourage others from reporting assaults as well.\n\nI can't. As I said, if you don't report a rape, then you make things harder on yourself. Those women who don't want to report being raped inevitably makes things harder on themselves. If you're unwilling to speak up about being raped, then you're going to have to accept the (Unforunate) consequences of not coming foward.\n\nSo, going back to the original discussion, if the law were that a woman must prove rape before she can have an abortion, it could easily have been too late for that to be a reasonable or viable option.\n\nAnyone who reports a rape is given emergency contraceptives, which significantly diminish the risk of becoming pregnant. This is why I said one should report being raped immediately after it happens-- It reduces the chance of her becoming pregnant or opting for an abortionStatistically speaking, rape accounts for a very small percentage of total pregnancies (A quick search neted me figures from less than 1% up to 4.7%) and a very small portion of total abortions done (Less than .05%), and health concerns another 4%. So it's not as if we're talking about a huge number of women here. But, anyway, as I said earlier, anyone who reports a rape is given emergency contraceptives. Furthermore, all anyone who wants an abortion in cases of health concerns would need would be the written diagnosis of two or more independent doctors (Which is what you need now for a late term abortion). I don't see what's so \"heinous\" about that.\n\nFortunately, I DON'T feel that such a restriction is the appropriate way to address abortion, so I don't end up chasing my tail.\n\nLa\n\nGuaranteed the abortion rate would go way down (This is because 92%'ish of all abortions are purely elective).\n\nSorry, Bei, for some reason \"quote\" isn't working, so I have to do this manually.\n\n\"But that's why they're considered anecdotal. Because they do not constitute the majority, or even a significant, portion of all cases. You can find a fringe occurrence for anything.\"\n\nOnly a very small percentage of the population of this country is blind, or Sufi, has last names that consist of a single letter or is severely allergic to peanuts. But we still try hard not to pass laws that make life difficult for them. In fact, we sometimes go out of our way to pass laws to protect them.\n\n\".\"\n\nAre you this judgemental about everything? Do you favor denying medical care to people who don't wear seatbelts? If someone doesn't discover a theft for a few weeks, does that mean they can't press charges?\n\n\"...And ugh GHB stays in the system for a few hours and gets flushed pretty quickly. I'm fairly sure that after a 3+ weeks it'd be impossible to tell if someone was drugged or not\"\n\nSorry my writing was unclear. Th sample was taken fairly quickly - she felt horrible the next day and ended up in the infirmary, but the results took quite a while to come back.\n\nSo, I have an additional question for you: I'm assuming from your position that you would like to see the number of abortions drop. Why is that? Do you believe that life begins at conception? Or do you have some other reason for the position?"}
{"text": "Menu\n\nthe war continues\n\nThe Arizona Senate has just passed a bill that immunizes doctors from lawsuits arising from withholding information on pre-natal problems that \"could lead to a decision to have an abortion\". There's just no end to this shit;\n\nThe Arizona Senate has approved a bill that would shield doctors and others from so-called \"wrongful birth\"\" to proceed.\n\nIf the bill becomes law, Arizona would join nine states barring both \"wrongful life\" and \"wrongful birth\" lawsuits.\n\nWrongful birth is a legal cause of action in some common law countries in which the parents of a congenitally diseased child claim that their doctor failed to properly warn of their risk of conceiving or giving birth to a child with serious genetic or congenital abnormalities.[1] Thus, the plaintiffs claim, the defendant prevented them from making a truly informed decision as to whether or not to have the child. Wrongful birth is a type of medical malpractice tort. It is distinguished from wrongful life, in which the child sues the doctor.\n\nFirst of all, who gets to interpret the bit about \"could lead to the decision to have an abortion\"? What qualifies? Are we really wanting doctors legally protected from not disclosing the results of amniocentesis or AFP screening? We're talking here about a doctor withholding information, not about medical mistakes. So a doctor could deliberately neglect to mention a positive indication for, say, spina bifida, and not be legally liable?\n\nIt's brilliant. If people making informed decisions don't make the \"right\" choice there's a simple enough remedy; withhold that pesky information and remove any legal recourse.\n\nThat's an interesting concept of Freedom\u00ae, and an even stranger one of Morality\u2122.\n\nThis is the year 2012, I just checked. You know, in case you were wondering.\n\n35 Responses to the war continues\n\nI've tried to come up with a humorous snark about this one, to start the day right. I can't.\n\nThis tells us several things.\n\n1. Conservative women can be just as nasty and toxic as the men, if not worse. That plastic-wands-up-the-vag bill, written deliberately to force such procedures, came from a female state senator too, in Virginia. And the same woman is floating another bill to allow parents to opt out of Gardasil injections, on the grounds that immunization against that virus \"encourages sexual behavior in teens.\"\n\n2. Arizona is a creepy place to live. Plus, it contains all three of my brothers-in-law, two of whom are OK, but one not. It is on my list of states to Never Live Within, ever. They get up to really ugly shit in Phoenix. Remember Evan Meachum? They recalled that Governor, and may recall the current one also.\n\n3. This bill will not stand under challenge in the courts. Withholding information for such a purpose, to discourage something that is legal, is so wrong that some judge will throw it out as contrary to public interest.\nOr, it will lead to some smug asshole doctors being shot. Real serious rage can arise from cases like this, with decades of consequences for the families who were denied the information they needed to make their own choices.\n\n4. When the hell did the so-called \"conservatives\" become so hostile to freedom?\n\nThis becomes more frightening by the week. Are there any other medical tests where doctors are given specific legal authorization to withhold the results from patients? Any test, anywhere, in any state?\n\nIs there any state law giving doctors the right to withhold the results of biopsies so as to prevent a terminally ill patient from possibly making the choice to commit suicide?\n\nPutting aside whether a doctor who deliberately neglected to tell a woman things like this could be sued- He or she would be struck off immediately. It would violate medical ethics big time. And state legislatures do NOT get to define medical ethics.\n\nBack in the country again. A quick search indicates that most wrongful birth suits arise from claims that the doctor or lab failed to diagnose an issue with the fetus, not that the doctor lied about what he learnt in an effort to prevent an abortion. In fact, just Googling around, I didn't find an instance of a suit where it was claimed that the doctor deliberately withheld information, just suits that alleged negligence in failing to diagnose an adverse circumstance. Perhaps someone else will find a case of deliberate lying.\n\nCertainly there are arguments out there that this law would shield a doctor from liability in the event of lying, clearly an ethics violation, but it is probably questionable that the AZ law provides such protection. Note that attorneys would probably prefer to file a negligence suit as the costs of the suit beyond the deductible and any settlement would be paid by malpractice insurance companies. Lying would not be covered by such insurance and would need to be defended at the doctor's or hospital's own cost. Regular incidents or accusations of lying would certain damage any doctor's reputation and perhaps also cause his insurance premiums to increase greatly.\n\nThe encouragement of lying appears to be a straw man argument. More to the point is the argument of whether the birth of a child with Downs or other adverse conditions is such an unfortunate circumstance that failure to diagnose it means that caring for their financial needs should be born by the doctor. It is probably not easy to definitively prove that the mother would have aborted the fetus as the case is occurring years after the birth.\n\nIf we are going to stray into straw man territory, abortion clinics in Bellingham, WA have long been notorious for catering to Vancouver, BC's east Indian and Chinese communities preference for sons to daughters. A Canadian Medical Association Journal editorialized last month:\n\nShould female feticide in Canada be ignored because it is a\nsmall problem localized to minority ethnic groups? No.\nSmall numbers cannot be ignored when the issue is about\ndiscrimination against women in its most extreme form. This\nevil devalues women. How can it be curbed? The solution is\nto postpone the disclosure of medically irrelevant information\nto women until after about 30 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nResearch in Canada has found the strongest evidence\nof sex selection at higher parities if previous children were\ngirls among Asians \u2014 that is people from India, China,\nKorea, Vietnam and Philippines.2 What this means is that\nmany couples who have two daughters and no son selectively\nget rid of female fetuses until they can ensure that their thirdborn\nchild is a boy.\n\nSo, if we're battling the culture wars, where do we draw the line to say that having a baby with conditions either unpalatable or difficult for the parent that failure to diagnose it is an event to which someone could be held liable? I can just imagine holding some doctor liable for a girl's dowry.\n\nA quick search indicates that most wrongful birth suits arise from claims that the doctor or lab failed to diagnose an issue with the fetus, not that the doctor lied about what he learnt in an effort to prevent an abortion.\n\nYes, I found that also.\nWhich begs the question why the \"need\" for the law, and why the wording \"that could lead to a decision to have an abortion\"\nYou're raising points which don't address the whole thrust of the piece, which is that these legislators are trying to whittle away the \"informed\" part of \"informed consent\"\nWhat else can we reasonably conclude as an underlying motive?\n\nwelcome home btw. You haven't missed much, except the Limbaugh debacle, which was long overdue anyway.\n\nTommydog is right, there haven't been any suits (so far) involving a doctor who knowingly refused to pass on diagnosis of birth defects.\n\nBut as Kev points out, why then the law? Negligent diagnosis, if proved, is negligent diagnosis, whether of a fetus's defects or cancer or a dissected aorta.\n\nIs it a straw man argument to suppose that a fundy doctor (and there are a few around) might start hiding behind the statute and telling expectant mums all is well?\n\nSeems pretty far fetched. And I still think if a doc did that he would be struck off quicker than you can say 'sanctity of life'. In any state in the union.\n\nI believe there are a number of states where 'wrongful life' suits are not allowed in cases where the child is healthy just not expected. Such as when an operation to tie off a woman's tubes (or a man's for that matter) is botched and ineffective.\n\nBut if a diagnosis of something hideous IS missed, negligently, then the doctor has broken trust with the patient. Tommydog might well ask, 'Which patient'? And that is when we get to the crux of the matter.\n\nBecause this law is really about pushing the agenda of giving the full rights of a fully fledge human being to a fetus. Through the back door. They know it and we know it too. Hence the (legitimate I would say) outrage.\n\nThough I certainly wouldn't dream of doing it myself, I don't feel I have a right to tell any woman anywhere that she can't abort any fetus inside her own body, for whatever reason she may have, during the first and second trimesters. Including sex. I wouldn't want to be a party to that if I was a doctor, either, or in any other capacity, but if we are serious about where the balance lies between the mother's interests and the potential human life in her womb, and I for one am, utterly, then aborting female fetuses because they are the wrong sex has to be included in that.\n\nOf course, if you believe in the invisible hand, if too many women abort females, then female babies will in their (strange to my eyes) view will soon be worth more than males. And the numbers will balance out.\n\n\" if we are serious about where the balance lies between the mother's interests and the potential human life in her womb, and I for one am, utterly, then aborting female fetuses because they are the wrong sex has to be included in that.\"\n\nBusy and off to the grind in a minute \u2013 but agree with that, and want to add that if you want to get into allowing abortion for some reasons, but not for others, how are you going to handle this then? Drag a woman into a court of law where it can be decided if her reasons for aborting are good enough? Let alone the time factor in getting a case scheduled, costs, etc.\n\nDid see an article a few days ago about the UK \u2013 it seems that aborting for gender reasons is illegal. They did some sting operations, but i still think that legally it's a toughie.\n\nWhy the need for the law? It gets down to an argument that if a fetus is diagnosed to have Downs or other disability, are we prepared to say that an abortion is the recommended course of action \u2013 furthermore, that if someone isn't offered that choice based on a misdiagnoses (not lying \u2013 an error) has that person been damaged? One can certainly sympathize with the family and the child without agreeing that the doctor's error caused damages as opposed to life just sometimes deals out unfair hands. To think that they did cause damages is to basically say that abortion is preferable (preferable, mind you, not a reasonable option but preferable). If you don't agree with that, then it is logical to advocate protecting doctors from such suits.\n\nDo I think some politicians think this might encourage doctors to lie? Possibly, but that would be an ethical breach. If it could be proved I doubt this law protects the doctor from suit or other disciplinary action.\n\nI don't know, Tommy. If I am pregnant and I go to a doctor who claims to be a competent specialist, and he does a test and tells me (negligently) I have a healthy baby, and then I give birth to a severely damaged child, and it turns out that any competent doctor who looked at the same information produced by the test could have told me that my fetus was severely damaged, then I can't see how the doctor did NOT harm me by his negligence, IF -and it does matter- I would have aborted the fetus had I known it was severely damaged.\n\nIn that scenario how has his negligence not harmed me?\n\nI'm in no way saying abortion is preferable in all cases, I'm saying that in MY case, if I had known what he claimed he had the expertise to tell me (and I relied on his assertions, reasonably, and his diagnosis was negligent) I would have aborted. It would have been MY preference, and I have that right to choose.\n\nIt wouldn't be the same case, of course, if the diagnosis was not clear cut, if another competent doctor in my place wouldn't have been just as fooled\u2026 But I was clearly negligent, then that's my story, not all stories.\n\nIf you were an architect and you hired and engineer to design the support system for the roof of a hall you were building, and he did it incompetently, you would sue him. Not because a roof fit for service is 'preferable', but because you were harmed by his incompetence. Why should the principle of liability here be any different?\n\nWell, I suppose it does y'all credit that you try to look at this as if there might be more to it than chapter 19 of Sarah's They Tried To Make Me Abort Trig saga and maybe chapter 12 of Frothy\"s Abortion Is The New Eugenics Oh Yes Oh Yes It Is. But that's really all there is, so I'll just check back in when it's over.\n\nHi, Dog. Anybody tell you about the new \"argue with Madame Max and Pornamy in the same day, buy the site a round\" fine yet? It's brutal. Me, I'd never have figured Bluthner for a single malt guy.\n\nBack to this insufferable legislation in AZ: if they do not intend to encourage lying to pregnant women, then there is no need for this piece of crap. And there was no need to pass this as a statute, already, in nine other states.\n(The article does not say, but I think we can guess which states those are, to a high probability.)\n\nAnd this also blurs the line as to whom is the \"patient\", thanks for that catch Bluthner, it is the same point being hammered upon with these \"personhood\" initiatives too. Women are to be considered, if pregnant, to be merely the vessels of other persons, from the point of fertilization onwards. So why not lie to them too?\n\nThe real point here, regarding the doctor and the living female pregnant patient, is informed consent. We all have a right to whatever information a professional has that pertains to a vital interest of ours, if we are their patient or client. Withholding information is wrong, period, especially if the purpose is to manipulate the choices and decisions of the patient or client.\n\nAs an engineer, if I hid vital information from a client then I would be in serious trouble.\n\nI am now working into a position in a building inspection outfit, in which we produce reports for parties who are about to purchase or renovate a building, home or commercial. The sellers never want us to disclose everything we find, of course, but we have to. Honesty is the only defense, the only legitimate path to take.\n\nFailure to catch something that a professional should be expected to catch is negligence. That is not at question. The question is one of damages. In the case of the faulty roof design, assuming it was caught before it collapsed, your damages are limited to repair costs and possibly some other items such as loss of income if it delayed the functional use of the building. You do not get a whole new building.\n\nIn the case of a misdiagnosis in a situation for which there is no cure, are there damages? You can only say their are if you consider abortion to be the preferred course of action and that it's the doctor's fault they they are now stuck raising a child they would rather not. The whole reason abortion is controversial is that many people consider that murder and fail to see the damages.\n\nKevin, I don't believe this law would protect doctors from legal or disciplinary action for lying. Interestingly, the law proposed by the Canadian medical journal cited above would mandate not telling mothers \"medically irrelevant\" (ie, the child's sex) until 30 weeks.\n\nI have a cousin who was brain damaged in a difficult birth. She's not hopeless, but definitely in Forrest Gump territory. She was always a part of life when we all got together. I appreciate more now that it was a trial for my aunt and uncle, but she was always loved. In her case, there probably actually was negligence on the part of the doctor who delivered her.\n\nIt gets down to an argument that if a fetus is diagnosed to have Downs or other disability, are we prepared to say that an abortion is the recommended course of action\u2026\n\nAgain, no, it comes down to whether the WOMAN WHO IS PREGNANT is prepared to say that an abortion is the recommended course of action. The distinction in huge.\n\nIn any suit for damages of course she would have to prove that she would not have carried the fetus to term if she had known.\n\nNo one here is saying that when severely damaged fetuses are brought to term and become human beings they don't bring good things into the world. At all. But if a woman wants to make a choice whether or not to take on that kind of burden, and some doctor lies to her because he thinks his duty is to the fetus rather than to the woman- That's wrong. And should be actionable at law, no holds barred.\n\nMost everyone here has concurred that the AZ law probably would not protect any doctor from deliberately lying or at least facing professional disciplinary action. Deliberate lying is an ethical breach in any profession.\n\nHowever, the suits that have arisen allege negligence not lying. Some examples include failure to notice deformities in an ultrasound image, accidentally extracting and testing tissue sample from the mother rather than the fetus, or even having taken samples from the fetus that did not reflect a Downs chromosome with the defense having been that not all cells had the extra chromosome. I can certainly see the logic for an action if a doctor failed to diagnose a condition that could be treated while the baby was still in the womb, but what about circumstances where there is no curative treatment and the failure to diagnose it is accidental?\n\nAs far as I can tell, there have not been wrongful birth suits that allege lying on the part of the doctor to discourage an abortion. YourYourI believe you are confounding two very important and completely separate issues.\n\nNo one is discussing a case where the failure to detect the problem with the fetus was 'accidental' (not a legal term at all, by the way). Either it was negligent or it wasn't. If it wasn't negligent, in other words if it did not violate the standard of medical practice and expertise that the woman, or any woman in her place in this time and place, could reasonably expect, then there clearly could be no damages.\n\nBut if the diagnosis was negligent, or reckless, or in fact a lie, then the doctor has done the WOMAN a wrong. Not the fetus, the woman. She is the one who collects, not the fetus. Because she is the one who will have suffered.\n\nI'm a trained lawyer, I know very well what an Act of God is in the law. A negligent diagnosis is NEVER an act of God. Ever. Not once.\n\nThe malformation of the fetus IS something that might be called, in legal terms, an act of God, but the harm caused to the woman is NOT caused by the malformation of the fetus. It is caused by the doctor's failure to live up to the standards of medical practice to which he is sworn to uphold. No one is suggesting holding the doctor responsible for the malformation of the fetus. All we are saying is that the doctor is responsible for his own standard of practice, which includes diagnosis.\n\nIt would be the same if a doctor failed, negligently, to diagnose a cancer in your body, even though you went to him in time to remove it and be free of disease, and then later it develops into a cancer that cannot be removed or cured. That doctor would be responsible to you for hefty damages. But no one would be holding him responsible for you getting cancer, he would merely be responsible for his negligent failure to diagnose what any competent doctor should have diagnosed.\n\nBluthner\nI didn't know you were a lawyer. I've merely been in too many lawsuits. I think, however, that your difference here is one I alluded to above, failure to diagnose a treatable disease, which is what the cancer situation would be. That could also apply to failure to diagnose, for example, a heart condition in a fetus that could be treated. However, many abnormalities are not treatable. If that circumstance is not diagnosed through negligence (which is often a result of error or accident whether a legal term or not), how is the woman damaged? What is the damage? Is the doctor responsible to contribute to the extra cost of caring for the child? How do we conclude that unless we accept that the preferred course of action is an abortion.\n\nI did not say that negligence was an Act of God, I said that the abnormality in the fetus was as you noted above. And I am not supported negligence, lying, or slacking off on standard protocols. But I have had to spec out what my damages were in a lawsuit, and they usually come down to additional costs incurred and lost profits, with the latter being harder to argue as possibly they were just deferred. In my experience they have to quantifiable and justifiable. Here, what are the parent's damages?\n\nYou continue to posit that 'we all' have to decide that abortion is the preferable option. I think you are willfully avoiding the the very idea that what WE fell about the matter makes no difference. It all comes down to what the woman carrying the fetus feels. If SHE is of the opinion that abortion in the case of a damaged fetus is preferable, and the diagnosis is negligently botched, then SHE has been harmed. Nothing to do with what the rest of us feel, think, judge, believe, want, hope for. It's HER decision. It's HER body. The fetus is NOT a human life, by any measure except religious fantasy. If she doesn't share that religious fantasy, then no one has any right to tell her otherwise. She has asked a doctor a question. He has represented himself as a skilled technician. If he screws up the diagnosis, then he has made a mistake that SHE has to pay for. Why on earth shouldn't he have to make good her loss?\n\nBluthner. Well, we're going around in circles. The clear point is that huge numbers of people disagree with abortion rights. While I don't think many seriously advocate doctors lying, they are not convinced that if an error is made in diagnosis that a human birth, even a deformed one, constitutes an actionable event against the doctor. Nine states have taken steps to make that the case. I'll hazard a guess that there will be more.\n\n\"Huge numbers of people disagree with abortion rights\", but the reality is, Roe vs. Wade is established law in the US and many other nations have even more liberal standards. The clear finding in RvW, confirmed in the Webster case, is the standard of viability outside the woman carrying the fetus. That is the point where the law recognizes that there is a separate interest that deserves protection of the law.\n\nThe extremist position that is now being advanced, with active help from the GOP is to define a \"person\" as initiated at the instant of fertilization. This is an absurdity. There are many bad things that would result from such a standard.\n\nOne Last time: legally, the actionable event is NOT the birth of a deformed child. The actionable event is the negligent diagnosis. You are confounding the two very separate things, and I kinda think now you are doing it on purpose. Even the people who are writing these laws understand that. Which is why the laws state that a negligent diagnosis of a deformed child can no longer be an actionable event. Which is in short, scandalous.\n\nIt would be exactly analogous to a situation where a bunch of people in some state took up a new strange religion that worshiped cancer. Cancer is alive, they say, it has a soul of its own from the moment atopsis fails in the first cell. Therefore if you have cancer you have no right to remove it from your body, because we worship it. And then they pass a law that says if a doctor fails to diagnose a cancer in your body, however negligent his failure was, you have no recourse against him.\n\nBluthner. You're a lawyer. She is not entitled to damages unless you can convince the jury that she was damaged by the negligent diagnosis. To convince them that she was damaged you have to convince the jury not only that she would have an abortion had she known but that she would have been better off having had the abortion. That requires a level of acceptance on the part of the jury that abortion would have been the preferred outcome. They could readily see it as simply an Act of God and their belief could well be that she should have carried the baby to term whether she knew of the deformity or not.\n\nA pregnant woman went to a doctor to find out if her fetus was healthy.\n\nThat the doctor tested the fetus and then negligently told her it was healthy when any competent doctor would clearly have been able to tell that it wasn't.\n\nThat she relied on the diagnosis and brought the child to term.\n\nThat if she had been told the correct diagnosis she would have aborted the damaged fetus.\n\nAnd that as a result of now having to bring up a damaged child, she will incur costs that she would not have incurred if the child had been healthy.\n\nThat's it. All pretty straightforward points, and not impossibly difficult to prove, or disprove.\n\nThe jury doesn't have to decide that she would have been better off having the abortion. All they have to decide is has she incurred extra costs -and I would include her own pain and suffering- for being burdened with a damaged child (which she never would have brought to term if she had known) above and beyond the the normal burdens and costs of a healthy child.\n\nJust to be clear, again: the fact that the child is damages could be considered and act of God, in legal terms, yes. But the negligent diagnosis was an act of a human being, and one that caused damage. You simply refuse to stop confounding the two completely distinct issues. A court of law would not make that mistake.\n\nI would just like to point out that if the possibility of abortion were not going to be considered, why have the prenatal testing at all? For conditions that CANNOT be repaired in utero?\n\nThe fact that prenatal testing is now routine, that almost all pregnant women (who intend to go through with the pregnancy) undergo it, is in itself an acceptance BY SOCIETY as well as by doctors and patients, that abortion is a reasonable option if the tests show serious problems.\n\nBluthner. I follow you sequence up until the end. Is that how a jury would decide? If they held strong moral beliefs against abortion, they could easily decide not. What you are not accepting is that to many people this is murder. You may try to mitigate against that in jury selection, but that will be easier in some parts of the country than others. Many people would not see your argument as being much different than psychiatric testing an 11 year and saying they have a predisposition toward teenage drug use and juvenile delinquency and that a couple of taps to the noggin with a .45 will save the parent a lot of grief and expense. I realize you will say that that is an absurd comparison. What you are fighting is that to a little of people the situations are analogous.\n\nI've been through civil litigation through trial and verdict. I've given up thinking I know how juries or judges may respond to arguments. The capriciousness and expense of the trial system is why so many business contracts are written to mandate mediation followed by mandatory arbitration.\n\nEvery civil suit before a jury runs the (generally very low) risk of jury nullification. I'm betting that the people trying to pass these idiotic laws don't feel at all confident in juries seeing their point of view. Or else they wouldn't see a need to try to foist their sectarian views upon the general population"}
{"text": "Every sexual encounter does not lead to pregnancy, but every sexual encounter leads to the possibility of pregnancy. Period.\n\nWhat is surprisingly helpful is Carroll's thoughts as to why someone would espouse a position that is so clearly untrue:\n\nSo why would someone say such a thing? While it's hard to get into the mind of another individual, we can guess. This line of reasoning isn't new. It's been used for the most part to delegitimize the idea that exceptions to abortion prohibitions should exist for rape. After all, if you really believe that abortion is the taking of a human life, then it's hard to suggest that there is any rationalization for it at all. While ethically consistent, this belief is rare in the United States. Even among those who oppose abortion, most people support exceptions for rape and incest.\n\nIt's hard for a politician who firmly opposes abortion to square this. Such a person wants the support of a majority of people but doesn't want to compromise principles. One option, then, is to find a way to make the occurrence of the problem nonexistent. If pregnancy from rape doesn't happen, then we don't need exceptions in the law.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that such pregnancies do occur. More than 31,000 of them happen in America every year. Pretending they don't by listening to a few anecdotes won't make them go away.\n\nThis is what happens when reality gets in the way of our moral convictions. Life is tricky. It's nuanced and complicated and often fraught with contradictions. Contrary to what you read, most people don't have black and white views of abortion. Few believe that it should be prohibited when it might save the life of a mother. Few believe that it should be allowed a week before a fetus is full-term. In other words, relatively few people believe abortion should never be legal, and few believe it should always be legal.\n\nThis places abortion in the gray zone. That doesn't work well for elections. It also doesn't make for clean philosophical discussions. It certainly doesn't make for good sound bites.\n\nPerhaps Carroll's points can lead us towards some non-soundbyte conversations about the ethics around abortion (without mangling facts). What are the parameters that most people agree on? What role does sex education and birth control play? What (if anything) should be legislated as reasonable restrictions concerning abortion while honoring the autonomy of the individual woman who must remain in control of her own body?\n\nThe problem with the discussion is that there are only two relevant view points which are then informing everything else.\n\nThe \"liberal\" view point is that the issue is PRIMARILY or even ENTIRELY about woman's rights to her own body.\n\nThe \"conservative\" view point is that the issue is PRIMARILY or even ENTIRELY about the life of an unborn child.\n\nDiscussion about rape and incest (which account for a tiny percentage of abortions) and the physical health of the mother (also a tiny percentage) obscure the primary issue- a disagreement over fundamentals.\n\nIf you think that the unborn child is exactly that- a human being, a child- there is no reasonable way to justify abortion, even in the supposed moral dilemmas of rape, incest, or health of the mother. That is: how many sane and moral mothers would kill their (born) children in order to save their own life? Or how many sane and moral people would see a newborn baby in a hospital nursery and, upon hearing that the child was the product of horrendous violence, decide \"this one has less right to live than all the others here.\"\n\nIf you think that an unborn child is a child, than there is no debate- there is only the staggering tragedy of 50 million children having been murdered legally in the United States.\n\nIf you DON'T think that a unborn child is really child, that it is a soulless mass of cells or that it has no value until you've met it in person, then abortion is not only justifiable but also extremely convenient.\n\nI can't understand why this is treated as a new issue (yes, intra-uterine photography and neo-natal care have advanced markedly is the past few decades). The writers of the Hebrew Bible were aware of the concept of \"quickening\": a time before when the conceptus was NOT considered human, and a time after when humanity was at least presumptive.\n\nIt still makes sense in terms of trimesters. MOST elective abortions are sought in the first trimester. While it's not as desirable a situation as preventing an unwanted pregnancy (medically), I really don't understand why people of faith need concern ourselves from a moral POV.\n\nIn the second and third trimesters, abortions are sought less and less frequently, and are almost ALWAYS related to the health of the fetus, the health of the mother, or both.\n\nNo, abortion is NOT primarily a moral issue. The attempt to BAN ABORTIONS, is. If one believes that women are fully Imago Dei: Anathema!\n\nIt would have bee nice to know who Dr. Aaron E. Carroll is and what his credentials are.\nThat aside, it's interesting to note in all the pro-life rallies I've seen on the tv machine and in blogs like this,it almost always seems that it's the men who are most \"het up\" about womens' bodies, their rights under the Constitution and abortion. (misogyny anyone?)\nIt is they who know what's moral and sane and what isn't. Once the \"wad\" is shot by a man, it magically becomes a person. Makes no difference if the woman was raped (she deserved it look how she dresses). Or it was a family member relieving himself, she must bear the child or she's not moral or sane.\n\nLan, I would ask you to reconsider your attitude towards men and abortion. Most of us are husbands and fathers with great love for our wives and children, and have great concerns about them both. In these discussions, some people speak about us like we are stray dogs. It is unhelpful, and demeaning to us, bordering on misandry.\n\nSociety is struggling with the entire pro-life/pro-choice conversation. We are struggling with the notion that yes, life in the womb is human life, but at what point does it rise to the same level of human life as a full-term baby? When it is a fertilized egg? A zygote? An embryo?\n\nIt appears that society is coming to a consensus about it. We have a real problem with an abortion in the third trimester, but the further back in development we go, the less problem we have. It strikes me as more intuitive than scientific, but is there none the less, and may be grounded in common sense rather than biology. Personally, I think this will be an on-going societal conversation for a very long time.\n\nSorry Kevin but although you and your friend care - many men do not. There are good reasons for 3rd trimester abortions - most women do not use abortion as a birth control method as some seem to think. Just keep abortion safe and legal - stop trying to make decisions for women - we can choose for ourselves and consult our God or or spouse or whomever if needed. It is simple. Stop trying to write laws for us. I lived with the no abortion laws growing up and had a friend die in a botched procedure. Women will terminate pregnancies regardless of the law if they are desperate. Work for a better environment for the born if you want to cut back on abortions. Support women don't legislate against them.\n\n>>No, abortion is NOT primarily a moral issue. The attempt to BAN ABORTIONS, is. If one believes that women are fully Imago Dei: Anathema!\n\nWhat? If a woman is made in the image of God she... has God's authority to snuff out the life of a human soul?\n\nIs the child not also made in the image of God?\n\nAnd this issue of, well we're not really sure when the embryo becomes a worthwhile human being. How does that justify anything? \"In the next room there may, or may not be a person. Press this button and the room fills with deadly gas. If there's someone over there, they die and you're a murderer. If there's nobody over there, then it really didn't matter.\" Do you press the button? Do you press the button even if you'll never know the result? Do you do it if you're being threatened with your life?\n\nIf you believe it's a human- then there is NO WAY to justify it under any circumstances. If you DON'T believe it's a human, then it's perfectly acceptable.\n\nMoral dilemmas are only complicated because we humans are (as Kierkegaard observed of Christians in particular) a bunch of scheming swindlers.\n\nThank you, Ann, the link to Aaron's blog. I read him often mostly because he challenges my more conservative views on health care reform.\n\nLan, if it was unclear, Aaron is not the kind of man you are describing. (I couldn't tell if you were making that equation or not.)\n\nI'm disappointed that the comment thread is mostly from men -- we are talking about a woman's right to choose. That said, there's no reason to exclude men from the conversation even though many men think they can dictate to women what their rights are.\n\nI do wonder, too, if there are women who are reluctant to express views that don't conform a liberal view of abortion. Polls shows there are many such women and not just of the hard right variety -- one's who have a nuanced view.\n\n1. She is not ready to be a parent.\n2. She cannot afford a baby.\n3. She doesn't want to be a single parent.\n4. She doesn't want anyone to know she has had sex or is pregnant.\n5. She has all the children she wants.\n6. She or the fetus has health problems\n7. She was a victim of rape or incest.\n\nTo me, that sounds mostly like birth-control. I don't know how else to characterize it. This does not pass any judgment on the legitimacy of termination as birth control, but it is a form of birth control.\n\nUnder the topic, \"Does my partner or parent need to know?\" they say \"No, they do not need to know. However, *most women come to the clinic with their partners*. More than half of teenagers talk with at least one parent before getting an abortion.\"\n\nTo me, this sounds like most men do care, not the opposite. According to a CBS/Times poll as far back as 2009, \"There are no major differences between mens' and womens' stands on the issue. 40% of men believe abortion should be generally available, and 37% of women think it should be. 20% of men think it should not be permitted, and slightly more women, 24%, agree.\"\n\nIt appears as many men support abortion rights as do women.\n\nThis makes no judgment about whether or not it should be legal, or safe, or available, et al. It also does not address whether 50% of our society should be eliminated from decisions relative to the kind of medicine we should support by virtue of their gender. But the notion that most men do not care is not supported by the Un. Of Washington's Women's Health website or the CBS/Times poll. Thanks! I'll get off my soapbox now!\n\nJC, I think you're wrong about the Old Testament. I don't remember quickening making an appearance there. What I do seem to remember is concern about \"the breath of life\" - an idea still valued in Jewish thought, which generally doesn't recognize personhood before birth.\n\nPersonally, I think we ought to reassess the now devalued concept of quickening. Until the 19th century abortions before quickening were not a moral or legal problem in the US or Britain; even after abortion began to be restricted, women were loath to abandon it as the limit between permissible and impermissible abortions.\n\nThe problem with quickening is that it's highly subjective, and depends on the woman noticing it. But just as we now view death as the cessation of brain function, perhaps it makes sense to view the beginning of a human life as the point where the CNS starts to function as a system.\n\nI don't think that embryos and zygotes are people, but I think that at some point before birth the fetus is a person. That said, I'm also in favor of keeping abortion legal.\n\nI also point out that there's a difference between \"human life\" and \"a human life.\" Zygotes are undeniably examples of human life - but so are any living cells with human DNA: liver cells, brain cells, tumor cells. The question of when an individual human life begins is something else.\n\nWhat? If a woman is made in the image of God she... has God's authority to snuff out the life of a human soul?\n\nThen one believes that NO ONE is BETTER qualified to evaluate the putative \"human soul\" of an embryo/fetus, than the woman in whom that embryo/fetus is located.

{"text": "Induced abortion\nClassification and external resources\nICD-10\nO04.\nICD-9\n779.6\nDiseasesDB\n4153\nMedlinePlus\n002912\neMedicine\narticle/252560\nAbortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion of a fetus or embryo from the uterus, resulting in or caused by its death.1 An abortion can occur spontaneously due to complications during pregnancy or can be induced, in humans and other species. In the context of human pregnancies, an abortion induced to preserve the health of the gravida (pregnant female) is termed a therapeutic abortion, while an abortion induced for any other reason is termed an elective abortion. The term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy, while spontaneous abortions are usually termed miscarriages.\nAbortion has a low risk of maternal mortality except for abortions performed unsafely, which result in 70,000 deaths and 5 million disabilities per year.2 Abortions are unsafe when performed by persons without the proper skills or outside of a medically safe environment. An estimated 42 million abortions are performed annually with 20 million of those abortions done unsafely.2 Forty percent of the world's women are able to access therapeutic and elective abortions within gestational limits.3\nAbortion has a long history and has been induced by various methods including herbal abortifacients, the use of sharpened tools, physical trauma, and other traditional methods. Contemporary medicine utilizes medications and surgical procedures to induce abortion. The legality, prevalence, cultural, and religious views on abortion vary substantially around the world. In many parts of the world there is prominent and divisive public controversy over the ethical and legal issues of abortion. Abortion and abortion-related issues feature prominently in the national politics in many nations, often involving the opposing pro-life and pro-choice worldwide social movements (both self-named). Incidence of abortion has declined worldwide, as access to family planning education and contraceptive services has increased.4\nContents\n1 Types\n1.1 Spontaneous\n1.2 Induced\n2 Methods\n2.1 Medical\n2.2 Surgical\n2.3 Other methods\n3 Health risks\n3.1 Physical health\n3.2 Mental health\n4 Incidence\n4.1 By gestational age and method\n4.2 By personal and social factors\n4.3 Unsafe abortion\n5 History\n6 Society and culture\n6.1 Abortion debate\n6.2 Abortion law\n6.3 Sex-selective\n6.4 Anti-abortion violence\n6.5 Art, literature and film\n7 In other animals\n8 References\n9 External links\n//\nTypes\nA 10-week-old fetus removed via a therapeutic abortion from a 44-year-old woman diagnosed with early-stage uterine cancer. The uterus (womb), included the fetus.\nSpontaneous\nMain article: Miscarriage\nSpontaneous abortion (also known as miscarriage) is the expulsion of an embryo or fetus due to accidental trauma or natural causes before approximately the 22nd week of gestation; the definition by gestational age varies by country.5 Most miscarriages are due to incorrect replication of chromosomes; they can also be caused by environmental factors. A pregnancy that ends before 37 weeks of gestation resulting in a live-born infant is known as a \"premature birth\". When a fetus dies in utero after about 22 weeks, or during delivery, it is usually termed \"stillborn\". Premature births and stillbirths are generally not considered to be miscarriages although usage of these terms can sometimes overlap.\nBetween 10% and 50% of pregnancies end in clinically apparent miscarriage, depending upon the age and health of the pregnant woman.6 Most miscarriages occur very early in pregnancy, in most cases, they occur so early in the pregnancy that the woman is not even aware that she was pregnant. One study testing hormones for ovulation and pregnancy found that 61.9% of conceptuses were lost prior to 12 weeks, and 91.7% of these losses occurred subclinically, without the knowledge of the once pregnant woman.7\nThe risk of spontaneous abortion decreases sharply after the 10th week from the last menstrual period (LMP).68 One study of 232 pregnant women showed \"virtually complete [pregnancy loss] by the end of the embryonic period\" (10 weeks LMP) with a pregnancy loss rate of only 2 percent after 8.5 weeks LMP.9\nThe most common cause of spontaneous abortion during the first trimester is chromosomal abnormalities of the embryo/fetus,10 accounting for at least 50% of sampled early pregnancy losses.11 Other causes include vascular disease (such as lupus), diabetes, other hormonal problems, infection, and abnormalities of the uterus.10 Advancing maternal age and a patient history of previous spontaneous abortions are the two leading factors associated with a greater risk of spontaneous abortion.11 A spontaneous abortion can also be caused by accidental trauma; intentional trauma or stress to cause miscarriage is considered induced abortion or feticide.12\nInduced\nA pregnancy can be intentionally aborted in many ways. The manner selected depends chiefly upon the gestational age of the embryo or fetus, which increases in size as the pregnancy progresses.13 Specific procedures may also be selected due to legality, regional availability, and doctor-patient preference. Reasons for procuring induced abortions are typically characterized as either therapeutic or elective. An abortion is medically referred to as a therapeutic abortion when it is performed to:\nsave the life of the pregnant woman;14\npreserve the woman's physical or mental health;14\nterminate pregnancy that would result in a child born with a congenital disorder that would be fatal or associated with significant morbidity;14 or\nselectively reduce the number of fetuses to lessen health risks associated with multiple pregnancy.14\nAn abortion is referred to as elective when it is performed at the request of the woman \"for reasons other than maternal health or fetal disease.\"15\nMethods\nGestational age may determine which abortion methods are practiced.\nMedical\nMain article: Medical abortion\n\"Medical abortions\" are non-surgical abortions that use pharmaceutical drugs. As of 2005, medical abortions constitute 13% of all abortions in the United States.16 Combined regimens include methotrexate or mifepristone, followed by a prostaglandin (either misoprostol or gemeprost: misoprostol is used in the U.S.; gemeprost is used in the UK and Sweden.) When used within 49 days gestation, approximately 92% of women undergoing medical abortion with a combined regimen completed it without surgical intervention.17 Misoprostol can be used alone, but has a lower efficacy rate than combined regimens. In cases of failure of medical abortion, vacuum or manual aspiration is used to complete the abortion surgically.\nSurgical\nA vacuum aspiration abortion at eight weeks gestational age (six weeks after fertilization).\n1: Amniotic sac\n2: Embryo\n3: Uterine lining\n4: Speculum\n5: Vacurette\n6: Attached to a suction pump\nIn the first 12 weeks, suction-aspiration or vacuum abortion is the most common method.18 Manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) abortion consists of removing the fetus or embryo, placenta and membranes by suction using a manual syringe, while electric vacuum aspiration (EVA) abortion uses an electric pump. These techniques are comparable, and differ in the mechanism used to apply suction, how early in pregnancy they can be used, and whether cervical dilation is necessary. MVA, also known as \"mini-suction\" and \"menstrual extraction\", can be used in very early pregnancy, and does not require cervical dilation. Surgical techniques are sometimes referred to as 'Suction (or surgical) Termination Of Pregnancy' (STOP). From the 15th week until approximately the 26th, dilation and evacuation (D&E) is used. D&E consists of opening the cervix of the uterus and emptying it using surgical instruments and suction.\nDilation and curettage (D&C), the second most common method of surgical abortion, is a standard gynecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons, including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy, investigation of abnormal bleeding, and abortion. Curettage refers to cleaning the walls of the uterus with a curette. The World Health Organization recommends this procedure, also called sharp curettage, only when MVA is unavailable.19\nOther techniques must be used to induce abortion in the second trimester. Premature delivery can be induced with prostaglandin; this can be coupled with injecting the amniotic fluid with hypertonic solutions containing saline or urea. After the 16th week of gestation, abortions can be induced by intact dilation and extraction (IDX) (also called intrauterine cranial decompression), which requires surgical decompression of the fetus's head before evacuation. IDX is sometimes called \"partial-birth abortion,\" which has been federally banned in the United States. A hysterotomy abortion is a procedure similar to a caesarean section and is performed under general anesthesia. It requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and is used during later stages of pregnancy.20\nThe Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has recommended that an injection be used to stop the fetal heart during the first phase of the surgical abortion procedure to ensure that the fetus is not born alive.21\nOther methods\nBas-relief at Angkor Wat, Cambodia, c. 1150, depicting a demon inducing an abortion by pounding the abdomen of a pregnant woman with a pestle.22\nHistorically, a number of herbs reputed to possess abortifacient properties have been used in folk medicine: tansy, pennyroyal, black cohosh, and the now-extinct silphium (see history of abortion).23 The use of herbs in such a manner can cause serious\u2014even lethal\u2014side effects, such as multiple organ failure, and is not recommended by physicians.24\nAbortion is sometimes attempted by causing trauma to the abdomen. The degree of force, if severe, can cause serious internal injuries without necessarily succeeding in inducing miscarriage.25 Both accidental and deliberate abortions of this kind can be subject to criminal liability in many countries. In Southeast Asia, there is an ancient tradition of attempting abortion through forceful abdominal massage.26 One of the bas reliefs decorating the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia depicts a demon performing such an abortion upon a woman who has been sent to the underworld.26\nReported methods of unsafe, self-induced abortion include misuse of misoprostol, and insertion of non-surgical implements such as knitting needles and clothes hangers into the uterus. These methods are rarely seen in developed countries where surgical abortion is legal and available.27\nHealth risks\nSee also: Health risks of unsafe abortion\nAbortion, when legally performed in developed countries, is among the safest procedures in medicine.2829 In such settings, risk of maternal death is between 0.2\u20131.2 per 100,000 procedures.30313233 In comparison, by 1996, mortality from childbirth in developed countries was 11 times greater.303435363738 Unsafe abortions (defined by the World Health Organization as those performed by unskilled individuals, with hazardous equipment, or in unsanitary facilities) carry a high risk of maternal death and other complications.39 For unsafe procedures, the mortality rate has been estimated at 367 per 100,000 (70,000 women per year worldwide).240\nPhysical health\nSurgical abortion methods, like most minimally invasive procedures, carry a small potential for serious complications.41\nSurgical abortion is generally safe and the rate of major complications is low42 but varies depending on how far pregnancy has progressed and the surgical method used.43 Concerning gestational age, incidence of major complications is highest after 20 weeks of gestation and lowest before the 8th week.43 With more advanced gestation there is a higher risk of uterine perforation and retained products of conception,44 and specific procedures like dilation and evacuation may be required.45\nConcerning the methods used, general incidence of major complications for surgical abortion varies from lower for suction curettage, to higher for saline instillation.43 Possible complications include hemorrhage, incomplete abortion, uterine or pelvic infection, ongoing intrauterine pregnancy, misdiagnosed/unrecognized ectopic pregnancy, hematometra (in the uterus), uterine perforation and cervical laceration.46 Use of general anesthesia increases the risk of complications because it relaxes uterine musculature making it easier to perforate.47\nWomen who have uterine anomalies, leiomyomas or had previous difficult first-trimester abortion are contraindicated to undertake surgical abortion unless ultrasonography is immediately available and the surgeon is experienced in its intraoperative use.48 Abortion does not impair subsequent pregnancies, nor does it increase the risk of future premature births, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, or miscarriage.29\nIn the first trimester, health risks associated with medical abortion are generally considered no greater than for surgical abortion.49\nAlthough some epidemiological studies suggest an abortion \u2013 breast cancer hypothesis, the World Health Organization has concluded that there is \"no consistent effect of first trimester induced abortion upon a woman's risk of breast cancer later in life\".5051 The National Cancer Institute,52 The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,53 the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists,54 and other major medical bodies have also concluded that abortion does not cause breast cancer.55\nMental health\nMain article: Abortion and mental health\nNo scientific research has demonstrated that abortion is a cause of poor mental health in the general population. However there are groups of women who may be at higher risk of coping with problems and distress following abortion.56 Some factors in a woman's life, such as emotional attachment to the pregnancy, lack of social support, pre-existing psychiatric illness, and conservative views on abortion increase the likelihood of experiencing negative feelings after an abortion.57 The American Psychological Association (APA) concluded that abortion does not lead to increased mental health problems.58\nSome proposed negative psychological effects of abortion have been referred to by pro-life advocates as a separate condition called \"post-abortion syndrome.\" However, the existence of \"post-abortion syndrome\" is not recognized by any medical or psychological organization.596061\nA January 2011 study in the New England Journal of Medicine concludes that women who have had a first-trimester abortion are no more likely to seek psychiatric care after the procedure than before -- but the risk of a mental health problem increases if the woman gives birth.62\nIncidence\nThere are two commonly used methods of measuring incidence of abortion:\nAbortion rate - number of abortions per 1000 women between 15 and 44 years of age\nAbortion ratio - number of abortions out of 100 known pregnancies (excluding miscarriages and stillbirths)\nThe number of abortions performed worldwide has decreased between 1995 and 2003 from 45.6 million to 41.6 million, which means a decrease in abortion rate from 35 to 29 per 1000 women. The greatest decrease has occurred in the developed world with a drop from 39 to 26 per 1000 women in comparison to the developing world, which had a decrease from 34 to 29 per 1000 women. Out of a total of about 42 million abortions 22 million occurred safely and 20 million unsafely.2\nOn average, the frequency of abortions is similar in developing countries (where abortion is generally restricted) to the frequency in developed countries (where abortion is generally much less restricted).363 Abortion rates are very difficult to measure in locations where those abortions are illegal,64 and pro-life groups have criticized researchers for allegedly jumping to conclusions about those numbers.65 According to the Guttmacher Institute and the United Nations Population Fund, the abortion rate in developing countries is largely attributable to lack of access to modern contraceptives; assuming no change in abortion laws, providing that access to contraceptives would result in about 25 million fewer abortions annually, including almost 15 million fewer unsafe abortions.66\nThe incidence of induced abortion varies regionally. Some countries, such as Belgium (11.2 out of 100 known pregnancies) and the Netherlands (10.6 per 100), had a comparatively low ratio of induced abortion. Others like Russia (62.6 out of 100), Romania (63 out of 100) and Vietnam (43.7 out of 100) had a high ratio (data for last three countries of unknown completeness). The estimated world ratio was 26%, the world rate - 35 per 1000 women.67\nBy gestational age and method\nHistogram of abortions by gestational age in England and Wales during 2004. Average is 9.5 weeks. (left) Abortion in the United States by gestational age, 2004. (Data source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) (right)\nAbortion rates also vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method practiced. In 2003, from data collected in those areas of the United States that sufficiently reported gestational age, it was found that 88.2% of abortions were conducted at or prior to 12 weeks, 10.4% from 13 to 20 weeks, and 1.4% at or after 21 weeks. 90.9% of these were classified as having been done by \"curettage\" (suction-aspiration, Dilation and curettage, Dilation and evacuation), 7.7% by \"medical\" means (mifepristone), 0.4% by \"intrauterine instillation\" (saline or prostaglandin), and 1.0% by \"other\" (including hysterotomy and hysterectomy).68 The Guttmacher Institute estimated there were 2,200 intact dilation and extraction procedures in the U.S. during 2000; this accounts for 0.17% of the total number of abortions performed that year.69 Similarly, in England and Wales in 2006, 89% of terminations occurred at or under 12 weeks, 9% between 13 to 19 weeks, and 1.5% at or over 20 weeks. 64% of those reported were by vacuum aspiration, 6% by D&E, and 30% were medical.70 Later abortions are more common in China, India, and other developing countries than in developed countries.71\nBy personal and social factors\nA bar chart depicting selected data from the 1998 AGI meta-study on the reasons women stated for having an abortion.\nA 1998 aggregated study, from 27 countries, on the reasons women seek to terminate their pregnancies concluded that common factors cited to have influenced the abortion decision were: desire to delay or end childbearing, concern over the interruption of work or education, issues of financial or relationship stability, and perceived immaturity.72 A 2004 study in which American women at clinics answered a questionnaire yielded similar results.73 In Finland and the United States, concern for the health risks posed by pregnancy in individual cases was not a factor commonly given; however, in Bangladesh, India, and Kenya health concerns were cited by women more frequently as reasons for having an abortion.72 1% of women in the 2004 survey-based U.S. study became pregnant as a result of rape and 0.5% as a result of incest.73 Another American study in 2002 concluded that 54% of women who had an abortion were using a form of contraception at the time of becoming pregnant while 46% were not. Inconsistent use was reported by 49% of those using condoms and 76% of those using the combined oral contraceptive pill; 42% of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage.74 The Guttmacher Institute estimated that \"most abortions in the United States are obtained by minority women\" because minority women \"have much higher rates of unintended pregnancy.\"75\nSome abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures. These might include the stigmatization of disabled people, preference for children of a specific sex, disapproval of single motherhood, insufficient economic support for families, lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods, or efforts toward population control (such as China's one-child policy). These factors can sometimes result in compulsory abortion or sex-selective abortion.\nUnsafe abortion\nSoviet poster circa 1925, warning against midwives performing abortions. Title translation: \"Abortions performed by either trained or self-taught midwives not only maim the woman, they also often lead to death.\"\nMain article: Unsafe abortion\nOne of the main determinants of the availability of safe abortions is the legality of the procedure. Forty percent of the world's women are able to access therapeutic and elective abortions within gestational limits.3 Women seeking to terminate their pregnancies sometimes resort to unsafe methods, particularly where and when access to legal abortion is restricted. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines an unsafe abortion as being \"a procedure ... carried out by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards, or both.\"76 Unsafe abortions are sometimes known colloquially as \"back-alley\" abortions. They may be performed by the woman herself, another person without medical training, or a professional health provider operating in sub-standard conditions. Unsafe abortion remains a public health concern due to the higher incidence and severity of its associated complications, such as incomplete abortion, sepsis, hemorrhage, and damage to internal organs. While maternal mortality seldom results from safe abortions, unsafe abortions result in 70,000 deaths and 5 million disabilities per year.2 Complications of unsafe abortion are said to account, globally, for approximately 13% of all maternal mortalities, with regional estimates including 12% in Asia, 25% in Latin America, and 13% in sub-Saharan Africa.77 Although the global rate of abortion declined from 45.6 million in 1995 to 41.6 million in 2003, unsafe procedures still accounted for 48% of all abortions performed in 2003.78 Health education, access to family planning, and improvements in health care during and after abortion have been proposed to address this phenomenon.79\nHistory\n\"French Periodical Pills.\" An example of a clandestine advertisement published in an 1845 edition of the Boston Daily Times.\nMain article: History of abortion\nInduced abortion can be traced to ancient times.80 There is evidence to suggest that, historically, pregnancies were terminated through a number of methods, including the administration of abortifacient herbs, the use of sharpened implements, the application of abdominal pressure, and other techniques.\nThe Hippocratic Oath, the chief statement of medical ethics for Hippocratic physicians in Ancient Greece, forbade doctors from helping to procure an abortion by pessary. Soranus, a 2nd-century Greek physician, suggested in his work Gynaecology that women wishing to abort their pregnancies should engage in energetic exercise, energetic jumping, carrying heavy objects, and riding animals. He also prescribed a number of recipes for herbal baths, pessaries, and bloodletting, but advised against the use of sharp instruments to induce miscarriage due to the risk of organ perforation.81 It is also believed that, in addition to using it as a contraceptive, the ancient Greeks relied upon silphium as an abortifacient. Such folk remedies, however, varied in effectiveness and were not without risk. Tansy and pennyroyal, for example, are two poisonous herbs with serious side effects that have at times been used to terminate pregnancy.\nDuring the Islamic Golden Age, physicians there documented detailed and extensive lists of birth control practices commenting on their effectiveness and prevalence.82 They listed many different birth control substances in their medical encyclopedias, such as Avicenna's list of twenty in The Canon of Medicine (1025 CE) and Muhammad ibn Zakariya ar-Razi's list of 176 substances in his Hawi (10th century CE) This was \"unparalleled in European medicine until the 19th century\".83\nDuring the Middle Ages, abortion was toleratedwhere? and there were no laws against it.84non-primary source needed A medieval female physician, Trotula of Salerno,85 administered a number of remedies for the \"retention of menstrua,\" which was sometimes a code for early abortifacients.86 Pope Sixtus V (1585\u201390) is noted as the first Pope to declare that abortion is homicide regardless of the stage of pregnancy.87 Abortion in the 19th century continued, despite bans in both the United Kingdom and the United States, as the disguised, but nonetheless open, advertisement of services in the Victorian era suggests.88non-primary source needed\nIn the 20th century the Soviet Union (1919), Iceland (1935) and Sweden (1938) were among the first countries to legalize certain or all forms of abortion.89 In 1935 Nazi Germany, a law was passed permitting abortions for those deemed \"hereditarily ill,\" while women considered of German stock were specifically prohibited from having abortions.90919293\nHowever, the procedure remained relatively rare until the late 1960s. In late 1960s and early 1970s, due to a confluence of factors, the number of abortions exploded worldwide. In West Germany, the number of reported abortions spiked from 2,800 in 1968 to 87,702 in 1980.94 In the United States, some sources show an even greater increase, from 4,600 in 1968 to 1.5 million in 1980. However, the fact that abortion remained illegal in many states prior to the landmark 1973 decision of Roe v. Wade may have affected the number of reported abortions prior to 1973.\nSociety and culture\nAbortion debate\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.\nPlease help improve this article by adding reliable references.

(right)\nMain article: Abortion debate\nSee also: Religion and abortion\nIn the history of abortion, induced abortion has been the source of considerable debate, controversy, and activism. An individual's position on the complex ethical, moral, philosophical, biological, and legal issues is often related to his or her value system. The main positions are one that argues in favor of access to abortion and one argues against access to abortion. Opinions of abortion may be described as being a combination of beliefs on its morality, and beliefs on the responsibility, ethical scope, and proper extent of governmental authorities in public policy. Religious ethics also has an influence upon both personal opinion and the greater debate over abortion (see religion and abortion).\nAbortion debates, especially pertaining to abortion laws, are often spearheaded by groups advocating one of these two positions. In the United States, those in favor of greater legal restrictions on, or even complete prohibition of abortion, most often describe themselves as pro-life while those against legal restrictions on abortion describe themselves as pro-choice. Generally, the former position argues that a human fetus is a human being with a right to live making abortion tantamount to murder. The latter position argues that a woman has certain reproductive rights, especially the choice whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term.\nIn both public and private debate, arguments presented in favor of or against abortion access focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion, or justification of laws permitting or restricting abortion.\nDebate also focuses on whether the pregnant woman should have to notify and/or have the consent of others in distinct cases: a minor, her parents; a legally married or common-law wife, her husband; or, for any case, the biological father. In a 2003 Gallup poll in the United States, 79% of male and 67% of female respondents were in favor of legalized mandatory spousal notification; overall support was 72% with 26% opposed.95\nAbortion law\nThe examples and perspective in this article may not represent a worldwide view of the subject.

(December 2010)\nMain article: Abortion law\nSee also: Reproductive rights and History of Abortion Law Debate\nInternational status of abortion law:\nLegal on request\nIllegal with exception for rape, maternal life, health, mental health, fetal defects, and/or socioeconomic factors\nIllegal with exception for rape, maternal life, health, mental health, and/or fetal defects\nIllegal with exception for rape, maternal life, health, and/or mental health\nIllegal with exception for maternal life, health, and/or mental health\nIllegal with no exceptions\nVaries by region\nNo information\nThe earliest secular laws regulating abortion reflect a concern with class and caste purity and preservation of male prerogatives. Abortion as such was not outlawed, but wives who procured abortions without their husband's knowledge could be severely punished, as could slaves who induced abortions in highborn women. Generally, abortions prior to quickening were treated as minor crimes, if at all.\nThe new philosophies of the Axial Age, which began discussing the nature and value of human life in abstract terms, had little impact on existing abortion laws. Even the Christian ecclesiastical courts of the Middle Ages imposed penance and no corporal punishment for abortion, and retained the pre- and post-quickening distinction from the ancient philosophies.\nWith the sole exception of Bracton,96 commentators on the English common law formulated the born alive rule, excluding feticide from homicide law, using language dating back to the Leges Henrici Primi.97\nIn the late 18th century, it was claimed that scientific knowledge of human development beginning at fertilization,98 justified stricter abortion laws. This was part of a larger struggle on the part of the medical profession to distinguish modern, theory based medicine from traditional, empirically based medicine, including midwifery and herbalism.99\nBoth pre- and post-quickening abortions were criminalized by Lord Ellenborough's Act in 1803.100 In 1861, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the Offences against the Person Act 1861, which continued to outlaw abortion and served as a model for similar prohibitions in some other nations.101\nThe Soviet Union, with legislation in 1920, and Iceland, with legislation in 1935, were two of the first countries to generally allow abortion. The second half of the 20th century saw the liberalization of abortion laws in other countries. The Abortion Act 1967 allowed abortion for limited reasons in the United Kingdom (except Northern Ireland). In the 1973 case, Roe v. Wade, the United States Supreme Court struck down state laws banning abortion, ruling that such laws violated an implied right to privacy in the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court of Canada, similarly, in the case of R. v. Morgentaler, discarded its criminal code regarding abortion in 1988, after ruling that such restrictions violated the security of person guaranteed to women under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.102 Canada later struck down provincial regulations of abortion in the case of R. v. Morgentaler (1993). By contrast, abortion in Ireland was affected by the addition of an amendment to the Irish Constitution in 1983 by popular referendum, recognizing \"the right to life of the unborn\".\nCurrent laws pertaining to abortion are diverse. Religious, moral, and cultural sensibilities continue to influence abortion laws throughout the world. The right to life, the right to liberty, the right to security of person, and the right to reproductive health are major issues of human rights that are sometimes used as justification for the existence or absence of laws controlling abortion. Many countries in which abortion is legal require that certain criteria be met in order for an abortion to be obtained, often, but not always, using a trimester-based system to regulate the window of legality:\nIn the United States, some states impose a 24-hour waiting period before the procedure, prescribe the distribution of information on fetal development, or require that parents be contacted if their minor daughter requests an abortion.103\nIn the United Kingdom, as in some other countries, two doctors must first certify that an abortion is medically or socially necessary before it can be performed.citation needed\nOther countries, in which abortion is normally illegal, will allow one to be performed in the case of rape, incest, or danger to the pregnant woman's life or health.\nA few nations ban abortion entirely: Chile, El Salvador, Malta, and Nicaragua, with consequent rises in maternal death directly and indirectly due to pregnancy.104105 However, in 2006, the Chilean government began the free distribution of emergency contraception.106107\nIn Bangladesh, abortion is illegal, but the government has long supported a network of \"menstrual regulation clinics\", where menstrual extraction (manual vacuum aspiration) can be performed as menstrual hygiene.108\nIn places where abortion is illegal or carries heavy social stigma, pregnant women may engage in medical tourism and travel to countries where they can terminate their pregnancies. Women without the means to travel can resort to providers of illegal abortions or try to do it themselves. 109\nIn the US, about 8% of abortions are performed on women who travel from another state.110 However, that is driven at least partly by differing limits on abortion according to gestational age or the scarcity of doctors trained and willing to do later abortions.citation needed Thousands of women every year travel from Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Poland, and other countries where elective abortion is illegal, to Britain or other countries with less restrictive laws, in order to obtain abortions.111112\nIn the United States and some Canadian localities, it is a legal offense to obstruct access to a clinic or doctor's office where abortions are performed. \"Buffer zones,\" regulating how close protesters can come to the clinic or to the patients, may exist.\nOther issues in abortion law may include the requirement that a minor obtain the consent of one or both parents to the abortion or that she notify one or both parents, the requirement that a woman obtain the consent of her husband to the abortion and the question of whether the fetus's father can prohibit an abortion, the requirement that abortion providers inform patients of the supposed health risks of the procedure, and wrongful birth laws.\nSex-selective\nMain article: Sex-selective abortion\nSonography and amniocentesis allow parents to determine sex before childbirth. The development of this technology has led to sex-selective abortion, or the targeted termination of female fetuses.\nIt is suggested that sex-selective abortion might be partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth rates of male and female children in some places. The preference for male children is reported in many areas of Asia, and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in China, Taiwan, South Korea, and India.113\nIn India, the economic role of men, the costs associated with dowries, and a common Indian tradition which dictates that funeral rites must be performed by a male relative have led to a cultural preference for sons.114 The widespread availability of diagnostic testing, during the 1970s and '80s, led to advertisements for services which read, \"Invest 500 rupees [for a sex test] now, save 50,000 rupees [for a dowry] later.\"115 In 1991, the male-to-female sex ratio in India was skewed from its biological norm of 105 to 100, to an average of 108 to 100.116 Researchers have asserted that between 1985 and 2005 as many as 10 million female fetuses may have been selectively aborted.117 The Indian government passed an official ban of pre-natal sex screening in 1994 and moved to pass a complete ban of sex-selective abortion in 2002.118\nIn the People's Republic of China, there is also a historic son preference. The implementation of the one-child policy in 1979, in response to population concerns, led to an increased disparity in the sex ratio as parents attempted to circumvent the law through sex-selective abortion or the abandonment of unwanted daughters.119 Sex-selective abortion might be an influence on the shift from the baseline male-to-female birth rate to an elevated national rate of 117:100 reported in 2002. The trend was more pronounced in rural regions: as high as 130:100 in Guangdong and 135:100 in Hainan.120 A ban upon the practice of sex-selective abortion was enacted in 2003.121\nAnti-abortion violence\nMain article: Anti-abortion violence\nDoctors and facilities that provide abortion have been subjected to various forms of violence, including murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, stalking, assault, arson, and bombing. Anti-abortion violence has been classified by governmental and scholarly sources as terrorism.122123 Only a small fraction of those opposed to abortion commit violence, often rationalizing their actions as justifiable homicide or defense of others, committed in order to protect the lives of fetuses.\nIn the United States, four abortion providers\u2014Drs. David Gunn, John Britton, Barnett Slepian, and George Tiller\u2014have been assassinated. Attempted assassinations have also taken place in the United States and Canada, and other personnel at abortion clinics, including receptionists and security guards, have been killed in the United States and Australia. Hundreds of bombings, arsons, acid attacks, invasions, and incidents of vandalism against abortion providers have also occurred.124125 Notable perpetrators of anti-abortion violence include Eric Robert Rudolph, Scott Roeder, Shelley Shannon, and Paul Jennings Hill, the first person to be executed in the United States for murdering an abortion provider.126\nArt, literature and film\nArt serves to humanize the abortion issue and illustrates the myriad of decisions and consequences it has. One of the earliest known representations of abortion is in a bas relief at Angkor Wat (c. 1150). Pro-life activist B\u00f8rre Knudsen was linked to a 1994 art theft as part of a pro-life drive in Norway surrounding the 1994 Winter Olympics.127 A Swiss gallery removed a piece from a Chinese art collection in 2005, that had the head of a fetus attached to the body of a bird.128 In 2008, a Yale student proposed using aborted excretions and the induced abortion itself as a performance art project.129\nThe Cider House Rules (novel 1985, film 1999) follows the story of Dr. Larch an orphanage director who is a reluctant abortionist after seeing the consequences of back-alley abortions, and his orphan medical assistant Homer who is against abortion.130 Feminist novels such as Braided Lives (1997) by Marge Piercy emphasize the struggles women had in dealing with unsafe abortion in various circumstances prior to legalization.131 Doctor Susan Wicklund wrote This Common Secret (2007) about how a personal traumatic abortion experience hardened her resolve to provide compassionate care to women who decide to have an abortion. As Wicklund crisscrosses the West to provide abortion services to remote clinics, she tells the stories of women she's treated and the sacrifices herself and her loved ones made.132 In 2009, Irene Vilar revealed her past abuse and addiction to abortion in Impossible Motherhood, where she aborted 15 pregnancies in 17 years. According to Vilar it was the result of a dark psychological cycle of power, rebellion and societal expectations.133\nVarious options and realities of abortion have been dramatized in film. In Riding in Cars with Boys (2001) an underage woman carries her pregnancy to term as abortion is not an affordable option, moves in with the father and finds herself involved with drugs, has no opportunities, and questioning if she loves her child. While in Juno (2007) a 16-year-old initially goes to have an abortion but decides to bear the child and allow a wealthy couple to adopt it. Other films Dirty Dancing (1987) and If These Walls Could Talk (1996) explore the availability, affordability and dangers of illegal abortions. The emotional impact of dealing with an unwanted pregnancy alone is the focus of Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her (2000) and Circle of Friends (1995). As a marriage was in trouble in the The Godfather Part II (1974) Kay knew the relationship was over when she aborted \"a son\" in secret.134 On the abortion debate, an irresponsible drug addict is used as a pawn in a power struggle between pro-choice and pro-life groups in Citizen Ruth (1996).135\nIn other animals\nFurther information: Miscarriage#In other animals\nSpontaneous abortion occurs in various animals. For example, in sheep, it may be caused by crowding through doors, or being chased by dogs.136 In cows, abortion may be caused by contagious disease, such as Brucellosis or Campylobacter, but can often be controlled by vaccination.137\nAbortion may also be induced in animals, in the context of animal husbandry. For example, abortion may be induced in mares that have been mated improperly, or that have been purchased by owners who did not realize the mares were pregnant, or that are pregnant with twin foals.138\nFeticide can occur in horses and zebras due to male harassment of pregnant mares or forced copulation,139140141 although the frequency in the wild has been questioned.142 Male Gray langur monkeys may attack females following male takeover, causing miscarriage.143\nReferences\n^ Dutt T, Matthews MP (1998).

{"text": "Employers restricting nurse's equal access to contraception?\n\nFor our colleagues, for our daughters, nurses need to speak out! Equal access to contraception should not be based on the political or religious views of an employer! Give your employer your feedback on this important issue.\nEspecially for those of us who are nurses working within the healthcare industry, we CAN influence this issue. Speak out now for women's contraceptive rights.\n\nThe argument about contraceptive choices for women has nothing to do with a woman's rights. A woman still has the right to chose whether or not she uses prescriptive contraceptives for whatever reason. You don't have to use the insurance provided by your employer if they don't provide services to you that you want/need. If you have to pay more out of pocket for those services is the issue many people have but no one is forcing you to choose their business or their insurance. Why would you force YOUR beliefs on an institution who opposes them? Just because its something you want, the hospital or place of business where you're employed shouldn't have to provide them if it is against their religious doctrines. You CHOOSE to work for those people, you CHOOSE your insurance, you CHOOSE whether or not you use contraception. There is nothing that says you can't use or be prescribed those things by physicians. The freedom for you is the choice you have in deciding who you want to be employed with... and the choices you make in providers and prescriptions.\n\nThere are more concerns than a woman's right to choose. Women who are patients (not always by choice) cannot have access to contraceptive pills if they didn't bring them and also don't have them listed on their medication reconciliation lists,so the pharmacist and physician may be unaware of what she's taking. We had an eleven-year-old who needed an IV medication to stop bleeding that the hospital deemed a form of contraceptive-had to ship her to another hospital that would give her care or let her continue to bleed. If you have cystic acne and are female insurance won't pay for treatment that uses any form of medication used in birth control, or requires birth control when you use it (I've forgotten the name, but there is an injection for cystic acne that by federal protocol requires two forms of birth control because of potential harm to a fetus). Hysterectomy? Better have a good reason! This isn't really about contraception, it's about two things-one is control over medical treatment for women, the other is how much money an organization that hires primarily women can save by not providing medical care that applies only to women. Interestingly, our suddenly very religious hospital doesn't consider Easter or Good Friday holidays. But it wants to make sure it doesn't shell out a few dollars and let the employee choose something against its Christian beliefs."}

{"text": "This is a topic that has large controversy, my thoughts on it aren't like anyone else's that I've heard or read about. So I'm going to try my best to fully explain it, though I may ramble a bit due to the multiple directions my opinion takes. So pre-sorry for that.\n\nAbortion is murder, that much I agree with. I understand with those arguments that it's an evil deed and killing something that will develop into a human. Though I then think about it a bit more and I disagree with the argument. Every period a girl has is the death of something that could have developed into a human. Why didn't it? Because the female choose not to get pregnant. Just as a women might choose to have an abortion. Just as a mother might choose to not take care of her baby to the point it died. All resulting in the death of that human or possible human because of a choice.\n\nI tried to look at this again from the point of few of Pro Lifers, and I can't agree. Conception wasn't the start of the life, it started with the unfertilized egg and the sperm. Each were living orginisms. Which makes me see the Pro Life argument as silly, unless they also agree in continually attempting to become pregnant. Which if the masses believed this, it would quickly lead to major over population problems.\n\nUnless you're continually pumping out babies, then you are choosing to kill. So ultimately the question is, \"When is it no longer okay to kill a developing human?\" With the large number of opinions on this concept, I think it's just silly to argue over. It's a choice, one that the parents should be allowed to make.\n\nThis is why I am Pro Choice.\n\nAs for those who are Pro Life and argue that the parents should simply put the baby up for adoption, I say no. If you really want to keep that baby alive, by all means offer to take care of it after it's born. Otherwise you're speaking on behave of someone else taking the baby, when based on the fact that so many kids are in the adoption system without parents, you're actually speaking on behalf of no one. Speak for yourself not others.\n\nOther information that should be taken into consideration;\n\nCriminalizing abortions has neverprevented themfrom being performed, it just makes them unsafe: illegal abortions cause an estimated 68,000to74,000deaths, with five million suffering from complications each year."}

Jordan III gave the clinic and the state each a partial victory with his ruling Friday. He upheld the law but said the clinic can't face criminal or civil punishment as it tries to meet the requirements.\n\nThe law requires anyone who does abortions at the clinic to be an OB-GYN with privileges to admit patients to a local hospital. The clinic's two out-of-state physicians don't have those privileges and have had difficulty getting them from local hospitals.\n\nThe judge says whether they get those privileges will impact the ultimate issues in the case.\n\nSee? The moralists only care about the freedom to abort. Financially, they won't extend women ANY rights to run own life. None of these girls would pi## on a poor girl if she were on fire, yet somehow they see themselves as gods gift to the world.\nIf you're not fascist, Jeff, then let me run my own life. Yea, I didn't think so. You have to assert your superiority. Like all moralists.\n\nThere's a big difference between thinking abortion is wrong, and trying to legally force everyone to share your opinion by making it illegal. It's ridiculous and ironic how Christian fundies pretend to be doing God's work by attempting to legally force people to conform to their personal beliefs, because this is in fact un-christian behavior. Why don't you all just silently pray for God to make abortions not happen. I'm sure God will do what is right, without you acting as his biblical police force.\n\nOh Missy, calling the left fascist, that is rich! It also shows your complete ignorance. Get an education and stop blathering your nonsense. You are very typical of right-wing misinformation and hysteria.\n\nDon't like abortion? Then don't get one. It really is that simple.

God ordered the killing of many babies in the OT, so obviously they had no special value in the Bible.\n\nSo like I said: different people take positions for many reasons. I'm looking at the consequences of those positions and if an embryo IS equal to all other humans, why the lack of effort to save all the embryos that God is throwing out? Are they not human too? I see many unpregnant women in churches that could be impregnated with them and save them.\n\nIf embryos have souls and innocent, then heaven is overloaded with embryos and people that lived are vastly outnumbered.

Same punchline, different method.\n\nFollowing hot on the heels of the birth control mandate and supposed back down last week, this bad, weak joke has opened an entire warehouse worth of cans of worms. Inalienable rights. First amendment rights. Womens rights. The far right and far left's right to froth at the mouth uncontrollably\n\nThey all miss the damned point as far as I am concerned.\n\nSince when did contraception become solely the woman's job? Just look at the assumption there for a second. \"Ladies, you had better keep your legs closed, 'cause guys can't control themselves. If you don't, it is all your fault.\"\n\nThat is a fundamentaly retarded idea, normally spouted by retarded fundamentalists of all stripes. It is not just dissing guys, but giving a get out of jail free card to the \"pump and dump\" a*sholes. It is total balls and drives me into a fury. It takes two to tango. Two to make a baby.\n\n7 Comments\n\nI find Rick Santorum completely abhorrent.

Vasectomies are a form of birth control that no one mentions. They are usually covered by insurance. That's why I call bullshit on this debate the republicans have made up.\n\nUmm, no, vasectomies are not really a viable alternative to regular birth control because it eliminates the man's ability to have children at all. With the Pill, women have the option of going off it at anytime when they want to have kids. Condoms? Just don't use one. Sponge? Take it out. But a vasectomy is permanent. Besides, my knowledge is that vasectomies are usually used by men who have had children and are with a woman who can't have more kids because of health or because they don't want to have kids at all. They aren't going to be widely accepted as a contraceptive for younger men.\n\nMM, I loved your post, until you started using the word \"retarded.\" why would you use this word instead of stupid, idiotiic, dumb, etc. I thought that using the term retarded to mean stupid was over, but I guess not.\n\nDo retarded people wake up one day and decide they will be \"stupid\" and have a challenging life in which they are always judged.\n\nI love this site but, MM could have chosen a vast number of words, other than retarded!"}
{"text": "Michele Bachmann bill would make women listen to fetal heartbeat before an abortion\n\n\u200bWith her presidential campaign foundering, it appears that Michele Bachmann is getting back to her super crazy roots.\n\nShe's just introduced the \"Heartbeat Informed Consent Act\" to congress, a truly epic work of legislative lunacy.\n\nThe bill would require pregnant women to get an ultrasound and view the images before they're allowed to receive an abortion. The provider would also be required to describe any cardiac activity that they are able to observe in the ultrasound.\n\nFor women who are far enough along in the pregnancy, the act would go even further -- they'd be subjected to a \"hand-held Doppler fetal monitor\" in order to make the fetus's heartbeat audible. Only after this bizarre ritual would the provider be allowed to accept a woman's consent and perform the abortion.\n\n\"A pregnant woman who enters an abortion clinic is faced with a decision that will forever change two lives,\" Bachmann wrote in a statement. \"That's why she must have the very best information with which to make that decision.\"\n\nThe bill does allow for the woman to refuse to receive this best manipulation, by closing or averting her eyes, or ostensibly jamming her fingers in her ears.\n\nIn this nightmarescape, abortion providers would be fined up to $100,000 if they gave abortions without performing the ultrasound.\n\nIt is, of course, not lost on anyone that this is part of her last, desperate attempt to curry Evangelical favor, but it's also a healthy reminder of the old Michele we knew and loved -- the one who's headed right back home to us once this campaign finally dies.\n\nWe Recommend\n\nWomen need to start making informed decisions about abortion before rashly throwing a HUMAN life away. Stupidity begets ignorance, and not recognizing the potential of life in a fetus is exactly that. Thank God all your mothers weren't idiots otherwise you wouldn't be alive to spew your pro abortion idiocy.\n\nThey are already doing this in Oklahoma. The state pays for it. I don't understand how Republicans always cry \"Less Government\" but are okay with it all the way up inside themselves or their wives and daughters. This is Nazi behavior in the disguise of Christianity and it must be stopped.\n\nWow, really? Women need the government to step in and \"help\" make this decision? Talk about big-government intrusion. This is a decision between a woman and her doctor. Period. Why not also require men getting viagra to receive a lecture on how sex can lead to pregnancy?\n\nActually adults typically use good grammar and spell things correctly. A shorthand way of knowing its ok to ignore someone and their stupid opinions is when they make lots of spelling and grammar errors like you do. It's a sign you aren't very smart. You obviously aren't very knowledgeable or well read. Not only that but you are so lazy intellectually that you don't bother to do something as simple as proofread or check your spelling. Why would anyone listen to you when you don't even have enough respect for your audience to express yourself at a 6th grade level. It's pretty much the definition of stupid and tells everyone with a brain precisely why you think idiots like Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain are so great.\n\nBesides being utterly moronic, who is paying for the ultrasound? Maybe it would come out of some of the money Bachmann's family received for training staff at her husband's clinic or the farm subsidy money.\n\nWhy not require people to listen to the heartbeat of a loved one and look at the ultrasound before they donate organs?\n\nThe chances that they are caught is extremely low. The doctor is more likely to get caught then the individual. He or she won't be keeping records. Plus if they can't find a doctor there's ways to do it on their own.\n\nIt's a moral stance, because they won't be stopping abortions by making it illegal. Are they going to keep track of all doctor's visits that pronounce a patient pregnant to make sure it didn't end in abortion?\n\nOn Oct. 1st that law went into effect here in Texas - supported by Gov. Perry! Just before it became effective a federal judge struck down the forced sonogram portion. But there are still plenty of Draconian features that will amaze anyone who believes in a woman's right to make her own decisions. Who is it that wants government out of our private business? I guess that means only the \"business\" that gives the right to make money through deregulation and gutting the EPA\n\nCould there possibly be a more assured destruction for the gnarled and twisted dreams of the dominionists? With her at the helm, it would be like \"The Handmaid's Tale\" meets \"Mars Attacks\"......Oh, yikes...I STILL submit she'd have made one memorable POTUS.....No comedian worth his or her salt would have gone hungry during a Bachmann admin. Talk about a target-rich environment!!!Besides, a MILF.....as prez? Whew! I've got to sit down for a moment......\n\n\"Crazy\", \"lunacy\", \"bizarre ritual\", \"nightmarescape\"... We're talking about the termination of a human life, or at the very least, the termination of what would soon be a human life; and what the author finds so outrageous isn't the act itself, but the procedure to remind the mother of what exactly she's destroying.\n\nReally? You think this is a decision women enter into lightly? Women who abort have reasons-very good reasons-for their decision not to bring a child into this world. You think women who have an abortion don't realize what they're doing? That the minute they hear a heartbeat (if there even is one, as the most abortions are performed before a heartbeat can be detected) they'll think, OH, so that's what's in here? Bottom line, this is big-government intrusion into a private decision women and their doctors make. We don't need more \"women are stupid\" laws. Keep the government and its \"wisdom\" out of my body.\n\nif this wont alter women's decisions, and only gives them information they already have then it should not be a problem to you, if it does give a woman more perspective that leads her to alter her decisions than it has done good.\n\nI'll agree to this is Bachmann agrees to spend 20 minutes each listening to the life story of every small-time criminal, unemployed person and single mother she wants us to punish with legislation cutting social safety nets.\n\n\"In this nightmarescape, abortion providers would be fined up to $100,000 if they gave abortions with performing the ultrasound.\"I think you meant to say \"without\".

{"text": "Pro-life robbed Savita of her life.\n\nToday, we have learned that a woman died because she was refused an abortion. On the 28th October, 2012, Savita Halappanavar died because she was denied an abortion, because the foetus inside her still had a heartbeat, and in the country in which she sought treatment, a foetus has as much of a right to life as the woman carrying it. Even if that woman is miscarrying, so the foetus is not going to survive. Indeed, Savita's story proves that \"the woman carrying it\" is all any woman is, in the eyes of the lawmakers of the Republic of Ireland. Because they are, as Savita and her husband were repeatedly told, \"a Catholic country\". And abortion conflicts with their Catholic beliefs, which stress a \"pro-life\" stance. So Savita was allowed to die.\n\nNever again shall we use the term \"pro-life\" to describe those who believe that a foetus is a living thing, to the extent that they believe that abortion should be outlawed. There is nothing \"pro-life\" about condemning a woman to death in favour of a foetus that was never going to live in the first place. Now, we have no lives. No mother, no baby. There is absolutely nothing wrong with having a moral objection to the process of abortion, and believing that a foetus has a right to life and is alive earlier in development, but when medical and scientific consensus all suggest that there is nothing harmful or wrong about termination, there is absolutely no excuse for supporting a ban. If Ireland had legalised abortion, Savita would still be alive today. If you don't like abortion, don't get one, but recognise that some women need them. Some women fall pregnant when they did not intend to or did not want to be, and some women, like Savita, want to be pregnant, but encounter complications. No woman deserves to be punished for any of these things. Society has moved on a lot since laws on abortion were developed (1861 for Ireland); things have changed. Religion no longer holds the strong influence over people that it once did. Sex is no longer reserved for marriage, for the intention of procreation. People have sex whenever and with whoever they like, and sometimes things go wrong. There are undoubtedly people who do not like this, but it is not for them to enforce their will on the many who do like it. It is for them to modernise their society and laws to ensure that people are able to live their lives the way they want, in the safest way possible. We do not live in the 1800s anymore. How acceptable is it even for Ireland to describe itself as \"a Catholic country\" now, when not all of its citizens follow that religion (like Savita); expecting them to abide by rules created around that religion seems ridiculous and unnecessary. Or are we really in the game of punishing women for having sex, and punishing people from other religions for not being Catholic? Really, in the 21st Century?\n\nForcing women to carry through with pregnancies by keeping abortion illegal is safe for no one. Not even that precious life inside the womb that it is designed to save. Forcing women to carry through with a pregnancy they do not want is nothing but punishment. A punishment for failing as a woman. Because if she was a good woman, she wouldn't be having sex if she didn't intend to get pregnant, she wouldn't ever not want to be a mother, and nothing would go wrong. To many, a woman's existence is only to serve as an incubator for new life. Few punishments could be so expensive, so time-consuming, so life-changing, and so often so one-sided (for women), as childbirth and childrearing when it is unwanted. What prospects do you think that child is going to have?\n\nSavita Halappanavar had intended to be a mother, and she could not wait for the moment that she was. Savita Halappanavar was married. Savita Halappanavar did absolutely nothing wrong. Except what happened within her body that caused her to miscarry \u2013 things that were completely out of her control. But for that, she received a death penalty. How can abortion be viewed as anti-life, and an anti-abortion stance be viewed as pro-life, when it is the latter that caused the most tragic loss of life? It goes without saying that people will be calling for Ireland to change its abortion laws. It has no excuse. If the people don't want it, if the people are \"good\" Catholics, then they will have no use for it. But some women, like Savita, will have no choice. Let's care about them."}
{"text": "thatToday, the FDA still only recommends Mirena for women who have children, and doctors still work to deter childless women from choosing an IUD. When one friend approached her gynecologist about switching to an IUD, the doctor told her that she had a personal policy against prescribing the method to women not in monogamous relationships\u2014even though my friend reported that she understood the risks, has never contracted an STD, and always uses condoms. The implication is that some women are allowed to make their own choices about their reproductive health, and some aren't\u2014and only women who already have kids are allowed to risk never having any more.\n\nOf course, IUDs aren't for everyone. When the IUD was approved for childless women in 2005, usage rates jumped 160 percent. But the study found that women who choose IUDs still tend to be \"older, to have public health insurance, and to have more children,\" while the pill, the patch, and the ring remain more popular among women who have private health insurance and no kids. That leaves the IUD too expensive for the women who want it most and its use discouraged among the women who can actually afford it\u2014and U.S. unplanned pregnancy rates some of the highest in the developing world.\n\nFor women, social issues are economic issues\u2026Laws that limit reproductive health care have a direct effect on the economic lives of women. Without the ability to control and delay reproduction, it's incredibly difficult for women to pursue education, develop careers, and carve out fulfilling, independent lives. A personhood amendment would result in an unprecedented attack on women's privacy\u2014everything from birth control to a miscarriage could potentially be illegal\u2014and the absence of laws for fair pay would entrench the pay gap between men and women.\n\nQuestion: What does birth control do to a girl's body to make her not get pregnant?\n\nAnybody else ever get the feeling that hormonal birth control (like the pill) is nothing less than pharmacy-dispensed magic? You take a pill every day, and voila: you don't get pregnant. I totally remember feeling like that when I first used it. And while that was kind of cool, understanding the specifics of how birth control pills work made me feel more confident about using it and more aware of what was up with my body.\n\nSo how does hormonal birth control work? Different methods work in slightly different ways, but the basic gist is the same: hormones in the pill (or the shot, the ring, the patch, or any other kind of hormonal birth control) keep a woman's ovaries from releasing eggs \u2014 ovulation. No egg = no pregnancy. The hormones can also prevent pregnancy by thickening the cervical mucus, which can block sperm and keep it from joining with an egg.\n\nSome kinds of hormonal birth control \u2014 including the ring, the patch, and most pills \u2014use a combination of the hormones estrogen and progestin. Others use just progestin. A health care provider can talk with you about your body and your life, to help you figure out what kind of hormonal birth control might work best for you.\n\nI don't keep up with this blog as much as I probably should, so this might have already been asked or noted, but I was just curious\u2026. With the fight for contraceptives going on every day, shouldn't Griswold v. Connecticut be cited? (Connecticut law outlawed contraceptives, Supreme Court invalidated it on the grounds that it violated your right to marital privacy) It just seems silly that anyone would try to say that it's wrong, seeing as the Supreme Court already ruled it constitutional.\n\nI went to the expert on this one. Jessica Pieklo, my friend and a brilliant lawyer/teacher/writer, said this:\n\nIn short, yes Griswold answered the question of whether or not the states can criminalize contraception by holding that a married woman has the right to discuss family planning, and be prescribed contraception accordingly, as part of an overall right to privacy \u2014 this is how Griswold builds for Roe.\n\nSo, the short answer is yes, everyone who is reasonable including some anti-choicers thinks this is settled. Except the 10thers and the Operation Rescue crew who view Griswold as wrongly decided the same way you and I view Dred Scott as wrongly decided. So there's that issue.\n\nBut the rub here is that the personhood push, for example, doesn't talk about contraception and Griswold doesn't talk about personhood and the language in the bills are really tricky here\u2014see Missouri for a good example and why Oklahoma's failed. So anti-choicers see an opening where one doesn't exist but where Scalia, Alito, Thomas and Kennedy are most certainly willing to go, and where John Roberts would likely follow.\n\nWhatWhile I agree that trying to change the language of the \"War on Women\" to War on Uterus Bearers is ridiculous because it does define us by our body parts, I do not agree that we shouldn't try to find ways to more accurately describe this war. Because it is not just a war on cis-women. Even if Perry and Boehner aren't thinking about transgender people when they do something to attack reproductive rights, their actions still affect transgender people. The feminist moment continue to erase that.\n\nI don't want to erase anyone, but I also am tired of being attacked by trans* advocates(somehow, never by trans* people themselves) to be more inclusive. I don't feel like cis women and trans* women should be considered the \"same\" for (mostly) political reasons. Although we identify with the same \"gender\"(however useful that even is), we have radically different life experiences and I think it's a little weird to lump us all together. For me, it's important to recognize trans* people as an individual group that overlaps with my personal fight as a cis woman for rights, but is not necessarily fighting for everything I am, nor I them. It's not just a war on cis women or a war on trans* women, it's a war on everyone who is not a straight, white male, but just because we have the same enemies doesn't mean we have all the same motivations and goals.\n\nThanks for your response and clarification. I agree that we shouldn't be treating cis-women and trans* women the same. Having a reproductive justice movement or a feminist movement that includes trans* issues should not be about lumping all of us together or considering all of us the same. Most times though \"inclusion\" does lead to lumping everyone together and erasing differences in order to keep the focus on middle class white hetero cis-women. The erasing of our differences is a big reason that so many think this is a war on cis-women and politicians are only thinking of cis-women when they do this stupid crap. Wealthy white cis-women's voices are privileged in our movement and in the media. If we have failed to make our movement one that truly incorporates and takes seriously trans* issues then then why would politicians or the media ever address them?\n\nAnd let's get real here, most of the attacks by right-wing politicians aren't really directed at weatlhy hetero cis-women. Defunding Planned Parenthood, prohibiting government funding of contraception and abortion, opposing reauthorization of VAWA are clearly aimed at poor people, people of color, LGBT communities, and undocumented immigrants. Personally, I'm not ok telling all of these groups that they just don't fit in with my personal fight for my reproductive rights as a white cis-woman so they're on their own. Coalition building is key in pressuring these idiots to stop this crap. It's also incredibly important for pressuring them to enact policies and legislation that adequately address reproductive health, domestic violence, equal pay, etc. And of course in order to do that we must keep the differences visible so that we don't end up with policies and legislation that only address concerns of a particular segment of our movement. And it's not only important politically, but it's also the only way to build a more just society."}
{"text": "Fox News' Bill O'Reilly challenged Rick Santorum on his opposition to contraception last night, noting that the former senator's claim that states have the right to outlaw birth control is extreme and out-of-touch with the beliefs of most Americans. Santorum responded that while he disagrees with the use of birth control, he would not necessarily advocate for its repeal:\n\nO'REILLY: You say that the states should have the right to ban some contraception. That's right off the bat going to be a big one.\n\nSANTORUM: Well, the states have a right to do a lot of things. That doesn't mean they should do it. Someone asked me if the states have the right to do it? Yes. They have the right to do it, they shouldn't do it. I wouldn't vote for it if they did. It doesn't mean they don't have the right to do it. As you know, Bill, you're a Catholic, Catholic Church teaches contraceptive is something you shouldn't do. So when I was asked the question on contraception I said I didn't support it.\n\nSantorum is trying to distinguish his religious beliefs from his governing philosophy to suggest to moderate voters that while he personally opposes contraception, he would do little to limit women's access to it. But that's not entirely honest and here is why: Santorum does disagree with the Supreme Court's 1965 Griswold v. Connecticut ruling (which struck down a law that criminalized the use of contraceptives by married couples) and believes that the question should be left to the states. At the same time, however, he has also pledged to defund federal funding for contraception if elected president and publicly address the \"dangers of contraception in this country.\" \"It's not okay. It's a license to do things in a sexual realm that is counter to how things are supposed to be,\" the former Pennsylvania senator explained during one interview in Iowa. In other words, Santorum would not sit on his religiously-inspired anti-contraception beliefs \u2014 he would work to move federal policies and public beliefs"}
{"text": "The Virginia Tech community, along with the rest of the nation, spent yesterday reflecting on the extraordinary achievements of Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nHis words and acts continue to influence policies, debates and discussions in classrooms and congress alike. Civil rights activists seek to identify where King might have stood on an issue in the same way lawyers try to interpret what the founding fathers might have said about the Constitution. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day comes at a time when thousands of individuals are organizing in the streets in protest or support of the Roe v. Wade decision that took place on this day 35 years ago which made abortion a Constitutionally-protected right.\n\nWhile it has long been debated which camp King may have sided with in the current abortion debate, civil-rights activists should question what his response to Planned Parenthood's mission would have been had he fully known its agenda. Planned Parenthood, the largest provider of abortions in America, was founded by Margaret Sanger in 1916.\n\nSanger, an advocate of eugenics, sought to improve human hereditary traits by eliminating undesirable traits using abortion. In her words, we should rid the world of reckless breeding by making abortions accessible to those who are poor, blind, deaf, mute, epileptic, feeble-minded, mentally ill, diseased, imprisoned or alcoholic.\n\nBy providing abortions to these groups, Sanger believed she was helping rid the world of an unnecessary strain on humanity. She explained, \"we are failing to segregate morons who are increasing and multiplying . . . a dead weight of human waste . . . an ever-increasing spawning class of human beings who never should have been born at all\" (advocates for diversity must be squirming in their seats at those words). For this reason, Sanger founded Planned Parenthood in an effort to better humanity through selective breeding. To those who believe an organization's origins have a bearing on its current respectability, it is also interesting to note that Sanger didn't just stop at poor and diseased people in her crusade.\n\nSanger created the \"Negro Project\" which, in her words, helped educate the black community about better family-planning practices. Some argue, as she did, that this program was created to help the community overcome the economic stress created by unwanted childrenWow, is this article on the comedy page? Just what we'd expect from one sitting in the ivory tower of the economically privileged. Planned Parenthood provides low cost health care for those that don't have it available to them. Those are what you would call \"poor people.\" Can you relate?, I doubt it. In addition, Roe v. Wade didn't make abortion a constitutionally protected right. It confirmed an individual's constitutionally protected right to be free from government intrusion...to make their own health-care decisions. Planned Parenthood prevents more abortions than Operation Rescue, and any of its other related terrorist organizations, combined.\n\nOnce again, great Article Allison. I appreciate all the articles you have written. Keep up the great work. We need to stop Planned Parenthood from receiving federal money and shut the door on abortion. Here is a Roe v Wade IQ test people should take:  This might open their minds to what a desastrous policy it is and why it should be overturned.\n\nI don't even understand why abortion is still such a hot topic. Roe v. Wade will never be overturned. Yes, I am saying never and maybe I am wrong, but I don't think so. Look at how many decisions the Supreme Court has overturned... liberal or conservative. Furthermore, if you don't like abortion then don't get one. It's a right and controversial, no doubt, but it should be left up to each individual. There are so many more issues that should be at the forefront. i.e. look at the economy, you may not even be able to afford that abortion soon!\n\nThanks for this article. For Justthefacts: There are many many legal scholars, lawyers, and judges who have said that Roe V Wade was a bad ruling, even without political bias, because it essentially created a right (that of privacy) which was not actually in the Constitution implicitly or explicitly. The case should be re-examined and re-decided, pure and simple. And, while it may be true that the courts will never overturn their own poorly made decision, it is possible to add an amendment to the Constitution to protect the unborn. As for \"don't get one\" all I can say is this: if you don't like murder, don't commit one; if you don't like burglary, don't commit one; if you don't like embezzlement, don't commit it; if you don't like speeders, don't speed. These are all things that are illegal based upon some sense of morality. If these things can be made illegal because they are in someone's perspective \"immoral\" why should abortion not be added to the list? It's not as simple as \"don't get one\" if we consider the act itself as immoral. It is immoral, therefore it should be illegal. It is immoral because it is murder, the killing of a human being without due process or proper application of justice.\n\nMurder, burglary, embezzlement... illegal and immoral. Speeding, illegal, but don't see how it's immoral. And, look at how many people murder, steal, embezzle, and speed even though it's illegal. Even if abortion is made illegal it won't stop women from getting them. They will just get it done in a back alley. Abortion is sad, but again it should be left up to the individual.\n\nJonathan, I disagree that immoral acts ought to be illegal, as you suggest. In theory, the reason that murder is illegal is not because it is immoral, but because it infringes upon the Constitutional rights of others. The same is true of burglary and embezzlement. Once we accept the premise that all are created equal, one shouldn't need a \"moral compass\" to recognize that these actions ought to be illegal. As you point out, a primary problem with abortion is that many see it as murder. But the conclusion here shouldn't be to legislate based on morality; rather, we should be focused on interpreting what rights, if any, should be given to the unborn under the Constitution. As for speeding, that seems to be an example of the government seeing fit to create legislation it believes will benefit the overall safety of society. I doubt you'll hear too many people debating the morality of speeding.\n\nJonathan, you're putting the cart before the horse. Roe v. Wade didn't create any rights. In fact, no case-law creates rights, and the Constitution doesn't create any rights. The starting point is...you have the right to do everything, and to be free from anyone imposing on those rights. Now, the Constitution, and case-law, and statutes, go about listing many of your rights as \"self evident\" and placing restrictions on those rights. Thus, a right of privacy doesn't have to be implicitly or explicitly in the Constitution to be \"created.\" It already exists. Roe v. Wade just prohibits the Government from infringing upon it. (See Amendment IX of the Bill of Rights) And Jason T, there are no rights given to the unborn under the Constitution. They're not \"born\" so they're not citizens of the U.S. with protections equal to or greater than those supporting the fetus. (See Amendment XIV of the Bill of Rights).\n\nThe problem here, in my mind, is that (generally speaking) the same crowd clamoring for the rights of 'enemy combatants' who, they claim, are 'unlawfully detained' (but not US citizens in most cases) clamors to prohibit the unborn from having rights. Either the US Constitution applies exclusively to US Citizens or it doesn't, but you can't have it both ways. An accurate reading of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, actually, would sustain Roe v. Wade (Article XI does just this, per JustTheFacts); the problem with the caselaw is that the Supreme Court generated a right to privacy as part of an umbrella coming from the first and, I believe, 4th amendments. It is this 'umbreally' concept which many legal scholars find offensive, as it grants, to a large extent, the SCOTUS power to simply generate rights for the citizens. At the end of the day, the real trouble here is that abortion should have been a state issue (see Amendment X), but instead it wound up in Federal Court so the case was decided without proper standing. I am personally opposed to abortion, but I am even moreso opposed to federal powers overstepping their Constitutionally-appointed bounds of jurisdiction.\n\n\"Enemy combatants\" are non-citizens by definition pursuant to the Presidential Order; Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism, so no, I don't think that is a fair comparison. That is an issue relating to treaties, international law, or in rare cases, \"entitlements\" to rights of US Citizens because you happened to be arrested on US soil. The abortion issue is fairly summed up as: whether you or I (the government) can force another human being to gestate. The Courts don't generate rights. They simply point them out. It illustrates the Tao of rights. I try to force you to do something, and your right not to do it is defined.\n\nI don't disagree with your assertion regarding the nature of courts, but a careful reading of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights presents itself as a specific list of protections against Federal intrusion. My ultimate point is that the SCOTUS was out of its jurisdiction in ruling as it did in Roe, and even if it HAD been within its jurisdiction, its legal reasoning was faulty because of the invocation of the umbrella of rights concept. My personal feelings about abortion aside, the issue ultimaely should be hashed out (if anywhere) in the state legislatures, since the right to an abortion (and more broadly, the right to privacy) is not enumerated anywhere in the US Constitution or the Bill of Rights. Thus, it falls under the scope of the 10th amendment, and as such should be left to the states to decide. A lot of the philosophical end of the argument comes from a disagreement about when a fetus becomes a human (since we operate under the assumption that humans have rights, and this is what fundamentally separates them from fetuses). From this perspective, it seems logical to assert that perhaps abortion ought not be illegal any more than the removal of a tumor ought to be illegal, but in practice we as a society still have practices (or had practices) wherein a fetus is actually 'mostly delivered' (and so can ostensibly be called partially human - although, we might want to discuss whether having your feet still in the womb really disqualifies you from being a human), and yet we still condone abortions at this point (partial-birth abortion). It is interesting to note the principle of viability as well - can it be successfully argued that a viable fetus is, effectively, being detained and killed against its will simply because the mother will not let it out of her womb? This is to say, if the fetus is capable of living outside of the womb, but the mother would prefer an abortion, why is the fetus not given the option to decide for itself (through, of course, a court-appointed guardian)? Interesting philosophical questions.\n\nI love it when Kyle gets into these discussions. I was wrong to say \"created a right\" Kyle pretty much summed up what I meant to say but didn't. It's interesting that you should bring up citizenship and the 14th amendment TO the Bill of Rights in this discussion since I'm pretty sure it's illegal in this country to kill non-citizens. The discussion does not pertain to citizenship as much as to the philosophical and scientific question of what defines a human being. If we define a fetus as a human being, scientifically and philosophically, it should have a right to live as all human beings do, citizen and non-citizen (\"all men (humanity to the PC) are CREATED equal\" not \"All men are BORN equal\"). That inherent right should not be infringed upon by the Federal Gov't or by the States. And, if a fetus is indeed alive and a human being, the next question should be: does its right to live trump the \"right to privacy\" of the woman carrying it? Think logically on this one, it is an extremely fuzzy line to draw between life and \"non-life.\" It would be far better to err on the side of caution than have blood on your hands.\n\nThe joke is...that men apparently care about civil rights more than women do. \"Oh, whatever shall we do?!? (hanky wipe), burn our bras?\" How about mobilizing the female voting base? How about addressing the article in the name of sisterhood?...assuming Allison Aldrich is a female. Ah, easier to take a gender swipe. Whatever.\n\nJustthefacts: you obviously don't care more about civil rights than women do if you're going to take such an ignorant jab at feminists. Maybe women like myself waited a whole day to respond because we actually wanted to think about the article before reacting to it. I thought you had some decent points until that last post. My response to the article follows this post.\n\nFirst of all, I'll say that I have a pro-choice bias. That wasn't so hard was it? Maybe if everyone was straightforward about their opinions then we wouldn't have misleading articles like Allison Aldrich's. I wouldn't mind reading an intelligent, well-supported pro-life argument in the paper but this is nothing short of pure slander. Allison Aldrich goes from MLK to abortion in some sort of unintelligible stream-of-consciousness and ends up saying that all of the Planned Parenthood clinics are run by murderous racists. Now I have no idea what MLK would say about abortion, but I know he was intelligent enough to listen to both sides of an argument before verbally bombing Planned Parenthood. Her \"theory\" is that we should drop Planned Parenthood, an organization providing reproductive health care and family counseling to low-income women who can't afford it, because it has a vague past connection to eugenics. That's like saying we should dismiss everything in the Constitution because the founding fathers were racist and *#*ist (apparently the CT doesn't allow the \"s\" word.) News flash: everything that occurred in the late nineteenth through the early twentieth century was at least somehow influenced by eugenics. Does that mean we should ditch women's right to vote as well? Eugenics was a massive pseudoscientific movement that affected a lot of otherwise decent human beings. It is in no way related to the mission or services performed by Planned Parenthood: an organization providing information and counseling to women more often than it provides abortions. How does this fit into the Planned Parenthood eugenics conspiracy? Are they counseling them to death? The eugenics movement is guilty of forced sterilization and genocide; regardless of political or philosophical leanings, I think we can all agree that Planned Parenthood is not guilty of either of these crimes. Aldrich also claims that Planned Parenthood targets low-income women and women of color. Her only supporting evidence is that Planned Parenthood's are placed in inner cities and most of the women seeking services are from low-income neighborhoods. Planned Parenthoods are opened to all women seeking help regardless of socioeconomic situation. Since middle to upper class white women are not the majority of women seeking the services of Planned Parenthood, this organization ensures that it is accessible to the population of women who historically have needed it the most.\n\nI have an anti-government-oppression bias. One other point, Planned Parenthood, being a completely under-funded organization that provides free and low cost health care--in other words--not a money making operation, is located in \"inner\" cities and low-income neighborhoods because the real estate is cheaper there. It's not some sort of master plan. It's economic reality. And Planned Parenthood has a hard time leasing...because there are people like Eric Rudolph out there. Landlords don't like their property to be targeted by the psychos.\n\nJust another thought about the article: Ms. Aldrich quotes a note from Sanger to Dr. Clarence Gamble about not wanting people to think that extermination of the black population is the goal. Ms. Aldrich takes this to mean, \"eradicating black people is the goal, but we must cover it up.\" It seems to me that the statement could just as easily read, \"we don't want to eradicate the black race, but just in case people mistakenly think that, please reassure them that we are providing a service to them.\" It doesn't seem unlikely to me at all that black citizens in the early 20th century would be wary of the intentions of such an organization, so such reassurance may have been appropriate. As for the KKK reference, Sanger's statement is not necessarily incriminating. She uses a basic \"any press is good press\" argument as justification for spreading her ideas to anyone who will listen. I realize that many of Ms. Sanger's views are now dated, but let's take a moment to recognize that there are different ways to interpret these statements.\n\nJust a note on facts; neither Margaret Sanger did not endorse abortion and indeed she wrote that \"care is the only cure for abortions.\" Planned Parenthood endorsed abortion only years after Sanger's death. Additionally, numerous civil rights figures did endorse Sanger's efforts including \"The Amsterdam News\" of Harlem, The Urban League, the Abyssinian Baptist Church, W.E.B. DuBois and, perhaps surprisingly considering the basis for this article, Martin Luther King who praised her efforts for the minorities of New York City.\n\nWow, great editing. I'm surprised the CT doesn't come out and say that Jesus endorsed abortion. \"True, the Son of man is going away, just as it is written concerning him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been finer for him if that man had not been born.\" (Matthew 26:24, Mark 14:21)\n\nYes, but Doug, that doesn't necessarily equate to her saying that we should eradicate the black race. As I understand it, eugenics seeks to eliminate the \"unwanted\" element of our population. If even the parents-to-be don't want these aborted children, why should the rest of society? While it seems that you're trying to use this quotation to shock us about Ms. Sanger's callous attitude, her point is very accurate, almost to the point of being self-evident.\n\nBy the way, Matt's point is excellent. It is so often overlooked that most women probably never \"want\" an abortion. For many women, it is a way to try to make the best of a bad situation. But no matter which side of the issue you're on, I think you'll agree that the ideal solution is to eliminate the NEED for abortions by eliminating unwanted conceptions.\n\nMy comment is better late than never.\nSanger practiced with and studied under Hitler's doctors. She\nwas for the elimination of imperfections. Her life is not a shining example for those of the nursing profession. Is not Eugenics and Planned Parenthood really rather the same concept, with implied differences?\nCan you trust the words of someone who had no regard for the most helpless of our species, whose own organization used the word \"baby\" in their family planning fliers circa\nlate 50's and early 60's without the term \"fetus\" or \"product of conception\".\nI do believe that she felt that all black women should be\nplaced on the table and sterilized. I believe this was quoted in a biographical text.\nWithout dispute, abortion stops a Beating Heart, no matter what race.\n\nDefinitely <a href=\" choice inexpensive Diablo 3 Gold on bankofd3.com</a><a href=\" title=\"swtor credits buy\">swtor credits buy</a>\n\nIt\u02c7s really a nice and useful piece of info.

{"text": "Abortion is a sin never use those words to describe it...but I do think its wrong.Especially when people use abortion as a form of \"birth control\" (Iv seen it happen).\nIv never read the bible,so I dont know about where it would say that...but Im asuming that way back then,it didnt even exsist so why would it even be in there kwim?\n\nIt's doesn't. The belief that the bible itself forbids abortion is a myth. In fact, the bible never once touches on the issue of abortion, although abortion was not at all uncommon at the time. In at least one place in the bible, it can be argued that a fetus was not considered endowed with the same rights of personhood. (Exodus 21:22) Although I do believe that different denominations interpret that passage differently, while other denominations will maintain that the Old Testament was an Old Law and therefore no longer relevant. But, if that is the case, then the fact that the Bible never again mentions abortion (again, although it was certainly a consideration in that time) can be somewhat construed as significant.\n\nWhich only leaves the commandment \"Thou Shalt Not Kill\", which is a rule that every society can agree with. No one can deny that the taking of another's life is reprehensible, regardless of religious beliefs. But, it can also be argued that one cannot break the commandment if there is not person that has been killed. The theological challenge here has been to find Biblical text that will definitively declare when a fetus becomes ensouled, and then, by Biblical standards, a person.\n\nWhere I've read and been told that some Christians will argue that when ensoulment (or the becoming of a person) is irrelevant because the zygote is still human life and so killing it is wrong. But, it's relevant to note that the Hebrew term for this commandment is rasach which most accurately translated means \"murder\" and is in itself a relative term. At the time of the commandments many forms of killing were considered legal and according to Biblical texts God sanctioned Israel permisson to kill - including men, women, children and infants.\n\nWhich then brings us to Levitical law (OK, I know, NO ONE is surprised I made it back to law in this topic ) Levitical law in the Bible has huge gaps and is it is acknowledged by theologians that the levitical law is incomplete. So, if abortion was ever a part of Levitical law, we'll never know what it was exactly.\n\nWe can, however, in these instances, look to Jewish law to find out what the rules/laws for the time were to get some idea.\n\nEven under most Christian interpretations, life for Adam began not when God created his body, but when he gave Adam the breath of life.\n\nAnd then, we've come full circle to the body/soul dichotomy. The flesh is transient, but the soul everlasting. But if the soul is everlasting, then what harm to the soul if the corporeal being is disposed of?\n\nAnd, now, I am off to read more from my theology texts to see read up on this some more. I remember this being a huge topic in my classes at the time.\n\nETA: It's interesting to note that abortion was never outlawed by a church (or the church forbid the practice of abortion) as part of it's dogma until 1581AD, when it was rescinded three years later. It wasn't religiously outlawed again until 1891AD and that was a political move, not on the religious and biblical basis***...\n[/b][/quote]\n\nHey, don't blame me. I didn't write Jewish law.\n\nETA - I do believe though that while the mourning of one under the age of thirty days is not allowed that the beliefs in most sects of Judaism is now that it is a person when the head emerges from the womb, or something similar. I'm not a Jewish scholar, by any means, but I do think that is the belief of most.[/b]\n\nI don't think anyone who has an abortion doesn't have respect for life. I'm pro-choice but I have a huge amount of respect for life.\n\nI pic and choose from the Bible anyway, but just for the hell of it...\n\nWhat about the passage(s)--I don't remember which one--that states that God made the person while in the womb...\n\nEdited because one of my letters is not wor_ing (see?) so I just edited the word out (it produced an entirely different word).[/b]\n\nPsalms\nThis is part of a Psalm of David's. The idea of being woven from the earth was not unique to David, and was actually a common belief about pregnancy throughout the lands at that time. Much of Israel, including it's most respected philosophers (Heck, even Plato believed) that infants were woven together from the soil underground and were then somehow - magically, mystically, supernaturally, and for David apparently, divinely, lifted from the ground into the mother's womb fully formed.\n\nOn it's own, however, the passage itself is not indicative of God's command against abortion. Merely David's belief that God had a hand in his underground formation [/b]\n\nI missed this while responding earlier. Again, I'm not an expert on Judaism. I was referencing Jewish law that was known to be common at that time. I do believe (although I don't know for certain) that Judaism (although my understanding is that different sects have slightly different beliefs) that life begins when the child exits the womb - or something to that effect. I've no idea what the current belief on mourning is.\n\nJudiasm truly prohibits the mourning of a miscarriage/stillbirth/neonatal death?? I have never got that impression from any of Sharon's posts. [/b]\n\nNo, of course not. It's a loss and you're allowed to mourn it. I think the confussion lies in the laws of mourning in Judaism. When a person dies, the direct relatives (paretns, siblings, spouse and children) sit \"shivah\" for 7 days. That's the mourning period according to Jewish Law and this period has its own set of rules and traditions. It is a way of helping the mournesrs get back together, but spiritually speaking, it's also a way to help the departed's soul to reach its place in the World to Come.\nSince a newborn (up to a child under 13, I think) doesn't require that aid, as it goes directly to \"Heaven\" (for lack of a better word), those 7 days aren't needed, therefore the mourners only observe the laws of shivah for 1 day. That doesn't mean that they're not allowed to mourn, and a newborn is certainly buried\n\nROFLOL, I can't help but laugh at your K problem... sorry... back to the topic... a very interesting conversation[/b]\n\nI didn't know if anyone would understand what was going on! lol\n\nQuote:\n\nWhile the Bible doesn't have the word \"abortion\" in it there are instances where it is clear that God is intimately involved in the creation process of an unborn child. \"Before I formed you in the womb I new you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.\" Jer. 1:5 LikewiseJesus emphasizes the importance of allowing little children to come to him. How can they if they aren't given a chance to come into this world?[/b][/b]\n\nExcept that, in a historical biblical sense, this passage was designed to address one specific person, Jeremiah, who was called upon by God to be a prophet and do miraculous works through his powers as a prophet to the world. In this instance, God was addressing the one man, not all men. In context of much of the bible, God is very specific when addressing a singular person versus the whole of mankind. In the simplest of terms (assuming that we pick and choose which half of the bible one should adhere to - OT or NT - and the book of Jeremiah is OT) then we can discount this as a message to all for what is expected of them on the basis that not all of man is pre-ordained to be a prophet of God.\n\nAlso, in 2 Chronicles 28 God is speaking about the people he had cast out of Israel who were killing their children in the name of a false god. It was all of their actions combined which led God to tell the people they were to do none of these things in the name of worshiping false gods. The man in question, IIRC, is King Azah (spelling questionable here) who did evil things in defiance of God."}

The burden of proof here is on those who say the unborn child isn't a human being to prove their point, but this has turned out to be such an illogical position that those on the forefront of the pro-abortion movement have long since given it up and freely admit it's a human being, just not one worthy of all the rights of any other human being.\n\nABortion was illegal before, and it did not backfire. There were far fewer abortions then than there were after it was legalized. There were not nearly as many deaths as you've been led to believe- not much different than there are now. The inflated numbers were completely made up by pro-abortionists, as we learned later when some of them left the pro-abort ranks and became pro-lifers.\n\nProhibition banned ALL drinking, including a glass of wine with dinner, which never killed anybody. Drunk driving is not an issue about drinking, it's drinking too much. It's still not the equivalent of abortion. Abortion kills somebody just about 100 percent of the time- that's the GOAL. When it fails, there are some candidates who want that child killed anyway.\n\nBy this reasoning, we should have no laws against anything.\n\nStrawmen: pro-life people believe women who have abortions are cold and unfeeling; when a mother dies in a back alley abortion it satisfies the sense of justice in those who disagree with you and does not horrify their sense of compassion; back alley deaths occurred in significant amounts before Roe V. Wade but don't now.\n\nI am terribly sorry when anybody dies, including a woman who is having an abortion, and in fact, the Pro-life community (those who do not vote for people who are in favor of partial birth abortion and against the Infants Born Alive act) have a long and vigorous history of being there to support and help women, including those who have fornicated. And some of their most passionate members are those who have had abortions themselves and know what a horrible thing was done to them.\nBut it's murder. And I have no obligation before God or anybody else to make sure somebody has a safe and risk free place to commit murder. When a woman dies in an abortion it is NOT compassionate to say, \"Oh, dear, we must make abortion safer and regulate it.\"\nCompassion would be to do what the pro-life community does- seek to educate people about the risks and dangers in ANY abortion (it's not possible to meke it a 'safe' procedure), about the very real humanity of that unborn child, and to continue to offer support, nurture, housing, food, job training, medical care, counseling, clothing, and more (all of which the pro-life community does, in spades, to women to alleviate the conditions that made some of them think an abortion was their only option.\n\nFrom everything I've heard, the reason for the failure of the bans on second and third trimester is because exception clauses are not added for \"medical necessity.\" If such an exception were given, the legislation would easily pass.\n\nNot true. Pro-life legislators have been more than willing to make exceptions for 'medical necessity,' even for rape and incest simply to be pragmatic (that would account for approximately 2 percent of all abortions). The failure of the bans on second and third trimester abortions are because pro-life people don't want exceptions made for the 'health' of the mother- a weasel word term that doesn't have to have anything to do with medical necessity at all. It can (and has been) used to justify abortions for any reason at all.\n\nPartial birth abortions, for another example, are not EVER medically necessary, and a number of Democrats have been willing to ban them. Some couldn't even bring themselves to vote against them. Fortunately, those who recognized it for what it is, infanticide, finally prevailed and it is now illegal.\nAnd the Infant Born Alive Act, of course, wouldn't in any way harm a woman's health since the baby is already born, yet Obama could not bring himself to vote for even that modicum of protection for babies who have already been born.\n\nIt's foolish to be a single issue voter. You should look at other issues besides abortion and vote based on other policies.\n\nHonestly, this to me is like arguing that if we lived in Nazi Germany it would be acceptable to vote for a Goebbel or a Hitler because we agree with their other policies, just not their genocidal goals, or to vote for pro-slavery factions in the antebellum era because outside of seeking to enslave people based on race, a politician might just on the same side as you on otherissues.\n\nThe HG points out: \u2013 that is rather what happened with Germany\u2026 My WWII professor was a grad student in the 1960s. He spent some time studying in Germany and asked some of his friends' parents why they had supported Hitler. \"People had jobs,\" was one woman's response. What is abortion? The intentional killing of an unborn child \u2013 the circumstances leading up to it do not change what it IS. What is intentional killing? Murder. It is a fundamental part of your basic social contract for murder to be illegal.\n\nMaking abortion illegal is incompatible with preferring small government, so you're a hypocrite:\nMaking abortion illegal is not remotely incompatible with small government. I want murder to be illegal. Why this one particular issue? People drink and drive and kill people. But good luck getting Prohibition back.\n\nIllogical. People don't drive and kill somebody because they had a sip of wine or a swallow of beer. They kill people when they have drunk to excess. And killing people? It's illegal- unless they are babies.\nAbortion is 'this one issue' because it's murder, and drinking is an irrelevant issue because it's not.\n\n\"I just don't see how trying to provide a political fix really solves the problem. You're still going to have women in precarious positions\"\n\nWho is arguing that making murder of the unborn illegal is the ONLY TOOL to address the problem? It is one important tool in a wide assortment of approaches.\n\nThese are all strawmen: \"You're still going to have women in precarious positions.\n\nAnd who is going to be there for them then, especially if the legislation gets passed and the issue is nationally forgotten?\n\nOr do we just thrust them out on their own to try to figure it all out?\n\nYes, people need to be held accountable for their mistakes\u2026but just leaving people to multiply in squalor in poverty does not satisfy the other aspects of Jesus' purposes for us. \"\n\nThe ugly and hostile assumptions you make here about the pro-life community simply do not reflect reality. The same people will be there for them then who are there for them now and who were there for them before- Crisis pregnancy centers, homes for unwed mothers, private citizens who reach out to help, adoption agencies, all these were available before, they're available now, and I have no doubt that they are not going to go away.\nAnd none of this alters the reality of what abortion IS- the murder of a child. It is also harmful to women- women who have had abortions have higher rates of infertility and breast cancer later, as well as higher risks of complications in later pregnancies, and mental health problems associated with the anguished regrets when a woman who chose abortion because she believed it was just a 'blob of tissue' learns that it was, in fact, a baby. In no way does the current legal situation help women.\n\nI don't know of anybody who advocates 'just thrusting them out on their own to figure it out' except abortion advocates who object to full disclosure requirements.\n\nNor is this about 'holding people accountable for their actions.' Fornication is a sin, not pregnancy. Some people fornicate and never get pregnant- they are separate issues. This is about protecting innocent human beings from being murdered. And that does not equate to 'leaving people to multiply in squalor and poverty.'\nThe Equuschick: I have heard this argument before, and on the one hand I see where it is coming from. I sincerely agree that the best way to reduce abortions is to change hearts before legislation, but to argue from that to say it is unnecessary (or even detrimental) to change legislation is seriously flawed logic. If people want abortions, I agree they're going to get them whether they're legal or not. But if someone wants to murder their spouse, they'll do it. Would you also argue that there's no point in having laws against spouse-killing? The point of a law, in the end, is not prevention. The point of the law is force and retribution. It isn't pretty. But it is the way the world works, and frankly the way God set it up. We as individuals have an oblgiation to be compassionate to every one in need, and I wouldn't care two cents if she was a pregnant prostitue I would still have a God-given obligation to be compassionate, loving, caring and supportive. But collectively, I do believe Christians have a responsibility to see to it that in this case principle becomes law. Will the law eliminate abortions? No one is naieve enough to suggest that, but again you're missing the point of the Rule of Law itself.\n\nMe: I actually don't agree that if people want abortions they are going to get them anyway. Some people will, but if abortion were illegal the number of abortion related deaths would be drastically reduced (because I count the babies in abortion related deaths). A useful tool in the hands of abusers, one used to hide their crimes, would be taken away from them, and young women would be protected from those who coerce them into getting an abortion. There's a reason why large numbers of young men are pro-choice and it's not because they want to protect women.\n\n11 Comments\n\nI'll always been irritated by the \"you can't argue against abortion unless you are pay for the pregnancy/raise the child\". I've never heard anyone say you can't speak out about wife beating unless you are willing to bring a battered woman and her children into your home.\n\nI don't want to argue abortion with you-we already know where we stand. But I will argue with the statement that intentional killing is murder. Intentional killing might be murder, but it also might be justifiable homicide, such as in self defense or defense of another. I think it weakens your argument to conflate the two.\n\nI think the argument you are making is that abortion is murder, but by defining all intentional killing as murder you are weakening your argument. I don't want to argue your definition of abortion, just point out that not all intentional killing is murder.\n\nNot seeing how the argument is weakened at all. Justifiable homicide has no place in this discussion, so it's a red herring. In what universe is the slaughter of an innocent baby justifiable homicide?\nAll intentional killing of children is murder.\n\nOkay, how about this? Intentional killing of a helpless unborn baby is murder. How can it possibly weaken the argument when there is no possible way anyone could think that it is justifiable homicide to KILL A HARMLESS BABY?\n\nYou raise so many valid points here. Two women that I know have had abortions because of pressure from the baby's father.(I may know other women who have had abortions who haven't told me about it) One was in a live-in, non-marital relationship with an older, divorced man. They had a 7 YO son together and he had 2 grown kids with the ex-wife. When I first got to know this woman, she would talk about how much she hoped to have a little girl some day. About a year later, she did get pregnant, but had an abortion because her boyfriend \"didn't want any more kids.\" Another friend had two children with her live-in boyfriend and when she conceived a third, he told her if she didn't \"get rid of it\" he'd push her down the stairs. Instead of getting out and getting help, she gave in.\n\nSee, here's what gets me. Most people do not really truly in their hearts believe a fetus is just a lump of tissue to be disposed of at will. If they did, they wouldn't disapprove of things like sex-selective abortions, or a (hypothetical) woman who had several abortions in a short time span. If an abortion is \"just another medical procedure\", than it shouldn't matter why someone has it done, or how often. It would be like having your hair cut. But it isn't like that, even for those who support abortion \"rights.\" Most pro-choice people have beliefs about what might justify an abortion- rape, incest, a baby that's less-than-perfect, medical risk to the mother*- but by the very fact that a justification is needed, it's obvious that it ISN'T like any other medical procedure.\n\n*I had a family member tell me and my DH after her 2nd C-section that her doctor told her if she got pregnant again too soon (I think she said within a year) She would HAVE to terminate because it would kill her. I wonder how many wanted babies are killed because of advice like this\u2026.\n\nI've done some other posts on that idea- that people who claim it's just tissue really know better. If it's just a lump of tissue, it's no different than gall bladder surgery, really, adn nobody should ever take offense at photographs of gall bladders that have been removed, so why are they so outraged by photographs of aborted babies? Because they know those are really babies.\n\nHowever, our culture is shifting ever downwards, and there are growing numbers of pro-aborts who will cheerfully admit that of course it's a human baby, but so what, it doesn't have the right to continue living in its mother's womb. Many of those who today insist that it's just tissue will be acknowledging and than ignoring the fact that it's a baby just a year or two from now- and they will never note the tragic irony of their shifting position, or the reality that this shift proves it was always about abortion and never about protecting women.\n\nThe real point we must focus on is the one defining question between the pro choice and the pro life movement. That question is whether or not it is a human life when they are in the womb. From the moment of conception regardless of how developed the child may be, it is a real human life. There has been proof of this all over the place. Most think that it is not a human life unless it can walk or talk. A human life is a human life whether he or she is in a mother's stomach or out-and-about walking and talking. Having an abortion is killing a baby no matter the age. Would you kill a toddler?\nHere is some proof of events supporting the theory that a human life is a human life from the moment of conception."}
{"text": "Is murder now a viable political tool in this country?\n\nMY NEWHERO\n\nDr. Mila Means\n\nThe one sure way to get what you want is to murder those on the other side of the debate.\n\nRachel Maddow\n\nThat abortion is and remains a divisive issue in this country is hardly newsworthy. That anti-choice zealots kill abortion providers is nothing new. That these same zealots ignore the rule of law in order to pursue their narrow agenda is something that should send chills up the spine of every American, regardless of where they happen to come down on the abortion debate.\n\nRoe v. Wade is settled law, having established a woman's right to a safe, legal abortion in 1973. The law aside, however, there remains a dedicated cadre of zealots who hold their narrow beliefs to be morally superior and sanctioned by God. To their way of thinking, the imprimatur of the Almighty elevates their beliefs over all other considerations- even the law of the land. Many of these folks are the same people who demand \"smaller government\", the idea that we should get government out of our lives. Incredibly, and not at all hypocritically, they find the idea of government policing the reproductive functions of American women to be perfectly acceptable.\n\nRemember, when Liberals do it, it's \"government overreach\". When Conservatives do it, it's \"standing up for the unborn\"\u2026.\n\nGranted, no reasonable person wants to see abortions taking place. In a perfect world, every baby would be born into an environment in which they could count on being wanted, cared for, and loved. Sadly, this is not the case, which, odious as it may seem, necessitates the need for Roe v. Wade. In a country that exists largely because of the rule of law, this should be taken as a matter of course\u2026unless you're an anti-choice zealot who feels that your moral outrage trumps everything, including the rule of law.\n\nWhen will women FINALLY be disabused of the silly notion that they should be entrusted with the ability to make decisions regarding their own reproductive functions? When will women realize that the people in the best position to make these decisions are wealthy, well-fed, Socially Conservative White Males who believe that women are merely sperm receptacles and vessesl for the propagation of the species?\n\nWhen God is on your side, it seems that any means for achieving your desired end is acceptable- even up to and including murder. How bad have things become? How about so bad that now a state (in this case South Dakota) is considering a bill that would allow for the idea of \"justifiable homicide\" to prevent abortions from taking place. Yes, despite the fact that abortions are legal under Roe v. Wade, South Dakota is seriously considering legislation that would seem to provide official sanction for killing abortion providers. Though those behind the bill will pooh-pooh this notion, I'm not certain how else you could interpret this bill.\n\nNow, it seems South Dakota is willing to legalize acts of terror in order to be the number one anti-abortion state in the U.S. The South Dakota House is taking up a bill to redefine \"justifiable homicide\" that may \"make it legal to kill doctors who perform abortions,\" Mother Jones reports. Passed out of committee on a 9-3 party line vote, the GOP-backed bill \"could in theory allow a woman's father, mother, son, daughter, or husband to kill anyone who tried to provide that woman an abortion \u2014 even if she wanted one.\"\n\nIdeology and my considered opposition to everything the zealots stand for aside, I really do have to commend them for their strategy and their commitment to it. Yes, it's odious, anti-American, and anti-Christian, but those who oppose abortion in any shape, manner, or form have adopted an ingenious three-pronged strategy:\n\nGiven that Roe v. Wade is settled law, the odds of overturning it are somewhere between slim and none\u2026not that the anti-choice zealots are worried about this, mind you. No, they have no intention of destroying a woman's right to an abortion with the sledgehammer blows of a frontal assault. What they have in abundance is commitment, patience, and a complete and total disdain for anything that falls outside their narrow agenda. They will picket, harrass, and agitate- hey, ain't free speech grand?- as long as they need to in order to frighten, intimidate, and wear down their adversaries. You don't need to worry about laws when those you oppose and despise are too intimidated to avail themselves of their legal rights. Freedom isn't destroyed by sledgehammer blows; it's nibbled away piecemeal by rubber mallets.\n\nOn the legal front, anti-choice zealots are taking on Roe v. Wade in an exceedingly oblique manner. Rather than work to overturn Roe v. Wade, anti-choice zealots and their Republican comrades are working to eradicate a woman's right to abortion through the legal equivalent of sawing the legs off the table. By tinkering around the margins, passing laws that place ever more egregious and inconvenient roadblocks in the path of a woman seeking an abortion, the result is that the legal right to an abortion becomes increasingly more challenging\u2026and eventually irrelevant.\n\nFor those will to bear any burden and overcome any obstacle to prevent women from having access to abortion services, there's still the time-honored (and effective) method: murdering abortion providers. Those who've committed murder in the service of the cause (Paul Hill, Scott Roeder, etc, ad nauseum) are considered to be heroes by those completely dedicated to the cause. That murder is against the law (and violates one of the Ten Commandments) seems not to matter to these zealots, who consider murder in the \"defense\" of the unborn to be both justifiable and righteous.\n\nBefore long, a woman's right to an abortion will be rendered moot, and Roe v. Wade, while still the law of the land, will be rendered completely irrelevant. While abortion will still technically be legal, in a practical sense obtaining an abortion will be an impossibility. A woman's legal right to an abortion will have succumbed to a war of attrition. It may not happen tomorrow, next week, or next year\u2026but it WILL happen. And then the zealots will finally have achieved their victory and eliminated the silly notion that women deserve to have control over their bodies."}

I'd like you to think long and hard about that answer because there have been some extremely brutal cases of rape (one in particular in Knoxville) and I'm curious as to if that woman had survived and was pregnant that you would insist she carry that child to term.\n\nThis whole discussion is pointless.

I would hope I would be loving enough to give it up, but abortion would be out of the question for me. There are too many couples in America who would love a baby. It must be hell for them not to be able to get pregnant, and an equal hell to read about women who carelessly throw a child into the trash can because they want to keep their figure, (or whatever selfish reason).\n\nI answered you about the \"carrying to term\".

{"text": "Abortion: Legal, Medical, and Historical Perspectives\n\nThursday, April 14, 1966\n\nThis episode is from the WNYC archives. It may contain language which is no longer politically or socially appropriate.\n\nModerator Lee Graham\n\nOpens with quote from a New York Times article calling \"New York's 83 year old abortion law cruel and unrealistic in common with the laws of most other states it prescribes that an abortion can only be performed if the mother's life is in danger. This restriction is among the principle reasons why more than a million illegal abortions are performed every year in this country bringing death or lifelong injury to thousands of young mothers.\" The New York Assembly has decided to hold public hearings on this problem.\n\nThis episode of Maincurrents aims to provide legal, medical and historical information on abortion so that listeners may form their own opinion on the topic.\n\nGuests include Alfred Julien, New York attorney; Dr. Robert Hall, President of the Association for the Study of Abortion, and Lawrence Lader, author of the forthcoming book \"Abortion.\"\n\nDr. Hall expresses his concerns that the current law prevents physicians from practicing \"good medicine.\" Protecting the life of the mother is too narrow, he believes protecting the health of the mother should also be protected.\n\nThey then go on to discuss the difficulties of quantifying \"hidden\" activities. Though there are 8,000-10,000 hospital abortions per year, 1 million illegal abortions is only an estimate.\n\nJulien believes this is a bad law because of the restrictive language which has lead to millions of illegal abortions.\n\nFinally, Lader, who previously wrote a biography of Margaret Sanger and the birth control movement. He considers the current laws defy a woman's basic right to decide if she should or should not become a mother. It is a basic human right that cannot be taken away from her.\n\nThe panel go on to discuss proposed changes in the law, which allow for a \"therapeutic abortion,\" that allow for abortion in cases of protecting mental health, and for cases of incest or rape. Likewise, if the child may be born with major birth defects abortion may be considered.\n\nBirth control was once totally illegal, however in 1936 there was a complete reversal of the federal birth control law.\n\nThere is further discussion of cases when a child's birth defects may warrant the termination of a pregnancy.\n\nLader notes the right of the mother to bring into the world children she can care for.\n\nThe speakers note the opposition's view that life begins at the moment of conception and that that life has rights (perhaps even constitutional rights?).\n\nLader goes on to describe the historical aspects of abortion. He argues that abortion was not always a crime (and is not a crime in Japan and parts of Europe). Abortion was outlawed as the power of the Roman Catholic church grew. Reference to St. Augustine saying that the male fetus has a soul 40 days after conception, while the female fetus has a soul 90 days after conception. He moves on to discuss early American laws related to abortion, based on English law. No state passed a law outlawing abortion before quickening until about the Civil War, the laws of this era were mild.\n\nThey speak of various religious groups views of abortion. Specifically mentioned are the views of Catholic and Orthodox Jews, as well as protestants.\n\nThey then move on to discuss various country's laws - Japan and the Communist countries where abortion is legal and the Scandinavian countries where abortion laws are very liberal.\n\nDistinctions in opinion are made between abortion based solely on the woman's choice vs. those based on the outlined criteria. The panelists disagree on how liberal laws should be.\n\nLader is passionately pro-choice and states that the women of America should be \"out in the streets screaming like they did for the vote"}

{"text": "Thursday, 12, so before you start calling me murderer, hear me out on my reasons for agreeing with this practice.\n\nVisualize this scenario. A patient has a terminal disease, and everything's been tried to promote recovery, to no avail. The patient is in pain, he/she's been given medications to ease the pain but nothing works, and so every waking hour of every day, the patient has to suffer in great agony.\n\nAfter a couple of days, the patient falls into a coma and is being kept alive by medical machinery. The family of this patient has tried everything and spent every single penny on the patient's treatment and hospitalization. The doctors say that there is no hope for him/her and so the family had two choices: let the patient die slowly or help them die faster, a good death, a painless death.\n\nRegardless of the hardships and sadness, the family comes to a decision, and they ask the doctors to pull the plug on the machines that are keeping the patient alive. With great sadness and heaviness in their hearts, they watch as the patient takes there last breath and die as if he/she were still asleep.\n\nThe family had the option of keeping the patient alive for his/her last moments, but then they remembered the screams and painful moaning of the patient who would, every day, wake up to pain and sleep with pain. They wanted the patient to die a good death, a death that kept the patients dignity in tact and untouched.\n\nMany people didn't agree with the family's decision to help terminate their family member's life who was already doomed to begin with. They were called murderers by many of them, but they didn't pay mind to their snide remarks and painful accusations because deep down they know that their family member was suffering on a daily basis at the last moments of his/her life. Deep down they feel that they made the right choice, though it was a painful one.\n\nWould you agree with this family's decision or would you be one of the people that accuse them for murder?\n\nAre we playing the role of G-d when we make such a decision like terminating a dying human's life? My answer is that no, we aren't playing G-d because the person's fate was already decided by G-d. By practicing euthanasia, we're merely giving the person -- who's lived a good life -- a peaceful death, without pain.\n\nMany times, people let their beliefs and emotions cloud their better judgement. Of course, not everyone is honest. Some people allow euthanasia on their sickened relatives just so they can get rid of them, regardless of the possibility of a substantial recovery.\n\nAccording to an investigation on the legalization of euthanasia in Oregon, it was concluded that the reason for the approval of said practice was because the majority of the population aren't religious. And frankly, when I read this, I was not surprised due to the fact that the 99.99% of religious people are against \"causing death\" or \"assisting suicide\"; the possibilities of a religious person agreeing with euthanasia are quite slim, maybe 1 out of 10 religious people may agree somewhat with the practice, although not fully convinced, they might consider it in a situation that requires it.\n\nThere aren't a lot of countries that support a \"good death,\" like for example in Puerto Rico. Puerto Ricans are known to be religious -- and so are other Hispanics -- so here the legalization of euthanasia is completely out of the question, much like other countries that don't support the practice.\n\nI just think that keeping a dying relative alive regardless of their suffering is selfish because the patient's feelings -- if they can be expressed -- are not being respected. Yeah, it's painful to lose someone you care about, but for me it's more painful and cruel to watch them die slowly.\n\nIt's a hard and rash decision to make, especially if the patient is unable to communicate their requests. And it's even harder when you're religious because by making this decision you are \"shunning your spiritual and moral beliefs\", this is what is often thought. I'm pretty sure that no one wants to feel continuous pain and agony in the last days of their lives.\n\nAre you for or against euthanasia? Do you think euthanasia is a \"good death,\" or is it \"playing God?\" Is there anything in scripture that can point us to the moral and biblical truth about euthanasia?\n\nRelated Posts\n\nComments (29)\n\nThis is a great debatable topic if it's nicely discussed. I actually wrote my final paper last semester on this topic for my Ethics class. I had just gone through the loss of my grandmother and it was a very personal paper. My grandmother died on God's terms. She had a living will which I highly believe in. There is no value in a life that is only living on machines. That's not how we were intended to live in this life. While I'm also not favorable for euthanasia. My argument in my paper was focused on the sanctity of life. I actually used the verse, \"Nor be foolish: Why die before your time?\" (Eccl 7:17b) to help with my argument in my paper. I also reasoned that if Jesus suffered for us why can't we suffer? I hated watching my Grandmother suffer but in the end it was on God's terms. I also had to watch my aunt suffer 8 years ago when she was dying of Ovarian cancer. Neither one believed living on machines but neither one also believed in drawing their last breath until God said it was enough. There's a reason for everything and I know personally how painful it is to watch someone suffer but it's not up to us how or when someone or ourselves should die. If you truly believe in God and our Savior our lives are in their hands until that last breath we take.\n\nJust thought I would share that because when I started out wanting to write my paper on euthanasia I was going to try and write it agreeing with euthanasia because of a conversation I had with my mother. She believes in it and would prefer to take her own life so I (her only daughter) does not have to make those decisions on what needs to be done to take care of her when that time comes that she is no longer capable of taking care of herself. She refuses to be a burden and does not want to live in a nursing home of any kind. My grandmother was a strong lady who made all her decisions to live in an Assisted Living Home and what she needed to have to be taken care of.\n\nGod sakes....in a democratic country, where votes are cast and counted, it would be to the detriment of any political party to allow this. It is completely legal in Cuba and North Korea and at one time...even encouraged in Cambodia by the Khemer Rouge.\n\nHow about murder plain and simple? I honestly could care less who your god is, I want to live. If you can't find that in your bible, then perhaps you can find a place for that book that doesn't affect me.\n\nMy morality's primary endeavor is to alleviate all suffering in any way I can. I'm lucky enough to have never had to call shots (literally) on anyone but a pet who was in agony. When my time comes I hope I'm in a country developed enough to provide the same choice to me.\n\nI've watched life leave both of my grandparents in person. Both died suffering, both very nobly and bravely, but both very unnecessarily. I've had two people die in my arms in complete agony and after such experiences I will do everything in my power to alleviate such pain from anyone I love, which is everyone.\n\nIf your morality drives you to condemn people to a death of suffering, I strongly suggest you take a long look at where you derive truth from.\n\n@When_We_Were_Both_Cats@xanga - A bullet to the brain certainly would eliminate suffering in all cases. But what if the State defined suffering as not having the correct ideology and decided it would institutionalize and then euthanize all people who were suffering in that way?\n\nHaven't we seen that scenario played out before? And didn't everyone say, \"It can't possibly happen here?\"\n\nGood governance and ethics therefore cannot be based on your or anyone else's experience or feelings of what you think mercy is or should be.\n\nThis issue concerns the sanctity of life, not the termination of life so that suffering can be totally eliminated.\n\nThe fact is people are euthanased daily by doctors in nurses but not in the manner you speak. They are simply withheld life saving extraordinary medical procedures that would save their lives in a form of euthanasia called \"NO CODE BLUE\". In lay language -- just let them die - and do not revive them. And whether you acknowledge it or not - you will be treated the same way if you die in a hospital.\n\nIn my mind I'm for Euthanasia, but I don't know if I'd be able to make a decision like that about a loved one in the moment. It's hard for me to say that I am for or against something when I have never really been forced/exposed to a situation like that.\n\nThe thing is, I don't ascribe to the popular Christian notion that assisted suicide, euthanasia, is inherently a sin. Just like the distinction between murdering and killing, I don't think the choice to end your loved one's suffering is evil. I think it's a choice, and the consequences are more immediate than others, but still a choice nonetheless. Therefore, I think the intentions are important. Only God can really judge that ~~\n\n\"After a couple of days, the patient falls into a coma and is being kept alive by medical machinery. The family of this patient has tried everything and spent every single penny on the patient's treatment and hospitalization\"\n\nDoes this mean that in the good ol' US of A, poor people or those with poor relatives are left to die? It is almost obscene to see this written casually as if it is the most normal thing in the universe; and on a post about euthanasia. I would suggest that any society that treats people like the Americans do, has a long way to go before discussing the dignity of life.\n\n@sometimestheycomebackanyway@xanga - \" But what if the State defined suffering as not having the correct ideology and decided it would institutionalize and then euthanize all people who were suffering in that way?\"\n\nWh...what? What does this have to do with euthanasia? Are you trying to apply a slippery slope argument from euthanasia to eugenics?\n\nI think there is a difference between pulling the plug and lethal injections. I don't see how anyone could say that passive euthanasia is immoral as long as it is voluntary. Why should someone take medicine, accept treatment, or continue to live only because of a machine if they are ready to just end the pain? They are still dying a natural death. Active euthanasia is another story, and I can understand why someone, especially a Christian, would be adamantly against it. I'm not even sure how I feel about it, even though we often practice it with our pets. It's tough when you have your loved one crying out, begging for death, wanting a lethal injection to just end the pain already instead of waiting for whatever to kill them.\n\nAlthough \"pulling the plug\" technically is euthanasia, almost everyone could be kept \"alive\" on a heart/lung machine indefinitely - remember Terri Schiavo? Seriously, can you imagine the healthcare costs if we hooked everyone who was dying up to a heart/lung machine indefinitely?!? Besides, the way it is now in America you get to stay alive that way for as long as your estate/family can pay the hospital expenses - meaning if you don't have the money you're going to be pulled off that machine quick regardless of what your wishes were when conscious. God is already out of the picture in that scenario, it's about the money.\n\nI do not understand Christians. Constantly talking about how unworthy they are in God's eyes, yet how special they are because God \"saved them\". Talking about how this life is a trial of suffering in order to gain entrance into the eternal paradise God has promised them after they die, and yet doing everything in their power not to die and trade in this evil world for a perfect paradise.\n\nI watched my grandfather suffer for years with Alzheimer's, and then lung cancer. He was gone years before he died. He didn't know who he was, or who anyone else was, his mind was gone and he was in massive pain from lung cancer. We would never put our pets through that kind of suffering. Do you get an extra halo if you're in agonizing pain at the end of your life and you stick it out until \"God decides\" you're ready? Do you really think an all-loving, merciful God will damn your soul to hell for all eternity because you upped the morphine in your last living days and checked out early rather than suffer agonizing pain any longer? If that's really what God expects and wants from people, then God is a sadistic bastard.\n\n@davesprettylady@xanga - This is what I actually came here to say. I don't understand the whole \"We shouldn't play God\" argument, because that's exactly what you're doing when you use extraordinary measures to keep someone alive. You're playing God. You're saying that no, this person will not die today, not because God says so, but because I say so.\n\nI am in favor of physician assisted suicide, because frankly, if I'm trapped in a hospital where my quality of life is pretty much non-existent, I want to be able to leave it in peace, not suffering and in pain. I have also expressed to my parents that I would never want to be kept alive as a vegetable, if the situation were such that I was not conscious to make the decision for myself. Basically, if a person is capable of saying for themselves that they want to be allowed to die, or if the person is incapable, but has specified through a living will that those are their wishes, they should have every right to do so.\n\nWe play god every day with things like modern medicine and technology, so I really don't think that's a valid argument against it. If there is a god, who are you to assume that you know God's will?\n\nAbout Me: I'm currently studying music, my main instrument is voice and my second is piano. I don't sing musicals and I will shoot anyone who asks me to sing it. Most of the time I space in and out...sometimes I just stay spaced out...ADD.\nI tend to not make sense most of the time, but if you're smart, you'll be able to figure out what I'm trying to say."}
{"text": "\"Jason is made of cookies, Instrumental, and honesty. With a dash of hentai.\"\n\nWelcome to my life.\n\nI feel like putting a disclaimer on all my political posts that deal with abortion, contraceptives, etc because no one reading my tumblr would ever know that I'm actually pro-life. I'm just, like\u2026 I dunno. Logical about it, I guess?\n\nYou're never going to get abortion illegal in America. The sooner you wake up and accept that, the better. What you can do is limit the need for abortions. Provide service and care to expecting mothers. Help them financially. They're not seeking an abortion because they're an evil baby-killing sex deviant. It comes down to economics.\n\nWhen it isn't about economics, it's [more than likely] about social stigma and mental trauma. Teen pregnancy isn't describable\u2014I certainly wouldn't assume to understand what teen mothers go through. Rape, incest\u2026 no, I would never make any claims. If you really value that baby's life, then provide a lot more help for them. And it's gonna have to be more than just religious counseling. I betcha they're not too keen on God right now if something like this happened in their life.\n\nIf you're upset with the idea of a new type of \"welfare baby,\" get over it. You're the one's screaming about dying children. If you truly care, then you'll do what you can do help them. And yes, government has a role in that. If you believe it has a role in protecting life, then be consistant. Protect all life, not just the politically expedient life. Show me you have depth to your so-called morals, and that your economic ideas don't trump your God-driven respect for life. We'll see who your real God is, pretty soon.\n\nAnd contraceptives\u2026 please understand that they're used for a lot more things than sex. They're medically prescribed in many cases. Hear that? Medicine. I see no reason insurance shouldn't cover that.\n\nOkay I'm done. I try not to get into political rants on here, but sometimes I just gotta spill it all out."}
