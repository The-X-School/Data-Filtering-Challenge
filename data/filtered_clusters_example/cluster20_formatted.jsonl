Under the terms of a secret convention Spain had to pay 72 million francs annually to France, until it declared war on Britain. The British had learned of the treaty, and knew it was likely that Spain would declare war soon. Bustamante set sail from Montevideo on 9 August 1804 with four frigates loaded with gold and silver, as well as other valuable cargo. On 22 September Vice Admiral Lord Collingwood ordered Captain Graham Moore, commanding the 44-gun frigate HMS Indefatigable, to intercept and detain the Spanish ships, peacefully, if possible. At dawn on 5 October, the Spanish frigates were sighted off the coast of Portugal. At 7 a.m. they sighted the four British frigates. Bustamante ordered his ships into line of battle, and within an hour the British came up in line, to windward of the Spaniards. Commodore Moore, sent Lieutenant Ascott to the Spanish flagship Medea, to explain his orders. Bustamante naturally refused to surrender, and impatient of delays, at 10 a.m. Commodore Moore ordered a shot be fired ahead over the bow of Medea. Almost immediately a general exchange of fire broke out. Within ten minutes the magazine of the Mercedes exploded destroying the ship (the moment depicted in this painting), and killing all but 40 of her 240 crew. Within half an hour the Santa Clara and the Medea had surrendered, and the Fama broke away trying to flee, the H.M.S. Medusa quickly followed. However, Moore ordered the faster H.M.S. Lively to pursue, capturing the Fama a few hours later. Spain declared war on Great Britain on 14 December 1804, only to suffer a catastrophic defeat less than a year later at the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805."}

His engines were to become famous for their use in rocket-powered aircraft\u2014notably the Me 163 Komet\u2014but most of his early efforts were spent on systems for submarine propulsion.\n\nIn these cases the hydrogen peroxide was reduced chemically and the resulting gases used to spin a turbine at about 20,000 rpm, which was then geared to a propeller. This allowed the submarine to run underwater at all times, as there was no need for air to run the engines. The system also used up tremendous amounts of fuel, and any boat based on the design would either have to be absolutely huge, or have terribly limited range.\n\nThus the system saw only limited development even though a prototype was running in 1940. But when problems with the existing U-boat designs became evident in 1942, the work was stepped up. Eventually two engineers came up with a simple solution to the problem.\n\nInstead of running the submarine 100% on the perhydrol, they used it strictly for bursts of speed when needed. Most of the operations would then be carried out as with a normal boat, using a diesel engine\n\nDiesel engine\n\nA diesel engine is an internal combustion engine that uses the heat of compression to initiate ignition to burn the fuel, which is injected into the combustion chamber...\n\nto charge batteries. However while a conventional design would use the diesel as the primary engine and the batteries for short periods of underwater power, in this case the boat would run almost all the time on batteries in a low-speed cruise, turning on the perhydrol during attacks. The diesel was now dedicated entirely to charging the batteries, which it needed only three hours to do.\n\nThe perhydrol design suffered from several design flaws which were not fixed before the end of the war. As an intermediate solution, the perhydrol propulsion system was dropped in favour of a conventional diesel/electric solution, but retaining the streamlined hull-shape. The battery capacity was increased significantly along with fuel stores, and the boat was designed to operate underwater for long periods.\n\nElectric U boats\n\nType XXI U-boats, also known as \"Elektroboote\", were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than as surface ships that could submerge as a means to escape detection or launch an attack.-Description:...\n\nGerman Type XXIII submarines were the first so-called elektroboats to become operational. They were small coastal submarines designed to operate in the shallow waters of the North Sea, Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea, where larger Type XXI Elektro boats were at risk in World War II. They were so...\n\n, finalized in January 1943 but with production only commencing in 1944-1945. When underwater the Type XXI managed to run at 17 knots (33.3 km/h), faster than a Type VII running full out on the surface and almost as fast as the ships attacking her. After the war, tests carried outAnti-submarine warfare is a branch of naval warfare that uses surface warships, aircraft, or other submarines to find, track and deter, damage or destroy enemy submarines....\n\nships by going in the direction of heavy seas. (The US Navy's first nuclear-powered submarine, , used a modified Type XXI hull shape.) For most of the trip it ran silently underwater on batteries, surfacing only at night, and then only toA torpedo tube is a device for launching torpedoes. There are two main types of torpedo tube: underwater tubes fitted to submarines and some surface ships, and deck-mounted units installed aboard surface vessels...\n\ns to be reloaded in less than one-fourth of the time, firing homing torpedoes that would attack on their own. Even the interior was improved: it was much larger and fitted with showers and a meat refrigerator for long patrols.\n\nThe design was to be produced in two versions, primarily the Type XXI, and lesser numbers of the smaller Type XXIII. Both were much larger and more difficult to build than the existing designs, the Type XXI taking some 18 months. Mass production of the new type did not really get started until 1944 and subsequently only one combat patrol was carried out by a Type XXI before the war ended. This patrol is considered controversial. According to some sources, the did not make any contact with the enemy. Another version suggests that the U-boat did make a contact with of the Royal Navy, but did not fire as the captain had already received orders of surrender. A number of boats were commissioned into Allied navies after the war for research purposes, and one into the Bundesmarine of post-war Germany."}

The thrifty traveler is also an intelligent and well-informed traveler \u2013 even if that means having to learn another language. Therefore, here is an introductory 3-part course in \"cruising language.\"\n\nWe'll begin by taking the mystery out of ships' prefixes. Ships have \"titles\" before their names, just like people do (e.g., Mr., Ms., Captain).

If so, let me know and I'll find out what it stands for!\n\nAre you tired of wearing a \"patch\" when you take a cruise? Do you wish there were some way to prevent motion sickness without taking drugs which makes you sleepy (and which don't even work if you fail to take them in advance of feeling queasy)?\n\nOne solution is GINGER. The herb? Yes. And not only does it really work; but even if you unexpectedly start to get seasick (or airsick; or carsick), ginger will STILL help.

At the Raid on Chatham, he commanded the Pro Patria, which charged the cable across the Medway and broke it, opening the way for the attack on the dockyard. He attacked the Dutch prize Mathias with his fireship and burnt her. In the Battle of Solebay in 1672, he commanded a fireship that successfully attacked the Earl of Sandwich's flagship St. James (100 guns) and fired her, causing her loss. The Earl drowned, after his crew lost their discipline and swamped his boat by jumping into it. This was another catastrophic example of how morale and discipline could suddenly collapse in the Restoration navy. The loss of the Royal Prince, in the Four Days Battle, is another example. Jan Danielszoon van Rijn also fought in the Battle of the Texel in 1673, where he commanded the fireship Louise. Sources:"}

{"text": "Why are we still so fascinated by the Titanic? I can't give you any profound answers. The answers are pretty straightforward. It was a great tragedy, it was so unexpected, it was the result of man's negligence, and it involved victims who were fabulously glamorous, as well as those, housed in the bottom of the ship, who were impoverished.\n\nIt also, let's face it, makes a whale of a movie. And don't underestimate the power of film to keep an event in the public imagination.\n\nThe Titanic was, in effect, relaunched by author Walter Lord in his 1955 telling of the story of the sinking, \"A Night to Remember,\" later made into a very successful movie. It was one of the books, along with Jim Bishop's \"The Day Lincoln Was Shot,\" that began a craze of non-fiction books about events that occurred within one day. Lord went on to write \"Day of Infamy,\" about Pearl Harbor, and Bishop later wrote \"The Day Christ Died.\"\n\n\"A Night to Remember\" was published 43 years after the Titanic disaster. Walter Lord was able to interview a number of survivors, bringing the event to life. We note that many of those who shaped \"the greatest generation\" of Americans, who fought through the Depression and World War II, also remembered the Titanic disaster from their younger years. When the Titanic went down, Franklin D. Roosevelt was 30. Dwight D. Eisenhower was in his first year at West Point. Harry S. Truman was 27.\n\nOf course, we also had the more recent movie, \"Titanic,\" which was an enormous hit. And the finding of the wreck of the Titanic, and photographing it on the ocean floor, was probably the greatest single factor in keeping the story alive.\n\nThere is a stone representation of the Titanic disaster on the grave of Isidor Straus, of Macy's department store, in Woodlawn Cemetery in New York. Mr. Straus died in the sinking. His wife, Ida, famously refused to take a place in a lifeboat, staying at her husband's side. His body was recovered. Hers never was."}
{"text": "Why Titanic's Story Still Resonates 100 Years Later\n\nSUMMARY\n\nOne hundred years after the Titanic sank, the story of the technological triumph-turned-tragedy still captivates many people. Margaret Warner and writer Daniel Mendelsohn, author of the recent New Yorker piece \"Unsinkable: Why We Can't Let Go of the Titanic,\" discuss the story's staying power.\n\nMARGARET WARNER: Finally tonight, remembering the Titanic, and exploring why its story resonates in our modern age.\n\nThe story of the technological triumph that ended in tragedy still captivates the public mind 100 years after the Titanic sank. This weekend will see scores of events marking the centennial anniversary, from the re-release of the late '90s blockbuster film, now in 3-D. . .\n\nWhen it sets sail from Southampton, England, for New York, on April 10, 1912, the Titanic was hailed as the largest vessel in the world and touted as unsinkable. But just four days into its maiden voyage, the luxury cruise ship hit an iceberg and sank, killing more than 1,500 passengers and crew.\n\nWith the shipwreck lying on the ocean floor, its tale has spawned countless books and films. And the wreckage itself attracts underwater tourists and scavengers, prompting calls for its preservation.\n\n\"It's a real-life event that unfolds as if it were basically a work of literature. You know, it's sort of too good to be true.\"\n\n- Daniel Mendelsohn\n\nSTEVE BLASCO, marine geologist, Survey of Canada: Recovering artifacts, the belongings of people who have died is -- is not to be done.\n\nMARGARET WARNER: Whether or not the wreckage survives another 100 years, fascination with its story and fate seem sure to endure.\n\nAnd for more on why the fascination endures, we turn to writer and critic Daniel Mendelsohn. His latest piece in The New Yorker is \"Unsinkable: Why We Can't Let Go of the Titanic.\"\n\nAnd, Daniel Mendelsohn, welcome.\n\nSo, what is it about the Titanic tale and its themes that so grips ours imagination and has for 100 years?\n\nDANIEL MENDELSOHN, writer/critic: Well, I think, mostly, it's that it's a real-life event that unfolds as if it were basically a work of literature. You know, it's sort of too good to be true.\n\nIt has all the themes. It has the structure. You know, there's something irresistible about it because it's too perfect.\n\nMARGARET WARNER: Well, give us an example. What do you mean? What themes?\n\nDANIEL MENDELSOHN: Well, you know, it's about the oldest -- it's about the oldest theme of all, which is man vs. nature. That's one, right?\n\nHubris, the subject of so many Greek tragedies. They say they build -- they're going to build the ship that can't sink. Of course it sinks. It's about class. It's a perfect parable about class at the end of the 19th century.\n\nIf you were a man in first class, you had a better chance of surviving than if you were a small child in third class. It seems to be about technology and overconfidence in technology, which is something we're very interested in still, obviously, and the limits of technology.\n\nSo all of these things seem to be sort of overdetermined. You know, in one story, you get class, you get overweening arrogance, you get technological overconfidence. And it all comes together and you put it in the most beautiful, biggest ship ever built, and it sinks on a piece of ice in the middle of the ocean.\n\nMARGARET WARNER: On its maiden voyage.\n\nDANIEL MENDELSOHN: On its maiden voyage.\n\nMARGARET WARNER: You write in this piece. You begin with the fact that your uncle when you were age 12 enrolled you in a club called Titanic Enthusiasts of America.\n\nDANIEL MENDELSOHN: Right.\n\nMARGARET WARNER: And I won't try to speculate on what your age may be, but what. . .\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMARGARET WARNER: Have the themes that resonate changed over time, at least here in the U.S.?\n\nDANIEL MENDELSOHN: I don't think so.\n\nWell, I mean, it could be. I think, at the very beginning, there was a tremendous amount of anguish about the class issue. You know, it was very shocking when this first came out that the scales were tipped so greatly and so obviously in favor of people who were first-class passengers. And I think, today, the sort of technological theme predominates. And, also, there's this irresistible idea. . .\n\nMARGARET WARNER: You mean the limits of our technology?\n\nDANIEL MENDELSOHN: The limits of technology.\n\nIt's like the Challenger disaster. You know, many of the kinds of things that were said after the Challenger disaster were said after the Titanic sank, how here we thought we had it all figured out and we were getting so accustomed to these fantastic technological accomplishments, and it turns out we didn't get it all right.\n\nSo that's -- as long as we have technology, that's going to be a theme that interests us.\n\nMARGARET WARNER: And then, of course, as you pointed out, it really taps into classical myth. It is a myth and it taps into them.\n\nDANIEL MENDELSOHN: Yes.\n\nYeah, I think there's an idea that the Titanic itself is a kind -- in a funny way, you know, a hero of this mythic story. You know, we go to Greek plays to watch great heroes like Oedipus, you know, who everyone thinks has all the answers, powerful, strong, accomplished, fall apart.\n\nThat's why we go to see these dramas. It is still we why we go to see \"Death of a Salesman\" or whatever. And the Titanic itself looks like one of these heroes. It's a wonderful, impregnable, unsinkable. It seems to have it all. And then we get a certain kind of funny pleasure from watching a drama in which something beautiful disintegrates"}

These patrol variants are known in the west as Whiskey I, II, III, IV, and V; and were called project 613 in the Soviet Union. In the 1950s and 1960s some patrol vessels were converted to guided missile submarines. These boats had the capability to fire one to four SS-N-3 Shaddock cruise missiles. In 1956, the first prototype was ready. It was a regular Whiskey class submarine which was fitted with a launch tube after the sail that contained a single SS-N-3 anti-shipping missile. This vessel was known in the west as Whiskey Single Cylinder. Between 1958 and 1960, six additional whiskey class submarines were converted to carry guided missiles. These boats had two missile tubes behind the sail, and were known in the west as Whiskey Twin Cylinder (Soviet designation:Project 644). Between 1960 and 1963, six boats received an extended sail that could contain four Shaddock missiles. These were called Whiskey Long Bin in the West and Project 665 in the Soviet Union. All guided missile variants of the Whiskey class had to surface in order to fire their missiles. The boats of the single and twin cylinder class also had to raise their missile tubes, which were normally positioned horizontally.\n\nWhen the boats became obsolete, some were converted to radar picket boats (which were called Whiskey Canvas Bag). Two vessels were converted to submarines for 'fishery research' and 'oceanographic research' purposes. In the Soviet navy, the patrol variants of this class were replaced by Romeo class submarines. The guided missile variants were replaced by Juliet class submarines.\n\nThe Soviet Union has exported patrol submarines of the Whiskey class to:\n\nCuba and Syria ordered used Whiskey class submarines for use as battery charging hulks.

{"text": "Leadbelly tune about Titanic addresses racial issues at time of ship's sinking\n\nThe African American folk singer Huddie Ledbetter, better known as Leadbelly, sings a wonderful song with the simple title \"Titanic.\"\n\nThis version was recorded in New York in 1948, but Leadbelly said that he started singing it with Blind Lemon Jefferson on Dallas street corners soon after the disaster. What's most immediately striking about the song musically is that it's kind of upbeat, almost cheerful for a ballad about a shipwreck that claimed 1,500 lives. And this is even more evident in the lyrics. The song includes a fictional story about how Jack Johnson, the African American heavyweight boxing champion at the time, was refused passage on the ship:\n\nThe Eagle Rock was a dance, so Jack Johnson's response to the disaster is to spread his arms like an eagle and swing his feet around. Some versions of the song include an additional verse:\n\n\"Black man oughta shout for joy,\nNever lost a girl or either a boy.\nFare thee, Titanic, fare thee well.\"\n\nWhy would Leadbelly suggest that black people should feel joy in response to a tragedy? Why would he celebrate the fact that there were no African Americans among the victims?\n\nTo answer these questions, let's put Leadbelly's song alongside a story about the heroism of the Titanic's two wireless operators told in the New York Sun and other newspapers, and in one of the first books written about the disaster. This story is also fictional, but it's an invention of a very different kind. It went like this: One of the wireless men had left the compartment to find out what was happening on deck. When he came back, according to Logan Marshall in The Sinking of the Titanic, a book rushed out to capitalize on the wreck, \"he found a Negro stoker creeping up behind\" his colleague \"and saw him raise a knife over his head.\" Without time to give a warning, the wireless man pulled out a gun and, in Marshall's words, \"shot the Negro dead.\" In other words, heroism in this story took the form of a lynching.\n\nBlack newspapers were understandably interested in knowing whether there actually were any African Americans on board the ship. (There weren't, it turned out.) Some insisted that \"the Afro-American must have been represented, as he generally is in everything in this country.\" While many newspaper articles, speeches, sermons, and poems had made heroism a matter of racial exclusiveness, African American writers tried to broaden the chivalric honor roll. As one put it, the \"daily press has made no special mention of him, [but] we know he was there, and that he died like the other men. And we shed tears to his memory as well as to the men of other nationalities who died with him.\"\n\nThe silence on this heroic presence didn't surprise African Americans; daily newspapers rarely reported on blacks except as criminals, which prompted a knowing comment in an African American paper about the mainstream coverage of the disaster. \"There may have been a Negro in the sinking of the great steamship Titanic off the Newfoundland coast last week, but the newspapers have not as yet discovered the fact. It is rather remarkable that there could be so great a tragedy without a Negro somewhere concealed or exposed in it.\" When the story of the wireless operators' lynching of the stoker appeared, it conformed to the pattern in which African Americans were either absent as heroes or present as villains in narratives of tragedy or disaster.\n\nA Philadelphia paper sarcastically observed, \"We thought it would be strange if there were no coloured persons aboard the fated ship. Of course, he had to be made to appear in the light of a dastard"}

{"text": "It Would Take a Titanic Raft of Flotsam to Float Two Actors\n\nCould Rose and Jack have both survived on the raft? Math says no. Image courtesy of 20th Century Fox\n\nDid plot triumph over physics in the climax of the film \"Titanic?\" Could Jack have shared the raft of flotsam with Rose, or would both actors have sunk beneath the waves?\n\nLet's examine the math calculations for floating this improvised raft, made from a door that broke away from the Titanic.\n\nSetting the Stage and the Goal\n\nThe primary question is whether they sink or float under ideal conditions, but we'll also explore exactly how big the raft would need to be, in order to support 2 people. We set the target of \"floating\" to mean that the total volume of the wood could be just at the water line, but that the people remain dry on top.\n\nThe requirement will be that the weight of the sea water that would be displaced by the entire raft must equal or exceed the weight of the raft, plus any survivors.\n\nWeight, Mass, Density, and Buoyancy via the Archimedes Principle\n\nArchimedes understood volume and displacement: Photo by SpreeTom\n\nNormally, it is easy to measure the weight of an object, whether using a spring-loaded weigh scale or a balance.\n\nThe density of an object is equal to its weight divided by its volume. Again, it is easy to calculate the volume of a regular solid such as a cube, which equals the length times width times height.\n\nThe Greek philosopher Archimedes realized that the volume of water displaced by any fully-submerged object is the same as the volume of the object. Therefore, an irregularly-shaped crown displaces the same volume of water as a cube of the metal from which it was cast.\n\nThe weight of the displaced water equals the volume of water times its density.\n\nIn general, the buoyancy provided by any fluid equals the mass that was displaced, multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity. This translates mass into \"dynes.\" However, the downward force opposed by the buoyancy is also the mass of the object multiplied by gravity.\n\nThis article will, therefore, omit multiplying weights by \"9.8M/s^2,\" since the acceleration due to gravity will be irrelevant to the question of sinking or floating.\n\nThis leaves a slight error due to the buoyancy of the object in air. This is about 0.08 pounds/foot^3 or (0.08lb/2.2lb/Kg) per (1foot/3.28M)^3 = .0363636\u2026 Kg/0.02834M^3 = 1.283Kg/M^3. Compared to water's density of 1000Kg/M^3, this error just over 0.1%. That is extremely minor, compared to the assumptions about the type of wood or size of the door we'll be making.\n\nThe Archimedes Principle is that a submerged object's effective weight is reduced by the weight of the displaced fluid. If an object is less dense than the fluid it displaces, it will float, partially submerged. The volume that is submerged will displace enough fluid to match the weight of the whole object.\n\nI guess neither Jack, nor Rose (and she was smart, too) were aware of Archimedes principle\u2026too bad, maybe Jack could have lived a day longer or so\u2026but then, the ending had to be gut wrenching, after all.\n\n W\n\nFor the door to support their weight it would have to weigh approx. 560 lb. to float level with the sea surface and more to keep them above. Take some strength to launch it!\n\nEdward\n\nBothhh Cannot Sorvive On dahhh Sea With Such Wavesss And High tides ,,,,,, ???\n\nYour assumption about the thickness of the original door is wrong: as the blurb for the Titanic door fragment clearly states, the piece being sold is 0.5 inches thick, but it \"was once a thicker block that years ago was cut up into tiny pieces\".\n\nmoioci\n\nWait a minute. The NYT site describing the 1/2-inch thick piece of door says, \"This relic was once a **thicker block** that years ago was cut up into tiny pieces, which sold for four figures each.\" Think about it. Even in today's world of very cheap construction, a half inch would be very flimsy, even for a closet door, let alone a stateroom door. I vote the actual door was at least an inch thick, possibly more.\n\nMike DeHaan\n\nFor Will, Stooge & Moioci, who pointed out that the door was probably much thicker\u2026\n\"Arghh, you're all extremely likely to be correct\".\nAssume 1.5\u2033 rather than 0.5\u2033? So we only need 1/3 the number of doors that I had calculated?\nThank you for taking the time to let us know"}

Before that, ho hum, he merely won the Volvo Ocean Race (as navigator aboard ABN AMRO in 2005-06); knocked off a slew of Transpacific, 24-hour, and Transatlantic records (including PlayStation's breakthrough 4-day, 17-hour run in 2001); and called the navigation shots in 22 Transpacs (winning 11 of them while setting the course record three times), among many, many other notable offshore deeds and victories.\n\nProfessionally, after earning undergraduate and graduate engineering degrees from Yale (where he sailed competitively with Steve Benjamin, Peter Isler, and Dave Perry) and Stanford, respectively, he spent some time as vice-president of technology for Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and started a couple of companies: Etack, which pioneered in-vehicle map displays before GPS came online, and Sportvision, which introduced TV sports junkies to the now ubiquitous yellow first-down markers in football games and virtual strike zones in baseball telecasts, among other innovations.\n\nJust for good measure, he's married to another pretty excellent sailor, Sally Lindsey Honey, who's won a pair of Rolex prizes herself.\n\nSo who's the best sailor in the Honey family? Sally, by far (laughing). I might have an edge navigating, but she's definitely the better sailor. She points out that I'm never catching up to her (as far as Rolex awards).\n\nYou've circled the planet as the lone American on basically an all-Kiwi boat (in the Volvo) and an all-French boat (Groupama 3). All things being equal, which would you choose if you were picking crew for a round-the-world race? I think it would be based on the kind of boat it was. If it was a multihull, you'd go with the French guys. As far as big offshore multihull sailing, there's nobody better: the seamanship, the preparation, all of it. On a Volvo 70, you'd want the Kiwis. The V70 is just\u2026pain. And endurance to pain. It's just brutal. And there's nobody better at that than the Kiwis. You know, grunt up, mate. And off you go. Sometimes, there'd be this heinous sail change, it's only going to pay off for fifteen minutes, but you do it. You always sail the boat absolutely optimum, and you never go bow down for a change. The French can't sail (the big multis) that way, you'd wreck the boat. They have to know when to back off and hide and when to let 'er rip.\n\nAs a navigator, the dynamics onboard (the different boats) are interesting. Every French sailor is a navigator, because they all come up through shorthanded sailing. They all know how to navigate and are interested in it. So on Groupama, there was a reasonable amount of time when someone was looking over my shoulder and asking questions, and I actually enjoyed that part. On a Kiwi boat, the rules are you don't hang around the nav station.\n\nHow's your French? Not very good is the short answer. I tried. I took courses. But once I was onboard with the crew, I couldn't follow it at all, unless it was a one-to-one situation. They'd all talk at the same time. Though, by the end of the trip, I was able to tell whether they were talking about boats or women"}

{"text": "07/03/2010\n\nThe last major naval conflict between British and French forces didn't involve point-blank broadsides from Napoleonic-era sailing ships, but instead occurred 70 years ago today, during World War II.\n\nThe attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, part of Britain's Operation Catapult, was a one-sided engagement off the coast of French Algeria on July 3, 1940, in which a Royal Navy task force attacked and destroyed much of the French fleet, killing 1,297.\n\nFrance and Britain were not at war, but France had recently signed an armistice with Nazi Germany and Britain feared the French fleet would end up as a part of the German Navy.\n\nAlthough French Admiral Fran\u00e7ois Darlan had assured Winston Churchill the fleet would not fall into German hands, the British acted upon the assumption that Darlan's promises were insufficient guarantees.\n\nThe attack was brutal in its ferocity and efficiency.\n\nA British force consisting of the battlecruiser HMS Hood, battleships HMS Valiant and Resolution, and the aircraft carrier HMS ArkRoyal, plus an escort of cruisers and destroyers, gave the French fleet, anchored in a narrow harbor, an utlimatum to surrender or be taken.\n\nThe French did not expect an attack and were not fully prepared for battle. The main armament of two of their key ships, the Dunkerque and Strasbourg, could not immediately be brought to bear.\n\nThe British opened fire a little before 5 p.m. The French eventually mounted an ineffectual reply.\n\nThe third salvo from the British force and the first to hit resulted in a magazine explosion aboard Bretagne, which killed nearly 1,000 of her crew.\n\nAfter some thirty salvos, the French ships stopped firing. Provence, Dunkerque and the destroyer Mogador were damaged and run aground by their crews.\n\nThe Strasbourg managed to escape with five destroyers and eventually reached the French port of Toulon on the next day.\n\nBesides nearly 1,300 French sailors killed, another 350 or so were wounded. The British lost just six dead. Not surprisingly, relations between Britain and France were severely strained.\n\nBritish Admiral Somerville was not enthusiastic about the action, saying that it was \"\u2026 the biggest political blunder of modern times and will rouse the whole world against us \u2026 we all feel thoroughly ashamed \u2026\"\n\nIndeed, the attack on the French vessels at port sowed anger amongst the French towards the British and increased tension between Churchill and the leader of the Free French Forces, Charles de Gaulle.\n\nBut the action demonstrated Britain's resolve to continue the war alone, and rallied the British Conservative Party around Churchill. Churchill later declared the action meant that for \"high government circles in the United States \u2026 there was no more talk of Britain giving in.\""}

By doing so, he removed much of the danger from whaling\n(though it remained a very dangerous task), but more than anything -\nincreased the efficiency by which whales could be captured and made\nit possible to hunt the larger and faster rorquals (baleen whales).\n\nThe gun enabled the harpooner to\nhit a whale 50 yards away, no longer needing to be next to the whale\nin a small wooden boat.

{"text": "\"Alarm !\" is perfectly right, e.g. when an outlook saw a plane. Then as soon as the alarm bells rang the whole crew would run to battle stations and prepare all for dive, and \"Fluten !\" would just be an order given in the central control room to the men at station there, meaning flooding the tanks by opening the upper tank's valves with the \"christmas tree\", so the air would be blown out by the incoming water from underneath. Certainly, all actions has to be fine tuned by the whole crew like running to the bow, opening forward valves earlier so the the bow would cut under first and the propellors drive the boat down dynamically, helping in a fast emergency dive. As well in an emergency situation the men in the engine rooms would already close the exhaust valves for the Diesel engines without waiting for the flooding command, often giving a last full speed ahead before shutting down. With the buoyancy tanks already flooded for a fast dive and a well-trained crew, a type VII boat would be able to completely submerge in less than 30 seconds, even a bit faster than modern boats - only that modern boats are not supposed to spend much of their time at the surface .."}

{"text": "Hi guys, I apologize if this isn't the correct location for a topic like this. Basically, my question concerns the sinking a dreadnought battleship. I'll try to give a little background to the inquiry so it doesn't come across as too ridiculous (because I'm sure it will).\n\nI am currently researching information on WWI British dreadnoughts for a novel that I'm writing; I came across these forums during my search, and felt that some members might be able to help me out. The book in and of itself, other than a short scene, has very little to do with dreadnoughts, but I would still prefer it to be as accurate as possible. At the moment, the scene involves two crew mates sinking the ship by setting off an explosion below the deck in the stern.\n\nGiven that the ship is much like the HMS Warspite (03) and armed as if it were commissioned during WWI, how difficult would this be to pull off? Was there anything already in (or near) the stern that could aid them in doing something like this (torpedoes, oil, coal)? In short, if such a feat is too outrageous, I want to scrap the idea right away\u2014but am not knowledgeable enough to know if that is really the case.\n\nI'm no expert on the matter but I would have thought scuttling charges in a single location would be ineffective due to the watertight compartments. Unless the explosion also detonated an ammunition magazine, but if this was in the stern, it would most likely blow that section off - the ship could still be afloat at that point, although it would obviously be missing its propeller and rudder.\n\nThe Queen Elizabeth class ships as initially commissioned did have two rear turrets, so there would have been an ammunition magazine serving them. That would be a little forward of the stern but maybe that would be suitable for your scenario?\n\nA boiler explosion would cripple the ship but not sink it, the easiest method to cause a problem is a coal bunker fire but again thats aggravating to the smooth running of the ship and rarely fatal.\n\nAs has been mentioned above an explosion in one of the rear ammunition magazines is your best bet, preferably while the watertight doors are open.\n\nI'm assuming this is sabotage rather than ammunition mishandling?\n\nIn that case a misfire in one of the guns during a test firing might create a large enoug explosion to set off a chain reaction down the magazine feed but thats a pretty rare circumstance since all the safety cutoofs would have to be locked open or ammunition stacked in the turret, that wasnt unknown in combat situations but might be rare in peacetime training.\n\nOn the other hand gunnery drill was notably lax and inefficient in the Royal Navy pre-WW1 so that sort of mistake might be possible?\n\nThank you guys so much for the quick responses! All of these links/facts are extremely helpful.\n\nIt seems like setting off an explosion in the rearmost ammunition magazine is the winner (it is sabotage). Assuming the magazine works like the ones here, what would be the simplest way to cause the cordite/projectiles to explode? In my rough draft of the scene, a pistol is used to detonate the initial explosion; however, that's my imagination thinking in Hollywood-action-flick mode, and I don't know if it is feasible.\n\nIf your guy is any good at chemistry a simple time fuse would do the job. I dont know the exact composition but theres a small charge of explosive, you squeeze one end with pliers or similar, that breaks the glass vial inside the case which contains slow acid which eats through the restaining pin which sets off the charge.\n\nThats more of a WW2 sneaky SOE device but perfectly feasible, cordite or other propellant charges in those days were soft bagged, think of a short bolster pillow stuffed with explosive.\nAll he has to do is secrete the pen sized device on his person as he enters the magazine for whatever excuse, set off the timer and then push it into the explosive charge, preferably round the back out of public view.\n\nHe's then got however long he set the fuse for (theyre chemical not mechanical so its approximate not precise) to make his excuses and get out."}
{"text": "Subject:\nBritish SSBNs, Do we need all 4? RM-Nod12/22/2004 11:18:28 PM\n\nSo...do we?\nIn my opinion the answer is no. I remember hearing that the UK usually only has a single boat on patrol at any one time. With that in mind, why do we need 4 boats? Wouldn't it be much cheaper to simply run the SSBN force as we do the carriers, ie one in refit/deep reserve, on in reserve and one on patrol. I'm sure it wouldn't be too difficult to get the one in reserve out in an emergency and in many cases the third might be available as a deterant anyway.\nEach boat can carry up to 16 missiles, this represents a maximum of 192 100-120kt warheads, under START maximums this is 128 and under UK policy this is around 48-64 warheads. More than enough to represent a credible threat to even the largest of nations. Along with the boat held in reserve the UK would always have at least 96 warheads going up to 128 while remaining within current British policy.\nGiven the current situation with money and what not, would it not make sense to reduce our force to 3 SSBNs?\n\nfrench stratege\nRE:British SSBNs, Do we need all 4? 12/23/2004 11:00:09 AM\n\nYes: if one is in major overhaul (like midlife update), you will have 3 boat available.\nIf one is also in normal overhaul: two remains available for deploiement.And you can not be sure that one of your SSBN will not be sunk.\nMoreover you can not have a flexible response with one SSBN: if one fired its missiles it is likely to be sunk soon after.\nWith two boat you can use one for counterforce or/and industrial potential destruction ,and keep one available to avoid counterpopulation reprisal.\nOr even three in crisis.\nI would add that a boat will use faster its life potential if you have to use only three boats.\n!\n\"48-64 warheads. More than enough to represent a credible threat to even the largest of nations\":\n.\nGermany have received the equivalent of 400 Hiroshima bombs in WW2!\n\nWe need at least 4.\nIf we have such a small number of boats, a likely enemy could attempt to destroy them in port and the likes.\nSo, if we only had 3 boats and one was destroyed, we would only have two boats, which is not enough to keep one at sea all the tme.\nIn my opinion we should bring back the V wings and all.\n\n\"Moreover you can not have a flexible response with one SSBN: if one fired its missiles it is likely to be sunk soon after.\"\nHow so? I don't know of any force on this planet that has the resources to detect a launch thousands of miles from it's coast and then mount a responce before the sub moves away.\nI don't agree with the enemy targeting our boats in port theory, what's to stop anyone doing that now? Obviously we wouldn't have all the subs in port at the same time.\nBy managing the SSBNs as we do the carriers we could have one on patrol and one in reserve at all times, there by having 2 boats available.\n\"!\"\nI agree, but it would spare some money and would offer major saving when it comes to replacing them; having only to order 3 boats instead of 4.\n\".\"\nWhat, so having an extra 64 warheads that aren't usually on patrol anyway will be a credible threat as opposed to having 64 fewer? I disagree. And if it is that bad then each boat can carry an extra 64 warheads while keeping within the START limits. In my opinion 64 warheads is enough to destory the major infrastructor of any nation and more importantly it is enough to trigger a major nuclear war. The threat only has to be enough to stop any leader wanting to launch an attack against you. For that you need to have a nuclear capability of destroying any forces that are moving against you; the UK easily has that with 3 SSBNs, further more you must be able to harm a country to the point it is not worth starting a war with you. 64 warheads can do that. It may not completley destroy a country (only a few countries though) but it could turn any country into it's own hell hole; destroy it's economy, probably destroy any system of power etc etc\n\n\"I don't agree with the enemy targeting our boats in port theory, what's to stop anyone doing that now? Obviously we wouldn't have all the subs in port at the same time.\"\nThat is hardly the point; they could be attacked before the start of hostilities in such a manner where it was unclear who done it.\nYou can hardly comission a couple new boats in a matter of months to fill the gap.\n\nfrench stratege\nRE:British SSBNs, Do we need all 4? 12/23/2004 1:05:44 PM\n\nFor the French the R&D cost nearly as much than the first four of the Triomphant class which is 2 billion $/per boat.\nYou have much more opportunity of saving R&D cost (and much more than a single SSBN price) by fielding a derivative of your SSN class (like Astute) than to build a special class.\n64 warheads of 120 kt is equivalent of 256 Hiroshima warheads.As I said Germany survived with much more dammages.For China it is putting them only 20 years backward and let them to dispose 90% of their power.\nTo dammage big countries need at minimum 300 nukes according to US.\nUK deterrent allow them to avoid their population threaten by nukes but not war even with nukes.\nTo have a credible deterrent means to inflict much bigger dammage of great countries and have a little flexibility for two strikes.\nEven with 2 subs, UK could have the risk to get boat sunk even by US (it would become a potential way for US to get a control on UK deterrent - a sort of double key control).\nIf you want more saving for next generation, make 4 smaller boat on a SSN basis like US did in the 60ies.\n\"How so? I don't know of any force on this planet that has the resources to detect a launch thousands of miles from it's coast and then mount a responce before the sub moves away.\n\"\nIn cold war I know two: US and Russia.It was the reason for nuke SUBROC.\nAn ICBM can destroy your subs also after a first salvo (which take 8 minutes for all 16 missiles).Ballistic missile launch detection satellites (DSP) pinpoint the subs and a ICBM/IRBM strike the sea maybe less than 20 minutes after (the boat have moved few miles only and a megatonic(s) bomb will crush it 10 miles away) or a SUBROC or ship equivalents in minutes.Your sub will fire one time only.\nNations with this capacity today: US, Russia\nIn few years: France (if satellites are developped as planed) and China.\n\n\"That is hardly the point; they could be attacked before the start of hostilities in such a manner where it was unclear who done it.\"\nBut my point still stands. What is to stop an enemy destroying our boats in port now? Obviously they can't since they aren't all in port at the same time but the same would be true of 3 boats.\nStrat, sorry, should hace said moved away AND fired it's missiles. That's the point, it doesn't matter if the sub get's destroyed as long as it has fired it's missiles, which it has ample time to do. A second boat would make little to no difference. I don't think that there is any country that would risk being hit by 64 120kt warheads, most likley 128 (depending on range). You may need 300 nukes to literally destroy a country but you don't have to be able to destroy a country, you just have to be able to destroy the governments control thereby providing a reason for the country's leaders not to push the button. If you destroy the control then the country will most likley destroy itself.\n\nfrench stratege\nRE:British SSBNs, Do we need all 4? 12/23/2004 2:30:51 PM\n\n-it means you can't launch a single salvo so no flexibility by moving target scale: military then industry then civilians in case of retaliation.\n-if a ennemy SSN is in the vicinity you are sunk even before launching all warheads if it has SUBROC equivalent. A single sub is not a robust deterrent.\n\n\"But my point still stands. What is to stop an enemy destroying our boats in port now? Obviously they can't since they aren't all in port at the same time but the same would be true of 3 boats.\"\nOf course, but you agree that at least one boat is laying vulnerable in port at any one time?\nNow, with four boats, one could be lost in such a manner, and we still have enough boats to ensure one is at sea at any one time.\nIf we only had three boats, and one were to be destroyed (at port, or by any other means), then we would be left with two boats. And two boats are not enough to garuntee that one will be at sea at any one time.\nYou see my point?\nI have always been more a fan of V bombers than subs anyway, but that is probably through watching Dr Strange Love too much.\n\nFrench Strateg is right. 4 boats is minimum figure. There is a general misunderstanding of the effects of nuclear warheads. Yes, even 1 will cause death and destruction on a scale you wouldnt believe. So if your goal is to just be able to nuke someone the just build 1 boat. Or even cheaper, just make a few silos and scrap the boats. That would be a nuclear strike capability, but not a nuclear deterent.\nI know 64 warhead sounds like a lot but its really not against a big country. They would survive it in the short term and retain the ability to make war. Now if you ally yourself with other nuclear powers so that the totality of your nukes is at the 300+ mark. then you could do that. But you would also be placing your fate in the hands of others. The actual number of nukes required to be a truly credible nucler war fighting force is 1000+ with the actual number a highly classified secret. But U.S./Russia arent just keeping several thousand for bragging rights. Short of Jesus Christ return to earth and ruling the world, you will never see superpower nuke forces go below 1500 warheads.\nKeep the 4 boats if you know whats good for you."}

Squadrons of more than three ships are generally\norganised into smaller units known as divisions and sub-divisions. A squadron\ncan be commanded, depending upon its size, by a commodore, rear admiral or\nvice-admiral.\n\nAugust 1941. Battleships of the United States Fleet operating of the California\ncoast. AWM 009436\n\nTask Force/Group\n\nA task force, or task group, is a number of ships grouped to carry out a\nspecific task such as the escort of a convoy or the protection of an aircraft\ncarrier. There is no set structure for a task force and the number and type\nof vessels allocated depends upon the tasks the group is expected to carry\nout. A task force is usually identified by a number. Task Force 44, which\nserved in the Pacific during the Second World War, consisted of the Australian\ncruisers HMAS Australia, Canberra, Hobart, and two United States Navy ships,\nthe destroyer USS Perkins and the cruiser USS Chicago. During 1991, the RAN\ntask force sent to enforce the naval blockade of Iraq, known as Task Group\n627.4, consisted of the guided-missile frigates HMAS Darwin and Adelaide and the supply ship HMAS Success. A task force is usually commanded by a\ncommodore or a rear admiral.\n\nAmphibious Force\n\nAn amphibious force consists of a number of vessels grouped together to\nland an army from the sea on enemy territory. It has no fixed composition\nand usually consists of transport ships, landing ships and landing craft,\nas well as a variety of armed ships tasked with the protection of the landing\nfrom enemy sea or air attacks, and the bombardment of enemy positions ashore.\nAn amphibious force also includes small units of specialists to survey beaches\nand select feasible landing spots, and to control and guide the landing.\n\nFleet\n\nA fleet is the largest naval structure and would usually contain a number\nof squadrons, flotillas and/or task forces. Again, its structure is flexible.\nOften a fleet is organised to work in a specific geographic area, such as\nthe British Pacific Fleet during the Second World War. The RAN has never\nhad enough ships to form more than one fleet, so the fleet, in terms of the\nRAN, equates with the entire sea-going navy. The United States Navy, however,\nhas many fleets.

Constantly adapting to German alterations to the Enigma system, the Allied codebreakers understood, after painstaking efforts, the basic principles of operating the Enigma. Understanding German operating procedures was key to solving the Enigma system.\n\nEncoding a message in naval Enigma required an extremely intricate series of steps. First, the machine must be configured to an elaborate series of predetermined settings listed in various codebooks. Using the codebooks, German signalsmen adjusted the \"outer settings\" of the Enigma by plugging wires into various ports on the plug-wire board in front of the typewriter keyboard. Before encrypting a message, an officer would check a list of daily settings to select the correct Enigma rotors. Aboard U-boats, the second watch officer (II W.O.) was responsible for adjusting the Enigma rotors to the proper daily configuration, establishing the \"inner settings\" of the machine. Each individual rotor featured internal circuitry connected to twenty-six electrical contacts representing alphabetical characters. Before typing a message, the signalsman would consult another codebook list to set the rotors to a predetermined daily starting position. For example, one daily configuration might be \"T - A - M - W.\" By typing a letter on the keyboard, the rotors would turn. Thus, the electrical contacts on the rotors would produce an entirely different letter for each letter typed\u2014even if the operator repeatedly typed the same letter.\n\nWith the \"outer\" and \"inner\" settings properly configured, U-boat signalsmen used codebooks to condense the length of the message text that was to be sent.\n\nFor example, in a message that reads:\n\nMy position is - EH - 56 - 61 - Am going along with supply boat - May - Have provisions for one week\n\nWith the message properly condensed, the U-boat signalsman typed the text of a message on the Enigma keyboard to create an enciphered message. The alphabetical characters passed through the Enigma plug-wire array, turning the rotors to produce the enciphered characters on an illuminated panel. U-boat signalsmen then used standard Morse code to transmit the encrypted message in relative security to radio stations aboard other vessels or ashore. Once a message was transmitted, U-boat signalsman would reset the Enigma rotors to the proper daily configuration to encipher another message. To decipher messages accurately, the recipient had to set another Enigma machine to the exact plug and rotor settings of the original machine used to encrypt a given message."}

In May 1941 the battleship, which was commanded by Admiral G\u00fcnther L\u00fctjens, was sighted off Bergen, Norway, by a British reconnaissance aircraft. Practically the entire British Home Fleet was immediately sent into action to intercept it. Two cruisers made contact off the coast of Iceland, and the battleship Prince of Wales and battle cruiser Hood soon engaged it. After destroying the Hood with a shell that exploded in the magazine, the Bismarck escaped into the open sea and soon began heading for Brest in German-occupied France.

Some people even claim that it contains a wormhole into another dimension, while others believe that the <a alt=\"((CONLINK|1140|area%20is%20a%20UFO%20hotspot))\" href=\" is a UFO hotspot</a> and that aliens are abducting the lost sea vessels.</p>\n<p>The area first attracted attention in December, 1945, when five United States Navy planes vanished during a training exercise. Before losing radio contact and disappearing somewhere off the coast of southern Florida, the flight leader was reportedly heard saying: \"We are entering white water, nothing seems right.\"</p>\n<p>The 14 men in the planes were never heard from again. Even spookier, a search-and-rescue aircraft with 13 men onboard was dispatched to locate the missing planes, but that aircraft and its passengers also inexplicably disappeared. Ever since, the disappearances of vessels in the area, including the SS Marine Sulphur Queen, a tanker carrying a crew of 39 in 1963, and the collier USS Cyclops with 309 crewmen in 1918, have been blamed on the Bermuda Triangle.</p>\n\nThe Sargasso Sea\n\n<p>The only \"sea\" without shores, the Sargasso Sea is a region in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean that is <a alt=\"((CONLINK|542|surrounded%20by%20ocean%20currents))\" href=\" by ocean currents</a> . These currents deposit marine plants and garbage into the Sargasso Sea, causing it to be full of <em>Sargassum</em>, a genus of dense, brown, invasive seaweed. Because of the seaweed buildup and the isolation created by the currents, the sea remains eerily warm and calm, despite being surrounded by the freezing and choppy waters of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>\n<p>This eerie calmness contributes to the area's mystery, as several ships have been found drifting crewless through its peaceful waters. In 1840, the French merchant ship Rosalie sailed through the Sargasso Sea and was later discovered with its sails set but without any crew members on board.</p>\n<p>In an effort to explain the mysterious disappearances, nineteenth-century lore told of the Sargasso Sea's carnivorous seaweed, which was believed to devour sailors whole, leaving only the ship.</p>\n\nThe \"Devil's Sea\" of Japan\n\n<p>The Devil's Sea, also known as the Pacific Bermuda Triangle, is a region of the Pacific around Miyake Island, about 60 miles south of Tokyo.

He wrote that after Japan lost five military vessels with carrying a total of more than 700 sailors during the peacetime years between 1952 and '54, the area was officially declared a danger zone. Investigations into Berlitz's claims later found that the military vessels were actually fishing vessels, some of which had vanished outside of the Devil's Sea.</p>\n<p>Additionally, investigators pointed out that during the time period that the ships went missing, hundreds of fishing boats were lost around Japan every year due to weather conditions and piracy \u2014 not because of supernatural activity or mythical sea dragons. But the Devil's Sea's reputation as a dangerous and eerie area lives on.</p>\n\nThe Michigan Triangle\n\n<p>The Michigan Triangle is found in Lake Michigan, whose shoreline spans the states of Illinois, Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin. Located over central Lake Michigan, the area has been blamed for the mysterious disappearances of ships' crew members and entire airplanes. Some have reported that while sailing over the Michigan Triangle, time seemed to stand still, slow to a crawl, or speed up.</p>\n<p>In 1937, the disappearance of Captain George Donner from his boat cemented the Michigan Triangle's status as a strange place. During a routine coal delivery, Donner gave his crew orders to wake him when the ship drew into port.

On his blog, NPR's Robert Krulwich quotes Titanic explorer Robert Ballard:\n\n\"There used to be bodies in those shoes. The body parts deteriorated, and the skeletal remains decalcified. The only thing left are the shoes, and the leather is perfectly preserved.\" The tannin in the shoe leather had apparently resisted the bacteriaWhile the Titanic was certainly a tragedy, it was hardly the worst maritime disaster ever. Not even close, really. You have to wonder why the Titanic dead get all this recognition while more profound disasters go virtually forgotten.\n\nBecause the Titanic was unsolved for nearly a hundred years. I guess I'm 'dating myself' when I say I can remember when they finally found where the wreck was at! Until then it had been a mystery.\n\nredstarr\n\nThere were some very rich and prominent people at the time on the ship. It made for an exciting story. Famous people, regular people, poor people, all on an extravagant ship, plunged into the ocean, some died, some survived, it was a bit mysterious who might have been at fault, corporate greed, human error, nature, fate. It had star power, adventure, tragedy, triumph, and mystery that captured the public's interest and made it a big deal.\n\nWreckrob8\n\nThe Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time. It was on its maiden voyage. Notwithstanding that its passengers included many of the wealthiest people on the planet. That wouldn't cloud people's judgement, would it?\n\nAmbiguity\n\nAgree with all of the above. It isn't hard to understand at all why the Titanic captures so much imagination (if you give it a few seconds thought). Unless, of course, you're just using the story to be a wee bit pedantic (not that that ever happens in the Internet!), or, for some reason, you think numbers are more interesting than the narratives around which we structure our lives.\n\n(Meant to reply to nanuq, by the way.)\n\n royaltrux\n\nAnd radio being so new at the time\u2026\n\nGeekMan\n\nNot to mention of course, that in all likelihood, no pair of boots could independently fall 3.8km through the ocean and come to rest exactly beside eachother.\n\nA human being was their vessel. Their owner is long gone, but those two shoes will be together as long as their last, an eerie tombstone on the sea floor.\n\nmccrum\n\nUnless they were in a non-leather suitcase or other container\u2026\n\n 64k a Day\n\nI am literally having the tears\u2026* jerked out of me* as I type this.\n\nJames B\n\nThat place should be designated something like a grave site, and left alone. I wouldn't want people gawking over my boots in my final resting place.\n\nVicqRuiz\n\nIf the Titanic had sunk in 150 feet depth, she'd have been salvaged to a faretheewell by 1920, bodies or no bodies.\n\nplanettom\n\nI remember reading somewhere that, when people are exploring the ocean floor, the incongruous thing they find most often are lightbulbs. Strangely intact; often they don't seem to break on impact or due to pressure as you'd think they might.\n\nCunning\n\nAre they suggesting the wearer of these boots was lying on their side, with their ankles crossed when they died? Clearly the body would float for several days after death before sinking to it's final resting spot.\n\nsnagglepuss\n\nNot necessarily. They could have belonged to a body that was dragged down with the ship, and never got a chance to bob to the surface before finally settling to the ocean floor.\n\nCunning\n\nIt would not have bobbed to the surface but it would have bobbed to the cabin ceiling. The cabins would not remain airtight at those depths.\n\n Robert Baruch\n\nOr maybe it was one of the people who jumped overboard and froze to death in the sea. I heard something on NPR the other day about a woman who, as a very young girl, was on the ship that passed through the area a few days after the sinking. They stopped to pick up bodies that were still floating there.\n\nsnagglepuss\n\nRight. the cabin could have been flooded, but not in a way that allowed the trapped body to reach the surface. After a few weeks or so, it falls to the ocean floor.\n\nI'm not prepared, really, to think about the specifics of the duel between the pressures down there versus the gaseous swellings of a decomposing body\u2026.\n\ntsol\n\nI remember reading about kayakers discovering a dead body floating just below the surface of the East River (NYC) a few years ago. Apparently the person drowned sometime during the winter and the corpse remained on the bottom of the river for the duration of the cold weather. Then spring came and the water warmed up enough for buoyancy to re-establish itself and the body floated back up.\n\nThe only people dragged down with the Titanic were inside it. There was no \"suction effect\" because the ship sank slowly. The US Senate investigating commission specifically asked survivors in the water, some of whom were literally on the ship as it sank, if there was any such phenomenon and none said there was.\n\nNever meant to sound like I was endorsing the \"sucked down\" myth \u2013 I watch \"Mythbusters\", too, and I understand that it's a falsehood.\nI was talking about people who could have been trapped in their cabins, or entangled in rigging or anything else \u2013 They got just as dead, but the ship itself prevented their corpses from getting back to the surface.\n\nYeesh, people \u2013 This whole debate is getting almost as disrespectful as the \"preservationists\" who have been looting the Titanic's resting place\u2026\n\nDv Revolutionary\n\nIf you aren't obese then all you have to do is breath out and/or inhale water and you tend to sink. You are no longer buoyant. You are made of bones and muscle and without air in your lungs or a big fat reserve you are denser than water and tend to go down.\nPeople drown and rest on the bottom of whatever body of water they are in. It's the horrible reason we send divers to find drowned swimmers in rivers and lakes. They may bloat up later and float up again or they may not, That depends on what's in their stomach, if it can't be outgassed and if their body is caught on something.\n\nCunning\n\n\u2026and the more I think about it, the more unlikely it seems that the body rested in this position. Don't bodies tend to bloat when submerged? The legs should have been outstretched.\n\n*takes off sunglasses and turns from body* somebody made a titanic effort to make this look like a drowning\u2026.YEAAAAHHHHHHH!\n\n AwesomeRobot\n\nThere's a lot of pressure down there, so I imagine bloating wouldn't really overcome that \u2014 though I'm not an expert in deep sea decomposition or anything.\n\n BonzoDog1\n\nI was going to object to the grave-robbing by RMS Titanic, Inc., but then I found the parent company, Premier Exhibitions, makes most of its money displaying cadavers from China to the public, so what's the use?\nThere oughta be a sea law!\n\n Hamish Grant\n\nsomewhat related, the on-going arrival of leg-and-running shoe combinations washing up on the beaches in British Columbia\u2026\n\nBest theory is that the owners of these feet-and-shoes either fell/jumped off a bridge, or a boat out at sea and sank, and their bodies were consumed by marine life to the point that the weight of the body could no longer keep the buoyant running shoes below, and the legs separated from the body and floated to the surface, eventually washing up on shore.\n\nDv Revolutionary\n\nPoetic. Don't mention the whale fall sort of scavengers that probably were part of the process, that would make the scene horrific.\n\nJohn Stephens\n\nInteresting. I wonder if any if those shoe pairs were custom work, that could be identified after all these years? Possibly someone would like to know an ancestor's last resting place. And then again, perhaps not. Anyway, I routinely wear my old military dog tags on airplane flights, just in case. Maybe I should tuck a pair in my shoes if I'm ever on a cruise?\n\nxzzy\n\nI don't buy this interpretation, but that's the fun with archaeology.. much of it gets to be interpreted however you like!\n\nI just can't envision how a corpse would naturally settle in such a significant manner and then survive 100 years to be discovered in the same position. I mean, the Titantic sank two and a half miles. The owner of those boots was probably dead within a quarter mile of sea level.\n\nThe other debris in the photo says to me it's the contents of a suitcase that decomposed away. But I guess it's just as possible that it's random debris from the ship that just happened to settle nearby. Again, that's the fun wit archaeology.\n\nGiven that many people will remove their shoes if they must jump into the water, tying their shoes together in order to help hold on to them (or to put them on the deck), I wouldn't necessarily leap to the conclusion that there was a body in them\u2013not without evidence.\n\ndesperado\n\nSo, what you're telling me is that I should keep a copy of my ID in my SHOES, so that I can be identified in 100 years, in the event of death by berg, or some similar cause.\n\nmccrum\n\nBe sure that your ID is made out of similar shoe material or encased in similar shoe-materials. There have been specific instances of paper from the Titanic being brought to the surface, but they are the exception due to protective cases, not the rule.\n\nTouch Sensitive\n\nI don't know why it hasn't been linked, but there's a, 'coat and shoes' release, of a previously cropped photograph. Dating from the late 1990\u2032s. A pair of shoes reinforced by a coat lying face down.\n\nI was convinced this was on the BBC website, but it seems to have vanished. Some of the links may be a tad 'tabloid-ish', as a result. Humble apologies..\n\nYikes. The IrishCentral link includes an article that argues with a straight face that the teaching of evolution led to the Columbine massacre. Not to criticize you, but \"a tad tabloidish\" is putting it mildly.\n\n Rock Hardwood\n\nOn the local news, they had this story, but had a graphic warning, said this might be disturbing.. BODY parts found.. there's no body.. just shoes..\n\nI wonder what the body would have looked like though, under all that pressure.\n\n Red Monk\n\nIs it just me or does that look like a very unnatural way for a set of feet to end up?\n\nfiatrn\n\nAccording to Dr Ballard's book on discovering the Titanic, the cold temperatures keep bodies from producing gas and floating. So instead, people who drowned stayed at the bottom once they sank. And if you take a water logged heavy object and sink it in over 12,000 feet of water, I imagine it can land in any wacky way.\n\nthe FiatRN\n\n Rosin Ffield\n\ni don't feel it is correct that \"the bones decaclified\". Where i used to live they found a wooden boat COMPLETELY intact from prehistoric times. What i think happened is that someone had their shoe-pair tied in a suitcase. In the past people used to tie their shoes one to the other with the laces."}

{"text": "Valhalla - Primos 1871\n\nA ship's figurehead represents many things. The quality and design of the figurehead will reflect the wealth, taste and extravagance of the ship's owner. It is the final flourish in the long and expensive business of building a ship, so a gloriously worked, lavishly decorated figurehead would have been something of a public proclamation of status and pride by the owner.\n\nThe model for the figurehead may have been a wife, daughter, son, mistress or even the owner, himself. To the sailor, a figurehead was also an object of pride and also a key part of basic ship identification. Emerging from the fleshpots of Bombay, let us say, an illiterate sailor, whose critical faculties had been blunted by strong drink, might have struggled to pick out his own vessel amongst the hundreds of ships jostling together in the busy port. A figurehead was an obvious and vital source of recognition, in what might otherwise be a rather bewildering situation.\n\nA figurehead might also have some superstitious value, bringing good luck on each voyage, keeping watch over the seas, the ship and the crew. If ever this talismanic power was present in a figurehead, then it was never more so than in that of the Primos. The Primos was an iron barque, built in Sunderland in 1869. She was registered in Bilbao and was carried sugar from Havana to Falmouth and Greenock. On 24th June 1871, around dawn, the Primos struck the Seven Stones. She began to sink fast. One boat drifted away empty, before the captain and four of the 12 crew launched a second. This swiftly capsized in the heavy seas, drowning the occupants.\n\nIn some 12 minutes from first striking the rocks, the Primos slid under the waves, taking with her the entire crew. One man remained alive. Vincenzo Defilice, alone in the dark, heaving sea, had managed to grab hold of a hen coop, that had been swept off the decks of the Primos. For two hours he clung tenaciously to this makeshift raft. Shaking violently with cold and battered by the waves, Delifice began to wonder if a quicker end might be favourable, perhaps he should release his grip on the coop and allow the sea to claim him. Just as his numb fingers began to loosen their hold, something in the water caught his eye. There he could see, torn from the bow of his ship, the figurehead of the Primos.\n\nDelifice later stated, apparently, that once he saw the serene face of the figurehead, he knew that he would be saved. Letting go of the hen coop, he swam over to his buoyant saviour. For another hour, he hugged the figurehead until one the ship's boats drifted by. After rowing himself to English Island Neck by St Maritn's, he was rescued bu pilots. The figurehead washed up on St Martin's, having saved the life of Vincenzo Delifice.\n\nValhalla and the figurehead collection are to be found in the AbbeyGardens on Tresco.

{"text": "Plattsburgh's Link to a Maritime Tragedy\n\nIn the past 200 years, a few ships have borne the name Plattsburg. In the War of 1812, there was the unfinished vessel at Sackets Harbor, a project abandoned when the war ended. There was the rechristened troop transport that hauled thousands of troops home from the battlefields of World War I. There was the oil tanker that saw service in the Pacific theater during World War II. And there was the cruise boat that plied the waters of Lake Champlain in 2003\u20134. One of them played a role in perhaps the most famous maritime disaster of all time. The unfinished ship at Sacket's Harbor had been designated the USS Plattsburg. The oil tanker was the Plattsburg Socony, which survived a horrific fire in 1944. Thirty-three years later, after two more re-namings, it split in two beneath 30-foot waves and sank off Gloucester. The cruise ship was the short-lived Spirit of Plattsburgh. But it is the USS Plattsburg from the First World War that holds a remarkable place among the best \"what if\" stories ever.\n\nIn early April 1917, just three days after the United States entered World War I, a merchant marine ship, the New York, struck a German mine near Liverpool, England. The damage required extensive repairs. A year later, the ship was chartered by the US Navy, converted into a troop transport, and newly christened the USS Plattsburg.\n\nBy the time the armistice was signed, ending the war in November of that same year, the Plattsburg had made four trips to Europe within six months, carrying nearly 9,000 troops of the AEF (American Expeditionary Forces) to battle.\n\nThe transport assignment continued, and in the next nine months, the Plattsburg made seven additional trips, bringing more than 24,000 American troops home. A few months later, the ship was returned to her owners, reassuming the name SS New York. After performing commercial work for a few years, the ship was scrapped in 1923.\n\nWhen the end came, the New York had been in service for 35 years. At its launch in 1888 in Glasgow, Scotland, it was named S.S. City of New York. The S.S. indicated it was a \"screw steamer,\" a steamship propelled by rotating screw propellers (City of New York was one of the first to feature twin screws). After service under the British merchant flag, the ship was placed under the US registry as the New York, where it served in like manner for five more years.\n\nIn 1898, the US Navy chartered the New York, renaming it Harvard for service during the Spanish-American War. It served as a transport in the Caribbean, and once plucked more than 600 Spanish sailors from ships that were destroyed off Santiago, Cuba. When the war ended, the Harvard transported US troops back to the mainland, after which it was decommissioned and returned to her owners as the New York.\n\nA few years later, the ship was rebuilt, and from 1903\u20131917, it was used for routine commercial activities around the world. In April 1912, the New York was at the crowded inland port of Southampton, England. It wasn't the largest ship docked there, but at 585 feet long and 63 feet wide, it was substantial.\n\nTowering above it at noon on the 10th of April was the Titanic. At 883 feet long, it was the largest man-made vessel ever built. This was launch day for the great ship, and thousands were on hand to observe history. The show nearly ended before it started.\n\nNo one could predict what would happen. After all, nobody on earth was familiar with operating a vessel of that size. Just ahead lay the Oceanic and the New York, and as the Titanic slowly passed them, an unexpected reaction occurred.\n\nThe Titanic's more than 50,000-ton displacement of water caused a suction effect, and the New York, solidly moored, resisted. It rose on the Titanic's wave, and as it dropped suddenly, the heavy mooring ropes began to snap, one by one, with a sound likened to gunshots. The New York was adrift, inexorably drawn towards the Titanic. A collision seemed inevitable.\n\nHuge ships passing within 50 to 100 feet of each other might be considered a close call. In this case, desperate maneuvers by bridge personnel and tug operators saved the day (unfortunately). The gap between the two ships closed to only a few feet (some said it was two feet, and others said four). Had they collided, the Titanic's maiden voyage would have been postponed.\n\nNo one can say for sure what else might have happened, but a launch delay would have prevented the calamity that occurred a few days later, when the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank within hours, claiming more than 1,500 lives.\n\nThere you have it. A ship that bore four names\u2014City of New York, Harvard, New York, and Plattsburg\u2014is forever tied to the fascinating, tragic story of the Titanic.\n\nPhoto Top: USS Plattsburg at Brest France 1918.\n\nPhoto Middle Right: L to R: The Oceanic, New York, and Titanic in Southampton harbor.\n\nPhoto Middle Left: The tug Vulcan struggles with the New York to avoid a collision.\n\nPhoto Bottom: The New York (right) is drawn ever closer to the Titanic.\n\nLawrence Gooley has authored eight books and several articles on the North Country's past.

{"text": "American Maritime Documents, 1776-1860 - Stein, Douglas L.\n\nThe 1822 edition of The Merchants and Shipmaster's Assistant described the Sea Letter as a document which \"specifies the nature of the cargo and the place of destination,\" and says that is was only required for vessels bound to the Southern Hemisphere. It further \"indicated that \"...this paper is not so necessary as the passport, because that, in most particulars, supplies its place.\" In 1859 the document was defined as part of the ship's papers when bound on a foreign voyage,\"...it is written in four languages, the French, Spanish, English, and Dutch, and is only necessary for vessels bound round Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope.\"\n\nLike the Mediterranean Passport, the Sea Letter was a remarkably standardized document, which changed little during the time that it was used. Usually printed on heavy grade paper, approximately 16\" x20\" in size, the first Sea Letters carried only three languages instead of four. However, they soon became known as \"Four Language Sea Letters.\"\n\nThe statement within the document conveys in part that the vessel described is owned entirely by American citizens, and requests that all \"Prudent Lords, Kings, Republics, Princes, Dukes, Earls, Barons, Lord, Burgomasters, Schepens, Consullors...\" etc., treat the vessel and her crew with fairness and respect. The signatures of the President of the United Stated, the Secretary of State, and the customs collector appear, usually in the middle portion of the document, The United States seal is present, while customs and consular stamps or seals are frequently in evidence.\n\nSea Letters are mentioned in the formative maritime legislation forged by the new Federal governments. Like passports, they provided additional evidence of ownership an nationality, but the criteria by which a shipmaster utilized one document over the other is not completely clear. It was explained at the time that both documents were \"rendered necessary of expedient by reason of treaties with foreign powers,\" a statement which suggests that certain nations required a particular document because of existing agreements with the United States.\n\nIn any case the Sea Letter was valid for only a single voyage, and a bond does not seem to have been required. Neither was it to be returned to the collector when the voyage was completed. Indications are that, as the years progressed, Sea Letters were being used more often by whaling ships than by merchant vessels, perhaps because American whalers fished in areas where this document was preferred as proof of national origin.\n\nBy providing a statement of American property, signed by the President of the United States, the Mediterranean Passport and the Sea Letter were intended to confirm our status as a neutral nation, when international conflict put added dangers on America's commerce at sea. By mid-century, however, much of what had previously threatened our shipping was being neutralized by the expanding power of the United States. In 1831 Congress eliminated the fee required for obtaining a Mediterranean Passport. It was argued a the time that the revenue arising from that source, and the protection which it provided, were no longer objects of any importance. As our merchant fleet became more secure, fewer shipowners and shipmasters considered these documents as necessary to guarantee their rights and safety in foreign lands.*\n\nBoth pieces were considered important parts of a ship's papers in the 1800s. They were kept aboard ship during the voyage and deposited, along with the Registry Certificate, with the appropriate U.S. consular authority anytime the vessel was in a foreign port. The Mediterranean Passport had disappeared from use by 1860, while the Sea Letter was still in evidence several years later.\n\nToday both pieces are considered to be important documents in any maritime collection. However, they are also highly valued by autograph collectors and investors, which keeps many fine pieces in private hands.\n*It is important here to note that both documents were intended only to protect the vessel from capture of destruction by providing American, - i.e., nonbelligerent - ownership. American crew members aboard these ships were still vulnerable to impressment, especially if they did not carry their own personal protection certificates as proof of citizenship."}
{"text": "was found convenient, particularly in ships of war, to connect the two short decks by a boarded passage on each side, called the gangway; to support which were placed beams, or rafters, that reached right across the ship. This gave to the whole such a continuous appearance, that no person, not otherwise taught would hesitate to call it as our landman did * the upper deck of the ship. And even a marine writer of France justifies the term:-\"On peut regarder les gaillards comme le Pont le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 des vaisseaux, dout une partie est interrompue entre le grand m\u00e2t et le m\u00e2t de misaine; ce qui forme deux demi-ponts au niveau l'un de I'autre.\" \u2020\n\nSome advances have, however, since been made. The French, for instance, were accustomed occasionally to cover with a grating the open space between the two \"half-decks;\" and then it was no longer \"les gaillards,\" or \"les demi-ponts,\" but \"le pont de cailbottis,\" the deck with a grating. \" Je crois donc que les vaisseaux du second rang pourroient avoir trois ponts sans gaillards, on plut\u00f4t les gaillards qui formeroient le troisi\u00e8me pont, seroient joints par des cailbottis, comme on l'a v\u00fb au Tonnant. De tels b\u00e2timens, qu'on pourroit regrarder comme d'ayant que deux ponts, seroient, au moyen du pont de cailbottis, &c.\" \u2021 In more modern times, each passage, or gangway, has in some cases been widened, so as to admit a gun to recoil; or, if necessary, as many guns as the passage, from its length, can receive. But even this, with the English, is not allowed to take from the deck that is underneath, and which is now almost covered from sight, its ancient name of upper. The ship, therefore, should particularity be requisite, not otherwise, has a new deck assigned to her, called the spar deck; a name the origin or application of which every one seems ignorant. If it is because the ship's spare spars are stowed on that deck, so are they in the same place on board every ship ; namely, on each side of the launch, between the fore and main masts. The French say, \"Pont sur gueule,\" which may be rendered, \"the deck built over the mouth of the upper deck,\" commonly called the waist. Why is this not as complete a deck as any in the ship ? Hence, asno one ventures, in common utterance, to speak of a spar-decked one, two, or three decker, a ship of this construction may mount a whole tier of cannon beyond what her denomination expresses and we shall, by and by, have to adduce some very formidable examples.\n\nNot only the three and the two, but the single decked ship feels, and that to a greater extent, the inconvenience of this ambiguous nomenclature. For instance, a ship that mounts"}

{"text": "Maritime Law by Barb Karg and Arjean Spaite\n\nMaritime law is defined as the body of law relating to maritime commerce and navigation, and to maritime matters in general. Each country generally controls the waters surrounding it, and their laws apply, but there are vast areas on the high seas that aren't owned or governed by any country. Because of this, the international community has often attempted to work together to form laws that would cover the world's oceans. In 1958, the United Nations Conventions on the High Seas was held, and in 1982 the Convention on the Law of the Sea was convened. These two groups defined piracy as \"an attack mounted for private ends on a ship on the high seas that involves violence, illegal detentions of persons or property, or the theft or destruction of goods.\" The more recent United Nations Law of the Seas defines piracy as \"any illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed by individuals for private ends against a private ship or aircraft.\" They also specify that two vessels must be involved in the incident, otherwise the act is one of hijacking rather than piracy.\n\nWhy was there a need for a change in the definition of piracy?\n\nThere are problems with the first definition, including the fact that it states that the attack must occur \"on the high seas.\" Many pirate attacks are much closer to shore, some even occurring on docked boats and rivers. Also, this definition said that the attack had to occur for private gain, and this is difficult to prove given that pirate's identities are typically unknown and the individuals can't be shown to be acting for their own private gain.\n\nThe majority of modern pirates operate out of a specific homeland, and piracy is most common near areas where authorities tend to turn a blind eye to their acts. Most countries have differing levels of laws and law enforcement, and local governments may condone or even participate in acts of piracy. For example, in 1995 the Philippine Coast Guard boarded the merchant ship Kafu Maru, allegedly searching it for illegal firearms. They found no firearms, but did commandeer the ship's cargo of cigarettes and liquor, which was worth over 4,500,000 pesos. The coast guard officers neglected to report that they'd taken the cargo, despite the fact that it was later found in their homes.\n\nOutside of local waters, international maritime laws prevail in any instance of piracy. If a ship on the high seas is suspected of being a pirate ship, it can legally be boarded and seized by any official government vessel. The pirates can then be arrested, and subjected to the laws and penalties of any country that apprehends them."}
