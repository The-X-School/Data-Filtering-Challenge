{"text": "I See You Typing\n\nSpying on someone by hacking into his webcam is disturbingly easy. Why don't more people do it?\n\nStill, webcam espionage isn't very common. Most scammers are interested in money, and video of someone's slack-jawed mug isn't going to yield much cash. \"Most stuff you'd capture on a camera, they've already posted on Facebook,\" says Kevin Haley of Symantec Security Response. *Even if you did have hundreds of hours of video and audio capturing someone's conversations, it's a lot harder to index and search than written information. (Some programs solve this problem by activating the camera only if they sense movement.) If it's profit the hacker wants, the contents of the computer are much more valuable than whatever's happening in front of it.\n\nIf someone hacks into a webcam, therefore, it's usually a targeted attack. Pure creepiness is one motivation. A 15-year-old girl in Texas reported in 2004 that a hacker who took over her computer would eject the disk drive and say things like, \"I like your shirt.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there's spying on people you'd like to keep an eye on, such as, say, your spouse. One could see this being useful for private investigators, though PIs I spoke with say they don't know of anyone hacking into webcams as part of their work. \"The technology is there for it to happen,\" says Charles McLaughlin, a PI in Andover, Mass. \"But in the private sector, although there are some characters willing to break the law, most reputable PIs don't.\" You might get away with it if you install the spyware own your own computer\u2014say, the one in the bedroom\u2014but even that gets into shady legal territory.\n\nMore threatening than video is audio. By accessing a computer's microphone, you turn the computer into a bug. It's also more clandestine than video, since the microphone is always on and there's usually no light to tip you off when it's recording. \"The mic thing worries me a lot more,\" says Chris Wysopal of the security firm Veracode. \"Unless you can lip-read, [video alone] isn't that useful.\"\n\nSo how do you prevent someone from spying on you? The usual Internet hygiene applies. Don't click the weird attachment your computer-illiterate relatives send you, update your antivirus software regularly, and so forth. If you want to be really cautious, the best solution is the simplest: Put a piece of tape over the camera. It may be the laptop equivalent of the tinfoil hat, but it's the only way to absolutely guarantee privacy. The microphone is trickier, since you can't tape it up. You can disable it, though, by plugging a converter or some other cord into the computer's microphone jack, which turns off the internal mic.\n\nBut ultimately, there's only so much you can do. Vulnerability is a fact of cyber life: Anytime you open a portal to the outside world, it makes intrusion possible. The problem is when we don't even know the portal exists, or are only dimly aware of it. There's a general rule that you shouldn't write anything in an e-mail that you wouldn't want shared with the world. Perhaps the same should apply to dancing in your underwear while your laptop is watching.\n\nCorrection,April 6, 2009: This article originally misspelled the name of Symantec Security Response.

As Sun Tzu says, \"Victory is more important than winning battles.\"\n\nIf you want to show superiority in skill over your target, then you have to be more skilled. Critical systems as you mention raise the bar on being able to defeat them, so a simple SQL Injection may or may not be successful (but that's why we do penetration testing: so see where the bar is set).\n\nIf you want to be victorious, then you need to transcend your target to see a wider battlefield.

If a target system is connected to a larger network, that increases the threat surface. There are some systems that require physical access (i.e. no network connectivity). Even those systems are subject to mission impossible-style physical access attempts.\n\nNo single programming language will help you learn or exploit complex systems, SCADA or otherwise. If you're really interested in learning, learn all you can about everything - from programming languages to operating systems to networking protocols to cpu/memory architecture. It's a high barrier to entry.\n\nThis is very vague. Is it possible? Most definitely, yes if proper precautions aren't met or if privileged users can be socially engineered or forced into giving up authentication details.\n\nIs it easy? It shouldn't be. Nmap/SQL injections would only work if the controlling device is internet connected to a public web interface, which they shouldn't be. At a minimum you should have to go through say a VPN before getting to something that controls critical resources. (Not to say VPNs don't have zero day vulnerabilities; or users don't reuse passwords/leave keys lying around).\n\nGranted if its a satelite that receives commands via radio, you could possibly build your own antenna, send bogus commands, etc. But likely commands are encrypted, kept secure, and use timestamps/nonces/sequence numbers in the encrypted message (no replay attacks)."}

They are relatively rare, unseen events, that make the news only when something goes horribly wrong.\nSecurity filters in both the real world and in the electronic world all work on pretty much the same principles. The computer security filters look for the presence of a set of \"features\", such as a set of binary strings or the libraries used by a given program, while real world security filters look for weapons in carry-on bags or other suspicious activities.\n\nBoth types of systems have error rates that are defined, measured, and hopefully reduced. Type I errors, or false positives, are mistakes where something is marked malicious when it is really clean, while Type II errors, or false negatives, are mistakes where malicious content is marked legitimate. Type I errors consists of legitimate mail going to your spam folder or travelers being told they can't fly due to their name being on a secret list. Type II errors consists of viruses that infect machines that are already running anti-virus and guys who smuggle shoe-bombs onto airliners.\n\nAcceptable numbers for false positive and false negative errors depend on the relative cost of an error and when the last error occurred. As a society we tolerate relatively high false positive error rates as long as false negative errors are zero for the screening of potential terrorists, while we don't tolerate false negative errors at all for desktop anti-virus, as it would affect legitimate software.\n\nAs errors fade into memory, our risk tolerance changes. Today, we are far less tolerance of false positives in anti-virus systems, as not too many people remember the days of when the Michelangelo virus would nuke a chunk of the hard drive on a given day. American citizens are also less tolerant of false positives when it comes to finding terrorists, as the current political climate has clearly shown.\n\nAll of you are aware that Google had a brief false positive issue on Saturday morning that was rapidly remedied. Their technology is important for providing the average user with a first-line filter for removing web-borne threats. I hope that people will continue to trust it, even with their small increase in false positive rate.\n\nRE: The psychological impact of false positives\n\nWell, if your car alarms goes off randomly, do you get rid of the alarm? Not\nreally, there are too many benefits. I think, in my view, the principle is\nthe same. People are used to \"false positives\", yes a certain amount of\ncompliance from the security control crying wolf will, for most people, make\nthem more complacent, as the \"feeling part of the brain\" might decided not\nallow the \"thinking\" part of the brain the effort or interest.\n\nTypo in Definitions - NOT\n\nHere's the actual quote. Nothing wrong with this...\n\n\"Type I errors, or false positives, are mistakes where something is marked malicious when it is really clean, while Type II errors, or false negatives, are mistakes where malicious content is marked legitimate.\"\n\nThe psychological impact of ...\n\nWait a minute! The name of the article is: The\nPsychological impact of false positives.\n\nNice discussion of what false positives are but\nwhat about the psychological impact? I see no\ndiscussion to that. What are the symptoms of\n\"False Positivical Disorder?\" We already know\nwhat causes it, is there anyone out there\ninfected? Hmmmm...Are we going to be falsely diagnosed?\n\nRE: The psychological impact of false positives\n\nThe examples need to be rewritten, as does the title\nof the article. There is no discussion of\n\"psychological impact\" here, and the fp discussion is\nconfused:\n\"Today, we are far less tolerance of false positives\nin anti-virus systems, as not too many people remember\nthe days of when the Michelangelo virus would nuke a\nchunk of the hard drive on a given day.\"\nNo, if users remember days of their hd being\ndestroyed, they would be far less tolerant of false\nnegatives, because they wouldn't want a virus to be\nmissed."}

I'd like to report him if for nothing else to get something on his record so if he does this often he can get some fines or jail time.\n\n5 Answers\n\nThe (old and possibly outdated) CERT \"Recovering from a System Compromise\" document suggests several methods for people in the US, mainly the FBI. It's also worth reading the page for forensic investigation and cleanup strategies.\n\nMaking false accusations is also a serious matter. Not only is that company a broadband provider so likely to be a customer IP rather than employee, more than likely it is a compromised machine controlled by someone else based anywhere in the world. Have you made a complaint to abuse@get.no? The FBI have no jurisdiction outside of USA so even if you had any evidence whatsoever you wouldn't be likely to get very far unless it was a serious crime. You are better off putting your effort into fixing the vulnerabilities in your own site.\n\n@EK: \"The FBI have no jurisdiction outside of USA\" - what relevance is that? Tyler doen't give his/her location. No police organisation has international jurisdiction - but they will cooperate / refer issues. But agreed that it may well be a compromised system and that the first port of call would be the contact address published in 'whois' (None for this domain) \u2013 symcbeanJun 28 '10 at 13:39\n\n1\n\nHe did state that he was in the US and that comment was mainly in response to others suggesting the FBI. There is an abuse contact for the domain in the whois which I included in my answer. \u2013 JamesRyanJun 29 '10 at 9:28\n\nThe FBI will generally not do anything for cases unless there is $5000 of damage. However, that threshold usually puts you at the bottom of a very long list, usually eliciting an interview, some questions, they take the logs, details, etc and forward it to their computer squad. Defacements/hacks of a single site, the fact that the hacker wasn't in the USA and probably hacked your site from a compromised machine makes it much more difficult to track down unless that host is willing to log/capture data and hand it over.\n\nYou can try posting details to  or contacting your local FBI office. Archive the logs, any modified files, etc and burn it to a CD/DVD so that you can hand it over. The more analysis you hand over with your report the better, but, don't get your hopes up for them actually doing much to catch a hacker that is most likely outside the USA.\n\nYou've got an IP address, but that doesn't mean that the person who (legitimately) had the IP address at that time is the person responsible for the attack on your site? How do you know the system using that IP hadn't been compromised? For all you know, the legitimate user of that IP address may also be (and probably is) a victim?\n\nAt the end of the day, if you have an insecure system, it is inevitable that this will happen. If you aren't 100% sure your system is secure, don't publicly expose it to the internet.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, I'm not defending the malicious person who did this, on the contrary, they should be punished to the full extent that the law allows, and I definitely do sympathise with your situation, but I believe your time would be better spent learning how they got in to your system and ensuring it can't happen again, rather than starting a finger pointing exercise, which will almost certainly be fruitless.\n\nEdit: Just saw the answer from @JamesRyan, who should have got the accepted answer to this question IMHO.\n\nThanks Bryan, but the question wasn't why should I do? It was how do I report. \u2013 TylerJan 3 '12 at 23:39\n\nVery true Tyler, but the point I'm making is that you are likely reporting an innocent party. I don't know the specifics of the event you suffered, and you might well have evidence that you haven't disclosed that proves you know beyond doubt who the assailant is, the fact that you didn't suggests to me that you were trying to starting a wild goose chase. Apologies if this isn't the case, I'm just going of the info available. If you do have evidence that proves this, then I wish you the best of luck, however I'm afraid I can't answer the specific question you asked. \u2013 BryanJan 3 '12 at 23:49\n\nIt's in the past friend, I figured who it was, got them to admit it and resolved any issues.

{"text": "Major types of Hacking\n\nHacking is basically a programming procedure through which a hacker can change any desired activity within the computer program and modify the software or hardware of one's OperatingSystem. There are actually many different hacking techniques available and each hacking attempt or procedure happens for different purposes.\n\nThe word hacker basically means a cyber attacker who assault on thecomputer's or network system security and manipulates the system accordingto their will. Hacking can be performed in several different platforms like in a personal computer, a website, emails, gadgets, wireless connection, personal accounts and even in mobile phones. Hackers' basically use different types of hacking software and programming algorithms to access and hackinto different kinds of platforms. So, here are few types of hacking that you'd like to know about :\n\nBlack Hat : This is actually one of the famous among all the different types of hacking. Black hat hacking is usually done to steal others' confidential information and break into protected systems.\n\nLegal Hacking or White Hat : This hacking is actually intentionally done to check for the vulanerability in one's system.\n\nGrey Hat : This is actually the combination of the both the above mentioned hacking. It is done using legal access to steal and modify unauthorized data.\n\nBlue Hat : This hacking is intentionally done by providing authority to a third party to check for bugs in your own system.\n\nScript Kiddie : These are normal very new to the scene, amateur hackers who use others' ideas and software for hacking.\n\nHacktivism : These are actually people who want to spread their beliefs and ideas in the form of message via the hacked system to other normal users.\n\nPhreaker : These hackers are actually limited to only Telecom hacking who actually play tricks with the telephone and make free ISD or STD calls.\n\nComputer Security Hacker : Hackers who know technical speciality of computer security and networking. They normally use fragmented packets to attack the firewall or ISP.\n\nNeophyte : Neophyte are actually the beginners in the hacking world, almost very new to the internet fundamentals.\n\nAcademic Hacker : These are persons who are actually monitoring and doing research about different types of hacking.\n\nHobby Hacker : These are actually normal users who are keen to unlock latest updates and applications. Like hacking done as a hobby like jail breaking done on Apple iPhones, modifying software/ hardware etc.\n\nElite: The word \"Elite\" is actually stated to hackers who are expert on what they are doing."}

See cracker, hack, white hat hacker and samurai.\n\nHackers Targeted the Internet\n\nThe term \"hacker\" was entrenched by the time this article appeared in early 2000, which referred to a huge denial of service (DOS) attack on Yahoo!, eBay, Amazon.com and other Web sites.

{"text": "I just thought I'd clear up all these rumors, questions etc regarding\nthe denial of service attacks which happened a while ago.\n\n1) Did mafiaboy use trinoo or smurf?\nHe didnt use either. He used a program called mstream and yes its\nprivate. It basically is similar to trinoo. It comprises of a client\nand a server. With the server it listens on port 7983 and you specify\nthe hosts which will connect to the server on that port. For that\nreason you must have been added to the server to packet from it. On\nthe server.c program is appears like this:\nchar *m[]={\n\"1.1.1.1\", /* first master */\n\"2.2.2.2\", /* second master */\n\"3.3.3.3\", /* third master etc */\n0 };\n\nNow as for the client you can define a password, serverfile and max\nnumber of users to use the client at one time. The client then\nconnects to the servers and gets the servers to send all crap data to\nthe host you specify and hence if you got enough servers will take\nthem down eg as mafiaboy did.\n\n2) So did mafiaboy actully hack anything?\nThe answer is yes. All the machine he installed the server on he had\nto have root. Therefore he must have hacked a lot of machines in\npreparation for the attack on the sites.\n\n3) Did mafiaboy take out all the sites?\nNo, mafiaboy only took out yahoo, etrade and some others which I cant\nremember. Coolio took out the rest. No matter what you're told I\nassure you Coolio took out the rest.\n\n4) How come it took so long for mafiaboy to get arrested?\nSimple he hanged low and the fbi etc had not enough evidence to make\nan arrest that was until his outburst on self-evident's msg board. His\nallowed the fbi etc to swoop swiftly and quickly.\n\nNow its time for my opinion:\n1) Do you think mafiaboy will get convicted?\nWell it depends, if mafiaboy admits to dos'ing those sites then yes I\nbelieve he will be convicted then again if he denies it I believe they\nwon't have enough evidence on him. The only reason they caught him is\nthat his nick etc was posted on  He also said to a\nperson I know that he destroyed the hard drive in a fire which would\ngive the fbi no physical evidence at his end.\n\nMafiaboy's story:\nHere is a quick rephraze of what mafiaboy has said in channels before\nhe got arrested. His nick has been edited out for various reasons.\n<> god fucking damnit\n<> i wish i can go back in time\n<> and undo what i did\n\nIn closing I'll tell you how I know this.

Basically spies on and subverts industrial systems. It is notorious for attacking and damaging centrifuges of an Iranian uranium enrichment facility in 2010.\n\nDuqu: Also a computer worm which is often related to the Stuxnet.

But the Kaspersky researchers declined to say which nation or nations they believe are behind Flame.\n\nWhy the needle of suspicion points towards the same nation states that build Stuxnet?\n\nActually, the creators of Stuxnet and Flame employed similar techniques to infect computers, which suggests that they were \"parallel\" projects backed by the same nation state.\n\nCyberacture\n\nCreation of living and working spaces which are a harmonious blend of technology, multimedia, intelligent systems and user interactivity, that is Cyber + Architecture.

{"text": "\" \"\n\nback when the first ipad came out, AT&T set up a system for purchasers of the 3G model to register their email addresses on the device. because they're brainless turd-men, AT&T coded it in the worst way possible and left the system with such a massive security hole that anybody who cared could come along, change a number in a URL, and get customer data.\n\nthat's really the extent of the security flaw. it's not a case of serious hacking, there was no actual code exploitation in the traditional sense. literally just changing the string of numbers at the end of the URL would give you the email address of whichever person happened to be assigned to that string of numbers\u2014 that's how poorly AT&T hammered their shit together. of course, somebody eventually noticed it and wrote a script to automate the process. functionally it was exactly the same as just typing new numbers by hand, except that it was a scrap of code doing it instead. the dude in question, notorious shitpile and obnoxious beardgoon \"weev\", harvested a couple hundred thousand email addresses this way. not their passwords or contents, just the address itself.\n\nafter deliberation about what to do with the addresses he had harvested (including the idea of selling them to spammers, let's not forget that weev sucks a lot), he decided to take the \"noble\" route and expose the security flaw to a journalist. now, years later, he's going to prison for pointing out the security hole in the same way any number of \"white hat\" corporate-backed hackers might. what this means, among other things, is that at any given moment a legitimate \"security researcher\" can run afoul of a capricious district attorney or vengeful megacorporation, resulting in judicial harassment, draining of finances through legal costs, conviction and imprisonment, or worse.\n\nweev is a crap dude (no really look him up) and i can't stand him and he deserves to stub his toe really hard every day for the rest of his life, but he doesn't deserve to go to jail just because AT&T got embarrassed over their half-assed coding. you don't have to be a hacker to get caught up in the same way, and it's worth thinking about while you're out dicking around on the internet. the incredibly aggressive prosecution practices we're seeing in cases like this don't operate under any laws of logic or reason, with comparatively tiny actions by often well-meaning individuals being met with the full force of judicial authority for the sake of making a political point.\n\nkeep it in mind, allright? IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU\n\nAll of this. And I'm giving serious thought to writing a browser extension that makes a picture of weev's beard pop up on screen every time a girl types that she likes guys with beards, but still. As many other people have mentioned, also in the news today two guys raped an unconscious sixteen year old girl. They received a sentence only 43% as long as weev, even though weev only accessed publicly available data and didn't actually harm a single person or thing aside from AT&T's misplaced pride.\n\nOr: 3-way date-rape - less than half as terrible as pointing out shitty coding, according to the US Justice system. I don't doubt that here in the UK things would be much different, where also today our politicians finally responded to public disgust and outrage at tabloids acting as though they're above the law by setting out new legally enforceable press guidelines that conveniently could also be used to prosecute and effectively censor tweeters and bloggers because yes that's exactly what we wanted from all this you total evil motherfuckers.\n\nThe Internet's \"anarchy\" may seem strange or even unnatural, but it makes a certain deep and basic sense. It's rather like the \"anarchy\" of the English language. Nobody rents English, and nobody owns English. As an English-speaking person, it's up to you to learn how to speak English properly and make whatever use you please of it (though the government provides certain subsidies to help you learn to read and write a bit). Otherwise, everybody just sort of pitches in, and somehow the thing evolves on its own, and somehow turns out workable. And interesting. Fascinating, even. Though a lot of people earn their living from using and exploiting and teaching English, \"English\" as an institution is public property, a public good. Much the same goes for the Internet. Would English be improved if the \"The English Language, Inc.\" had a board of directors and a chief executive officer, or a President and a Congress? There'd probably be a lot fewer new words in English, and a lot fewer new ideas.\nPeople on the Internet feel much the same way about their own institution. It's an institution that resists institutionalization. The Internet belongs to everyone and no one.\n\nYou should also compare the largely unfettered evolution of modern English with that of French, which (in France at least) is carefully moderated, shaped and pruned by L'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in what most English people regard as a Canute-like attempt to stem the flow of loan-words into modern French (in part, because most of these loan-words are English, which the English find hilarious because the old rivalries never really go away). Is French better, stronger, and more relevant for this kind of control?Nick Clegg, above, is leader of the Liberal Democrats. They're Britain's 3rd political party. The vote is generally split mainly between Labour (used to be left wing, have drifted closer to centre & alienated lots of voters in their quest to please rich party donors) and the Conservaties (AKA the Tories, who are right wing, like to pretend they're centrists to catch swinging voters in elections, but then go right back to foaming at the mouth about poor people breathing their air).\n\nAnd then there's the Lib Dems.\n\nIn the 2010 general election Labour had pissed off a lot of their core voters, the Tories were pretending to soften their policies a bit, and the Lib Dems had Nick Clegg as party leader, who was seen as young and progressive. The party stood to have its best result ever, and finally become a proper force in British polictics.\n\nIn the end, the vote was split, and the Lib Dems had three options:\n\nRemain independent, and get to vote whichever way they pleased in parliament, thus essentially controlling all votes even though they technically weren't in charge.\n\nAlly themselves with Labour, the party that was ideologically incredibly close to them, making a coalition government whose supporters saw eye to eye on most issues.\n\nWhore themselves out to the Tories, who were quite clearly opposed to Lib Dem ideology, just for a tiny sniff of power.\n\nGuess which option Nick chose?\n\nAnd when I say they whored themselves, I mean they utterly capitulated on every single one of their primary election promises and totally betrayed the trust of every single person who voted for them, blackening their name in the public consciousness and virtually guaranteeing that in the next election they're going to lose dozens of seats in Parliament, being reduced to a fraction of the former influence and power that they'd slowly worked decades to build, and setting their cause back an incredibly long way.\n\nIt was maybe the dumbest move they could have made.\n\nBut Nick Clegg didn't think he could be friends with the leader of the Labour Party, Gordon Brown.\n\nYes, that is what his decision hinged upon.\n\nBritain has failed to recover from recession, libraries and community centres have been sold off cheap to developers, the NHS is in the worst state it's ever been as Tory hawks try to carve it up and sell it to their rich friends against the wishes of most Britons, jobless figures have risen, the gap between rich and poor has increased, only the wealthy can afford higher education, the economy has stagnated, everything feels like it's turning to shit, and it's all because Nick Clegg couldn't be fwends with Gordon Brown.\n\nCash Offer of the Day: Hustler head honcho Larry Flynt took out a full page ad in today's Washington Post, offering $1 million to anyone who could provide information about Mitt Romney's tax returns or various other assets.\n\nLarry clearly hasn't been keeping up with the times, because the people who supposedly have such information only accept Bitcoins.\n\nHeh, this is awesome. Those mad old bastards at the GOP have, amongst a raft of other Protecting American Americanism proposals (essentially, \"No Gays, No Abortions, No Muslims, No Fat Chicks\"), decided they really need to have a bug up their collective arse about making the internet \"safer.\"\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nWell, making sure children can't gamble, making sure children can't meet Atheists online, making sure they can't see naked people, making sure that someone thinks about the children won't somebody think about the children?\n\nI can sort of see their point. Really, no sarcasm, those are kind of fair and reasonable things exceeeeppppptttt\u2026..\n\nExcept they're obviously going to just go mad with the power if they get a sniff of it aren't they? Ohhhhhh, those guys.\n\nAnd I really really really think they should set their sights squarely on those awful pornographers for a start. Which, those of you who know me, might find kind of sort of out of character a bit. But no, no no no, not at all. Let me explain:\n\nThe American porn industry is huge. Billions of dollars a year huge. Bigger than Hollywood. Bigger than all the sports franchises in the US combined. Bigger than their top TV broadcasters combined. Amazing. And this is a highly-connected tech-savvy industry too. Oh sure, you could take that giant on in a fight, but it's gonna cost you a hell of a lot of money and if you're successful then you put thousands of people out of work and shrink the American economy by billions of dollars. Hey, good luck with that.\n\nWhat do you think of when you picture a core GOP voter? Yup, it's a guy. For a party that has so many policies that can be harmful to women, for a party that doesn't even appear to understand women (\"spastic tubes\" and all that), it's refreshing to see them spreading the love around a little bit. Because while some women like to sample some nudey pictures, pretty much all men have indulged. Oh I'm generalising, I'm not even bothering to cite a source, this isn't a real debate and I'm not your real Dad! But I'm still totally right and you know it. Oh, hey politically dispossessed low-income blue-collar male, do you like internet porn and vote GOP because you don't want the gays and the brown people to tell you how to live? Yes, yes you do, don't you? I'd draw a Venn diagram of the prototypical GOP voters demographic, and people who like to download porn, but the two circles are perfectly aligned over one another, so it'd be a bit pointless.\n\nOther countries. Hello, yes America, the internet does not belong exclusively to you, so even if you manage to stop Americans making stuff you don't like, there's still another couple of hundred other countries in the world who you aren't in charge of, and porn in Myanmar or Djibouti or Vanuatu or wherever is just as easy for Americans to access as naked pictures hosted in California. All you'll do is shift that industry (and all the aforementioned billions of dollars) offshore.\n\nI get why you want to regulate this industry GOP, I really do, but you have no idea what you're doing, no idea of the magnitude of the task nor the massive negative impact your regulation would have on both the American economy and your popularity with voters.\n\nSo go ahead, take on that Sisyphean task, blow away your money and make people dislike you. I'm totally cool with that. Should keep you guys busy and out of power for a few years.\n\nFor"}

{"text": "from the might-be-a-bit-extreme dept\n\nA few years back, we asked if it should be illegal to get hacked. In that case, we were referring to some fines that the FTC had handed out to companies that had leaked data to hackers. This raised some troubling questions -- as it's often difficult-to-impossible to stop your computer systems from getting hacked, and putting liability on the company could lead to some serious unintended consequences. Yet, at the same time, over the past few years, we've heard about large security breaches on a regular basis (thanks, in large part, to new disclosure laws) -- and often those breaches definitely seem to be due to negligence on the part of a corporate IT team that failed to lock down the data in any significant manner. That seems to be leading more people down the path of saying that companies should be liable for getting hacked.\n\nFor example, Slashdot points us to a blog post at InfoWorld, where it's suggested that companies should be criminally liable for leaking such data. I can certainly understand the sentiment, but it may go too far. Again, it's impossible to totally protect a system from getting hacked. Sooner or later there's always going to be some sort of leak. Increasing penalties could make companies take things more seriously -- especially in cases of gross negligence (which do seem all too common). But making the rules too strict can have serious negative unintended consequences as well, even to the point that some companies may stop accepting credit cards altogether, since the liability would just be too great. Would people be willing to give up the convenience of credit cards to protect their safety? From what we've seen, for most users the answer would be no. They know their credit cards are at risk, but they still use them because the benefit of the convenience still seems to outweigh the danger of the risk"}
{"text": "Actually, human language is a great example that shows this is not true. You are able to utter sentences that have never been uttered before by combining language constructs recursively.

These cameras plug directly into your internet connection and stream what they see to clients that can authenticate properly with the camera's software.\n\nIt's not a question of activating the camera or exploiting the software.

The problem is the cameras allowed people to view the stream without authenticating, which actually might have been by design. Maybe the company thought some users would prefer not having to authenticate, and left the option in for them to choose. If so, it's the users' fault for not using authentication on their security camera.\n\nWebcams don't work like that. At all. To turn your webcam on remotely and watch you, a \"hacker\" would have to basically write a virus that bypasses the strong protections that come with modern operating systems and modern antivirii, which is far from simple, and then find a way to deploy the virus to your computer.\n\nChances are, if you haven't stripped your computer down of all of its defenses, you're completely fine.\n\nThis isn't CSI.

If, as you suggested earlier, it is the actual conscious experience, then no, it isn't making the decision. Under my definition, I am indeed making the decision. Parts of my brain are aware of it, others (such as conscience) only become so a few moments later."}

{"text": "Video: Cyber security students, class of 2012\n\nProfessor Luallen ups the ante with industrial cyber security students, challenges them to understand functionality of industrial devices and networks.\n\n07/19/2012\n\nShare\n\nFlash is required!\n\nA new class of cyber security students reflect on their forays into industrial networking applications.\n\nControl Engineering visited DePaul University College of Computing and Digital Media in Chicago again in June to meet a new class of industrial cyber security students. Professor Matt Luallen has been rethinking his strategy for the class, pushing his students to get a better handle on how a device like a PLC fits into an application rather than simply trying to figure out ways to break in.\n\nStudents in the class had a group project as well as an individual assignment, and had to present a report on each. There were four groups, each with four students, that had to create a system to perform one of the following functions: Control a model train, including moving the locomotive and operating turnouts; control a simulated gas pipeline, including running a compressor and maintaining system pressure; design a traffic signal system for an intersection; and control a miniature robotic arm. In all the cases, the students were simply given a PLC along with the necessary support equipment. The assignment asked them to figure out how to make the system perform a prescribed list of functions, including programming the PLC.\n\nThis might not sound like much, but these are students with no industrial background. Starting from scratch figuring out how the I/O works and how to build a program is nothing to sneeze at. Once they got their respective systems working, they then had to figure out how to break them, or how a hacker might plot an attack. Some of the solutions the students create are better than others. For example, all of the projects required integration of a manual e-stop. The pipeline group included that function as part of the PLC program, which meant that if a hacker could break the program, the e-stop no longer worked. One of the topics of discussion was why that wasn't a good idea and how that kind of problem could be avoided.\n\nThe students speak for themselves in the video. You'll hear things that they learned in their individual and group projects. Keep in mind that these are resourceful IT students, not people with industrial experience. It's amazing what they can find out about the kind of equipment in your plant"}

The ring, which was busted last November, had been using the servers to redirect millions of Internet users to rogue websites when they tried to visit normal websites. The FBI took over the servers and cleaned them up, but it doesn't particularly want to be in the business of running DNS servers permanently \u2014 so it's shutting them down Monday.\n\nThe date has been dubbed \"Internet Doomsday\" because everyone still using those servers will lose pretty much all access to the web once the FBI takes them down.

{"text": "ZeuS Trojan Botnet Learns a New Trick: Peer-to-Peer\n\nIn what seems to be the next evolution of malware, the Zeusbot/SpyEye Trojan network has been discovered in the wild that doesn't rely on a centralized command-and-control server\u2014instead, the new variants use a peer-to-peer architecture to get the job done.\n\nAccording an article in The Register, security researchers at Symantec have dissected the new code and discovered that the virus makers have sought to jettison the weakness of requiring a home-base for something that BitTorrent users have known for a long time: being decentralized makes it harder to shut you down.\n\nNow cybercrooks have built functionality into Zeusbot/SpyEye that allows instructions to be distributed via P2P techniques as well, eliminating the need for C&C servers. Compromised systems are now capable of downloading commands, configuration files, and executables from other bots, a write-up by security researchers at Symantec explains.\n\n\"Previously, every compromised computer was a peer in the botnet and the configuration file (containing the URL of the C&C server) was distributed from one peer to another,\" Symantec researcher Andrea Lelli explains. \"This way, even if the C&C server was taken down, the botnet was still able to contact other peers to receive configuration files with URLs of new C&C servers.\"\n\nResearchers also discovered that instead of forming long-lastingTCPdirect connections, the malware is working harder on flying under the radar by sending out packets that it doesn't expect replies to with UDP. This makes the malware just a little bit harder to track and allows it to piggyback signals that pretend to be part of regular operations (such as DNS and other quick-burst communication.)\n\nThe peer-to-peer aspect appears to be exchanged via HTTP using an open source minimal Web server called nGinx. This allows the bots to discover and contact each other as if they were Web servers. Once again, meaning that the communication between the bots could be disguised better as usual computer use (since most users use the Web a great deal.)\n\nAlso, the nGinx server permits each bot in the entire net to handle and respond to HTTP requests and as a result any given bot in botnet can handle command-and-control messages. Web servers in botnets aren't very new; in fact, the Waledac/Kelihos botnet uses Web servers to communicate\u2014the same botnet obliterated by a Microsoft operation in late 2011.\n\nLittle information was released by the write-up about how the command-and-control has been decentralized. It would make sense that the virus maker would key the botnet to their commands in some fashion and would designate a single bot for a short time as command-and-control in order to tell the botnet what to do and could turn that functionality on and off via contact.\n\nZeuS and such are often used as Trojans to spy on users as they use their computers and collect sensitive information such as passwords, banking information, etc. and now that information can be carefully doled out through the botnet between different bots. This both makes it harder to kill the entire botnet\u2014whereas before only one C&C server needed to go down\u2014and it makes it harder to find the criminals using the net because they could connect to any given bot in the network and have them siphon their ill-gotten goods to any particular node for exfiltration.\n\nAs a botnet source that used to sell time for thousands of dollars a whack, ZeuS probably just made itself even more valuable.\n\nAlthough, as previously noted, the code for this net has been leaked publicly, which means anyone with the know-how can tinker with it and set a new one up"}

{"text": "How Hackers Attack\n\nDespite the many products and services on the market designed to protect computers from getting hacked, many businesses\u2014small firms in particular\u2014are still suffering at the hands of cyberthieves.\n\nJust ask Lloyd Keilson, the co-founder of Lifestyle Forms & Displays Inc., a mannequin maker and importer that had $1.2 million wiped out of its bank account in just hours through online transactions in May. His story was described in a Wall Street Journal article Thursday.\n\nRelated Article\n\nMr. Keilson isn't entirely sure, though experts in Web security say that cyberthieves likely covertly installed a virus on one of his company's computers.\n\nThe firm's computers run on the Windows 7 operating system and the company uses an internal firewall to connect to the Internet, Mr. Keilson says.\n\nIts computers are Dell Inc. machines that his staff installed with antivirus software called Neatsuite purchased from Trend Micro Inc., a Japan-based security company, he adds.\n\nMichael Sweeny, a spokesman for Trend Micro, says Neatsuite is an older product.\n\nExperts say that it's possible that after one of Mr. Keilson's staffers tried to log onto the website for the company's bank, a virus may have redirected him or her to a fake page that looked identical to the bank's site.\n\nIf the employee typed in a username and temporary password provided by a secure-ID token, the virus might have sent that information to a thief who could have quickly logged into the bank's real website to make money transfers before the temporary password changed.\n\nPasswords created by tokens tend to be valid for about two minutes, say Web security experts. It's important to note that Mr. Keilson isn't able to confirm that this is what happened.\n\nWhy did the company's bank allow money to be transferred out of its account?\n\nIn this kind of scenario, banks commonly aren't aware anything is wrong because they're seeing someone log onto their websites with the correct information. Cyberthieves often transfer stolen funds to account created with stolen identification to avoid detection.\n\nHow do viruses get onto computers that have anti-virus software?\n\nComputer users often download viruses onto the machines inadvertently by clicking on a website, advertisement or email attachment embedded with malicious content. Mr. Keilson says he isn't aware that any of his employees did this.\n\nThough anti-virus software is designed to recognize such material, it doesn't always work because hackers are regularly refining their tricks.\n\n\"You have to continually evolve your technology approach to security to stay up with the latest threats,\" says Lawrence Pingree, an analyst at technology research firm Gartner Inc. \"What worked yesterday might not work today.\"\n\nDoes it matter what Web browser or operating system you use?\n\nSome Web browsers and operating systems have a reputation for doing a better job of preventing viruses from infecting computers than others.\n\n\"We see far more infections on Windows than we do Macs, Unix and Linux,\" says Wade Baker, author of the Verizon 2012 Data Breach Investigations Report, a study based on cybercrime investigations conducted by Verizon's team, which is comprised of data-breach reports from Verizon and various law-enforcement groups around the globe, including the U.S. Secret Service and the Australian Federal Police.\n\nMr. Baker says there's long been a debate over which Web browsers are the safest but that all browsers \u2013 including popular ones like Safari and Firefox -- are susceptible to viruses when users recklessly click on Web ads, email attachments and other online content.\n\nSo what can I do to keep hackers at bay?\n\nBe cautious when downloading any material from the Web and opening email attachments. If you don't trust the source, don't open it.\n\nAlso, contact your bank and find out what Web-related protections it offers businesses and what it's liable for in the event of a cyberattack on your firm's account. Set up limits on how much money can be transferred from your account in a day and require verbal authorization from an approved employee to make transactions above a certain"}

Princeton researchers (.pdf) drew widespread attention when they said that freezing a computer's memory chips preserves data that normally disappear when a computer is turned off. Someone who chills the chips can retrieve data after the PC has been powered down.\n\nRoger Kay of Endpoint Technologies makes the process sound at least far-fetched and maybe laughable in the real world. Someone would have to have access to a notebook when it's running or sleeping (not turned off) and then spray liquid nitrogen to freeze the chips. Then the thief would have to abscond with the memory sticks to another machine to sniff out the precious data\u2014and return to the target machine to apply the revealed password. Only then could the bad guy open an encrypted hard drive.\n\nWhile possible, the attack remains much less likely than much more mundane methods of cracking a computer, Kay says. \"Anyone who knows the security biz knows that there is no such thing as absolute security, only reasonable security for a given situation,\" he adds. \"Commercial-grade security is good enough for most businesses, but spooks need a higher grade.\"\n\nSo maybe James Bond has to worry about keeping his laptop out of the freezer.

The PC virus problem is 25 years old now. So half a year ago, I decided to go to Pakistan myself. So let's see, here's a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan. This is from the city of Lahore, which is around 300 km south from Abbottabad where Bin Laden was caught. Here's a typical street view. And here's the street or road leading to this building, which is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal town. And I knocked on the door. (Laughter) You want to guess who opened the door? Basit and Amjad; they are still there. (Laughter) (Applause) So here standing up is Basit. Sitting down is his brother Amjad. These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus. Now of course, we had a very interesting discussion. I asked them why. I asked them how they feel about what they started. And I got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both Basit and Amjad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years. So there is some sort of justice in the world after all.\n\nNow, the viruses that we used to see in the 1980s and 1990s obviously are not a problem any more. So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like. What I'm writing here is a system that enables me to run age-old programs on a modern computer. So let me just mount some drives. Go over there. What we have here is a list of old viruses. So let me just run some viruses on my computer.\n\nFor example, let's go with the Centipede virus first. And you can see at the top of the screen, there's a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one. You know that you're infected, because it actually shows up. Here's another one. This is the virus called Crash invented in Russia in 1992. Let me show you one which actually makes some sound. (Siren noise) And the last example, guess what the Walker virus does. Yes, there's a guy walking across your screen once you get infected. So it used to be fairly easy to know that you're infected by a virus, when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers.\n\nToday, they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers. Today, viruses are a global problem. What we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs, where we track virus infections worldwide. So we can actually see in real time that we've just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere. In fact, if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web, we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses, how many new examples of malware we find every single day. Here's the latest virus we've found in a file called Server.exe. And we found it right over here three seconds ago - the previous one, six seconds ago. And if we just scroll around, it's just massive. We find tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands. And that's the last 20 minutes of malware every single day.\n\nSo where are all these coming from then? Well today, it's the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses. It's gangs like - let's go to GangstaBucks.com. This is a website operating in Moscow where these guys are buying infected computers. So if you are a virus writer and you're capable of infecting Windows computers, but you don't know what to do with them, you can sell those infected computers - somebody else's computers - to these guys. And they'll actually pay you money for those computers. So how do these guys then monetize those infected computers? Well there's multiple different ways, such as banking trojans, which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking, or key loggers. Key loggers silently sit on your computer, hidden from view, and they record everything you type. So you're sitting on your computer and you're doing Google searches. Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals. Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals. Same thing with every single password and so on.\n\nBut the thing that they're actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store. Because when you do purchases in online stores, you will be typing in your name, the delivery address, your credit card number and the credit card security codes. And here's an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago. That's the credit card number, that's the expiration date, that's the security code, and that's the name of the owner of the card. Once you gain access to other people's credit card information, you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information. And that, obviously, is a problem. We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime.\n\nOne example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing their operations. We go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL and search for wanted persons. We find guys like Bjorn Sundin, originally from Sweden, and his partner in crime, also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages, Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain, a U.S. citizen. These guys were running an operation called I.M.U., a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions. They are both right now on the run. Nobody knows where they are. U.S. officials, just a couple of weeks ago, froze a Swiss bank account belonging to Mr. Jain, and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it.\n\nSo the amount of money online crime generates is significant. And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks. We know that online criminals are hiring programmers, hiring testing people, testing their code, having back-end systems with SQL databases. And they can afford to watch how we work - like how security people work - and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build. They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage. I mean, the Internet is international. That's why we call it the Internet.\n\nAnd if you just go and take a look at what's happening in the online world, here's a video built by Clarified Networks, which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world. This operation, believed to be originally from Estonia, moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is trying to shut down. So you just can't shut these guys down. They will switch from one country to another, from one jurisdiction to another - moving around the world, using the fact that we don't have the capability to globally police operations like this. So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world. The criminals who weren't capable of reaching us before can reach us.\n\nSo how do you actually go around finding online criminals? How do you actually track them down. Let me give you an example. What we have here is one exploit file. Here, I'm looking at the Hex dump of an image file, which contains an exploit. And that basically means, if you're trying to view this image file on your Windows computer, it actually takes over your computer and runs code.\n\nNow, if you'll take a look at this image file - well there's the image header, and there the actual code of the attack starts. And that code has been encrypted, so let's decrypt it. It has been encrypted with XOR function 97. You just have to believe me, it is, it is. And we can go here and actually start decrypting it. Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted. And I know, it doesn't really look much different from the original. But just keep staring at it. You'll actually see that down here you can see a Web address: Unionc.com/d/ioo.exe. And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program. And that's a backdoor which will take over your computer.\n\nBut even more interestingly, if we continue decrypting, we'll find this mysterious string which says O600KO78RUS. That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature. It's not used for anything. And I was looking at that, trying to figure out what it means. So obviously I Googled for it. I got zero hits; wasn't there. So I spoke with the guys at the lab. And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs, and one of them mentioned, well, it ends in rus like Russia. And 78 is the city code for the city of St. Petersburg. For example, you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that. So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg. And through a long road, we eventually found this one particular website.\n\nHere's this Russian guy who's been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website, and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal. And on this blog, he blogs about his life, about his life in St. Petersburg - he's in his early 20s - about his cat, about his girlfriend. And he drives a very nice car. In fact, this guy drives a Mercedes-Benz S600 V12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower. Now that's a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St. Petersburg.\n\nHow do I know about this car? Because he blogged about the car. He actually had a car accident. In downtown St. Petersburg, he actually crashed his car into another car. And he put blogged images about the car accident - that's his Mercedes - right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into. And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara ends in 78RUS. And if you actually take a look at the scene picture, you can see that the plate of the Mercedes is O600KO78RUS. Now I'm not a lawyer, but if I would be, this is where I would say, \"I rest my case.\"\n\n(Laughter)\n\nSo what happens when online criminals are caught? Well in most cases it never gets this far. The vast majority of the online crime cases, we don't even know which continent the attacks are coming from. And even if we are able to find online criminals, quite often there is no outcome. The local police don't act, or if they do, there's not enough evidence, or for some reason we can't take them down. I wish it would be easier; unfortunately it isn't.\n\nBut things are also changing at a very rapid pace. You've all heard about things like Stuxnet. So if you look at what Stuxnet did is that it infected these. That's a Siemens S7 400plc, programmable logic computer. And this is what runs our infrastructure. This is what runs everything around us. PLC's, these small boxes which have no display, no keyboard, which are programmed, are put in place, and they do their job. For example, the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these. And when Stuxnet infects one of these, that's a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about. Because everything around us is being run by these. I mean, we have critical infrastructure. You go to any factory, any power plant, any chemical plant, any food processing plant, you look around - everything is being run by computers.\n\nEverything is being run by computers. Everything is reliant on these computers working. We have become very reliant on Internet, on basic things like electricity, obviously, on computers working. And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us. We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail.\n\n(Laughter)\n\n(Applause)\n\nSo preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren't there. It's actually very basic stuff - thinking about continuity, thinking about backups, thinking about the things that actually matter.\n\nNow I told you - (Laughter) I love the Internet. I do. Think about all the services we have online. Think about if they are taken away from you, if one day you don't actually have them for some reason or another. I see beauty in the future of the Internet, but I'm worried that we might not see that. I'm worried that we are running into problems because of online crime. Online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us.\n\n(Laughter)\n\nI've spent my life defending the net. And I do feel that if we don't fight online crime, we are running a risk of losing it all. We have to do this globally, and we have to do it right now. What we need is more global, international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs - these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks. That's much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls. What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks. And even more importantly, we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime, but haven't yet done it. We have to find the people with the skills, but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good."}

{"text": "The first problem is the \"80%.\" 80% of what? What is the sample set? Are the victims in the retail and hospitality sectors or the telecommunications and aerospace industries? Speaking in general terms, different sorts of organizations are at different levels of maturity, capability, and resourcefulness when it comes to digital security.\n\nIn the spirit of salvaging this poorly worded statistic, let's assume (rightly or wrongly) that the sample set involves the retail and hospitality sectors.\n\nThe second problem is the term \"breach.\" What is a breach? Is it the compromise of a single computer? (What's compromise? Does it mean executing malicious code, or login via stolen credentials, or...?) What is the duration of the incident? There are dozens of questions that could be asked here.\n\nTo salvage this part, let's assume \"breach\" means \"an incident involving execution of unauthorized code by an unauthorized intruder\" on a single computer.\n\nThe third problem is the word \"preventable.\" \"Prevention\" as a concept is becoming less useful by the second. Think about how an intruder might try to execute malicious code against a victim. Imagine a fully automated attack that happens when a victim visits a malicious Web site. An exploit kit could throw a dozen or more exploits against a browser and applications until one works. Are they all non-zero day, or are some zero day? Again, many questions beckon.\n\nTo salvage the end of the original statement, let's translate \"preventable\" into \"exploitation of a vulnerability for which a patch had been publicly available for at least seven days.\"\n\nOur new statement now reads something like \"In the retail and hospitality sectors, 80% of the incidents where an unauthorized intruder successfully executed unauthorized code on a single computer exploited a vulnerability for which a patch had been publicly available for at least seven days.\"\n\nIsn't that catchy! That's why we heard shortcuts like the original statement, which are basically worthless. Unfortunately, they end up driving listeners into poor conceptual and operational models.\n\nThe wordy but accurate statement says nothing about preventability, which is key. The reason is that a determined adversary, when confronted by a fully patched target, may decide to escalate to using a zero-day or other technique for which patches are irrelevant.\n\n4 comments:\n\nGreat post! In a lot of ways, Twitter (and other abbreviated communications mediums, to include the option for simply clicking \"Like\" or \"+1\") have really done a lot to decimate the already poor communications skills of many.\n\nOne thing I keep in mind when I hear folks quoting any of the annual reports is that each of the organizations providing those reports has a different customer base, different focus, etc. Readers have to keep in mind which statistics are based on a minimalist approach to response, and which may be based on a more in-depth approach to intelligence gathering.\n\nFinally, what is \"preventable\"? I've worked engagements where a patch would've \"prevented\" the incident that we uncovered, although we have no idea if the attacker would've walked away if the attempt had failed, or if they would have tried something else.\n\nIn trying to encapsulate something like the final statement in your post into 140 characters for easier transmission, or to be \"the first\" to get it out, we're not distilling the issue down to it's essential components, as much as we're just throwing away accuracy.\n\nI love this line of thought you've brought up. The soundbytes, catch phrases, tweets, headlines, buzzwords, and all things taken without the proper context are slowing and in some cases reversing progress in Def Sec.\n\nIf you look at a breach in hindsight and assume that the actual attack would not continue or escalate if the circumstances changed (i.e. if what was successful, was not), then I would bet that closer to 100% of breaches are \"preventable\". What is missing from this quote is \"prevented...using basic security controls\". That context really changes the point of the statistic."}

{"text": "It sounds like the subject of a Hollywood thriller or paperback science fiction novel. Hackers surrounded by glowing LCD screens watching as money drains from your bank account into theirs. Cybercrime: a new crime for the digital age. Or is it? Is cybercrime something new or is it just a new spin on the familiar old crimes?\n\nCybercrime has no established definition. On the broadest interpretation it could include any criminal act committed via computer or the Internet. But what distinguishes theft from your online banking account and theft by someone impersonating you in the branch or forging your signature on a cheque? For many crimes involving computers, the essential elements are the same as the traditional crime and recognizing a distinction when a computer is used does not make sense. A computer does not aggravate a theft in the way that a weapon does (by increasing the likelihood of bodily harm) it is merely a method of committing the same crime. For \"cybercrime\" to be coherent as a category, it must be in some way distinct from recognized traditional crimes: cybercrimes are those criminal acts that are unique to computers.\n\nBut some would argue that there are no crimes that meet this definition. In a 2001 article and a recent follow-up, Professor Susan Brenner argues that all known cybercrimes can be encompassed, with a little effort, by existing crimes. Consider a few candidates for pure cybercrimes: hacking, denial of service, and distributing malicious software. These are criminal acts which take place in \"cyberspace\". But each of them has a real-world analogue: hacking can be viewed as a form of digital trespass; denial of service is vandalism or common nuisance; malicious software is mischief or theft of processing power. Thus, even these acts are like the example of theft in the previous paragraph: merely traditional crimes carried out through the medium of cyberspace. The solution is not to invent new crimes but to revise existing ones to accommodate changing situations. Brenner does, however, suggest the possibility of true cybercrimes (acts only possible in cyberspace) emerging in the future. There is even a precedent for criminalizing acts that take place in another realm\u2014witchcraft. It was once believed that witches manipulated spirits in another realm to harm their victims much like cyber-criminals act in cyberspace to harm their victims. But for the present time Brenner concludes that traditional crimes are enough.\n\nOne troubling aspect of Brenner's argument is its reliance on the concept of \"cyberspace\". Cyberspace allows you to easily draw analogies between real and virtual actions\u2014for example, associating hacking with trespassing. But cyberspace is just a metaphor. It is useful for explaining the relationships between computers, but it leads to inaccuracy in describing the actions of people online. It is certainly possible to redefine the legal understanding of location to match this metaphor, but just because something is possible doesn't make it right. Without relying on cyberspace, the ability to remotely access and manipulate another person's property is actually something new but still easily described: the Criminal Code calls it unauthorized use of a computer. The provision does not criminalize \"digital trespass\" but rather unauthorized access, which is an accurate non-metaphorical description of the act we wish to proscribe. This is a cybercrime. It is not a pure cybercrime in the sense that Brenner is looking for, but it is a distinct criminal act in which computers play an essential role.\n\nThe Criminal Code provision also highlights another problem with extending real-world crimes to encompass virtual counterparts. Unauthorized use of a computer is classified in the Code alongside theft rather than breaking and entering. This demonstrates that there may be multiple candidate offenses for a single cybercrime. What can be clearly defined as a separate crime becomes muddled if we try to force it into existing categories. If only for practical reasons, it makes sense to treat it differently.\n\nThe global reach of the Internet and the power and flexibility of computers allow us to interact in brand new ways. Sometimes this merely provides a new method to commit an old crime. But there are some crimes\u2014cybercrimes\u2014in which the role of the computer renders them practically distinct."}
{"text": "For example, in May a mannequin company in Brooklyn, N.Y., lost $1.2 million in just a few hours. Verizon (VZ) analyzed hundreds of data breaches in 2010 and found that 63 percent of them happened at companies that had 100 or fewer employees.\n\nThis isn't entirely new. I spoke with Kevin Haley, a director with Symantec Security Response, earlier this year. He cited company research showing that only 13 percent of 1,900 SMBs the security software maker had surveyed felt completely protected against computer threats. Related Symantec studies also have showed that 40 percent of targeted online attacks had gone after smaller businesses.\n\nCriminal hackers, like bank robber Willie Sutton, not only want to go where the money is -- they also want to be sure they can get at it. Small and midsize businesses are perfect prey. Not only do they tend to lack the resources to fully secure their computer systems, but they also tend to have significant amounts of money.\n\nIf things weren't tough enough for SMBs, they're getting worse. According to a report from computer security company McAfee, a unit of Intel (INTC), and online banking security vendor Guardian Analytics, hackers are using fraud automation to increase the power and speed of their attacks. Tools also abound on hacker sites to help people illegally tap into company information networks.\n\nThe solution? There may not be one, and for the same reasons that large companies remain vulnerable. Computer security is expensive. To many executives, it's a black hole for spending. Even big companies with significant IT staffs have difficulty keeping up with all the changes, updates, modifications, and upgrades necessary to keep up with the world of criminal hacking.\n\nSo the challenge for smaller companies is daunting. The best bet may be for SMBs to shore up their systems just enough to encourage criminals look for easier pickings. It's like the old story about being with a group of people attacked by a bear: You don't have to run faster than the bear, just faster than most of the other people you're with outlook for small businesses in regards to IT security certainly is daunting. Small business owners tend to shy away from investing in proven IT solutions for one of two reasons: 1) they can't afford enterprise-level solutions; and 2) they don't understand the depth and risks of cyber crime threats. I think you make a great point in acknowledging that small businesses, especially, operate under the \"it can't happen to me\" mentality. In-house personnel wear so many different hats that adequate attention to the security of their network infrastructure is often overlooked. It will be increasingly important for security vendors to create the need and inform SMBs--to not overlook the little guys. A cost-effective solution and popular trend appears to be outsourcing to MSPs. Fortunately, some companies out there, like <a href=\" Network Solutions</a>, are focused on specifically on addressing the IT needs of small"}

{"text": "For almost two decades, military analysts have worried that foreign powers might use computer networks to inflict harm on the United States. Politicians quickly translated those concerns into warnings of a \"cyber Pearl Harbor.\" Almost as promptly, legal analysts began dutifully charting the limits on how we would fight the cyber war that might follow such an attack\u2014if we chose to conform to the UN Charter and various post-war Geneva Conventions\n\nBut cyber attacks are already a persistent and disturbing aspect of international relations in the twenty-first century. At moments of particular tension between hostile states, computer network attacks have been launched against national infrastructure, causing large-scale disruptions. It happened in Estonia in 2007, Georgia in 2008, and South Korea in 2011. Meanwhile, large and important American companies, including Google, Lockheed Martin, and RSA, have fallen victim to highly sophisticated, multi-stage attacks.

To which Jack Welch, head honcho of US car maker of GM, later retorted that if Microsoft made cars they'd crash twice a day and the airbag would ask if you're sure before deploying.\n\nThat was then. Today, cars and computing are on a convergence - you could say collision - course. Some cars have up to 150 or more computer chips on board. Renault, to take just one recent example, has chosen Google's Android OS to power its in-car kit.\n\nThe implication, then, is that cars will become increasingly reliant on computing for everything they do. And our experience of computing in just about every other walk of life is that it's far from 100 per cent reliable. How soon before an operating system crash turns into one that hurts more than just a few files?\n\n2. Malware takes on a whole new meaning\n\nIf cars could soon be crashing due to sheer computational complexity and human error in design and engineering, what about the scope for good old malice?\n\nWith cars becoming increasingly computerised, internet-connected and also sharing software platforms with more commonly used computing devices, can it really be long before viruses and other malware begins to target cars? Also, more and more cars are internet-connected, so an infection could happen at almost any moment.\n\nIf you start to think laterally, all sorts of sinister opportunities arise, and not just the apocalyptic, life-threatening sort. Imagine a future where all tyres have RFIDs. Could a tyre company send out a virus that detected tyres from rival companies and then hack the target vehicle to encourage faster tyre wear? If you can imagine it, maybe it's possible.\n\nWe've spoken to engineers at several car makers and they assure us that the way systems are compartmentalised and firewalled means it simply isn't possible for a virus to migrate from, say, the entertainment kit to a more safety-critical system like cruise control or lane departure correction.\n\nBut isn't that what they always say \u2013 that it could never happen \u2013 just before Armageddon strikes?

They simply hack and prime the car from a remote location and nip over when it's ready for pinching. WIth self-driving cars on the way, it's not inconceivable that thieves might find a way of driving your car away without even being present at the scene.\n\nAlready, cars from several brands can be unlocked remotely via a cellular connection. Seriously, people, it's going to happen.\n\n4. Your bunny-boiling ex will track you via GPS\n\nIf that sounds like a bad movie plot, try this for size. A self-contained GPS device that attaches to cars in an instant courtesy of a magnetic pad can be had for as little as \u00a3100.\n\nThe Back2you personal GPS tracker is a perfect example. Smaller than a pack of cards, it has both GPS and a GSM/GPRS cellular adapter. Simply slap it onto a target vehicle \u2013 any steel bodied car is a suitable target \u2013 and then all that's required is a call to the device's mobile number.\n\nIt will then reply with a text revealing its current location and speed. It will even drop its dastardly master a text when it's running low on battery charge.\n\n5. Black boxes will become compulsory\n\nBlack boxes or devices that record various operational parameters and activities are generally seen as a good thing. They're commonly used in commercial aviation and provide crucial insight into the cause for any crash.\n\nThe same could very soon apply to cars. The technology is relatively simple. Indeed, some insurers are already experimenting with the idea with a view to setting premiums based on driving style. It's not a big step from there to imagine black boxes becoming compulsory.\n\nOn the face of it, the safety argument seems pretty compelling. On the other hand, do you really want electronic eyes watching your every move? It's the classic personal freedom versus broader public safety argument and we've an inkling the latter will eventually win out.\n\n6. Cyberjams and worse\n\nStories involving dunderheaded drivers who sheepishly follow satnav directions hundreds miles off course, into rivers, over cliffs and worse are already common place. It's classic one-last-thing local news bulletin material.\n\nBut in a world where cars are increasingly connected and automated, the scope for serious carnage increases. Take, for instance, the d\u00e9b\u00e2cle of Apple's own mapping software introduced with the iPhone 5 and iOS 6. Users reported widespread errors in mapping data.\n\nThen factor in a future where in-car system are increasing powered by smartphones. Already, models from MINI, Vauxhall, Mercedes and others are already available with smartphone-powered nav.\n\nYou're then in a situation where a cloud based mapping error or an OS update could instant render thousands or millions of handsets and in turn cars with incorrect data. That could cause traffic chaos, or worse.\n\nOn the subject of traffic, with in-car nav systems increasingly fed with streaming traffic data, what happens if there's a data glitch or someone hacks the data provider for nefarious reasons? Record breaking traffic jams or, worse, pile ups could ensue. And you could achive that with a single hack, rather than having to target individual cars.\n\n7. Say hello to your new four-wheeled overlords\n\nThis is it, the global catastrophe. The Skynet moment. Self-driving cars, you see, are on their way. They're inevitable and they're coming whether you like it or not.\n\nNow, for the most part, self-driving cars will be a very good thing. They won't be perfect. But then they don't need to be to improve upon the horrific standards of most human drivers and in turn dramatically reduce deaths and serious injuries on our roads.\n\nThey'll also have a dramatic positive benefit on all manner of modern life. For more on that, hop on over to our feature here. But with millions of fully automated cars running around, the scope for cataclysm whether by accident or malicious intent is pretty epic.\n\nTo be fair to cars, this falls into a broader category involving robots and perhaps event artificial intelligence too. But while a murderous robo-vacuum might be little more than amusing, millions of cars hell bent on destruction is another matter altogether. Anyway, keep thinking happy thoughts and maybe it will never happen. Either that or think twice when you vote in that robotic-car referendum 15 years from now"}

In most cases, I'd say home systems are fairly safe, if only because each computer is a needle in a giant haystack called the Internet. While the profile of the criminal hacker (for whom I prefer the term \"cracker\") suggests a young male who is both patient and obsessive, most of these individuals would rather stalk the big fish--university, government, and commercial systems--than your computer.\n\nI don't mean to say home PCs aren't targets. They are. Crackers keep track of IP addresses assigned by Internet service providers to dial-up, DSL, and cable-modem users. Some regularly scan those addresses, looking for PCs that are connected to the Net and that have known security vulnerabilities.\n\nThese lists of vulnerable computers are often traded or sold over the Internet, and help virus writers plant their viruses quickly. That's why it's important to use firewall software and keep all your applications updated with the latest patches"}
{"text": "Now, since security researchers already have copies of the software this isn't going stop anyone further deconstructing and analysing it. The only possible reason for doing this is to avoid discovery of infection somewhere particularly sensitive. I wonder who the lucky person or nation-state is?\n\nHeckler und Koch GmbH and Rheinmetal AG have licensed factories in Iran. Iranian factories are cranking out G3s, MP5s, MG3s, all legally and for export. Not to mention the various Chinese/Russian small arms they manufacture (couldn't find out whether those were licensed or not).\n\nI think that, before they ban software companies from doing business in Iran, they should maybe think about banning the firearm companies. Just a thought.\n\nArstechnica.com has more stories on it and how it worked through collision detection and much more. I am amazed yet worried as I am sure malware mobfia folks are using the source code with real NATO grade malware complete with forging certificates, turning zombies into proxy servers, and using the Md5 collision detection done by professional mathematicians.\n\nWorse Ubuntu and other operating systems can be hit by this as they use the same algorithms for the certificates. This piece of malware was just done through conventional 0 day exploits but rather a very sophisticated means of forging certificates and might have done the cyberworld much more harm.\n\nThere are a limited number of possible suspects. First off, not many parties have the means to create this. The consensus is that Flame is one of the largest and most advanced pieces of malware ever created- it's 20 megabytes of code- which strongly implies that it was developed by a nation with an advanced cyber-warfare capability. That list is pretty short, and would include countries like the United States, China, Russia, Israel, and North Korea.\n\nSecond, let's look at the targets. The Flame malware hit Iran, Israel/Palestine, Sudan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, in that order. Roughly half of the infections are in Iran. So whoever created Flame is worried about the Middle East, but really, really worried about Iran. More worried about Iran than any other country. The Iran fixation suggests two possible suspects- Israel and the United States.\n\nThe focus on Iran is consistent with Flame coming from the U.S., but Flame also targets several U.S. allies, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The other thing is, Flame doesn't target anything outside of the Middle East. If it was produced by the U.S., you'd expect Flame to be found in other countries- North Korea and Pakistan, for example- where the U.S. has security interests. But whoever created Flame doesn't really care what happens in North Korea or Pakistan. Whoever created Flame is primarily concerned with countries that are either enemies or potential enemies of Israel- Iran, Palestine, Syria, Lebanon. That strongly suggests Israel as the culprit.\n\n1. Because iran has money. 2. Because there are 70 million people in Iran, the vast majority of whom are not engaged in trying to kill americans or europeans. 3. Because lots of people, especially in europe, believe that US sanctions are counter productive, and so don't have such sanctions.\n\nAlso keep in mind there are lots of things that aren't barred from export to Iran, and lots of things are sold legally to other countries and then illegally re-exported to Iran. Most notably to qatar and bahrain, but other places as well.\n\nHave you bothered to read other articles on Flame? It's ability to record and gather information and transmit it back to C&C servers means that it's an excellent tool not just to do large government espionage, but also to listen in on individual conversations. As a tool in a fight against domestic terrorism, and counter espionage. I imagine it would be very effective, it's like a wiretap, without having to ask a judge for a wiretap. Infections in Israel/Palestine aren't broken down by Israel vs Palestine anywhere I've seen, which may mean that the vast majority are in Palestine. If that's true, it is another pretty large piece of evidence in favor of Israeli authorship.\n\nWhy would you think that they wouldn't spy on their own people, especially with their relationship to the Palestinians? If anything, the fact that it's not showing up in the US would tend to prove the point that it was Israel. The US clearly [slashdot.org] isn't afraid to spy on it's own people.\n\n... it is way too late to get rid of the evidence. I mean, really? Every malware researcher ever must now have a copy of the code.\n\nThe code, sure. But there is still value in hiding what data has been stolen. Destroying the evidence rather than deleting it in a recoverable way means that if a target realises they were infected they will have to assume that everything was taken. That's much worse than knowing exactly what was taken. Consider online store that keeps credit card details for a million users - the difference between knowing that 20 credit card details were leaked and merely knowing that you were infected could well be the difference between surviving as a company or not.\n\nRight but the assumption has always been they don't vandalize their own bots because the owners would then discover they are part of a bot net. That does not hold if the bot net owner is already dismantling the network, I don't know what motivation they have to not nuke the hosts entirely to ensure there don't leave any finger prints.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is they may be concerned that if a large percentage of the public has their machines trashed all at the same time Joe Sixpack of Pakistani mangoes might wake up and start taking computer security seriously. Which could make future bot nets harder to construct."}

{"text": "Experts see nation-state behind sophisticated computer virus attack\n\nByIAN ALLEN| intelNews.org |\nComputer forensics specialists are split as to the purpose and initial target of a sophisticated computer virus that infected computers used in the Iranian government's nuclear energy program. The virus, named Stuxnet, was discovered in Iran in June by a Belarusian computer security firm doing business in the Islamic Republic. It has since infected at least 100,000 computer systems in countries such as Brazil, India, Russia and the United States. But the primary target of the virus appears to have been the Iranian nuclear energy program, specifically computers located at the Islamic Republic's nuclear reactor facility in Bushehr and the uranium enrichment plant in Natanz. Several commentators, including Wired magazine, dispute the existence of any evidence pointing to a clear target inside Iran. But Israeli media maintain that computers at Natanz were the primary target of Stuxnet, and that subsequent infections at computer labs at Bushehr were in fact an unintended side effect. Putting aside differences regarding the primary target of the virus, most experts agree that the complexity and sophistication of Stuxnet's code point to the sort of programming resources that would normally be available only to \"a well-resourced nation-state\". Israel's Ha'aretz daily identifies Unit 8200 of the Israeli Military Intelligence, or the Mossad, as chief suspects behind Stuxnet. The latter appears specifically designed to sabotage sensitive hardware components found specifically in centrifuges. In the summer of 2009, the Reuters news agency revealed the existence of a covert Israeli cyberwarfare scheme directed against the Iranian nuclear energy program"}

With the rise of smart phones, however, how will this effect the security of this transaction? Smart phones are, in essence, computers (even more so than phones in the past). Does this leave them at risk for malware, much like with traditional computers? Would it be possible for a piece of malware to sit on a smart phone and wait for a message from a service (such as a message with an authentication code)? Would it be possible for the malware to redirect such a message, thus allowing the hacker to not only have a password (gotten from another attack), but also receive the authentication code when he tries to log in? If this is possible, it could pose a serious threat to this style of authentication.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nI've been thinking about it for a long time, ever since people kept asking me why I didn't have a Facebook or other social networking account.

I've heard the excuse of being able to meet up with old friends, and various other things, but I know a lot of people that this isn't the case. So, what exactly is the appeal?\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nOne topic we have discussed was the idea of cyber stalking with things like Facebook. The information is presented on the internet publicly, thus it's public information. Most wouldn't question you for looking up a friend from grade school, seeing what they're up to, etc. But would someone question your motives if you decided to check on a person for a specific purpose? Is it too much to check on a person you have a crush on, to see their status before deciding to ask them out? Is it wrong to check on a rival in a field (take your pick) to see how they're doing, and to measure your own progress?\n\nMy point here is, when do you cross the line? Where is the point where you stop just looking at public information, and begin stalking? Or is it just variable levels of stalking?\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nSo, I see a lot of people just posting news. Where's all the personal stories?\n\nWell, I've got one (or two, if you want to count them separately). Recently, I've had two social engineering attempts launched against me. Was pretty funny, really. First was a phishing attempt, claiming to be from a company of an online game I play. They said there was an issue with my account and needed to log in to validate my account, and failure to do so would cause my account to be locked or banned. Seemed legit, though the claims as to why I needed to validate my account were kind of sketchy, until I read the link they had. The URL they provided was the same as the one for my game, except an \" L \" (lower case, did upper case for the sake of reading it easier) was replaced by a \" 1 \". Heh, nice try, engineer. Better luck next time.\n\nSecond, the hacker spoofed an e-mail account I knew and said something along the lines of \"This is an thing, it can totally change your life! Leave that boring life of hard work for a life of luxury!\" (Heh, hilarious) The link was to some site I never heard of. But really, that's not what tipped me off. First, the fact that this person who's e-mail it supposedly was doesn't use that e-mail anymore, plus he doesn't talk the way the e-mail spoke. More importantly, however, the e-mail was sent to numerous people, ranging from myself and some family, to his high school teachers, to Youtube's support e-mail address. Hmm\u2026 Can anyone tell me if this is legit or possibly some form of fraud\u2026? Haha."}
{"text": "In an unexpected move for a security company, SecurEnvoy today said that cyber break-ins and advanced malware incidents, such as the recent DDoS attack by LulzSec, should actually be welcomed and their initiators applauded. The company's CTO Andy Kemshall said: \"I firmly believe that the media attention LulzSec's DDoS attack has recently received is deserving. It's thanks to these guys, who're exposing the blase attitudes of government and businesses without any personal financial gain, that will make a difference in the long term to the security being put in place to protect our own personal data!\"\n\n\"I'd suggest that DDoS vulnerability is indeed a security issue. Security is not just concerned with protecting the information in that one box. It is also concerned with protecting the system resources for legitimate use. A denial of service removes resources from legitimate users.\"\n\nThis is all true, however you've overlooked a crucial element: in a well designed large scale DDoS attack, the victim doesn't know the attackers from legitimate customers.\n\n\"If your network gets flooded out by packets, you have a security mechanism failing to filter packets properly.\"\n\nTwo problems:\n1. A filter is useless when the attacker's botnet has more bandwidth than you. Even an OC3 (which was considered large enough for my whole university) is easily saturated by a few hundred broadband users.\n\n2. What kind of filter do you use? If you detect excessive bandwidth on an IP you can block it, but it may or may not be legitimate. Consider a bunch of mobile users being a proxy/nat router, you're filter could inadvertently block all of them.\n\n\"If your software gets crashed into a denial of service condition, you have an exploitable vulnerability in the code that needs to be addressed.\"\n\nWell granted, the software should never crash. In the worse case, a busy server should start returning something like error 500 in http-speak.\n\n\"If your website takes down your webserver due to resource exhaustion through a designed website function, you have site code that needs to be addressed.\"\n\nYou're totally oversimplifying the issue to imply that code is at fault. Assuming you actually have enough bandwidth in the first place (which isn't likely for most small/medium businesses), then there are other local bottlenecks which will require infrastructure upgrades to eliminate. Databases quickly become saturated. Even ordinary web servers can start thrashing if the attackers deliberately request pieces of material which are unlikely to be cached. This causes random disks seeks well in excess of normal load. A typical disk seek is 5ms, if the attacker successfully requests an uncached file each time, then both normal users and attackers will reach a limit of 200 requests/sec.\n\n\"The information systems are a business resource that need to be protected in addition to the information those systems house. Denial of service demonstrates an exploitable flaw in the security of those systems.\"\n\nHopefully I've gotten my point across that being vulnerable to DDoS doesn't imply a security vulnerability. As Soulbender stated already \"Availability != security.\"\n\nI'd gladly discuss any usable ideas you have, but DDoS isn't as easy to solve as you make it out.\n\nIf you get blown off the network by a flood you technology can not at all deal with then fair enough. The issue is not mitigting the risk of denial of service and getting blown off by deciding to ignore it outright; \"DDoS isn't our responsability and even if it was, we'll just get hit with volumes that our physical network medium can't even handle.\"\n\nCompartmentalization - try to keep a denial of service on one system from taking out other systems\n\nIf we have a hode of random addresses cooperating to keep the server busy; throttle them so the server hardware can at least keep up rather than become completely unusable. Block all but known good addresses if your in such a situation the public service is secondary to specific clients/partners who use it. Drop an IPS in front of the box and let it help manage the hit.\n\nI mean, if you've done what you can to mitigate denial of service attacks and your upstream provider is litterally over-run then fair enough. If you simply discount denial of service as \"not a security concern\" then; security fail.\n\n\"I would agree that avaiability does not mean one is secure. I would not agree that availability is not a security concern.\"\n\nLet me put forward the notion that if availability is a security concern, then the internet is not really a suitable medium.\n\nHypothetical a country may have a grid of warhead detecting radars. These radars are considered to be of paramount importance with near-absolute availability. They bring in a team of security experts to eliminate all possible vulnerabilities. They factor in all possibilities, including spies leaking details of the project (no security by obscurity). Now that they've addressed the security issues, can they rely on the internet to provide the necessary availability?\n\nI expect the answer is \"no\".\n\nI realize this skews the discussion a little bit, and that your talking about exploiting code scalability issues, but I think the point still stands; one cannot secure availability on the internet.\n\n\"If your systems are getting hammered by malicious intent, maybe you need an IPS on the line to defend your systems.\"\n\nThe problem with DDoS is that no one has intruded onto the system in the typical sense. The attacker is flooding servers with otherwise innocuous traffic.\n\n\"If your webform is chewing up your server resources, maybe you need some throttling in place.\"\n\nHow do you keep the throttle from affecting normal users?\n\n\"If the denial of service is caused as a misdirection or cover for a breakin that is most definately a security issue.\"\n\nYes but in general the DDoS *is* the damage, not a cover for some other nefarious activity.\n\n\"If we refer to IBM's ten principles of secure software design...\"\n\nYou have me at a disadvantage here, I've never heard of them.\n\n\"If we have a hode of random addresses cooperating to keep the server busy; throttle them so the server hardware can at least keep up rather than become completely unusable.\"\n\nWell, apache tends to respond with error messages when it gets overloaded. Is this what you mean by degrading gracefully? If not, then what do you mean?\n\n\"Block all but known good addresses if your in such a situation the public service is secondary to specific clients/partners who use it.\"\n\nThis will block legitimate users too, but my bigger question is how to put this into practice. Would you envision a process which scans web server logs heuristically for IP addresses and then loads them into iptables? Something more sophisticated? This list could become overwhelmingly large. What if bad IPs make it through the whitelist or the IPs are faked?\n\n\"Drop an IPS in front of the box and let it help manage the hit.\"\n\nTo the extent that it can determine which requests are legitimate, then that's great, but in practice it can be impossible to tell, an IPS has even less information to go by than the application server.\n\n\"I mean, if you've done what you can to mitigate denial of service attacks and your upstream provider is litterally over-run then fair enough. If you simply discount denial of service as 'not a security concern' then; security fail.\"\n\nThat's the opposite of what I'm claiming. It's an \"availability fail\", but the security is still intact.\n\nI guess we're just arguing semantics here, but I'd rather that the media distinguish between actual security failings and denial of service related downtime. Otherwise we'd start to hear about about \"security flaws\" every time a company's servers were overloaded"}

{"text": "Errata Security\n\nWednesday, May 15, 2013\n\nAfter the sucky Star Trek reboot, I assumed the series would get better. It didn't, the second installment in the series is much worse. If you are a fan of the Star Trek canon, do yourself a favor and don't see this movie. Once seen, it cannot be unseen.\n\nThe best analogy for this film is Transformers 3, a terrible movie consisting of one long action sequence with less plot holding it together than a porno. The critics hated that movie, giving it a score of 36% on Rotten Tomatoes. But, like porno, it's the low-brow entertainment that people want, making Transformers 3 the fifth highest grossing movie of all time (over $1-billion).\n\nSimilarly, this new Star Trek likewise is less a movie and more a spectacle. If you like lots of noise, shiny big things crashing into other big things, and men grunting at each other, then you'll like this movie. But, if you want to think, you'll hate it.\n\nStar Trek 2 takes the low-brow concept even further. The unoriginal plot is just pulled bit by bit from the more famous episodes and movies in the Star Trek canon. It's designed to stroke your ego, making you think you are intelligent because you recognize what's going on. And that's the biggest problem: this new movie not only craps all over the Star Trek series as a whole, but over many of your favorite parts in particular.\n\nSaturday, May 11, 2013\n\nGoGo Inflight is running a promotion right now giving you free Internet access on airplanes from your Blackberry phone/pad. Even if you don't have a Blackberry device, you can still get the free service by changing your browser identifier to match a Blackberry (instructions below). Here's the question: is spoofing your browser ID like this in order to get free Internet service illegal under laws like the CFAA (\"Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\")?\n\nThat's an interesting debate, but there is a further twist: GoGo Inflight's promotion violates their own Terms of Service (ToS). According to the ToS, you need a \"user account\" to use the service. However, the Blackberry promotion doesn't give you one, because it triggers off the browser ID. Thus, even if you have a valid Blackberry (and aren't cheating), you are still technically in violation of the Terms of Service.\n\nWhat I'm trying to show here is that nobody reads the Terms of Service \u2013 not even the people who write them. The marketing droids who negotiated the deal with Blackberry clearly had no idea that the promotion violates their own ToS.\n\nThat's why Internet activists are up in arms about the anti-hacking law known as the CFAA. It's so vague that it's impossible to tell the line between legal or illegal. Even lawyers can't tell if you if cheating on the browser ID is legal/illegal. Prosecutors often try to use the ToS as a guide, but as this example demonstrates, companies don't even mean what their ToS says.\n\nEven though I paid the $12.99 for GoGo Inflight service (with a user-account), I also flushed the cookies and change the MAC address in order to test getting the free service. (Actually, I just rebooted -- my machine automatically flushes cookies and resets the MAC on reboot). I used a Chrome addon called \"User-Agent Switcher\" to change the browser identifier to:\n\nGoGo Inflight sees the \"(BB10; Z10)\" portion and assumes I'm using a Blackberry Z10 device and offered me the free service instead of paid service. The sequence of screens activating this are shown below:\n\nFrom this point on, I had free Internet access from my MacBook Air. I didn't use it, but switched back to the account that I'd paid for. But, what you are supposed to see in these screenshots is that even with a real Blackberry device, no user account is created. This means all Blackberry users are technically in violation of the ToS.\n\nYou can go read the Terms of Service yourself and find some reading that makes sense, thus refuting this blogpost. I've spent some time at it, and as far as I can tell, GoGo Inflight does not mean what its own ToS says.\n\nTuesday, April 23, 2013\n\nAccording to all press outlets, the stock market \"plunged\" today due to @AP getting hacked and reporting explosions at the White House. In fact, stock prices didn't change much at all. Below I've graphed today's S&P 500 stock price. As you can see, it's a flat line hovering within 1% of 1580:\n\nSo how does the press create a story that it plunged? By changing the baseline. Instead of using '0' as the baseline, they use a baseline of '1560'. This magnifies the change for dramatic purposes. It makes the graph look like the following:\n\nThis looks scary indeed, but it's not true. Yes, the @AP hack had a noticeable effect on stock prices, but not necessarily an important effect.\n\nLet's look at it from another perspective, the ^VIX volatility index. As you can see, today was the least volatile of the past five trading days. In addition, the brief event related to @AP is only barely noticeable, and unremarkable compared to volatility later in the day.\n\nWednesday, April 10, 2013\n\nBitcoin is an increasingly popular electronic currency, used both for legitimate and illegal transactions. Economists haven't taken a serious look at bitcoin yet, so I thought I'd take a stab at it. In particular, I'm going to look at the \"intrinsic value\" of bitcoin, answering the question whether the recent rapid rise in price (to $240 at the time of writing this) is justified.\n\nThe TL;DR version is this: bitcoins have real value (they are not a fantasy), and that value is between $0.01 and $15000.\n\nBitcoin vs. Money\n\nThere have been many un-serious looks at BitCoin. Take, for example, this 2011 blogpost by Nobel-prize winning economist Paul Krugman, where he compares bitcoin to the gold standard. He's completely wrong.\n\nThe mistake economists make is assuming that bitcoin works like real money. It doesn't. While bitcoin is designed as a \"medium of exchange\", it doesn't serve the other traditional functions of money, such as a \"store of value\", \"unit of account\", or \"measure of value\".\n\nIn recent months, the price of bitcoins has skyrocketed. In classic economics, this means that the bitcoin economy has experienced massive \"deflation\". Likewise, when the bitcoin bubble bursts and the price goes down, the bitcoin economy will experience hyper \"inflation\".\n\nBut this inflation/deflation has no effect. Prices aren't denominated in bitcoins, but in some hard currency like dollars or euros. Buyers exchange their dollars for bitcoins, give the bitcoins to the seller, who then immediately changes them back to euros. The entire process takes about 30 minutes. The only requirement is that the exchange rate for bitcoins not fluctuate wildly during this half-hour window. Since bitcoins are electronic, they can easily be subdivided, so \"billionth of a bitcoin\" is a workable value. When analyzing bitcoin, we have to toss out this idea that it is a \"measure of value\" and the related ideas of inflation/deflation.\n\nBitcoins are not legal tender. That's entirely the point: it's a rebel currency designed to evade normal government controls. But that means there is no government protection, either. This means that you cannot borrow bitcoins, because the government won't force you to pay back the loan. While might be able to store bitcoins in a \"bank\", rather than paying you interest on your deposit, the \"bank\" would charge you a fee. Thus, there is no bitcoin financial system. Our entire economic system isn't based on money but derivatives of money -- all that goes away leaving bitcoins by themselves.\n\nBitcoins are not a \"store of value\". Sure, speculators are hoarding bitcoins, but that's a different thing. You can't safely store bitcoins on your computer, because they will be lost when your hard drive crashes or a hacker infects you with a virus. You can't rely upon somebody else to store them for you, because as mentioned above, there's no law forcing them to give them back. And, as recent hacks of bitcoin businesses have shown, it's unlikely that an online site is safe enough. Only experts have enough skill to safely store their own bitcoins over long periods of time.\n\nThis is the failing of economists. They've built up a bunch of assumptions and rules-of-thumb about how \"money\" works, but bitcoins aren't really money, and those assumptions break down. We have to go back to first principles.\n\nMeasuring the bitcoin money supply\n\nBitcoins are currently above $200/coin. Is this price justified? Or is this due to speculators? What's the \"true\" value of bitcoin? To answer this question we have to first find out the \"true value\" of any currency, like the dollar or euro. Why is $1 worth $1? Or, better asked, why is $1 worth a quarter of a Big Mac hamburger? The answer is this: economists don't really know. They have theories, and some evidence, but they aren't certain.\n\nThe basic theory of money is simply \"supply and demand\". People demand money both as a medium of exchange and store of value. People demand money because barter is inefficient. If you want your car fixed, you might try to offer the mechanic some chickens, a goat, or a year of free haircuts. But if your mechanic is a long haired hippie, he's not going to want any of these things in trade. What he wants is something that he can easily exchange elsewhere. In other words, your mechanic demands money.\n\nThe same goes with savings. Long term savings are in things like your house, but in an emergency, it's hard to sell your house. Therefore, people want some savings in something more liquid, which is to say, money.\n\nThat's where the value of $1 comes from: supply and demand. People demand a thing that can easily be exchanged, and that demand creates value. This value is as real as the value of anything.\n\nThat's the theory, and there is evidence to back it up. For example, when governments print more money, the supply goes up, and as you would predict, the value of money goes down. That means it then takes more money in exchange for the same goods. In other words, prices go up, and inflation occurs. That's what happened in pre-war Germany and Zimbabwe more recently: the governments printed more and more money, causing hyperinflation with prices doubling daily.\n\nThere are other theories about where the value of money comes from. Some people believe that the value of currency comes from the government who prints it. The evidence for this theory is not good. Saddam-era Iraq is a good example. The 1991 Guld War cut off Iraq from the outside world. Instead of using high-quality \"Swiss\" printing presses, Iraq printed new money on low-quality presses. They also printed more of it, causing devaluation and inflation. The old currency continued to be used in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region, even though it was no longer officially recognized by the government. Moreover, when Saddam's regime fell, both forms of Iraqi currency continued to be used, even though no government existed to set its value. Even bad money is better than bartering three chickens and a goat -- the value comes from the demand, not from the government.\n\nYet another theory about the value of money is that it's due to irrational \"faith\" or \"perception\" of value. Economists disagree. A fundamental axiom of economics is that people are rational. When they value gold, dollars, or bitcoin, the assumption of economists is that people have a rational reason for doing so. Bubbles may seem irrational, but it's from people rationally betting. Some will be winners, some will be losers. It's like betting on who wins the superbowl: just because they lost the bet doesn't mean the losers were irrational choosing that team. All evidence suggests that valuing money is the \"rational\" thing to do, and trying to setup a barter system is less rational.\n\nSo if the \"true\" value of bitcoin is set by supply and demand, what are the \"suppy\" and \"demand\" for bitcoin?\n\nThe entire premise of bitcoin is that it can be used in the underground economy. This includes illegal activity, such as buying drugs, but also a lot of legal-but-shady activity, like buying porn or transferring money to your cousin overseas. The IRS estimates that the unreported underground economy is about $2-trillion per year (out of a total GDP of $14-trillion). So let's use that number as our \"demand\" part of the equation.\n\nWhat is the \"supply\" of bitcoin? That's determined by mathematics of the bitcoin algorithm. There are about 10-million bitcoins now, which will rise to a maximum of 20-million bitcoins over the next decade. So that's 20-million bitcoins chasing $2-trillion in transactions.\n\nCompare this to the official economy, with $2.4 trillion in money (M1) chasing $14-trillion in transactions, or a 6.553 ratio. Simply divide $2-trillion by 6.553 by 20-million and poof, you get the precise value of bitcoin: $15,260 per coin (fifteen thousand dollars).\n\nThat seems like a lot, much more than today's $240 price, but it's based on an enormous number of probably invalid assumptions. Changing the assumptions changes the valuation. For example, if we assume bitcoin is only used for 10% of the underground economy rather than 100%, then the value is 10% that number, or $1,526.\n\nPut another way, with bitcoins approaching $300, that means punters are assuming bitcoins are going to take over 2% of the underground economy. If you think bitcoins will take over more of that, then you should be buying bitcoin. Likewise, if you think bitcoin will take over less, then you should be selling bitcoin.\n\nNote that I use the M1 measure of the money supply in this calculation. Let's talk about money supply for a moment.\n\nThere are three good measures of the money supply: M0, M1, and M2.\n\nM0 is just the amount of physical money, which is about $800-billion in bills (mostly $100 and $20 bills). The 20-million possible bitcoin is the M0 of bitcoin.\n\nM1 includes M0, plus checking accounts. When you deposit money, your bank immediately lends out most of it. The borrower spends that money, which gets deposited in a bank, which likewise lends out most of it. This \"fractional reserve banking\" multiplies the effective amount of money available to about $2.4 trillion.\n\nM2 includes M1 and M0, plus liquid savings like money market funds. This is money that households can easily spend, but which they generally choose not to. This is roughly $10 trillion.\n\nIf you think bitcoins will be used primarily for transactions and not for savings, then M1 is the more appropriate measure. If you think there will be more saving of bitcoins, then M2 is likely a better measure, so increase your estimate of bitcoin value by four times.\n\nSince there is no banking in bitcoins, that makes M0 and M1 equivalent. If you think banking services like \"fractional reserve lending\" are likely to appear, then reduce your estimate of the value of bitcoin by three times.\n\nThe value of protocol\n\nThe above discussion is a top-down analysis from the \"economics\" perspective, comparing bitcoin to money. Let's also do a bottom-up analysis looking at bitcoins as a \"network protocol\", as a means of exchanging money -- but not being money itself. That last bit is important: we call bitcoins money, but technically, it's just a protocol for exchanging dollars into other dollars.\n\nAn essential part of bitcoin is that it takes 10 minutes for a transaction to complete. That number is baked into the protocol. Your transaction gets added to a blockchain, and that chain gets computed and rebroadcast out to the rest of the network. There is a new blockchain every 10 minutes. A typical transaction will therefore take 30 minutes: 10 minutes for the buyer to convert hard currency to bitcoins, 10 minutes to exchange the bitcoins, then 10 more minutes for the seller to change those coins back to hard currency.\n\nLet's assume a $2-trillion economy where bitcoins are converted back to hard currency as fast as possible, where nobody holds onto the coins longer than they have to. Running these numbers ($2-trillion divided by (365*24*60*2) divided by 20 million) comes out to 10 cents per bitcoin. Assuming a smaller economy, such as bitcoins handling 2% of the underground economy, and you get 0.2 cents per bitcoin. Since there's a little slack in the system, let's call this 1 cent.\n\nThis assumption that people get rid of bitcoins as fast as possible won't be true, of course. Take a hypothetical gambling site that deals only in bitcoins. It'll take bets over the season on which baseball team will win the superbowl, and only then paying the winners at the end of the season. The value of 10 minutes is only the minimum, the average will be larger.\n\nYour belief in how long a bitcoin will be held (on average) therefore changes the equation. If the average built coin is held for a day rather than 30 minutes, the value of a bitcoin goes up 50 times. Conersely, the time between block chain confirmations can do down (it's actually 7 minutes now instead of 10), reducing the value of bitcoins. Today's alue of $240/bitcoin implies the average length of time somebody holds onto a bitcoin is 7 years (assuming bitcoins handle 2% of the underground economy).\n\nThe value of politics\n\nCan the government outlaw bitcoin, driving its value to zero?\n\nThe government has an excellent track record in this respect. They've bankrupted other popular electronic currencies, like \"e-gold\". Americans can no longer obtain Swiss bank accounts, because the Swiss are tired of the U.S. government harassing them all the time. This means there is a serious risk that the government can either shut down bitcoin completely, or drive it underground severely reducing it's usefulness and value.\n\nBut here's the thing about bitcoin: it's based on math, no organization controls it. Even if the government bankrupts public facing sites like Mt. Gox and throws its owners into jail, bitcoin transactions will continue.\n\nIndeed, you could have the reverse effect: the more government shuts down competing currencies, the more valuable bitcoin becomes as the one currency the government cannot shut down. There will always be a huge demand for an underground, non-governmental currency that government will never successfully squash.\n\nConclusion: is this a bubble?\n\nI've laid out arguments why bitcoins are worth as low as 1 cent and as high as 15 thousand dollars ($0.01 to $15000). So, should you be buying or selling right now with the value around $200?\n\nLet's say you bought Amazon.com at the height of the dot-com bubble. How much money would you have lost? At the height of the bubble, their stock price was $100 a share. Now it is near $300. You wouldn't have lost money, you would have instead tripled your investment. Of course, the other 99% of dot-com companies either went out of business or lost most of their value. Amazon is one of only a few companies that have held onto their value.\n\nThe point is this: just because it's a bubble doesn't mean it's a bad time to invest. Given certain assumptions, I've laid out a good argument why bitcoins could be worth thousands of dollars, much higher than the current price of $240. If you agree with those assumptions, you should be buying bitcoins.\n\nThe point is also this: the Internet did take off, exceeding the wildest dreams of even the most optimistic visionary. But this didn't mean that early dot-com investors made any money; most lost their shirts in the dot-com crash. Bitcoin could become wildly successful, accounting for a trillion dollars a year in transactions, all with a valuation of pennies-per-bitcoin. That means you can still lose a lot of money while being \"right\".\n\nFull disclosure: I own 4 bitcoins (that I got from mining), and I have no plans to sell them. Neither do I have plans to buy any.\n\nUpdate: since starting this post and completing it, the bitcoin bubble appears to have burst:\n\nMonday, April 01, 2013\n\nA lot of ink's been spent lately on\nthe idea of cyber warfare, cyber defense, the enemies, the allies, what would\nwe do if we had a cyber Pearl Harbor, etc. As one of the foremost experts on\nall things cyber, I thought I would take a day to explain some of the finer\npoints of this new realm of warfare and how to fit in.\n\nOrganization\n\nNow despite what anyone may say,\nCyber Warriors are going to be a huge part of any future war. In the military\nthere is a name for highly skilled Special Mission Units (SMUs). They are\nreferred to as a \"Tier-One\" units. These units are well known secrets like the\nArmy's 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (Delta Force), the Navy's\nNaval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU or SEAL Team 6), and the Intelligence SupportActivity (ISA). These are the men and women our country calls upon to solve the\n\"big boy\" problems. Cyber Warriors will soon join their ranks, but not as a\nTier-One unit.\n\nEvery true Cyber Warrior worth his\ndeck knows that counting starts at zero. Be prepared to see DoD messages about\nTier-Zero units. These will be the cyber warriors with access to military-grade\nexploits and viruses. They'll be the guys with the authority to infect an\nenemy's computer with e-sheep in the name of freedom.\n\nHow To Join\n\nThe training required for Tier-One\noperators to arrive at the \"tip of the spear\" is a highly classified secret. Expect\nno less for Tier-Zero operators. Various methods of recruitment could be, but are\nnot limited to:\n\n1.Apprehending you when you break into your school to change your grades.\n\n2.Lurking on IRC channels that elite hackers are known to\nfrequent.\n\n3.Breaking into your Call of Duty clan meeting to taunt you. This\nwill test your mental stamina and toughness. They need to see if you have what\nit takes. There's no good time during a mission to cry over getting flamed.\n\n4.Sending out mass flyers advertising \"military style\" boot camps\nfor MCSEs. Do you have the guts to respond?\n\nHowever the recruiting is done, you\ncan be sure it will be subtle. It will in no way resemble a NSA recruiting\nbooth at Defcon.\n\nHow to Dress\n\nSince Tier-Zero and Tier-One units\nwill work together closely, it makes sense to dress as much alike as possible.\nGenerally, if you are a sniper you wanna take out the guy that looks like he is\nin charge. You're looking for the guy who looks somehow \"different.\" Different\nmeans important. Important means \"target.\" This is why saluting unpopular officers\nin the field is called a \"sniper check.\" If the \"different\" looking guy doesn't\nget shot, it's just because there wasn't a sniper around to shoot him. Here is\nhow to blend in with a Tier-One unit while carrying out your Tier-Zero mission.\n\n1.Uniform \u2013 Just\nbecause you are not actually with them does not mean you should not dress like\nthem. Stock up on tactical pants and combat shirts. The preferred brand is a\ncompany called Crye Precision. Their combat pants and shirts will help you\nblend in considerably. The Tier-One guys use all the pockets to carry things\nlike first aid kits, high tech military gear, secondary weapons, etc. A\nCyberwarrior can carry things like USB doodads (microphones and thumb drives),\nextra Ethernet cables, your secureID card, multiple cell phones, a tablet, and\nyour office badge. The combat clothes also have removable knee and elbow pads.\nI suggest you use these when you have to rewire a server room, plug something\nin under your desk, or reach under the vending machine when a Mountain Dew\nslips out of your hands.\n\nAs a word of caution, go for the Khaki, Black or Green. The Multicam will make you blend into your surroundings,\ncausing you to be counted absent at work or a no-show for a boring meeting. You\ndon't want to lose a vacation day because you blend in too well.\n\n2.Footwear \u2013 Tier-One\nassets can expect to go anywhere and do anything. For that reason, they wear\nspecialized shoes and boots from makers like Oakley and Salomon. This footwear\nis designed to withstand jumping out of airplanes, trekking across deserts, and\nslogging through jungles. The ankle support is key. Getting a sprained ankle in\na firefight is just embarrassing.\n\nA Tier-Zero operator needs the same\nsupport. A hallway could be getting mopped. A data center could have a pulled\ntile you don't notice, or someone could spill their Big Gulp at lunch and cause\na slip hazard. Fire drills and offsite meetings are also concerns. Take care of your feet, and they will take care of you.\n\n3.Helmets \u2013 Just\nbecause you are not on a kinetic battlefield does not mean you do not need a\nhelmet. Tier-One units have a variety they use, but I suggest you stick with\nthe Crye Precision Airframe. Other operators will recognize how high-speed you\nare when you wear it. It actually serves two functional purposes. First, your\nbrain is all you have going for you. In cramped office and cubicles\nCyberwarriors will often stack collectibles. You can't have one of these action\nfigures falling on your head and putting you out of commission. Second, the\nCrye helmets have side rails for quickly attaching several high tech devices\nlike flashlights. I recommend the SureFire brand, since the guys doing the\nshooting may have to borrow yours one day and you don't want to hand them\nanything cheap. Make sure yours can do regular white light or green tinted\nlight. The best is a red tinted light that won't ruin your night vision when on\nan all night \"op.\" Believe me, giving away your position in your office at your\ndesk is a definite no-go.\n\n4.Armor \u2013\nCyberwarring is a dirty business. Sometimes things get hot. For those times, I\nsuggest you have a \"plate carrier\" and a good set of armor plates ready to go.\nTier-One guys expect their armor to stop AK-47 rounds and fragments from\nexplosives. You should as well. If it can stop a speeding 7.62x39mm bullet, think\nof the wonders it will do in office airsoft fights. You can stride through a\nhail of Nerf projectiles like they aren't even there. These plate carriers are\ndesigned to carry extra magazines for weapons, explosives, and other tools of\nthe Tier-One trade. You can use that space to carry extra Limitless energy\nshots, snacks, your ID, or reloads for your own Airsoft/Nerf weapons. Don't cut\ncorners on the cost here. Your enemies can tell the difference between a Condor\nvest from the local Airsoft store and a real deal London Bridge Trading Company6094 plate carrier used by Navy SEALs. Learn the difference and make fun of the\nnerds with the cheap stuff. They are not Tier-Zero.\n\n5.Belt \u2013 Real \"shooters\"\nin the thick of it have special belts they can use to clip to a helicopter\nduring a hairy exfil or while going into a hot LZ. These are known as \"rigger'sbelts,\" and they have an extra hook that the operator can attach a lanyard to.\nThis keeps the operator in place. Tier-One ops don't fall out of aircraft or off\nof rooftops. A Tier-Zero specialist has a very similar use for a rigger's belt:\nwhen the cyber fighting goes hot, you will become a kidnapping target. You\nprobably already are, and just don't know it yet. A rigger's belt and lanyard\nwill allow you to clip yourself to a stationary object and foil any foreign\nintelligence agents' attempts to kidnap you. I suggest LBT for these items. Do\nnot clip yourself to something mobile, like a car, or something easily movable,\nlike your chair or an orange emergency cone. I would not put it past a spy to\njust steal the car or road cone to get to you. Protip: bulk up. Your natural\nobesity will make pulling you into a van or helicopter against your will much\nharder. If they want you, make them work for it.\n\n6.Guns \u2013 Of course\nCyberwarriors need guns. We're talking about blending in with the big boys,\nhere. I could spend hours on this topic alone, but I'll just give you a few\ntips and let OJT training cover the rest. You need good military-grade weapons.\nNot having them would be like a kid showing up to do pentests without\ninstalling NMap first. Poseur.\n\nSince civilians can't get military-grade\nweapons, buy weapons that look military-grade. I suggest a Daniel Defense M4A1SOCOM with a Leopuld HAMR scope. Daniel Defense makes a lot of gun parts for\nSOCOM, so the rifle makes you blend right in. For a pistol, go with a Sig Sauer226. The rifle needs to be in 5.56mm, and the 226 needs to be in 9mm. If\nanybody gives you crap about the weapon calibers, just smirk and blame the\nGeneva Convention or liberals, either works. The secret to dealing with caliber\nsnobs is to know they aren't listening to you, anyway. They are just waiting\nfor their turn to talk.\n\nHere is the hard part, though (you\ndidn't think this was just a shopping trip, did you?): you actually have to be\nable to shoot. Any time someone looks at your rifle, dropping some shooting\nlingo like, \"Yeah, its zeroed to two hundred meters,\" is a great response. The\nlingo is not a substitute for shooting, though. You have to be able to keep an\ninch group at 200 meters with your rifle and a two-inch group at 25 meters with\nyour pistol. Frown and silently shake your head at anyone who can't.\n\n7.Random other stuff - The Devil is in the details. Here's a list of the small things you'll need that\ndon't warrant their own sections:\n\nb.Flashlights - Carry two of these, as well. One should be an\ninsane 500 lumen-powered light, and the other should be something like a\nsurefire X300 that you can use on a rifle or pistol. If people ask why you have\na weapon light when you aren't carrying a weapon, just tell them you are always\nprepared. (Add a smirk here. It'll make them think you're prepared to take\nsomeone else's weapon if you don't have your own on you.)\n\nc.Paracord - This stuff is almost as useful as duct tape,\nwithout the disadvantage of making everything in your pockets stick together.\nParacord can come in the form of bracelets you can wear and unwrap when you\nneed it, but that's not Tier-Zero cool. Get a paracord sling for your rifle, a\nparacord strap for your computer bag. paracord bootlaces, paracord keychain. Make\nsome toys for your desk out of paracord. Finally, when you're good enough, make\nyour underwear out of paracord. Nobody ever expects paracord underwear.\n\nd.Multitool \u2013 You don't know what's gonna happen any time you step\noutside. Get a good multitool, like the Leatherman EOD MUT. It comes with a C4\npunch. Tier-One guys use C4 punches to put detonators in plastic explosives.\nYou can use one to deflate potato chip bags to fit in your desk. You can even\nuse it on bubble wrap.\n\ne.Gloves \u2013 With all this dangerous stuff, you need some gloves to\nkeep your typing assets in order. Do you know how hard it is to type with one\nhand? I suggest Oakley. Good, well made, hardcore protection for your knuckles,\nand they will insulate you from a very hot cup of coffee (Protip: Studies have\nbeen done on the body's ability to uptake caffeine more quickly from hot\nliquids. Elite Tier-Zero operators microwave their Mountain Dew.)\n\nf.Patches \u2013 As a Tier-Zero operator, you will be in a unit\nthat doesn't exist, so you won't have a unit patch. It's not cool to wear other\nunits' patches. You don't wanna give those dweebs credit for your awesome\nmissions. I wear Foxhound or Mandalorian unit patches as a form or psyops.\nEnemy intel agents will waste time and effort trying to figure out what unit\nyou are with. Let them. It's all part of the game.\n\nHow to talk\n\nStrangely, there's not much\ndifference between a Tier-Zero operator and a regular InfoSec professional.\nThink about it: DMZs, payloads, and perimeter threats? The language isn't that\ndifference. Throw in some gun lingo, and you're talking like a badass. Don't\ntalk about zombies, though. That's a dead giveaway that all of your tactical training\ncame from the Walking Dead. Instead\nof \"Zombie Killer,\" you should say \"Non-permissive environment specialist.\"\n\nWrapup\n\nThat's all the space I have for this issue. Next week we'll\ntalk about hacking techniques, identifying Nation-State weak spots, and getting\naccess to SCADA environments for testing new malware. Until then, stock up on\nTier-Zero uniforms and gear, and get some time in at the gun range. Oh, and be\ncareful. It's a jungle out there.\n\nWednesday, March 27, 2013\n\nWe are a tool using species. It started with sticks to knock down bananas. For the modern homo sapiens, it's tools like JavaScript and Hadoop.\n\nToday, I was working on a technical problem. I came across this blogpost from 2012 that had close to the answer I was looking for, but it missed a key detail that was important to me.\n\nWell, I follow the author on twitter, and the author follows me. So I sent him a tweet asking if he still had the data around, and whether he could analyze it again to solve my specific question. He responded with \"Just let me run a quick hadoop query for you\".\n\nMinutes later, he posted the results of the query to GitHub that had exactly what I was looking for.\n\nThis all took place within 30 minutes from start to finish. It's possible because we tool using homos have opposable thumbs that can grasp the blogs, the twitters, the github, and the hadoop. I don't know how many servers @jedisct1 has at his disposal, but in theory, with a few keystrokes, he could reach into the cloud (like Amazon's service) and marshall a thousand machines equalling a million dollar super computer to answer this small question for me.\n\nMonday, March 25, 2013\n\nFor those of you who play with virtual-machines like VMware, the Ubuntu server .iso contains an option for dramatically reducing the amount of memory needed. Using this option reduces the default installation's memory usage down to 66-megabytes. This is probably basic information for most of you, but I didn't know it, so I'm writing it up here."}

{"text": "Google opens door to hackers\n\nHackers no longer even need to visit a website to attack it, instead they are using information from pages cached by popular search engine Google according to a report in the New Scientist.\n\nOne way hackers can break into a website is by hunting for private pages containing the passwords or usernames required to access secure parts of the site. These pages are normally hidden from the casual browser, but sometimes faulty software or failure to properly delete such pages make this data available, creating a serious security loophole, according to the report.\n\nHackers normally have to trawl the web searching for such vulnerabilities, but professional hacker Johnny Long told the New Scientist that search engines, such as Google, have made the task much easier.\n\nSearch engines work by following all the links on a page and caching the information they find to create a searchable database of web pages. So if a page contains a link to a private page the search engine will follow it and store the cached page. This means that hackers can search for common words found on pages containing sensitive information, such as 'cash history', 'temporary' and 'password'."}

{"text": "Up Next\n\nWhen the company Enron declared bankruptcy in December 2001, hundreds of employees were left jobless while some executives seemed to benefit from the company's collapse. The United States Congress decided to investigate after hearing allegations of corporate misconduct. Much of Congress' investigation relied on computer files as evidence. A specialized detective force began to search through hundreds of Enron employee computers using computer forensics.\n\nThe purpose of computer forensics techniques is to search, preserve and analyze information on computer systems to find potential evidence for a trial. Many of the techniques detectives use in crime scene investigations have digital counterparts, but there are also some unique aspects to computer investigations.\n\nFor example, just opening a computer file changes the file -- the computer records the time and date it was accessed on the file itself. If detectives seize a computer and then start opening files, there's no way to tell for sure that they didn't change anything. Lawyers can contest the validity of the evidence when the case goes to court.\n\nSome people say that using digital information as evidence is a bad idea. If it's easy to change computer data, how can it be used as reliable evidence? Many countries allow computer evidence in trials, but that could change if digital evidence proves untrustworthy in future cases.\n\n\u00adComputers are getting more powerful, so the field of computer forensics must constantly evolve. In the early days of computers, it was possible for a single detective to sort through files because storage capacity was so low. Today, with hard drives capable of holding gigabytes and even terabytes of data, that's a daunting task. Detectives must discover new ways to search for evidence without dedicating too many resources to the process.\n\nWhat are the basics of computer forensics? What can investigators look for, and where do they look? Find out in the next section.\n\nThis Whole Court is Out of Order\n\nVincent Liu, a computer security specialist, used to create anti-forensic applications. He didn't do it to hide his activities or make life more difficult for investigators.

Liu is concerned that computer forensics tools aren't foolproof and that relying on computer evidence is a mistake [source: CSO]."}
{"text": "Is Your PC a Hacker Tool? How to Test Security\n\nTHE CUTTING EDGE: FOCUS ON TECHNOLOGY | PC FOCUS\n\nI don't know who was responsible for last week's attacks on Yahoo, EBay, E-Trade and other popular Web sites, but there is a remote possibility that I could have been an unwitting accomplice. That's because I have a cable modem, which connects the PCs in my house to the Internet 24 hours a day. People with digital subscriber lines and businesses with high-speed dedicated lines could be in the same boat.\n\nOne possible explanation for the attacks is that an individual or a group of people used software to automatically plant malicious software on other people's computers, which, in turn, bombarded those sites with millions of bytes of information per second. Because my machines are on all the time, this could happen while I am sleeping.\n\nBeing a potential unwitting cohort in crime is bad enough, but what's more scary is that when you're connected to the Internet, there is also the risk that someone might be able to access data on your computer or know more about you than you care to disclose.\n\nUsers who dial into the Internet with standard modems aren't likely to pass on a hacker's instructions, but their privacy could still be jeopardized.\n\nTo find out if you're vulnerable, visit the Shields Up Web page at  Run by Steve Gibson, head of Gibson Research Corp., the site tests your machine to see if your privacy or data security is at risk.\n\nI tested my Windows PCs on Gibson's page and, until I installed some security software, they were \"wide open.\"\n\nTo begin with, Gibson's Web page greeted me by name, which it inferred from information on my machine. So much for anonymity. If his Web site can figure out my name, so can any other site whose operator is determined to find out who is visiting. Next it told me that my printer, my hard drive and my floppy drive were accessible via the Internet.\n\nI'm a bit of a cynic so I called Gibson to see just how much information he could really extract from my machine. I gave him my Internet protocol (IP) address and permission to hack and, less than a minute later, he told me what directories I have on my hard drive, the names of some of my files and then planted a text file on my hard drive. What's even scarier, he taught me how to do the same using some simple commands with software that's already on all Windows computers. In this case, I disclosed my IP address, but there are plenty of ways for hackers to get that information without your permission.\n\nMinutes later, I was spying on a system myself. I couldn't get into just any machine but I was able to penetrate a friend's system after he gave me his IP address and permission. Once in, I was able to plant files, read the content of his files and copy them to my own PC. I'm not going to tell you how to do it, but--trust me--it's very easy. Fortunately, there are also easy ways to keep your machine from being invaded.\n\nOne method is to install software that creates a \"firewall\" around your machine. Symantec, which makes the popular Norton Utilities and Norton Anti-Virus software, publishes Norton Internet Security. This $59.95 program shields your PC from invaders by blocking unauthorized attempts to get into your system. After I installed it, Gibson's Shields Up Web page was unable to determine my name or anything else about me and neither his Web site nor the tricks he taught me were able to penetrate the program's defenses. In other words, it protected my privacy and the security of my files. The program also scans for viruses and can also be used to block advertising and protect your kids from sexually explicit and other inappropriate Web sites.\n\nBlack Ice from Network Ice ( is another product aimed at keeping hackers out of your computer. This $39.95 program, which works on Windows 95 and 98, scans all traffic between your PC and the Internet and blocks intruders. Both of these programs also have alert features that tell you if someone is trying to get in and they keep a log so you can find out if anyone tried to break in while you were away from your PC.\n\nNorton Internet Security alerts you in \"real time\" so you can detect a potential intrusion as it happens. A small icon near the bottom of your screen flashes when it detects a potential problem. Zone Labs' ZoneAlarm 2.0, which you can download for free at  offers similar protection.\n\nI'm running Black Ice on one machine and Norton Internet Security on another and, on several occasions during the last 48 hours, someone has \"probed\" each of my PCs. A probe doesn't mean that someone was peering into my files or planting a program on my hard drive, but it does mean that an effort was made to identify my machine and possibly to look for security holes. The scary thing about this is that users might not even know this is going on. It's possible for a hacker to plant software on your machine that can later be triggered to violate your privacy or use your machine as an unwitting \"zombie\" to attack other machines."}
{"text": "A long-known but little-discussed vulnerability in the modern Internet's design was highlighted yesterday by a report that hackers traced to Iran spoofed the encryption procedures used to secure connections to Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, and other major Web sites.\n\nThis design, pioneered by Netscape in the early and mid-1990s, allows the creation of encrypted channels to Web sites, an important security feature typically identified by a closed lock icon in a browser. The system relies on third parties to issue so-called certificates that prove that a Web site is legitimate when making an \" connection.\n\nThe problem, however, is that the list of certificate issuers has ballooned over the years to approximately 650 organizations, which may not always follow the strictest security procedures. And each one has a copy of the Web's master keys.\n\n\"There is this problem that exists today where there are a very large number of certificate authorities that are trusted by everyone and everything,\" says Peter Eckersley, senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who has compiled a list of them.\n\nThis has resulted in a bizarre situation in which companies like Etisalat, a wireless carrier in the United Arab Emirates that implanted spyware on customers' BlackBerry devices, possess the master keys that can be used to impersonate any Web site on the Internet, even the U.S. Treasury, BankofAmerica.com, and Google.com. So do more than 100 German universities, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and random organizations like the Gemini Observatory, which operates a pair of 8.1-meter diameter telescopes in Hawaii and Chile.\n\nIt's a situation that nobody would have anticipated nearly two decades ago when the cryptographic protection known as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) began to be embedded into Web browsers. At the time, the focus was on securing the connections, not on securing the certificate authorities themselves--or limiting their numbers.\n\n\"It was the '90s,\" says security researcher Dan Kaminsky, who discovered a serious Domain Name System flaw in 2008. \"We didn't realize how this system would grow.\" Today, there are now about 1,500 master keys, or signing certificates, trusted by Internet Explorer and\nFirefox.\n\nThe vulnerability of today's authentication infrastructure came to light after Comodo, a Jersey City, N.J.-based firm that issues SSL certificates, alerted Web browser makers that an unnamed European partner had its systems compromised. The attack originated from an Iranian Internet Protocol address, according to Comodo Chief Executive Melih Abdulhayoglu, who told CNET that the skill and sophistication suggested a government was behind the intrusion.\n\nSpoofing those Web sites would allow the Iranian government to use what's known as a man-in-the-middle attack to impersonate the legitimate sites and grab passwords, read e-mail messages, and monitor any other activities its citizens performed, even if Web browsers show that the connections were securely protected with SSL encryption.\n\nIf Comodo is correct about the attack originating from Iran, it wouldn't be the first government in the region to have taken similar steps. Late last year, the Tunisian government undertook an ambitious scheme to steal an entire country's worth of Gmail, Yahoo, and Facebook passwords. It used malicious JavaScript code to siphon off unencrypted log-in credentials, which allowed government agents to infiltrate or delete protest-related discussions.\n\nComodo's revelation throws into sharp relief the list of flaws inherent in the current system. There is no automated process to revoke fraudulent certificates. There is no public list of certificates that companies like Comodo have issued, or even which of its resellers or partners have been given a duplicate set of the master keys. There are no mechanisms to prevent fraudulent certificates for Yahoo Mail or Gmail from being issued by compromised companies, or repressive regimes bent on surveillance; Tunisia even has its own certificate-issuing government agency.\n\n\"These organizations act as cornerstones of security and trust on the Internet, but it seems like they're not doing basic due diligence that other organizations are expect to do, like the banks,\" says Mike Zusman, managing consultant at Web app security firm Intrepidus Group. \"I'm not sure what we need to do but I think it's time we start addressing the issue of trust and issues of certificate authorities potentially not living up to standards that they should be.\"\n\nOver the last few years, a handful of papers and demonstrations at hacker conferences have focused more attention on the topic. But the Comodo intrusion, which appears to be the first public evidence of an actual attack on the way the Web handles authentication, could be a catalyst for rethinking the way to handle security.\n\nTwo years ago, for instance, Zusman was able to get a certificate from Thawte, a VeriSign subsidiary, for \"login.live.com\" just based on an e-mail address he created on the Hotmail domain. Even though it was revoked, it still worked in a Web browser during a demonstration at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas. Comodo, too, has previously been shown to have lax security standards among its resellers as far back as December 2008.\n\n\"Remember, the only reason Iran has to go to the lengths they've gone to to get certificates is because they don't have a (certificate issuer) of their own... most countries can just generate their own,\" says Moxie Marlinspike, chief technology officer of mobile app developer Whisper Systems, who has discovered serious problems with Web authentication before. One problem, he says, is that companies that issue certificates have a strong economic incentive to make it as easy as possible to obtain them.\n\nAnother worrisome aspect is that browser makers don't always have a good way to revoke fraudulent certificates. A discussion thread at Mozilla.org, makers of the Firefox browser, shows that after being alerted by Comodo, they had no process to revoke the faux certificates. Mozilla developers ended up having to write new code and test a patch, which took a few days and, even after its release, meant that only users who downloaded new versions of Firefox benefit.\n\nGoogle's Chrome, on the other hand, uses a transparent update system for desktop versions but not necessarily mobile ones. Microsoft said yesterday that \"an update is available for all supported versions of Windows to help address this issue.\"\n\nRoss Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge's computer laboratory, offered an anecdote in this paper (PDF): \"I asked a panelist from the Mozilla Foundation why, when I updated Firefox the previous day, it had put back a certificate I'd previously deleted, from an organisation associated with the Turkish military and intelligence services. The Firefox spokesman said that I couldn't remove certificates--I had to leave them in but edit them to remove their capabilities - while an outraged Turkish delegate claimed that the body in question was merely a 'research organisation.'\"\n\nJacob Appelbaum, a Tor Project developer who is a subject of a legal spat with the Justice Department over his work with WikiLeaks, says Mozilla should have warned of the vulnerability immediately and shipped Firefox 4 with a way to detect and revoke bad certificates turned on by default. (The technique is called Online Certificate Status Protocol, or OSCP).\n\n\"Mozilla's not taking their responsibility to the Internet seriously,\" said Appelbaum, who wrote an independent analysis of the situation. \"A Web browser isn't a toy. It's being used as a tool to overthrow governments...At the end of the day, they did not put their users first.\"\n\nSome long-term technical fixes have been proposed, with names like DANE, HASTLS, CAA (Comodo's Philip Hallam-Baker is a co-author), and Monkeysphere. The technology known as Domain Name System Security Extensions, or DNSSEC, can help. The Electronic Frontier Foundation's Eckersley, who runs the groups SSL Observatory that tracks SSL certificates, hints that he'll soon offer another proposal about how to reinforce the Web's cryptographic architecture.\n\n\"We do in fact need a way not to trust everyone,\" Eckersley says. \"We have 1,500 master certificates for the Web running around. That's 1,500 places that could be hacked and all of a sudden you have to scramble to dream up a solution"}
{"text": "Researchers studying the passwords exposed by the Christmas-day attack on the security firm Stratfor Global Intelligence say that many of the passwords have turned out to be \"simple and easy to decode.\"\n\nThat assessment comes from Utah Valley University's Kevin Young, area IT director and an adjunct professor who teaches information security. Using 120 computers, researchers at the university are decoding the encrypted passwords, which were revealed by a group purporting to be the AntiSec branch of Anonymous.\n\nThe story comes from PCWorld's Jeremy Kirk, who goes on to describe the weaknesses Young has found thusfar in short, simple passwords and in the MD5 hashing algorithm Stratfor employed to secure them:\n\nRather than store passwords in clear text, which is considered dangerous, Stratfor stored a cryptographic representation of victims' passwords called an MD5 hash, generally considered a wise security practice. Young set up the 120 computers in order to decode the MD5 password hashes released by the hackers.\n\nWith modest computing power and password cracking programs, many of those MD5 hashes can be decoded into their original password. The simpler and shorter the password, the faster it can be decoded.\n\nWhile MD5 is still a widely used cryptographic hash function, it's not perfect. Design flaws were found as early as 1996, and US-CERT has since said that the function \"should be considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use.\" Most U.S. government applications now require the SHA-2 family of hash functions.\n\nOf course, as Young pointed out to Kirk, what makes the imperfect hashing scenario particularly worrisome is that the computing power employed by the university pales in comparison to what a nation state can throw at a decryption target.\n\nAccording to the LA Times, Anonymous late last month released two batches of account information on 860,000 Stratfor subscribers.\n\nThose subscribers include many officials who are central to the country's financial system, holders of intellectual property, and/or instrumental to the United States's national defense.\n\nGiven that Stratfor analyzes national and international affairs, it counts among its clientele hundreds of U.S. intelligence, law enforcement and military officials, including the U.S. State Department; international banks such as Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase; and tech companies such as IBM and Microsoft.\n\nAnonymous revealed email addresses, names and credit card numbers belonging to some 75,000 customers, including former U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle and former U.S. Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.\n\nAs Kirk points out, the credit card data is of ephemeral value to criminals. It's the email addresses and cracked passwords that could enable malicious actors to identify some of Stratfor's subscribers and to potentially impersonate them in cyberspace.\n\nYoung told Kirk that he's decoded more than 160,000 Stratfor passwords, with many of the weak passwords belonging to those in organizations such as the U.S. Marine Corps, where the creation of a safe password should be well-understood and well-implemented.\n\nTime for a reminder on how to create a safe password. In a nutshell:\n\nUse a minimum of eight or nine characters.\n\nMix upper- and lower-case letters.\n\nUse numbers and/or punctuation.\n\nNever use the same password twice.\n\nYou can Frankenstein yourself a delightfully ungainly beast this way. An example: One of my previous passwords is Tb=0tS2!\n\nHow did I ever remember it? That nonsense string contains the first letters of a sentence in which I've swapped the first letter of each word for the entire word, thus foiling brute-force dictionary decryption.\n\nThere's more to it than that, of course. Sophos's Graham Cluley outlines the technique in this video.\n\n\"Stratfor stored a cryptographic representation of victims' passwords called an MD5 hash, generally considered a wise security practice.\"\n\nThat does not sound right.\n\nWe cracked 111,429 of the STRATFOR's MD5 hashes under 40 seconds with a large password dictionary, and many more in minutes after that using incremental cracking mode with John the Ripper. We stopped at 200k passwords. So, yea, they were really weak.\n\nThere's some misunderstanding in this article. The first is the belief something hashed with MD5 was actually decoded, and that security was compromised because of that particular algorithm. As far as I know, it's almost impossible to decode something hashed with MD5, as it's simply not reversible.\nHowever, it is possible to keep generating values until there's a match with a given value, or to find two inputs that return the same hash, which is the 'collision attack' you were referring to.\n\nThe actual method for cracking Stratfor's passwords was to keep hashing dictionary words, variations and possibilities, until there's a match with an MD5 entry in the password database. This same method is effective against MD5, SHA and SHA2, so changing the algorithm does nothing to improve security if weak passwords are still used.\n\nFor passwords that aren't horribly weak (nothing is going to help a password of \"Password123\"), SHA1 and SHA2 do provide advantages over MD5 for three reasons:\n1. MD5 produces a 128-bit digest. SHA1 = 160-bit. SHA2 = 224 to 512-bit. Longer digest = more possible digest values = lower chance of a collision.\n2. There are known weaknesses in MD5 that significantly decrease the number of calculations needed in order to find a collision.\n3. MD5 is computationally easier than SHA1, which in turn is easier than SHA2. This means with the same amount of processing power, you can grind through many more possible MD5 values than SHA1/SHA2.  has a nice table showing relative real-world computation speeds.\n\nMartin Bos (@PureHate_) announced he had recovered passwords for 92.22% of the Stratfor accounts back on Jan 3rd. I'd put money on him using oclHashcat-lite and at least one Radeon HD 5970. @hashcat reported hitting a record rate of 9.95B MD5 hashes/sec using that card on Jan 4th.\n\nUsing 120 computers to break only 160,000 passwords?!???! I used one machine that doesn't have the most modern gpu's to gather just over 300,000 total before I stopped. I used my own dictionaries, then brute forced the entire 1-7 password length space using the upper / lower alphanumeric character set. This was with only 700 million hashes per second, newer ati hardware can exceed 5 billion hashes per second per gpu. Even my laptop with a mobile nvidia card can exceed 85M hps. They need a new IT director even in his example Tb=0tS2! is only 8 characters long if his hash was leaked it would only take an attacker with a few current gen gpu's a day or two at max to break this. One hash cracking group is already known to have completed over 92% of the entire leaked data set and that was as of 3 days ago.\n\nI too, thought he was an idiot at first so I clarified it with the researcher. The 120 machines were creating 8,9, and 10 char sequential wordlists - until the researcher exhausted his 50TB allotment.\nHe fed both generated and existing wordlists into both JTR and oclHashCat (for speed comparison purposes). I have no idea how many he's since cracked.\nHis research was more about the quality, entropy, and complexity (and the lack thereof) than the quantity.\n\nIf you want to secure your data I would suggest keeping it offline and not on a networked PC. I keep my info on an encrypted USB stick, and it's only accessable during the times I need it. Much harder to get the data that is not there all the time.\n\nIt's amazing how this group seems to get around, and not anyone has anything to trace. Most of the Companies targeted are large, who think they have security under control by paying a guy thousands a year. While the $8/hr employee has insight to get around network security, and gives the hacker a free ride in. On top of the fact the IT Admin probably had no intentions of checking logs, or going about doing anything other than email to the subscribers to change their passwords because of the security breech.

All the security questions that websites use for password recovery can be figured out by knowing someone, and every site uses the same basic questions. I can get a lot of information right off facebook. (What highschool did you go to. Favorite food. Mothers Madien name. Favorite Hobby, pets name, etc). I bet I can get 8/10 friends passwords in less than 30 mins if they where all on the same site, using password recovery and quick guesses.\n\nI usually choose the ones that have an ever occuring change, and require me to know when I created the account to know what I liked or was doing then. Favorite Hobby could be reading today, be rock climbing tomorrow, and building snowmen on Saturday. It makes it harder for even me to remember my passwords, but knowing I created the account on 05/06/2003 and I know exactly what I was doing and what I was thinking at the time.\n\nDon't store password not even on a flash disk that can be turned to network disk, don't type password a key logger can send a copy of it somewhere, instead use a password generator to fill that field every time you login.

{"text": "On Meeting the Prime Minister\u2026and Online Security\n\nShare this:\n\nA few weeks ago my husband, son and I were strolling through our local shopping mall when we happened to see the prime minister of our country of residence. He was standing in the common area shaking hands and posing for photos with passersby.\n\nWe stopped and I took a photo of my husband and son with him. That done, we proceeded along to the supermarket to do our Saturday grocery shopping.\n\nSome minutes later it hit me. We had just met the prime minister, the most powerful man in Finland. I should have shaken his hand. And why hadn't I gotten in the photo too? The significance of meeting this dignitary had been completely lost on me!\n\nThe thing was, it was so low key. There was no big fuss about it. People were mostly going about their business. There was no heavy security detail, no men in black suits and sunglasses. And the prime minister himself, Jyrki Katainen, had looked so ordinary. Casually dressed, he could have been any other shopper that day.\n\nBut he wasn't any other shopper. He was the head of the Republic of Finland, out campaigning for his party (municipal elections were the following day).\n\nIt was a completely different experience from the other time I saw a head of government. In 1996 President Clinton came through my hometown on his re-election campaign. I remember the excitement. Thousands of people stood thronged around the stage. It took quite a while for my cousins and I to weave our way to the front of the crowd, where a rope separated the mass of people from the president. My cousin, who was bolder than I, stretched out far enough to shake his hand. And you can bet there was security.\n\nThe laid-back encounter with Prime Minister Katainen got me thinking about security in the real world versus the online world. In the real world, the need for security varies depending on the population, economics, social problems, et cetera, of where you are. It's apparently pretty easy for Katainen to get around in this quiet northern country of 5.4 million people. But in many countries with higher populations and less egalitarianism than Finland, top government officials must travel with an elaborate entourage.\n\nIn the online world however, threats are not bound by geography. Hackers use the information superhighway to get them anywhere in the world they want to go, in milliseconds. They can, for example, steal personal data, spread viruses, infiltrate bank accounts, and turn computers into robots that do their bidding, all from the comfort of their own home. So hackers in Wherever-ia aren't just that country's problem \u2013 they're everyone's problem.\n\nComprehensive Internet security is a must, whether you're in a small, relatively safe country like Finland, a populous nation like the USA, or whether you use a Mac or a PC. And wherever, whoever you are, there's protection for you."}

{"text": "Is That How You Do It?\n\nI'm a network and telecommunications engineer. My areas include infrastructure and security, and have worked for Fortune 100 companies, and been a DOD contractor.\n\nI suspect [the alleged Romney tax hack] is a hoax, and attempt to make some money.\n\nStill, this is a prime example as to how a low tech 'recon' hack works, and is often the first step in a bigger hack.\n\nA surprising number of people will let someone into an area just because they look like they should be there. An AC repairman, Telephone tech, a janitor, someone in a suit and tie asking for someone by name. It doesn't matter if they don't recognize them. People WANT to trust, and they are only to happy to, especially if you tell them that the AC/Phone/Computer/Printer is broken in the boss' office, and he wants it fixed NOW.\n\nMany of Kevin Mitnick's best hacks started with this exact kind of initial recon work. I use similar techniques for security audits, and a frightening number of otherwise smart and concientious people won't ask anytime more if you show them a fake work-order with the name of someone in authority (usually easy enough to locate on the company website). They don't want to annoy the boss, or delay them getting what ever issue is being claimed fixed.\n\nBingo, you now have (usually unescorted) access to the office and files to do what ever you're looking to do. Rummage through file cabinets, install a keylogger or packet sniffer, or just copy the passwords off of the post-its that so many people keep attached to their monitors.\n\nSo I suspect it's a fake trying to score some BitCoin, but it's certainly plausible.\n\nIf PWC is smart, they have already had all their systems checked and scanned for any other surprises (especially checking the backs of the computers for any new toys plugged in that shouldn't be there). If there is nothing, it's probably phoney. Any \"hacker\" that would go to that much trouble and that sort of risk, isn't likely to waste the opening by not plugging in a jump drive with an extra surprise for them. Even if it only runs for a day or two before it's found."}
{"text": "Security breaches and how attackers break in to networks and systems are difficult to explain and conceptualize because of all the moving parts involved in an attack. Data visualization of these complex attacks is effective because it shifts the balance between perception and cognition to take fuller advantage of the brain's abilities. Seeing (i.e visual perception) which is handled by the visual cortex located in the rear of the brain, is extremely fast and efficient. We see immediately, with little effort. Thinking (i.e. cognition), which is handled primarily by the cerebral cortex in the front of the brain, is much slower and less efficient. The more we can gleam from a picture the more likely the oft quoted phrase \"a picture is worth a thousand words\" is true.\n\nWhile there are only a couple of books on visualization of security events, most is focus on presenting security data such as facts and figured visually. The tide is changing though as we are seeing more people start to actual perform visualizations of attacks. These visualization convey much more data than a table ever could.\n\nBen Reardon, a fellow Honeynet project member, who created the visualization wrote on his company's website that \"with the increase in popularity of VoIP telephony, attacks are becoming more prevalent. The compromise of a VoIP system can cost the victim over $100,000 in real cash. For example, an Australian based company suffered $120,000 in toll fraud as a result of a VOIP compromise.\"\n\nHere's a brief primer so you'll know what's actually going on:\n\nThe purple bubbles to the left of the screen represent user accounts belonging to people who sign up for VOIP phone services like Skype.\n\nThe tiny white and red bubbles are malicious scans from the hacker's computer that are executed as a way of breaking into customer accounts to steal passwords.\n\nThe green bubbles represent imposter data or in cyberspeak \"honeypots\" that the server sends to intercept the scans and prevent them from compromising user's accounts.\n\nHoneypots are a lot of fun for security professionals. We get to trick the tricksters who try to trick security systems. These opportunities give us whitehats a chance to be a little devious for once and get in the heads of those we are protecting against.\n\nSo Microsoft conducted a little honeypot of their own to collect some data on the kinds of automated password attacks hackers are using to break into user accounts. They created a fake FTP server and allowed hackers to go to town trying to crack the password for about a year. The FTP logged and processed the information gathered by login attempts.\n\nThe honeypot gathered hundreds of user names and tens of thousands of password that have been used in automated attacks. The data told us a few things we already knew, basically that the most common password hack attempts resemble the most commonly used passwords. But the data told us one new thing that we did not already know about password cracking. That is, simply having a long password isn't good enough anymore if it is still dictionary-based. The honeypot attackers routinely used passwords 8-10 characters in length and would even try passwords 10, 15, or 20 characters long. Also, hackers are persistent, even for using automated systems. One tenacious attacker attempted 400,000 passwords to crack the fake FTP.\n\nThe emphasis on password strengthening is now more relevant than ever with the reemergence of \"L0phtCrack\" \u2013 a password auditing software. L0phtCrack attempts to crack passwords at swift speeds by scanning through a dictionary of words and forming probable password guesses. Basically, it does the exact same thing as the automated password crackers the hackers use, but for whitehat purposes. Of course, critics are worried that L0phtCrack is a double-edged sword since it could be used for that very purpose.\n\nPasswords are actually the easiest security measure to ensure protection. As long as your password follows the basic password strengthening guidelines \u2013 length, alphanumerical, case variance, special characters, etc \u2013 it should never be cracked. At least, not by an automated tool."}
{"text": "The second rule of the internet\n\nAgainst a sophisticated attacker, nothing connected to the internet is secure.\n\nTo this, I feel like I should add a second item:\n\nEverything is internet now.\n\nWhile there were once large numbers of electronic systems entirely disconnected from the internet, nowadays virtually everything is either connected to the internet constantly or occasionally connected to a device that is online. Your cell phone is probably always accessible to a sophisticated attacker using the internet, and the same is probably true for landlines using VoIP. Many of your computers are probably constantly connected to wireless networks (themselves targets for attack) and exposed to the wider internet through your broadband connection at all times.\n\nWeb integration with computers has reached the point that Google's Chrome browser now treats 'search' and 'GMail' as apps within the Chrome environment.\n\nThe implication of combining the first and second rules is pretty plain. If you manage to attract the attention of a sophisticated attacker, they can probably get into the contents of your cell phone and your GMail account, as well as the hard drive of your PC and laptop, the ubiquitous webcams now built into computers, and so on. There is also a good chance they can take over your email, websites, Twitter accounts, and the like and use them for their own purposes.\n\n\"Kate Murphy writes that as cellphones have gotten smarter, they have become less like phones and more like computers, and that with more than a million phones worldwide already hacked, technology experts expect breached, infiltrated or otherwise compromised cellphones to be the scourge of 2012. Cellphones are often loaded with even more personal information than PCs, so an undefended or carelessly operated phone can result in a breathtaking invasion of individual privacy as well as the potential for data corruption and outright theft. But there are a few common sense ways to protect yourself: Avoid free, unofficial versions of popular apps that often have malware hidden in the code, avoid using Wi-Fi in a Starbucks or airport which leaves you open to hackers, and be wary of apps that want permission to make phone calls, connect to the Internet or reveal your identity and location.\"\n\n\"A massive Android malware campaign may be responsible for duping as many as 5 million users into downloading the Android.Counterclan infection from the Google Android Market. The trojan collects the user's personal information, modifies the home page, and displays unwanted advertisements. It is packaged in 13 different applications, some of which have been on the store for at least a month. Several of the malicious apps are still available on the Android Market as of 3 P.M. ET. Symantec has posted the full list of infected applications.\"\n\n\"Encryption keys on smartphones can be stolen via a technique using radio waves, says one of the world's foremost crypto experts, Paul Kocher, whose firm Cryptography Research will demonstrate the hacking stunt with several types of smartphones at the upcoming RSA Conference in San Francisco next month.\"\n\nYour encryption doesn't work because you cannot keep a key safe. You can't memorize a key that is long enough to be secure and as soon as you write it down electronically an attacker can gain access to it.\n\n\"Elsewhere, driven by the acceleration of computing power and connectivity and the simultaneous development of surveillance systems and tracking technologies, we are approaching a theoretical state of absolute information transparency, one in which 'Orwellian' scrutiny is no longer a strictly hierarchical, top-down activity, but to some extent a democratized one. As individuals steadily lose degrees of privacy, so to do corporations and states. Loss of traditional privacies may seem in the short term to be driven by issues of national security, but this may prove in time to be intrinsic to the nature of ubiquitous information.\n\nCertain goals of the government's Total (now Terrorist) Information Awareness initiative may eventually be realized simply by the evolution of the global information system \u2013 but not necessarily or exclusively for the benefit of the United States or any other government. This outcome may be an inevitable result of the migration to cyberspace of everything that we do with information.\n\nHad Orwell known that computers were coming (out of Bletchley Park, oddly, a dilapidated English country house, home to the pioneering efforts of Alan Turing and other wartime code-breakers) he might have imagined a Ministry of Truth empowered by punch cards and vacuum tubes to better wring the last vestiges of freedom from the population of Oceania. But I doubt his story would have been very different. Would East Germany's Stasi have been saved if its agents had been able to mouse away on PCs into the Nineties? The system would still have been crushed. It just wouldn't have been under the weight of paper surveillance.\"\n\n\""}

{"text": "Black ops: how HBGary wrote backdoors for the government\n\nThe attacks last week by Anonymous on security firm HBGary have yanked back \u2026\n\nBack to basics\n\nIn January 2011, Barr had moved on to his research into Anonymous\u2014research that would eventually do his company in. Over at HBGary, Hoglund continued his pursuit of next-gen rootkits. He had hit on a new approach that he called \"Magenta.\"\n\nThis would be a \"new breed of Windows-based rootkit,\" said a Magenta planning document, one that HBGary called a \"multi-context rootkit.\"\n\nThe Magenta software would be written in low-level assembly language, one step up from the ones and zeroes of the binary code with which computers do their calculating. It would inject itself into the Windows kernel, and then inject itself further into an active process; only from there would the main body of the rootkit execute.\n\nMagenta would also inject itself routinely into different processes, jumping around inside the computer's memory to avoid detection. Its command-and-control instructions, telling the rootkit exactly what to do and where to send the information, wouldn't come from some remote Internet server but from the host computer's own memory\u2014where the control instructions had been separately injected.\n\n\"This is ideal because it's trivial to remotely seed C&C messages into any networked Windows host,\" noted Hoglund, \"even if the host in question has full Windows firewalling enabled.\"\n\nNothing like Magenta existed (not publicly, at least), and Hoglund was sure that he could squeeze the rootkit code into less than 4KB of memory and make it \"almost impossible to remove from a live running system.\" Once running, all of the Magenta files on disk could be deleted. Even the best anti-rootkit tools, those that monitored physical memory for signs of such activity, \"would only be of limited use since by the time the responder tried to verify his results Magenta will have already moved to a new location & context.\"\n\nHoglund wanted to build Magenta in two parts: first, a prototype for Windows XP with Service Pack 3\u2014an old operating system but still widely installed. Second, if the prototype generated interest, HBGary could port the rootkit \"to all current flavors of Microsoft Windows.\"\n\nShortly thereafter, Anonymous broke into HBGary Federal's website, cracked Barr's hashed password using rainbow tables, and found themselves in a curious position; Barr was also the administrator for the entire e-mail system, so they were able to grab e-mail from multiple accounts, including Hoglund's.\n\nA world awash in rootkits\n\nThe leaked e-mails provide a tantalizing glimpse of life behind the security curtain. HBGary and HBGary Federal were small players in this space; indeed, HBGary appears to have made much of its cash with more traditional projects, like selling anti-malware defense tools to corporations and scanning their networks for signs of infection.\n\nIf rootkits, paranoia monitors, cartoons, and fake Facebook personas were being proposed and developed here, one can only imagine the sorts of classified projects underway throughout the entire defense and security industry.\n\nWhether these programs are good or bad depends upon how they are used. Just as Hoglund's rootkit expertise meant that he could both detect them and author them, 0-day exploits and rootkits in government hands can be turned to many uses. The FBI has had malware like CIPAV (the Computer and Internet Protocol Address Verifier) for several years, and it's clear from the HBGary e-mail leak that the military is in wide possession of rootkits and other malware of its own. The Stuxnet virus widely believed to have at least damaged Iranian nuclear centrifuge operations is thought to have originated in the US or Israeli governments, for instance.Critics like Glenn Greenwald contend that this nexus of private and public security power is a dangerous mix. \"The real issue highlighted by this episode is just how lawless and unrestrained is the unified axis of government and corporate power,\" he wrote last week.\n\nEspecially (though by no means only) in the worlds of the Surveillance and National Security State, the powers of the state have become largely privatized. There is very little separation between government power and corporate power. Those who wield the latter intrinsically wield the former.\n\nThe revolving door between the highest levels of government and corporate offices rotates so fast and continuously that it has basically flown off its track and no longer provides even the minimal barrier it once did. It's not merely that corporate power is unrestrained; it's worse than that: corporations actively exploit the power of the state to further entrench and enhance their power.\n\nEven if you don't share this view, the e-mails provide a fascinating glimpse into the origins of government-controlled malware. Given the number of rootkits apparently being developed for government use, one wonders just how many machines around the globe could respond to orders from the US military. Or the Chinese military. Or the Russian military.\n\nWhile hackers get most of the attention for their rootkits and botnets and malware, state actors use the same tools to play a different game\u2014the Great Game\u2014and it could be coming soon to a computer near you.\n\nNate Anderson / Nate is the deputy editor at Ars Technica, where he oversees long-form feature content and writes about technology law and policy.

{"text": "Hacked to Death: A Brief History of Tech's Most Two-Sided Term\n\nShare this:\n\nThe word hacker has been everywhere recently, splashed across the front page for weeks as the \"Phone Hacking\" scandal at News of the World engulfed Rupert Murdoch and his media empire. There is a sensational mystique to the term that makes it irresistible to journalists. But typing the default password \"1111\" into the voicemail box of a murdered girl is not hacking. Neither is bribing the police for the phone numbers of celebrities and crime victims. Unless we're ready to call smashing the window on my Honda Civic \"car hacking,\" nothing in the News. Corp scandal fits the bill.\n\"If it had been me, I would have broken into the phone company system, so I could have had direct access to the messages of all their customers,\" said Kevin Mitnick, who was for several years the most wanted computer criminal in America, after hacking into the voicemail computers at Pacific Bell. \"What News Corp. did, guess pin codes, spoofing voicemails, that is amateur script kiddie stuff.\"\n\nMr. Mitnick, who now works as a security consultant and is publishing his first book in August, said he's disappointed to see what passes for hacking these days. \"I can remember writing a program in high school that was supposed to calculate 100 digits of the Fibonacci Sequence. It did that, but of course, it also stole passwords from my professor and classmates. But I didn't get in trouble for that, I got an A, because my teacher recognized it was smart. That's what hacking is supposed to be about, not crime, but innovation and creativity.\"\n\nIn the 1950s, on the campus of The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a great \"hack\" meant a practical joke; covering the campus dome in tin foil, for example. Among the nerdy members of the Model Railroad Club, a hack came to mean a feat of technical skill, a particularly sweet switching station or miniature drawbridge. As these young geeks moved from laying track to working with computers, training massive IBM mainframes to make music and play chess, they took this attitude and vernacular with them.\n\nRuining it for the rest of us\n\nThe word hacker began to mutate, like a quartet of teen turtles, during the late 1980s and early 1990s. What had been a compliment among programmers and engineers became a byword for cyber-crime. Hollywood played a big role: films like WarGames and the eponymous Hackers made the word synonymous with mischief and mayhem.\n\nThe laws that sprung up to combat the rising tide of cyber-crime followed suit. \"Hacking is breaking into computer systems, frequently with intentions to alter or modify existing settings,\" according to the National Conference of State Legislators. \"Sometimes malicious in nature, these break-ins may cause damage or disruption to computer systems or networks.\"\n\nA Google Trends chart of the period between 2004 and today shows the prevalence of hacking in the press isn't just anecdotal, news coverage of hacking over the last three years has grown by leaps and bounds. Some of this coverage has been about real hacking. The attacks that penetrated Google's systems in China and caused the search giant to pull it business out of the country. The infiltrators who stole sensitive data from hundreds of thousands of Sony customers. And the hack-tavism by Anonymous and Lulzsec that defaced websites of major governments and corporations.\n\nvia Google Trends\n\nBut just as often hackers have been convenient boogeymen. For example it turned out to be Rep. Anthony Weiner, not a hacker, who posted a photo of the congressman's package to Twitter. When Pfc. Bradley Manning was arrested for passing classified military documents to Wikileaks, publications like Wired and CNN speculated Pfc. Manning had learned the dark arts from MIT students he partied with at a hack spaces in Boston. The banal truth was that an angry young man with access to information downloaded sensitive files and burned them to a CD. Writing Lady Gaga on the disc was a nice bit of misdirection, but hacking it was not.\n\nThe sad reality is that cyber-crime is on the rise. And in fact News Corp has engaged in computer hacking. As The New York Times recently pointed out, the company paid $29.5 million back in 2009 to settle charges that it hacked into the computer system of New Jersey based company called Floorgraphics and stole information for a smear campaign that cost the the small advertising company several major clients. There were no 9/11 victims involved, no celebrities or young murder victims, and so the story went largely untold. Hell, the head of U.S. cyber-security, Randy Vickers, resigned on Monday in the aftermath of hacking assaults on the Senate, FBI and CIA websites. Yet only the only major publications to carry the story so far have been foreign outlets, Reuters and The Guardian.\n\nHackers are like Jedi, wielding mysterious powers that enable them to peer into the private lives of normal folks. Just as there are Jedis on the light and dark side, so hackers are divided into white and black hat, a porous boundary which contributes to confusion around the term. Before he built computers, Steve Jobs and his partner Woz built blue bloxes that helped phone phreakers hack their way to free long distance calls. And the most widely known and admired young entrepreneur of this generation, Mark Zuckerberg, has dark hacking in his DNA. He didn't ask for permission when he took the names and faces of his classmates and put them together into Facemash, an early experiment at Harvard that nearly got him expelled.\n\nBut when Zuckerberg sat down earlier this year with Leslie Stahl for a 60 minutes interview, he tried to explain to her that Facebook was strictly white hat. \"The graffiti is largely gone,\" Stahl said to Zuckerberg, during her tour Facebook's fancy new offices, \"except for one word, you just can't miss. I see hack everywhere. Hack! It has a negative connotation, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"When we say hacker, there is this whole definition that engineers have for themselves, it's very much a compliment,\" said Zuckerberg. \"To hack means to build something very quickly. In one night you can sit down and churn out a lot of code and at the end you have a product. Hackathons are these things where all of the Facebook engineer get together and stay up all night building things, and I do too, usually I code alongside everyone.\"\n\nZuckerberg's comment highlights an interesting divide. \"The word now has two branches, the one used among computer progammers and the one used in the media,\" said author Stevy Levy, whose 1984 book Hackers, first introduced the term to the mainstream.\" On one hand it means \"to create\"; on the other \"to steal.\"\n\n\"There was a time when hacker had lost almost all of it positive connotation,\" said Mr. Levy, who wrote in the update to the 2005 edition of his book that he considered dropping the word altogether. \"But the community seems to have really reclaimed it for themselves, and that has spread, to the point where people talk about hacking healthcare or hacking education, and they mean working to make it better.\"\n\nComments\n\n\"But typing the default password \"1111\" into the voicemail box of a murdered girl is not hacking.\" \u2014 I understand this to be precisely the definition of hacking. A \"hack\" was originally (and still is) a journalist who turned out copy of low quality; a \"hacker\" was a person who would attempt to gain access to computer systems by guessing passwords, manually or otherwise.\n\nThe original \"hack\" was actually someone who makes furniture with an axe, as in \"hack together\" or make something work without much sophistication. Using a phonebook to balance a crooked table is an oft-cited example of the prototypical hack.\n\nOver time, clever hacks began to be appreciated by amateur engineers, as distinguished from ugly hacks. So, perhaps, balancing a crooked table with varying thicknesses of nylon on each leg, allowing it to now slide across the floor without marring the floor would be considered an elegant or clever hack as opposed to simply cutting off the legs until they weren't crooked anymore.\n\nSo while a case can be made that guessing passwords to someone's voicemail box is a way of \"hacking together\" a way of getting in, it certainly isn't elegant and in fact requires all the brainpower and morality of a juvenile gang member half-braindead from too much coke, and therefore is certainly the lowliest of hacks if it even qualifies as a hack.\n\nIf Kevin Mitnick were to truly hack into people's voicemails, he would probably do so in a way that was nearly impossible to detect, wouldn't interfere with a police investigation (unless that was his motive), and would give him further access into interesting parts of the system, because a true hacker is a person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system. This acquiring of knowledge is very distinct from the messy destruction most \"hackers\" who make headlines cause.\n\nThe second half of the hacker ethic is \"commit no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.\" Most people who are part of the hacking community respect this.\n\nIt does not always have a positive meaning within programming (doing something quickly rather than thinking it through). 'Hacking something together' rather than designing it properly. Providing a 'hack' rather than a proper fix. Zuckerberg might be happy to get something demonstrated quickly, but over time some of those hacks might just come back to bite him in the ass.\n\nThere is an argument for designing versus hacking, but if you're a programmer you'll agree that the best code is written out of inspiration, regardless of whether it was designed first or not. In other words, you can design an elegant system, but you can't actually design elegant code; moreso you should meditate on the design and allow that flash of insight to come to you that solves all problems simultaneously with maximum efficiency. That's the sign of an elegant hack and is why the word has its positive, revered meaning.\n\nPeople are so fucking dumb. Most people confuse the terms \"cracker\" and \"hacker\". Lulzsec is a group of \"crackers\". Read the Hacker manifesto and you will see they are the opposite of the connotation. People who finds flaws in things to see how they work and can improve them\u2026\n\nmoney pools in the accounts of boomers who have little technical skill. a younger generation desires those resources. so they will abuse the term to create a phantom enemy so that they may play the white knight protecting your online business. but don't we all sort of suspect that this is what has been all about the whole time? kids with skills creating demand for their own market. you plugged an ex criminal in this post and his coming book. Its all business. so away with your lofty venture into semantics as if this was art.\n\nIt's unfortunate that despite your knowledge of how journalists ruin the word \"hacker,\" you still use that word to describe criminals in this article. Journalists would do everyone a favor if they said \"criminal\" or \"thief\" when they meant criminal or thief, and \"hacker\" when they meant someone who exhibited one of the definitions of hacker: \n\nRemember, hacker is supposed to be an honorific. If they are honorable but also a criminal, then you can say \"malicious hacker\" to distinguish properly.\n\nI disagree. As many of you have noted, cracker has been offered up as an alternative, but that word never got traction with the mainstream media. I could switch to using cracker all the time as some kind of linguistic statement, but I think that would be futile.\n\nI also don't think there is no such thing as a criminal hacker. A hacker in my opinion \u2013 and I don't claim to have the ultimate definition, just a few weeks of research \u2013 is someone who applies technical and creative skill to a project.\n\nAt MIT this first meant a good practical joke, then a good model railroad builder, then a good programmer. The common valence these days is for CS folks, but plenty of the members of NYC resistor think of themselves as hackers, despite working in other fields.\n\nSo I would say hacker is a word I will use, but be careful to qualify. And I will fight against those who use it carelessly, to refer to criminals who fail the Model Railroad Club test \u2013 no technical or creative skill.\n\nThere were a lot of other things that I wanted in the piece that ended up on the cutting room floor, but hopefully this discussion can continue on Twitter, Google+ and in the comments.\n\nSeveral years ago, in a similar article, the author suggested the term \"cracker\" for criminal hackers. A \"hacker\" is really anyone who hacks things together\u2013i.e., whips it up from whatever comes to hand\u2013and is not restricted to the realm of digital technology. Like the fellow who uses baling wire to repair his outboard motor\u2013that sort of thing. Computer hackers were people who had enough programming knowledge to create or alter subroutines on the fly. They were the original IT people. It's sad that the press couldn't come up with their own term for criminal computer activity, but etymological dictionaries are replete with examples of this sort of usurpation.\n\nThank goodness for this article, the incorrect use of the word hacking is my biggest pet peeve, and i normally don't have pet peeves. I totally agree with all that you have said and I am pretty sure i agree with your point of view."}

They can break any type of security of your system has. Hacking is an Art as well as a Skill. Either hacker use his skill in crime or against the crime. Ethical Hacking means penetration testing which is focused on Securing and Protecting IT Systems. Ethical hackers use their knowledge for checking security weakness of systems and take steps to improve its security.

White hat hackers find security vulnerabilities in networks and websites. Then they report these vulnerabilities to the company and help them to secure their network or website. These hackers are also called white hat hackers. Black Hat Hacker - Criminal Hackers Black Hat hackers are criminal hackers. They always use their hacking skills to harm companies. They try to intrude in network and website to steal data and deface website. Grey Hat Hacker - Sometimes good and sometimes criminal These hackers are neither criminal nor good hackers. They can be seen has professional hackers who only work for those who hire them. They never care whether the work is for good cause or bad cause. Ethical Hackers are white hat hackers"}
{"text": "Sega Gets Hacked Too, Customer Data Stolen\n\nIt appears that yet another gaming company has come under online attack resulting in the theft of user data. This time it's Sega and its Sega Pass system. No one has claimed responsibility for this attack yet, but most observers are pointing the finger at LulzSec.\n\nSega has pulled the system offline and has not indicated when it might return. According to the statement sent out by Sony to users, \"... a subset of SEGA Pass members emails addresses, dates of birth and encrypted passwords were obtained.\" Sega stressed that no passwords were stored in plain text. No payment information was obtained in the hack.\n\nWhile the Internet is pretty convinced it was LulzSec, the group posted on its Twitter feed saying, \"@Sega - contact us. We want to help you destroy the hackers that attacked you. We love the Dreamcast, these people are going down.\" Do you think this rash of data breeches will slow down, of is this the new normal?\n\nPrison rape is illegal. You're defeating the logic of your own stance by advocating illegal actions because of your anger at illegal actions. This is exactly what Anonymous does. So unless you are silent or approving of Anonymous then you are being hypocritical.\n\nThis does seem to be an ongoing trend, and even if these guys get busted, and the other guys, and the other-other guys, it is just a matter of time before something bad happens on the internet again. I'll bet Xbox Live and Netflix are doubling down on their security measures, and if not, I'd bet they're the next to get attacked.\n\nIf they didn't claim responsibility for it then I don't think it was them ... I mean if they claim responsibility for attacking major government agencies then why wouldn't they brag about breaking into SEGAs stuff? I'm with them though, my dreamcast was one BAMF console! ;)\n\nHaha hackers destroying other hackers....... Riiiight. Is lulzsec an actual group or just one guy pretending to have friends? I think a person who messes up any website is a major tool. Anytime I hear of a hacker/hack/\"programmer\" talking tough on the internet it makes me want to punch them in the face. Actually that would be a sweet android app. Problem with some twat on a forum? Fire up your smartphone and punch them in the face!They didn't hack Minecraft, EVE or LoL, they DDoSed them. They even had a reason. The reason being they were asked to by their 'fans'. They hacked Bethesda and tried to get details about Skyrim by 'blackmailing' them, however they said they would be gentle becuase they enjoyed Call of Cthulu. Maybe their love for the Dreamcast outshines their love for Call of Cthulu. Maybe, given enough time, they would have hacked SEGA, they were just beaten to it and they want to take down whoever did it anyway. Who knows. They're assholes, but they're not morons.\n\nThe internet is hardly convinced it was LulzSec, as LulzSec have no reason to say it wasn't them. Why the hell would they take responsability for hacks like Sony and Senate.gov but not for SEGA?\n\nCrappy media outlets might think it was LulzSec, purely because 1. They only heard about LulzSec from someone else and actualy have no idea what it is, and 2. They do not check LulzSec's twitter. But other than that, I don't think anyone with a brain capable of producing individual thought is 'pretty convinced' that it was LulzSec."}
{"text": "There are only 10 kinds of people:\nThose who understand binary\nand those who don't!\n\nPosted 03 November 2003 - 06:18 PM\n\nI wished to revisit this subject in a civilized and direct manner; as I am curious as to the input of individuals on these forums. Dollars... yen... pounds... euros... whatever currency you trade in, hackers cost millions, perhaps even billions, per year. Today's high-tech buisness market relies on the speed with which computers and the internet allow the transfer of data. Perhaps they rely on it too much, as they find out \"WHEN HACKERS ATTACK\" (sorry, couldn't resist ) and they have no way in which to conduct thier buiness. To a corporation as large as Microsoft of McDonalds, or even Amazon or Ebay, a single day on the down can mean several million dollars of lost profits (especially for those that operate solely online)... multiply that by the number of corporations affected, and the results can be tremendous! As a programmer, I speak with \"wanna-be\" hackers on a daily basis... but not a one of them I know would venture to truly cause destruction... As a matter of fact, none have ever mentioned of truly hacking into any system, personal or otherwise. Most hackers are more interested in learning about the systems, wether it be in the hopes of creating a empire of thier own or simply by creating a system for thier own personal enjoyment. Saying that malicious hacking is a product of boredom is like saying that murder is a product of malnutrition. Bad parenting, shady morals, or good, ol' fashioned destructive tendancies are the causes of malicious hacking. There are plenty of other challenges that the PC presents. If you are a board young prodigy, try creating the next hit PC game... or maybe put Microsoft out to pasture with a superior OS or a wonderful and affordable office suite. Sure... these are VERY lofty ambitions... and that's the point, these are much higher and more fulfilling ambitions than hacking into Ebay and changing every other word of text to \"boob.\" Don't want to set your sites so high? You skills could always allow you to make a nice bit of extra cash setting up wireless networks for private individuals and small buisnesses; or spend your day creating groovy flash animations for NewGrounds. Not that ambitious? Well, you probably shouldn't try hacking anyway... but if you still need a deterrant; why don't you just spend all day creating \"nude patches\" for GTA or Tomb Raider? Not that tech saavy? There's ALWAYS porn and message boards... take your pick, I prefer the latter. My point is; there are lots of equally entertaining, accessible, and profitable diversions other than malicious hacking. Destructive hacking is brought on by the same teenage angst that causes vandalism and non-social drug and alchohol abuse... it is a lack of parenting and good social exposure that leaves teens without a proper outlet for thier frustrations. Parents spend too much time worrying about Johnny's grades and NOT enough time worrying about Johnny's emotional state. They never tried to teach Johnny what to do when his girlfriend says \"so long\", what to do when the world throws you a curveball. Parents... TEACH YOUR CHILDREN HOW TO CONSTRUCTIVELY DEAL WITH THIER ANGER AND FRUSTRATION! It will allow your children to live happier, healthier, and more successful lives as well as cause you ALOT less trouble in the long run!\n\n***************************************************\nThe Saxfiend (AKA \"SaxCatz\")\nsaxcatz@hotmail.com\nSaxophonist and Software Engineer (AKA \"Code Jockey\") \"What do you mean IF these walls could talk?\"\n***************************************************\n\nEveryone likes a smouldering and sexy glare from a diminutive scientist.\n\nPosted 03 November 2003 - 08:47 PM\n\nWell, I'd give my opinion again\u2026but I'm pretty sure it's been pretty well documented So I'll just reiterate that I think hackers are scum, who shouldn't be allowed to have a computer, let alone the internet, and leave it at that.\n\nShould they be punished? Yes, next question.\n\nIf you want the full argument\u2026and I do mean 'argument'\u2026then it's all in the other thread.\n\nApparantly, over on Exchristian.Net, they say that I'm \"probably the smartest person\" on UM....that is so cool...\n\nSo the point you're making is that hackers shouldn't waste their brains on topics like computer security but work on motivating projects like for example a word processor or something like excel. Put yourself in the head of the teenager, or remember when you were one, what was the thing that excites all teenagers ? If I remember well, it's being cool, a concept that people generally loose when they grow up. But for teenagers, writing a text processor is not \"cool\", hacking in a computer is cool. Listening to Mozart is not cool, listening to the latest rap hit is cool. So basically teenagers and adult live in two different worlds, conceptions are completely different.\n\nTo the question: should they be punished. Of course yes but in proportion to the consequences of their acts and their age. I can hardly imagine to hold a kid responsible on the same level as an adult because by nature kids are not as reponsible as adults (otherwise we would let them drive cars at 10 ).\n\nIt's always the same question and internet and hackers are just one side of it. For example if a 12 years old kid shots another one with his father gun, who is guilty ? The kid for stealing the gun and using it ? The father for not securing the access to the gun enough ? The society that lets people have guns so easily ?\n\nIn computers it's similar. Who is responsible for the loss of money ? The kid for hacking a server ? The server owner for not taking sufficient measures for protecting its server ? The parents for not monitoring their kid ?\n\nIn both cases, I feel that the kid isn't responsible because he doesn't have the maturity to be responsible. But then who is responsible ?To expand on it it's like a kids killing his brothers and sisters in cold blood then whoever claiming he was misunderstood...He should fry nomatterwhat.\n\nRavens KeepA forum for Classic D&D, AD&D and the upcoming Castles and Crusades.\n\nSoon it's over, all the dwarfs defeated\nThe silence of the caverns stand still\nOrcs took the command of the caves and depths\nThe darklord has reached his will ---Battlelore\n\nFill my mug, I just want to forget\nAll the troubles and fighting\nAnd the ghosts in my head --Battlelore\n\nI'm Simply repeating what I said in the last thread about this subject, here goes, lol.\n\nThe other day a hacker was acquitted because his lawyer claimed a Trojan Virus was placed onto his clients computer by ANOTHER hacker. But even though the law can prove where the hack was preformed from, they cannot prove who was sat at the keyboard at the time, or whether it was in fact caused by another hacker hacking the hackers computer (confusing I know, lol) So this has set a new president. Now hackers have a legal loophole with which to escape punishment for something they have done.\n\nAbout the Trojan Horse: Imagine a hacker sets up a Trojan Horse in your computers and hacks into many places using your computer as a getaway. Now imagine that the FBI traces the attacks back to your computer. Then you'll be happy to find an attorney to defend yourself and explain that it wasn't your fault. See it's not because people are charged that they're guilty, that's why there are courts of law.\n\nAbout kids not being responsible: What I'm saying is that they can't be held responsible on the same level as adults, that is the punishment must be much lighter.\n\nTalking about responsability, if someone with a mental handicap murders someone else, what should be his sentence ? Electric chair or mental hospital ? I would say mental hospital if he's not fully aware of his doings, the punishment only makes if the person understands he did something wrong. And I think it's good that the law generally agrees with that in evolved countries (ok may be perhaps excepted in Texas from what I've heared but well I'm not going to comment on Texas).\n\nEveryone likes a smouldering and sexy glare from a diminutive scientist.\n\nPosted 04 November 2003 - 09:15 AM\n\nIs this the correct time to point out that children are not insane? Nor, for that matter, are they stupid...which is what the opinion that 'they're not responsible', levied by extremely patronising adults, manages very well to imply.\n\nThe kids who are actually out there hacking (most of the ones I've encountered range from 15-19) are quite able to understand the concept of right and wrong, and are also able to understand that people are being hurt as a result of their actions...they simply don't care. What age do you think the people making all these killer viruses are, seven!?\n\nApparantly, over on Exchristian.Net, they say that I'm \"probably the smartest person\" on UM....that is so cool...\n\nAbout kids not being responsible: What I'm saying is that they can't be held responsible on the same level as adults, that is the punishment must be much lighter.\n\nSo, these 'young' kids, who have the ability to bypass complicated multitasking computer software that protects programs from military installations to oil companies and banks (just to name a few). You believe they have the ability and intelligence to get around military encrypted programs, and insert their own, which causes devastation, that these, amazingly gifted young ninos, shouldn't be prosecuted along with adults, when as its stated they are of legal age to be prosecuted? Well I for one am 30 and know my way around almost any computer, but I haven't the ability to comprehended how to bypass complicated programs. I think you not giving these 'children' enough credit for the abilities and intelligence they hold, and have the power to cause alot of trouble, considering almost everything is patched through computers. I wonder if you will feel the same way after one of these precious little 'children' hack into the bank where your money is 'safely' held, and wipes your banking details of the computer. Or puts your address onto a dept collecting agencies computer, and have you furniture removed in front of all your neighbours. Or puts a tag on your car, and the police pull you over for unpaid tickets (which have all been done by hackers). Lets see you smile and pat the wonderful little ninos on the head after you have personally been a victim of them! If they have the intelligence to commit the crime, then they should be treated with the same manner as one would treat any other crime. (Don't get me wrong, this sort of crime is pure adrenaline junkies, that know exactly what they are doing,) not all crime is so black and white as this!\n\nit's funny you ask me this question because I asked it to myself before posting my mail. I would be really pissed off if such a situation happened to me but I would stick to my principles, lighter punishment than for an adult (which doesn't mean no punishment). Being skilled and knowledgeable doesn't mean that you have the maturity to go along with it. I'm saying that about kids and suddenly I realize that it would apply perfectly well to military and their powerful weapons too. But well I guess it's easier for people to focus on a kid than on a powerful institution...\n\nKryso? I applaud your efforts....... However? I think you're beating your head against a wall.\n\nOne of the comments I found interesting in this thread was a reference to \"anti-virus\" Companies....... Those who produce the Software to fight the digusting, never-ending battle against this crud that has invaded the Internet...... would have nothing to produce, if \"hackers\" ceased their dirty work.\n\nAgain you use hacker as a generic term, Say that in 1 million hackers and cracker 5 are stupid enough to get caught, the public starts to get annoyed with computer savvy people, it doesn't matter whether they are good or bad they still get a blasting, The hackers gets pissed off because they spend all of their free time making YOU safe, from the crackers. The hackers are what make your firewalls, your antivirus software, your trojan horse detecters, they fix bugs in your software, so that crackers can't get the handhold, while they are busy making YOU safe, they are getting flamed but millions of user worldwide becuase of crackers who are intent on harming, do they get credit? NO. How about giving the hackers that do a good job in keeping YOU safe a round of applause for their efforts? I'm not saying praise the crackers, but praise hackers that do good, they are like the \"police\" force of the internet, but go relatively unnoticed by normal users. I myself find it frustrating everytime i mention myself as a hacker, to be blasted left right and centre because of something else someone else is doing. Don't hate the many because of a few. You can call me whatever you likeBlood Angel: For your information, I found the following in Merriam Webster:\n\nQUOTE\n\nMain Entry: hack\u00b7er Pronunciation: 'ha-k&r Function: noun Date: 14th century 1 : one that hacks 2 : a person who is inexperienced or unskilled at a particular activity <a tennis hacker> 3 : an expert at programming and solving problems with a computer 4 : a person who illegally gains access to and sometimes tampers with information in a computer system\n\nThe whole point of my boring and excessively long Reply is to advise that the \"general public\" is not familiar with \"cracker.\" I suggest you direct your efforts to educate the public, so computer dummies will realize the world has changed.

{"text": "Kaspersky says Apple needs to change its approach to updates and patches for its machines\n\nComputer security company Kaspersky Labs said that Apple is at least 10 years behind Microsoft when it comes to security.\n\nEugene Kaspersky, co-founder of Kaspersky Lab, discussed the security of both PCs and Macs at the Info Security 2012 event. He concluded that Apple's security is far behind Microsoft's, and that Apple will need to change its ways when it comes to updates and patches.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, Macs are becoming increasingly targeted by malware due to increased Mac sales. In Q2 2012, Apple sold 4 million Macs, which was a 7 percent boost from Q2 2011. Cyber criminals are starting to notice that these computers are becoming more popular and are easy targets for malware attacks.\n\nEarlier this month, Apple finally admitted that its machines have been prone to malware problems. It has had issues with Flashback trojan, also known as Flashfake. This particular trojan disguises itself as an install Java applet on hijacked sites, and when users approve it, the trojan runs a piece of code that exploits a flaw in Java to remove OS X's anti-malware abilities. It also installs alternative control programs, turning the machines into bots.\n\n\"Apple is now entering the same world as Microsoft has been in for more than 10 years: updates, security patches and so on,\" said Kaspersky. \"We now expect to see more and more because cyber criminals learn from success and this was the first successful one.\n\n\"They will understand very soon that they have the same problems Microsoft had ten or 12 years ago. They will have to make changes in terms of the cycle of updates and so on and will be forced to invest more into their security audits for the software. That's what Microsoft did in the past after so many incidents like Blaster and the more complicated worms that infected millions of computers in a short time. They had to do a lot of work to check the code to find mistakes and vulnerabilities. Now it's time for Apple [to do that].\"\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, Flashback infected about 600,000 machines worldwide (approximately 3,000 in the U.S.) at its peak where 98 percent of these machines were Macs.\n\n\"I think they are ten years behind Microsoft in terms of security,\" said Kasperskya) boot up another O/S to check the usual hooks/entry points. b) upload suspicious stuff to virustotal for scanning (copy it to a thumbdrive and use another computer to do the uploading if you think the virus is that devious).\n\nThat is such a stupid comment!! I suppose if you're not sick now you don't need healthcare insurance either. Or how about your car isn't in an accident now so you don't need auto insurance either. Don't use condoms either if you don't have an STD. Man, you're dumb!\n\nWholeheartedly agree. For this reason it is highly irresponsible for Apple to promote their OS as impenetrable. People stupid enough to believe it are even more likely to behave in a less security conscious manner.\n\nquote: ...it is highly irresponsible for Apple to promote their OS as impenetrable\n\nI'm no attorney but couldn't this be considered a false claim by Apple such that it could be vulnerable to a class action? Enough people lose enough money doing online banking, etc, with using their unprotected Macs and serious life changing financial losses could precipitate angry litigants.\n\nI think you are exaggerating the claims that Apple has made. I don't think they've ever come out and said \"you don't have to worry about viruses on OS X.\" They've merely spoke in half truths about there being more viruses on Windows and Windows being less secure because of that fact. It's BS marketing speak but not lawsuit worthy.\n\nActually, Apple's advertisement was, \"Mac doesn't get PC viruses \". Apple has never said anything about Mac not getting any viruses, just that they don't get any PC viruses.\n\nAlthough that is borderline false advertisement, technically they haven't advertised anything that's not true (other than it being magical). That's why I think Apple marketing team have some of the smartest, most devious people on Earth.\n\nWhile technically it is a PC, their advertising ads over the years have been an attempt to tell users that they are in fact not. Hence the \"I'm a PC, and I'm a Mac,\" implying that there is a difference. If your same ads attempt to advertise that you don't get PC viruses, I don't see any problem because they've clearly stated at the beginning that they are not the same.\n\nIf Apple claims that a Mac doesn't get PC viruses... but marketshare analysts like Canalys lump the iPad into the PC world to say Apple has a huge presence in the PC Market, then can you infer that an iPad should get PC viruses? lol\n\nEven that is untrue, macro viruses don't care about little things like operating system or processor architecture. As long as you have a program that can run the macro (like MS Office), it will gladly bring chaos, strife, and ruin. It is also possible to create viruses that execute outside the OS, sorta like a hypervisor, so if said Mac user loads his copy of Boot Camp, gets infected, his OS X stuff gets infected too. It might be possible with such a virus to throw in a second version of the code for multiplying via OS X and Linux and you got a multi-platform virus.\n\nquote: Honestly if you get any virus, on any OS, it is most likely your own fault...\n\nTrue but that's no excuse for relying on anonymity for security. MS doesn't sit on their laurels and tell people they're at fault for being infected. The UAC, malicious software removal tool and hell they even made their own anti-virus program Security Essentials.\n\nApple doesn't rely solely on anonymity for security . Depending on your security preferences you can be asked to type your password before software is allowed to be installed. This is something that I've suggested to MS at every level of beta since Windows Vista. They aren't nearly as vigilant as MS but they haven't had to be. There flat out just aren't nearly as many viruses written for OS X.\n\nlol that's been a standard practice in Linux OS's from as far back as I can remember. I would hardly call that advancing desktop security on Apple's part.\n\nquote: This is something that I've suggested to MS at every level of beta since Windows Vista.\n\nNo offense but I'm glad they have ignored your suggestion. Why on Earth would you want to remember, and type, a password frequently when you can just click a UAC prompt to achieve the same goal?\n\nThe UAC is even better because the Unix/Linux password method ONLY functions when YOU take an action. There is no active safeguard against something attempting to gain root access behind your back. UAC on the other hand will notify you when any attempt to gain root/system access takes place. Also a little known fact, but when the UAC prompt pops up and the screen dims, Windows enters a \"secure desktop\" mode where NO program can run until you make your choice.\n\nAlso your suggestion is a bit redundant because you actually CAN make the UAC also function with password. However a good suggestion would be to make this process a bit easier and intuitive to the end user, I agree.\n\nquote: lol that's been a standard practice in Linux OS's from as far back as I can remember. I would hardly call that advancing desktop security on Apple's part.\n\nI didn't say they were advancing security just that they don't completely ignore it.\n\nquote: No offense but I'm glad they have ignored your suggestion. Why on Earth would you want to remember, and type, a password frequently when you can just click a UAC prompt to achieve the same goal?\n\nNone taken. It would obviously be an option, not a requirement. I think requiring a password in the \"UAC state\" is more secure. Imagine a scenario where I leave my laptop unattended for some unknown reason. Guy comes over, pops in his flash drive, and installs a malicious program. Password prompt inside UAC stops that from happening. I think this style of attack is called the \"evil maid\" attack.\n\nquote: Also your suggestion is a bit redundant because you actually CAN make the UAC also function with password. However a good suggestion would be to make this process a bit easier and intuitive to the end user, I agree.\n\nWasn't even aware of that. That should be much easier to enable or disable. Why isn't it right next to the UAC slider??\n\nquote: That should be much easier to enable or disable. Why isn't it right next to the UAC slider??\n\nAg\n\nAlso from a customer support view, I'm sure not requiring a password cut out some millions of calls from people who can't install something because they \"forgot\" their password lol.\n\nquote: I think requiring a password in the \"UAC state\" is more secure.

I do web apps (CRM/ERP) and I cannot tell you how many times I get emails about forgotten passwords. How?!? Perhaps that is why Microsoft hid it.\n\nquote: NowI can't say how widespread that style of attack is but I can say that I've neither worked nor consulted for a company that enabled the UAC password. I didn't even know it existed.\n\nquote: That should be much easier to enable or disable. Why isn't it right next to the UAC slider?\n\nWhy should they put some redundant slider when this functionality already works 100%? Just use your PC under user account, not under admin account, and evil maid will always fail. Why? 'Cause if you're under user account Windows always asks for password whenever UAC prompt comes up. See, MS is actually much smarter than you think.\n\nAllot of the people that buy Macs buy them because of the form factor (Mac Air) or the exclusive persona they think that it gives them. They also think that viruses are something that only Windows PCs get, so they will click on any prompt and download, because Macs don't get viruses do they?\n\nThe problem with that approach (and MS is guilty of this too) is that the assumption is that you are only installing software if it is attempting to put it in a common area of the system, like the Applications folder on Mac, or the Program Files folder on Windows. Both systems are still perfectly happy to run unsigned, unverified code in user-owned folders, like the desktop or your Documents folder. I know that even code signing doesn't prevent malware (the bad guys could get a certificate too), but the idea that requiring a password (or even a UAC prompt) to install software will prevent malware from being installed is just plain false.\n\nGoogle Chrome is a great example of an application that runs out of user-owned folders. At least on Windows, anyway, it installs for each user and doesn't attempt to put anything into the Program Files folder. So it technically never requires a UAC prompt. I haven't investigated how it does it on the Mac, but the same thing applies... it could run out of a folder that is owned by the current user and no permission would ever be required to install it that way.\n\nBoth Windows and OS X are vulnerable here. Neither one has come up with a magic solution to prevent this.\n\nBut that doesn't matter because without Administrator elevation, nothing can effect your system anyway no matter what folder it's trying to run out of.\n\nquote: but the idea that requiring a password (or even a UAC prompt) to install software will prevent malware from being installed is just plain false.\n\nThis is correct. However in reality it doesn't matter, again. It can install, sure. But unless you're using the Administrator as a USER account (extremely bad practice), the software will still require UAC confirmation to ACCESS and alter system files etc etc.\n\nthat isn't true. I work in enterprise IT. I have seen a number of valid sites, with non-adult content, that had been compromised by hackers. In fact they don't even need to hack the site itself, but rather the ad servers. Most sites these days allow \"foriegn\" content to run in the paid ad areas of their site. Most ads are \"active\" in tht they have some kind of scripting or programmatic content which has executeablity. If hackers can simply modify the ad's code base they can make it download malicious code. There was a well known sports website last year that had some infected ads. Myspace was also notorious for this.\n\nIn all seriousness, Macs do not get viruses. Nor does Linux. Nor does any commercial UNIX. They never have and they never will.\n\nWindows is the only OS plagued by viruses.\n\nNote that I'm using the word virus. A virus is self propagating, and does not require user intervention or social engineering.\n\nApple's recent malware has all been Trojans. A Trojan relies solely on social engineering to spread and infect. It convinces the user that it is something legitimate, and fools them into installing it.\n\nA Trojan is a very different thing than a Virus.\n\nIf I make a Windows batch file that contains \"format c:\" and I email it to you, and say hey, run this awesome new game! And you run it and it formats your c drive. That's a trojan. It is not a technical deficiency in your OS. It's a simple scam. I've tricked you. It's social engineering.\n\nSo yes, a Mac is susceptible to social engineering. Just like Windows is. The big difference however, is that a Mac (and Linux and UNIX) does not, and will not ever get viruses.\n\nIf you make a batch file that containts format c: it will fail. Windows doesn't allow you to format a system disk anymore, and hasn't for over 12 years.\n\nBut since you're using the narrow definition of the word \"Virus\" go ahead and name the last major virus outbreak on Windows computers. I mean, you know *so* much about this subject.\n\nUnless you don't, which is actually the case. Modern outbreaks (using the narrow Virus definition) are almost non-existent now because most infections are hybrids of *multiple* definitions for malicious software, or any kind of software that is designed with malicious intent in mind. A single piece of malware can use any number of techniques including self-replication, social engineering, etc. But since you haven't used anything but Linux or OSX since...ever, I imagine you don't actually know a damn thing about security and are just yanking crap off Wikipedia and pretending.\n\nSurely you are aware that the first virus was on UNIX. There have, in fact, been many computer viruses on UNIX. All operating systems that communicate with other operating systems are vulnerable. No exceptions.\n\nquote: In all seriousness, Macs do not get viruses. Nor does Linux. Nor does any commercial UNIX. They never have and they never will. Windows is the only OS plagued by viruses.\n\nA computer virus is any \"app\" that can spread itself (typically without user consent). As such, your statement above is bunk. It has been a very long time since windows users have seen the kind of viruses that would attach themselves to EXEs and spread through that method. On the other hand, network spreadable viruses are an issue on windows. E-mail spreadable viruses are even worse.\n\nIf you think Mac OS or Linux are free from network/e-mail spreadable viruses you are either deluded or uninformed. They are just as vulnerable as any OS if an exploit is found (which they have been, many times on Mac and Linux).\n\nYes, trojans tend to be more of an issue because people are easy to trick. And trojans don't require sophistication, although more than \"format c:\" is required. But computer viruses, in the original sense of the word still exist and can affect all platforms.\n\nIf anything, Mac is more safe because of the low numbers of Macs. It is difficult to spread when you can't find the next host to jump to.\n\nApple Zealot: My Apple system got a virus! Apple: Lies! You don't get them! You are holding it wrong! Apple Zealot: Oh! Ok! Thanks Apple, you are the best! <frolics through the rainbow tulips where unicorns are grazing>\n\nWith the rise in hacking related instruments : ATMs, Mobile Phones, iPODs and so on [saw that on this course  on WizIQ] companies like Kasperesky are going to reap big benefits for sure. Its a sure stock to bet on.\n\nIn news broken by Fosspatents and Reuters, Apple CEO Tim Cook and and Samsun CEO Choi Gee-sung have agreed to meet in mid-May to discuss a settlement in the patent infringement case that Apple brought against Samsung and its like of Galaxy smartphones and tablets. \n\nApple is now entering the same world as Microsoft has been in for more than 10 years. We now expect to see more and more because cyber criminals learn from success and this was the first successful one \n\nThe 600,000+ Macs that have been infected by Flashback have had more than an infinite number of times more viruses on them than my Windows PCs ever have. I've never had a single virus on any of my Windows PCs, ever. I keep anti-virus software on them just to be sure, but I've never seen a single infection.\n\nIt's all about keeping software up-to-date and watching what you click on. It really isn't that hard to stay clean"}

{"text": "One of the essays in FP's 21 Solutions to Save the World package that has attracted the most attention online is Mikko Hypp\u00f6nen's solution for preventing the growing problem of online banking fraud, specifically the \"phishing\" technique of luring trusting users to fake bank websites and then stealing their information. Hypp\u00f6nen proposes to create a special Web domain just for banks, and make securing such a domain so costly and difficult that only genuine banks would be able to obtain one. I asked Hypp\u00f6nen, who is chief research officer at F-Secure, to respond to critics of his idea. Here is his response.\n\nHypp\u00f6nen: We've been pushing for an initiative to get a secure top-level domain (like \".bank\" or \".safe\") for some time now.

{"text": "Schneier on Security\n\nSeptember 2008 Archives\n\nHow to Clone and Modify E-Passports\n\nThe Hackers Choice has released a tool allowing people to clone and modify electronic passports.\n\nThe problem is self-signed certificates.\n\nA CA is not a great solution:\n\nUsing a Certification Authority (CA) could solve the attack but at the same time introduces a new set of attack vectors:\n\nThe CA becomes a single point of failure. It becomes the juicy/high-value target for the attacker. Single point of failures are not good. Attractive targets are not good.\n\nAny person with access to the CA key can undetectably fake passports. Direct attacks, virus, misplacing the key by accident (the UK government is good at this!) or bribery are just a few ways of getting the CA key.\n\nThe single CA would need to be trusted by all governments. This is not practical as this means that passports would no longer be a national matter.\n\nMultiple CA's would not work either. Any country could use its own CA to create a valid passport of any other country. Read this sentence again: Country A can create a passport data set of Country B and sign it with Country A's CA key. The terminal will validate and display the information as data from Country B.This option also multiplies the number of 'juicy' targets. It makes it also more likely for a CA key to leak.\n\nRevocation lists for certificates only work when a leak/loss is detected. In most cases it will not be detected.\n\nSo what's the solution? We know that humans are good at Border Control. In the end they protected us well for the last 120 years. We also know that humans are good at pattern matching and image recognition. Humans also do an excellent job 'assessing' the person and not just the passport. Take the human part away and passport security falls apart.\n\nFriday Squid Blogging: International Squid Cookbook\n\nYour Own Personal Robot Voyeur\n\nSpykee is your own personal robot spy. It takes pictures and movies that you can watch on the Internet in real time or save for later. You can even talk with whoever you're spying on via Skype. More here, and you can buy one here: only $300.\n\n$20M Cameras at New York's Freedom Tower are Pretty Sophisticated\n\nIf you have ever wondered how security guards can possibly keep an unfailingly vigilant watch on every single one of dozens of television monitors, each depicting a different scene, the answer seems to be (as you suspected): they can't.\n\nInstead, they can now rely on computers to constantly analyze the patterns, sizes, speeds, angles and motion picked up by the camera and determine -- based on how they have been programmed -- whether this constitutes a possible threat. In which case, the computer alerts the security guard whose own eyes may have been momentarily diverted. Or shut.\n\nAn alarm can be raised, for instance, if the computer discerns a vehicle that has been standing still for too long (say, a van in the drop-off lane of an airport terminal) or a person who is loitering while everyone else is in motion. By the same token, it will spot the individual who is moving rapidly while everyone else is shuffling along. It can spot a package that has been left behind and identify which figure in the crowd abandoned it. Or pinpoint the individual who is moving the wrong way down a one-way corridor.\n\nBecause one person's \"abnormal situation\" is another person's \"hot dog vendor attracting a small crowd,\" the computers can be programmed to discern between times of the day and days of the week.\n\nSarah Palin's E-Mail\n\nPeople have been asking me to comment about Sarah Palin's Yahoo e-mail account being hacked. I've already written about the security problems with \"secret questions\" back in 2005:\n\nThe point of all these questions is the same: a backup password. If you forget your password, the secret question can verify your identity so you can choose another password or have the site e-mail your current password to you. It's a great idea from a customer service perspective -- a user is less likely to forget his first pet's name than some random password -- but terrible for security. The answer to the secret question is much easier to guess than a good password, and the information is much more public. (I'll bet the name of my family's first pet is in some database somewhere.) And even worse, everybody seems to use the same series of secret questions.\n\nThe result is the normal security protocol (passwords) falls back to a much less secure protocol (secret questions). And the security of the entire system suffers.\n\nThe Two Classes of Airport Contraband\n\nAirport security found a jar of pasta sauce in my luggage last month. It was a 6-ounce jar, above the limit; the official confiscated it, because allowing it on the airplane with me would have been too dangerous. And to demonstrate how dangerous he really thought that jar was, he blithely tossed it in a nearby bin of similar liquid bottles and sent me on my way.\n\nThere are two classes of contraband at airport security checkpoints: the class that will get you in trouble if you try to bring it on an airplane, and the class that will cheerily be taken away from you if you try to bring it on an airplane. This difference is important: Making security screeners confiscate anything from that second class is a waste of time. All it does is harm innocents; it doesn't stop terrorists at all.\n\nLet me explain. If you're caught at airport security with a bomb or a gun, the screeners aren't just going to take it away from you. They're going to call the police, and you're going to be stuck for a few hours answering a lot of awkward questions. You may be arrested, and you'll almost certainly miss your flight. At best, you're going to have a very unpleasant day.\n\nThis is why articles about how screeners don't catch every -- or even amajority -- of guns and bombs that go through the checkpoints don't bother me. The screeners don't have to be perfect; they just have to be good enough. No terrorist is going to base his plot on getting a gun through airport security if there's a decent chance of getting caught, because the consequences of getting caught are too great.\n\nContrast that with a terrorist plot that requires a 12-ounce bottle of liquid. There's no evidence that the London liquid bombers actually had a workable plot, but assume for the moment they did. If some copycat terrorists try to bring their liquid bomb through airport security and the screeners catch them -- like they caught me with my bottle of pasta sauce -- the terrorists can simply try again. They can try again and again. They can keep trying until they succeed. Because there are no consequences to trying and failing, the screeners have to be 100 percent effective. Even if they slip up one in a hundred times, the plot can succeed.\n\nThe same is true for knitting needles, pocketknives, scissors, corkscrews, cigarette lighters and whatever else the airport screeners are confiscating this week. If there's no consequence to getting caught with it, then confiscating it only hurts innocent people. At best, it mildly annoys the terrorists.\n\nTo fix this, airport security has to make a choice. If something is dangerous, treat it as dangerous and treat anyone who tries to bring it on as potentially dangerous. If it's not dangerous, then stop trying to keep it off airplanes. Trying to have it both ways just distracts the screeners from actually making us safer.\n\nIndia Using Brain Scans to Prove Guilt in Court\n\nThe technologies, generally regarded as promising but unproved, have yet to be widely accepted as evidence -- except in India, where in recent years judges have begun to admit brain scans. But it was only in June, in a murder case in Pune, in Maharashtra State, that a judge explicitly cited a scan as proof that the suspect's brain held \"experiential knowledge\" about the crime that only the killer could possess, sentencing her to life in prison.\n\n[...]\n\nThis latest Indian attempt at getting past criminals -- defenses begins with an electroencephalogram, or EEG, in which electrodes are placed on the head to measure electrical waves. The suspect sits in silence, eyes shut. An investigator reads aloud details of the crime -- as prosecutors see it -- and the resulting brain images are processed using software built in Bangalore.\n\nThe software tries to detect whether, when the crime's details are recited, the brain lights up in specific regions -- the areas that, according to the technology's inventors, show measurable changes when experiences are relived, their smells and sounds summoned back to consciousness. The inventors of the technology claim the system can distinguish between people's memories of events they witnessed and between deeds they committed.\n\nEDITED TO ADD (10/13): An expert committee said it is unscientific, but their findings weren't accepted.\n\nFriday Squid Blogging: Dissecting a Giant Squid\n\nAmong other dissection highlights, Hochberg pulled out plastic-like pieces, which comprised what could be best described as a backbone, as well as a translucent brownish-yellow piece of the beak, which is made of fingernail-like material. The giant squid's anatomy features a mouth at the top of the head, which means the esophagus travels through the brain. \"So you have to get very small chunks of food,\" said Hochberg, \"or you'll blow your brains out.\" The sharp beaks, then, are used to chomp food into tiny pieces before sending it down the esophagus, through the brain, and into the gut.\n\nTSA Employees Bypassing Airport Screening\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration (TSA) rolled out the new uniforms and new screening policy at airports nationwide on Sept. 11.\n\nThe new policy says screeners can arrive for work and walk behind security lines without any of their belongings examined or X-rayed.\n\n\"Lunch or a bomb, you can walk right through with it,\" said Mike Boyd, an aviation consultant in Evergreen. \"This is a major security issue.\"\n\nActually, it's not. Screeners have to go in and out of security all the time as they work. Yes, they can smuggle things in and out of the airport. But you have to remember that the airport screeners are trusted insiders for the system: there are a zillion ways they could break airport security.\n\nThe Pentagon's World of Warcraft Movie-Plot Threat\n\nIn a presentation that rivals any of my movie-plot threat contest entries, a Pentagon researcher is worried that terrorists might plot using World of Warcraft:\n\nIn a presentation late last week at the Director of National Intelligence Open Source Conference in Washington, Dr. Dwight Toavs, a professor at the Pentagon-funded National Defense University, gave a bit of a primer on virtual worlds to an audience largely ignorant about what happens in these online spaces. Then he launched into a scenario, to demonstrate how a meatspace plot might be hidden by in-game chatter.\n\nIn it, two World of Warcraft players discuss a raid on the \"White Keep\" inside the \"Stonetalon Mountains.\" The major objective is to set off a \"Dragon Fire spell\" inside, and make off with \"110 Gold and 234 Silver\" in treasure. \"No one will dance there for a hundred years after this spell is cast,\" one player, \"war_monger,\" crows.\n\nExcept, in this case, the White Keep is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. \"Dragon Fire\" is an unconventional weapon. And \"110 Gold and 234 Silver\" tells the plotters how to align the game's map with one of Washington, D.C.\n\nI don't know why he thinks that the terrorists will use World of Warcraft and not some other online world. Or Facebook. Or Usenet. Or a chat room. Or e-mail. Or the telephone. I don't even know why the particular form of communication is in any way important.\n\nThe article ends with this nice paragraph:\n\nSteven Aftergood, the Federation of the American Scientists analyst who's been following the intelligence community for years, wonders how realistic these sorts of scenarios are, really. \"This concern is out there. But it has to be viewed in context. It's the job of intelligence agencies to anticipate threats and counter them. With that orientation, they're always going to give more weight to a particular scenario than an objective analysis would allow,\" he tells Danger Room. \"Could terrorists use Second Life? Sure, they can use anything. But is it a significant augmentation? That's not obvious. It's a scenario that an intelligence officer is duty-bound to consider. That's all.\"\n\nMy guess is still that some clever Pentagon researchers have figured out how to play World of Warcraft on the job, and they're not giving that perk up anytime soon.\n\nThe NSA Teams Up with the Chinese Government to Limit Internet AnonymityThis is being sold as a way to go after the bad guys, but it won't help. Here's Steve Bellovin on that issue:\n\nFirst, very few attacks these days use spoofed source addresses; the real IP address already tells you where the attack is coming from. Second, in case of a DDoS attack, there are too many sources; you can't do anything with the information. Third, the machine attacking you is almost certainly someone else's hacked machine and tracking them down (and getting them to clean it up) is itself time-consuming.\n\nTraceBack is most useful in monitoring the activities of large masses of people. But of course, that's why the Chinese and the NSA are so interested in this proposal in the first place.\n\nIt's hard to figure out what the endgame is; the U.N. doesn't have the authority to impose Internet standards on anyone. In any case, this idea is counter to the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19: \"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\" In the U.S., it's counter to the First Amendment, which has long permitted anonymous speech. On the other hand, basic human and constitutional rights have been jettisoned left and right in the years after 9/11; why should this be any different?\n\nBut when the Chinese government and the NSA get together to enhance their ability to spy on us all, you have to wonder what's gone wrong with the world.\n\nNSA Snooping on Cell Phone Calls\n\nA recent article in the London Review of Books revealed that a number of private companies now sell off-the-shelf data-mining solutions to government spies interested in analyzing mobile-phone calling records and real-time location information. These companies include ThorpeGlen, VASTech, Kommlabs, and Aqsacom--all of which sell \"passive probing\" data-mining services to governments around the world.\n\nThorpeGlen, a U.K.-based firm, offers intelligence analysts a graphical interface to the company's mobile-phone location and call-record data-mining software. Want to determine a suspect's \"community of interest\"? Easy. Want to learn if a single person is swapping SIM cards or throwing away phones (yet still hanging out in the same physical location)? No problem.\n\nIn a Web demo (PDF) (mirrored here) to potential customers back in May, ThorpeGlen's vice president of global sales showed off the company's tools by mining a dataset of a single week's worth of call data from 50 million users in Indonesia, which it has crunched in order to try and discover small anti-social groups that only call each other.\n\nGPS Spoofing\n\nJon used a desktop computer attached to a GPS satellite simulator to create a fake GPS signal. Portable GPS satellite simulators can fit in the trunk of a car, and are often used for testing. They are available as commercial off-the-shelf products. You can also rent them for less than $1K a week -- peanuts to anyone thinking of hijacking a cargo truck and selling stolen goods.\n\nIn his first experiments, Jon placed his desktop computer and GPS satellite simulator in the cab of his small truck, and powered them off an inverter. The VAT used a second truck as the victim cargo truck. \"With this setup,\" Jon said, \"we were able to spoof the GPS receiver from about 30 feet away. If our equipment could broadcast a stronger signal, or if we had purchased stronger signal amplifiers, we certainly could have spoofed over a greater distance.\"\n\nDuring later experiments, Jon and the VAT were able to easily achieve much greater GPS spoofing ranges. They spoofed GPS signals at ranges over three quarters of a mile. \"The farthest distance we achieved was 4586 feet, at Los Alamos,\" said Jon. \"When you radiate an RF signal, you ideally want line of sight, but in this case we were walking around buildings and near power lines. We really had a lot of obstruction in the way. It surprised us.\" An attacker could drive within a half mile of the victim truck, and still override the truck's GPS signals.\n\nFear of Terrorism Could Cause Psychosomatic Epidemic\n\nUK Ministry of Defense Loses Memory Stick with Military Secrets\n\nThe USB stick, outlining training for 70 soldiers from the 3rd Battalion, Yorkshire Regiment, was found on the floor of The Beach in Newquay in May.\n\nTimes, locations and travel and accommodation details for the troops were included in files on the device.\n\nIt's not the first time:\n\nMore than 120 USB memory sticks, some containing secret information, have been lost or stolen from the Ministry of Defence since 2004, it was reported earlier this year.\n\nSome 26 of those disappeared this year == including three which contained information classified as \"secret\", and 19 which were \"restricted\".\n\nI've written about this general problem before: we're storing ever more data in ever smaller devices.\n\nThe point is that it's now amazingly easy to lose an enormous amount of information. Twenty years ago, someone could break into my office and copy every customer file, every piece of correspondence, everything about my professional life. Today, all he has to do is steal my computer. Or my portable backup drive. Or my small stack of DVD backups. Furthermore, he could sneak into my office and copy all this data, and I'd never know it.\n\nChange Your Name and Avoid the TSA Watchlist\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security wrote a letter to Labb&eacuteNew Book: Schneier on Security\n\nI have a new book coming out: Schneier on Security.

The squid's beak is one of the hardest organic substances in existence -- such that the sharp point can slice through a fish or whale like a Ginsu knife. Yet the beak is attached to squid flesh that itself is the texture of jello. How precisely does a gelatinous animal safely wield such a razor-sharp weapon? Why doesn't it just sort of, y'know, rip off? It's as if you tried to carve a roast with a knife that doesn't have a handle: It would cut into your fingers as much as the roast.\n\nThe Doghouse: Tornado Plus Encrypted USB Drive\n\nMy first discussion was with a sales guy. I asked about the encryption method. He didn't know. I asked about how the key was protected. Again, no idea. I began to suspect that this was not the person I needed to speak with, and I asked for a \"technical\" person. After a short wait, another sales guy got on the phone. He knew a little more. For example, the encryption method is to XOR the key with the data. Those of you in the security profession know my reaction to this news. For those of you still coming up to speed, XORing a key with data to encrypt sensitive information is bad. Very bad.\n\nEDITED TO ADD (9/13): In the comment thread, there's a lot of talk about one-time pads. This is something I wrote on the topic in 2002:\n\nSo, let me summarize. One-time pads are useless for all but very specialized applications, primarily historical and non-computer. And almost any system that uses a one-time pad is insecure. It will claim to use a one-time pad, but actually use a two-time pad (oops). Or it will claim to use a one-time pad, but actually use a stream cipher. Or it will use a one-time pad, but won't deal with message re-synchronization and re-transmission attacks. Or it will ignore message authentication, and be susceptible to bit-flipping attacks and the like. Or it will fall prey to keystream reuse attacks. Etc., etc., etc.\n\nCost/Benefit of Terrorism Security\n\nSandler and his colleagues conducted an analysis of the costs and benefits of five different approaches to combating terrorism. I must warn you that, because of the dearth of information, this study is even more reliant on assumptions than usual. Even so, in three cases the cost of the action so far exceeds the benefits that doubts about the reliability of the estimates recede.\n\nBecause the loss of life is so low, they measure the benefits of successful counter-terrorism measures in terms of loss of gross domestic product avoided. Trouble is, terrorism does little to disrupt economic growth, as even September 11 demonstrated.\n\nUsing the case of the US, Sandler estimates that simply continuing the present measures involves costs exceeding benefits by a factor of at least 10. Adopting additional defensive measures (such as stepping up security at valuable targets) would, at best, entail costs 3.5 times the benefits. Taking more pro-active measures (such as invading Afghanistan) would have costs at least eight times the benefits.\n\nAccording to Sandler, only greater international co-operation, or adopting more sensitive foreign policies to project a more positive image abroad, could produce benefits greater than their (minimal) costs.\n\nWhat's that? You don't care what it costs because no one can put a value on saving a human life? Heard of opportunity cost? Taxpayers' money we waste on excessive counter-terrorism measures is money we can't spend reducing the gap between white and indigenous health -- or, if that doesn't appeal, on buying Olympic medals.\n\nTurning off Fire Hydrants in the Name of Terrorism\n\nHe explains all the district's hydrants, including those in Alexander Ranch, have had their water turned off since just after 9/11 -- something a trade association spokesman tells us is common practice for rural systems.\n\n\"These hydrants need to be cut off in a way to prevent vandalism or any kind of terrorist activity, including something in the water lines,\" Hodges said.\n\nBut Hodges says fire departments know, or should have known, the water valves can be turned back on with a tool.\n\nOne, fires are much more common than terrorism -- keeping fire hydrants on makes much more sense than turning them off. Two, what sort of terrorism is possible using working fire hydrants? Three, if the water valves can be \"turned back on with a tool,\" how does turning them off prevent fire-hydrant-related terrorism?\n\nMore and more, it seems as if public officials in this country have simply gone insane.\n\nDNA Matching and the Birthday Paradox\n\nIs it possible that the F.B.I. is right about the statistics it cites, and that there could be 122 nine-out-of-13 matches in Arizona's database?\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, the answer turns out to be yes. Let's say that the chance of any two individuals matching at any one locus is 7.5 percent. In reality, the frequency of a match varies from locus to locus, but I think 7.5 percent is pretty reasonable. For instance, with a 7.5 percent chance of matching at each locus, the chance that any 2 random people would match at all 13 loci is about 1 in 400 trillion. If you choose exactly 9 loci for 2 random people, the chance that they will match all 9 is 1 in 13 billion. Those are the sorts of numbers the F.B.I. tosses around, I think.\n\nSo under these same assumptions, how many pairs would we expect to find matching on at least 9 of 13 loci in the Arizona database? Remarkably, about 100. If you start with 65,000 people and do a pairwise match of all of them, you are actually making over 2 billion separate comparisons (65,000 * 64,999/2). And if you aren't just looking for a match on 9 specific loci, but rather on any 9 of 13 loci, then for each of those pairs of people there are over 700 different combinations that are being searched.\n\nSo all told, you end up doing about 1.4 trillion searches! If 1 in 13 billion searches yields a positive match as noted above, this leads to roughly 100 expected matches on 9 of 13 loci in a database the size of Arizona's. (The way I did the calculations, I am allowing for 2 individuals to match on different sets of loci; so to get 100 different pairs of people who match, I need a match rate of slightly higher than 7.5 percent per locus.)\n\nMythbusters Episode on RFID Security Nixed\n\nSeems that the idea waskilledbylawyers under pressure from the credit card industry. Or maybe not; the person who started this rumor has retracted his comments. Or maybe those same lawyers made him retract his comments.\n\nDon't they know that security by gag order never works, except temporarily?\n\nSecret Military Technology\n\nOn 60 Minutes, in an interview with Scott Pelley, reporter Bob Woodward claimed that the U.S. military has a new secret technique that's so revolutionary, it's on par with the tank and the airplane:\n\nWoodward: This is very sensitive and very top secret, but there are secret operational capabilities that have been developed by the military to locate, target, and kill leaders of al Qaeda in Iraq, insurgent leaders, renegade militia leaders, that is one of the true breakthroughs.\n\nPelley: What are we talking about here? Some kind of surveillance, some kind of targeted way of taking out just the people that you're looking for, the leadership of the enemy?\n\n[...]\n\nWoodward: It is the stuff of which military novels are written.\n\nPelley: Do you mean to say that this special capability is such an advance in military technique and technology that it reminds you of the advent of the tank and the airplane?\n\nI'm going to make a wager about what I think Woodward is talking about, and I'll be curious to see what Danger Room readers have to say. I believe he is talking about the much ballyhooed (in defense geek circles) \"Tagging, Tracking and Locating\" program; here's a briefing on it from Special Operations Command. These are newfangled technologies designed to track people from long distances, without the targeted people realizing they are being tracked. That can theoretically include thermal signatures, or some sort of \"taggant\" placed on a person. Think Will Smith in Enemy of the State. Well, not so many cameras, maybe.Gait Analysis from Satellite\n\nBy analysing the movements of human shadows in aerial and satellite footage, JPL engineer Adrian Stoica says it should be possible to identify people from the way they walk -- a technique called gait analysis, whose power lies in the fact that a person's walking style is very hard to disguise.\n\nVideo taken from above shows only people's heads and shoulders, which makes measuring the characteristic length and rhythm of a person's stride impossible. That's not true of shadows, though, Stoica told a security conference in Edinburgh, UK, last month. Shadows, he says, provide enough gait data to deduce a positive ID. To prove it, he has written software that recognises human movement in aerial and satellite video footage. It isolates moving shadows and uses data on the time of day and the camera angle to correct shadows if they are elongated or foreshortened. Regular gait analysis is then applied to identify people. In tests on footage shot from the sixth floor of a building, Stoica says his software was indeed able to extract useful gait data.\n\nThe article goes on to say that using satellite images would be harder, but that the basic idea is the same.\n\nOf course, this is less useful for finding individuals and more useful for tracking a population as it moves about its day. But some individuals will have more distinctive gaits than others, and will be easier to track. Soon we may all need to walk with rocks in our shoes.\n\nIdentity FarmingCall it \"identity farming.\" You invent a handful of infants. You apply for Social Security numbers for them. Eventually, you open bank accounts for them, file tax returns for them, register them to vote, and apply for credit cards in their name. And now, 25 years later, you have a handful of identities ready and waiting for some real people to step into them.\n\nThere are some complications, of course. Maybe you need people to sign their name as parents -- or, at least, mothers. Maybe you need to doctors to fill out birth certificates. Maybe you need to fill out paperwork certifying that you're home-schooling these children. You'll certainly want to exercise their financial identity: depositing money into their bank accounts and withdrawing it from ATMs, using their credit cards and paying the bills, and so on. And you'll need to establish some sort of addresses for them, even if it is just a mail drop.\n\nYou won't be able to get driver's licenses or photo IDs in their name. That isn't critical, though; in the U.S., more than 20 million adult citizens don't have photo IDs. But other than that, I can't think of any reason why identity farming wouldn't work.\n\nHere's the real question: Do you actually have to show up for any part of your life?\n\nAgain, I made this all up. I have no evidence that anyone is actually doing this. It's not something a criminal organization is likely to do; twenty-five years is too distant a payoff horizon. The same logic holds true for terrorist organizations; it's not worth it. It might have been worth it to the KGB -- although perhaps harder to justify after the Soviet Union broke up in 1991 -- and might be an attractive option for existing intelligence adversaries like China.\n\nImmortals could also use this trick to self-perpetuate themselves, inventing their own children and gradually assuming their identity, then killing their parents off. They could even show up for their own driver's license photos, wearing a beard as the father and blue spiked hair as the son. I'm told this is a common idea in Highlander fan fiction.\n\nThe point isn't to create another movie plot threat, but to point out the central role that data has taken on in our lives. Previously, I've said that we all have a data shadow that follows us around, and that more and more institutions interact with our data shadows instead of with us. We only intersect with our data shadows once in a while -- when we apply for a driver's license or passport, for example -- and those interactions are authenticated by older, less-secure interactions. The rest of the world assumes that our photo IDs glue us to our data shadows, ignoring the rather flimsy connection between us and our plastic cards. (And, no, REAL-ID won't help.)\n\nIt seems to me that our data shadows are becoming increasingly distinct from us, almost with a life of their own. What's important now is our shadows; we're secondary. And as our society relies more and more on these shadows, we might even become unnecessary.\n\nBT, Phorm, and Me\n\nOver the past year I have gotten many requests, both public and private, to comment on the BT and Phorm incident.\n\nI was not involved with BT and Phorm, then or now. Everything I know about Phorm and BT's relationship with Phorm came from the same news articles you read. I have not gotten involved as an employee of BT. But anything I say is -- by definition -- said by a BT executive. That's not good.\n\nSo I'm sorry that I can't write about Phorm. But -- honestly -- lots of others have been giving their views on the issue.\n\nFriday Squid Blogging: Colossal Squid was a Lethargic Blob\n\n\"We are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre. As she got older she got shorter and broader and was reduced to a giant gelatinous blob, carrying many thousands of eggs,\" he says.\n\n\"Her shape was likely to have affected her behaviour and ability to hunt. I can't imagine her jetting herself around in the water at any great speed, and she was too gelatinous to have been a fighting machine.\n\n\"It's likely she was just blobbing around the seabed carrying her brood of eggs, living on dead fish, while her mate was off hunting.\"\n\nContest: Cory Doctorow's Cipher Wheel Rings\n\nCory Doctorow wanted a secret decoder wedding ring, and he asked me to help design it. I wanted something more than the standard secret decoder ring, so this is what I asked for: \"I want each wheel to be the alphabet, with each letter having either a dot above, a dot below, or no dot at all. The first wheel should have alternating above, none, below. The second wheel should be the repeating sequence of above, above, none, none, below, below. The third wheel should be the repeating sequence of above, above, above, none, none, none, below, below, below.\" (I know it sounds confusing, but here's a chart.)\n\nSo that's what he asked for, and that's what he got. And now it's time to create some cryptographic applications for the rings. Cory and I are holding an open contest for the cleverest application.\n\nI don't think we can invent any encryption algorithms that will survive computer analysis -- there's just not enough entropy in the system -- but we can come up with some clever pencil-and-paper ciphers that will serve them well if they're ever stuck back in time. And there are certainly other cryptographic uses for the rings.\n\nHere's a way to use the rings as a password mnemonic: First, choose a two-letter key. Align the three wheels according to the key. For example, if the key is \"EB\" for eBay, align the three wheels AEB. Take the common password \"PASSWORD\" and encrypt it. For each letter, find it on the top wheel. Count one letter to the left if there is a dot over the letter, and one letter to the right if there is a dot under it. Take that new letter and look at the letter below it (in the middle wheel). Count two letters to the left if there is a dot over it, and two letters to the right if there is a dot under it. Take that new letter (in the middle wheel), and look at the letter below it (in the lower wheel). Count three letters to the left if there is a dot over it, and three letters to the right if there is a dot under it. That's your encrypted letter. Do that with every letter to get your password.\n\n\"PASSWORD\" and the key \"EB\" becomes \"NXPPVVOF.\"\n\nIt's not very good; can anyone see why? (Ignore for now whether or not publishing this on a blog makes it no longer secure.)\n\nHow can I do that better? What else can we do with the rings? Can we incorporate other elements -- a deck of playing cards as in Solitaire, different-sized coins to make the system more secure?\n\nUsing Shredded Checks as Packaging Material\n\nPrivacy Policies: Perception vs. Reality\n\nNew paper: \"What Californians Understand About Privacy Online,\" by Chris Jay Hoofnagle and Jennifer King. From the abstract:\n\nA gulf exists between California consumers' understanding of online rules and common business practices. For instance, Californians who shop online believe that privacy policies prohibit third-party information sharing. A majority of Californians believes that privacy policies create the right to require a website to delete personal information upon request, a general right to sue for damages, a right to be informed of security breaches, a right to assistance if identity theft occurs, and a right to access and correct data.\n\nThese findings show that California consumers overvalue the mere fact that a website has a privacy policy, and assume that websites carrying the label have strong, default rules to protect personal data. In a way, consumers interpret \"privacy policy\" as a quality seal that denotes adherence to some set of standards. Website operators have little incentive to correct this misperception, thus limiting the ability of the market to produce outcomes consistent with consumers' expectations. Drawing upon earlier work, we conclude that because the term \"privacy policy\" has taken on a specific meaning in the minds of consumers, its use should be limited to contexts where businesses provide a set of protections that meet consumers' expectations.\n\nMovie-Plot Threats in the Guardian\n\nWe spend far more effort defending our countries against specific movie-plot threats, rather than the real, broad threats. In the US during the months after the 9/11 attacks, we feared terrorists with scuba gear, terrorists with crop dusters and terrorists contaminating our milk supply. Both the UK and the US fear terrorists with small bottles of liquid. Our imaginations run wild with vivid specific threats. Before long, we're envisioning an entire movie plot, without Bruce Willis saving the day. And we're scared.\n\nIt's not just terrorism; it's any rare risk in the news. The big fear in Canada right now, following a particularly gruesome incident, is random decapitations on intercity buses. In the US, fears of school shootings are much greater than the actual risks. In the UK, it's child predators. And people all over the world mistakenly fear flying more than driving. But the very definition of news is something that hardly ever happens. If an incident is in the news, we shouldn't worry about it. It's when something is so common that its no longer news - car crashes, domestic violence - that we should worry. But that's not the way people think.\n\nPsychologically, this makes sense. We are a species of storytellers. We have good imaginations and we respond more emotionally to stories than to data. We also judge the probability of something by how easy it is to imagine, so stories that are in the news feel more probable - and ominous - than stories that are not. As a result, we overreact to the rare risks we hear stories about, and fear specific plots more than general threats.\n\nThe problem with building security around specific targets and tactics is that its only effective if we happen to guess the plot correctly. If we spend billions defending the Underground and terrorists bomb a school instead, we've wasted our money. If we focus on the World Cup and terrorists attack Wimbledon, we've wasted our money.\n\nIt's this fetish-like focus on tactics that results in the security follies at airports. We ban guns and knives, and terrorists use box-cutters. We take away box-cutters and corkscrews, so they put explosives in their shoes. We screen shoes, so they use liquids. We take away liquids, and they're going to do something else. Or they'll ignore airplanes entirely and attack a school, church, theatre, stadium, shopping mall, airport terminal outside the security area, or any of the other places where people pack together tightly.\n\nThese are stupid games, so let's stop playing. Some high-profile targets deserve special attention and some tactics are worse than others. Airplanes are particularly important targets because they are national symbols and because a small bomb can kill everyone aboard. Seats of government are also symbolic, and therefore attractive, targets. But targets and tactics are interchangeable.\n\nThe following three things are true about terrorism. One, the number of potential terrorist targets is infinite. Two, the odds of the terrorists going after any one target is zero. And three, the cost to the terrorist of switching targets is zero.\n\nWe need to defend against the broad threat of terrorism, not against specific movie plots. Security is most effective when it doesn't require us to guess. We need to focus resources on intelligence and investigation: identifying terrorists, cutting off their funding and stopping them regardless of what their plans are. We need to focus resources on emergency response: lessening the impact of a terrorist attack, regardless of what it is. And we need to face the geopolitical consequences of our foreign policy.\n\nIn 2006, UK police arrested the liquid bombers not through diligent airport security, but through intelligence and investigation. It didn't matter what the bombers' target was. It didn't matter what their tactic was. They would have been arrested regardless. That's smart security. Now we confiscate liquids at airports, just in case another group happens to attack the exact same target in exactly the same way. That's just illogical.\n\nDiaries Written in Code\n\nSucking Data off of Cell Phones\n\nThere is a new electronic capture device that has been developed primarily for law enforcement, surveillance, and intelligence operations that is also available to the public. It is called the Cellular Seizure Investigation Stick, or CSI Stick as a clever acronym. It is manufactured by a company called Paraben, and is a self-contained module about the size of a BIC lighter. It plugs directly into most Motorola and Samsung cell phones to capture all data that they contain. More phones will be added to the list, including many from Nokia, RIM, LG and others, in the next generation, to be released shortly.\n\nSoftware to Facilitate Retail Tax Fraud\n\nThanks to a software program called a zapper, even technologically illiterate restaurant and store owners can siphon cash from computer cash registers and cheat tax officials.\n\n[...]\n\nZappers alter the electronic sales records in a cash register. To satisfy tax collectors, the tally of food orders, for example, must match the register's final cash total. To hide the removal of cash from the till, a crooked business owner has to erase the record of food orders equal to the amount of cash taken; otherwise, the imbalance is obvious to any auditor.\n\n[...]\n\nThe more sophisticated zappers are easy to use, according to several experts. A dialogue box, which shows the day's tally, pops up on the register's screen.\n\nIn a second dialogue box, the thief chooses to take a dollar amount or percentage of the till. The program then calculates which orders to erase to get close to the amount of cash the person wants to remove. Then it suggests how much cash to take, and it erases the entries from the books and a corresponding amount in orders, so the register balances.\n\nSecurity ROI\n\nReturn on investment, or ROI, is a big deal in business. Any business venture needs to demonstrate a positive return on investment, and a good one at that, in order to be viable.\n\nIt's become a bigdeal in IT security, too. Many corporate customers are demanding ROI models to demonstrate that a particular security investment pays off. And in response, vendors are providing ROI models that demonstrate how their particular security solution provides the best return on investment.\n\nBefore I get into the details, there's one point I have to make. \"ROI\" as used in a security context is inaccurate. Security is not an investment that provides a return, like a new factory or a financial instrument. It's an expense that, hopefully, pays for itself in cost savings. Security is about loss prevention, not about earnings. The term just doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nBut as anyone who has lived through a company's vicious end-of-year budget-slashing exercises knows, when you're trying to make your numbers, cutting costs is the same as increasing revenues. So while security can't produce ROI, loss prevention most certainly affects a company's bottom line.\n\nAnd a company should implement only security countermeasures that affect its bottom line positively. It shouldn't spend more on a security problem than the problem is worth. Conversely, it shouldn't ignore problems that are costing it money when there are cheaper mitigation alternatives. A smart company needs to approach security as it would any other business decision: costs versus benefits.\n\nThe classic methodology is called annualized loss expectancy (ALE), and it's straightforward. Calculate the cost of a security incident in both tangibles like time and money, and intangibles like reputation and competitive advantage. Multiply that by the chance the incident will occur in a year. That tells you how much you should spend to mitigate the risk. So, for example, if your store has a 10 percent chance of getting robbed and the cost of being robbed is $10,000, then you should spend $1,000 a year on security. Spend more than that, and you're wasting money. Spend less than that, and you're also wasting money.\n\nOf course, that $1,000 has to reduce the chance of being robbed to zero in order to be cost-effective. If a security measure cuts the chance of robbery by 40 percent -- to 6 percent a year -- then you should spend no more than $400 on it. If another security measure reduces it by 80 percent, it's worth $800. And if two security measures both reduce the chance of being robbed by 50 percent and one costs $300 and the other $700, the first one is worth it and the second isn't.\n\nThe Data Imperative\n\nThe key to making this work is good data; the term of art is \"actuarial tail.\" If you're doing an ALE analysis of a security camera at a convenience store, you need to know the crime rate in the store's neighborhood and maybe have some idea of how much cameras improve the odds of convincing criminals to rob another store instead. You need to know how much a robbery costs: in merchandise, in time and annoyance, in lost sales due to spooked patrons, in employee morale. You need to know how much not having the cameras costs in terms of employee morale; maybe you're having trouble hiring salespeople to work the night shift. With all that data, you can figure out if the cost of the camera is cheaper than the loss of revenue if you close the store at night -- assuming that the closed store won't get robbed as well. And then you can decide whether to install one.\n\nCybersecurity is considerably harder, because there just isn't enough good data. There aren't good crime rates for cyberspace, and we have a lot less data about how individual security countermeasures -- or specific configurations of countermeasures -- mitigate those risks. We don't even have data on incident costs.\n\nOne problem is that the threat moves too quickly. The characteristics of the things we're trying to prevent change so quickly that we can't accumulate data fast enough. By the time we get some data, there's a new threat model for which we don't have enough data. So we can't create ALE models.\n\nBut there's another problem, and it's that the math quickly falls apart when it comes to rare and expensive events. Imagine you calculate the cost -- reputational costs, loss of customers, etc. -- of having your company's name in the newspaper after an embarrassing cybersecurity event to be $20 million. Also assume that the odds are 1 in 10,000 of that happening in any one year. ALE says you should spend no more than $2,000 mitigating that risk.\n\nSo far, so good. But maybe your CFO thinks an incident would cost only $10 million. You can't argue, since we're just estimating. But he just cut your security budget in half. A vendor trying to sell you a product finds a Web analysis claiming that the odds of this happening are actually 1 in 1,000. Accept this new number, and suddenly a product costing 10 times as much is still a good investment.\n\nIt gets worse when you deal with even more rare and expensive events. Imagine you're in charge of terrorism mitigation at a chlorine plant. What's the cost to your company, in money and reputation, of a large and very deadly explosion? $100 million? $1 billion? $10 billion? And the odds: 1 in a hundred thousand, 1 in a million, 1 in 10 million? Depending on how you answer those two questions -- and any answer is really just a guess -- you can justify spending anywhere from $10 to $100,000 annually to mitigate that risk.\n\nOr take another example: airport security. Assume that all the new airport security measures increase the waiting time at airports by -- and I'm making this up -- 30 minutes per passenger. There were 760 million passenger boardings in the United States in 2007. This means that the extra waiting time at airports has cost us a collective 43,000 years of extra waiting time. Assume a 70-year life expectancy, and the increased waiting time has \"killed\" 620 people per year -- 930 if you calculate the numbers based on 16 hours of awake time per day. So the question is: If we did away with increased airport security, would the result be more people dead from terrorism or fewer?\n\nCaveat Emptor\n\nThis kind of thing is why most ROI models you get from security vendors are nonsense. Of course their model demonstrates that their product or service makes financial sense: They've jiggered the numbers so that they do.\n\nThis doesn't mean that ALE is useless, but it does mean you should 1) mistrust any analyses that come from people with an agenda and 2) use any results as a general guideline only. So when you get an ROI model from your vendor, take its framework and plug in your own numbers. Don't even show the vendor your improvements; it won't consider any changes that make its product or service less cost-effective to be an \"improvement.\" And use those results as a general guide, along with risk management and compliance analyses, when you're deciding what security products and services to buy.\n\nMy LA Times Op Ed on Photo ID Checks at Airport\n\nNo-fly lists and photo IDs are supposed to help protect the flying public from terrorists. Except that they don't work.\n\nBy Bruce Schneier\n\nAugust 28, 2008\n\nThe TSA is tightening its photo ID rules at airport security. Previously, people with expired IDs or who claimed to have lost their IDs were subjected to secondary screening. Then the Transportation Security Administration realized that meant someone on the government's no-fly list -- the list that is supposed to keep our planes safe from terrorists -- could just fly with no ID.\n\nNow, people without ID must also answer personal questions from their credit history to ascertain their identity. The TSA will keep records of who those ID-less people are, too, in case they're trying to probe the system.\n\nThis may seem like an improvement, except that the photo ID requirement is a joke. Anyone on the no-fly list can easily fly whenever he wants. Even worse, the whole concept of matching passenger names against a list of bad guys has negligible security value.\n\nHow to fly, even if you are on the no-fly list: Buy a ticket in some innocent person's name. At home, before your flight, check in online and print out your boarding pass. Then, save that web page as a PDF and use Adobe Acrobat to change the name on the boarding pass to your own. Print it again. At the airport, use the fake boarding pass and your valid ID to get through security. At the gate, use the real boarding pass in the fake name to board your flight.\n\nThe problem is that it is unverified passenger names that get checked against the no-fly list. At security checkpoints, the TSA just matches IDs to whatever is printed on the boarding passes. The airline checks boarding passes against tickets when people board the plane. But because no one checks ticketed names against IDs, the security breaks down.\n\nThis vulnerability isn't new. It isn't even subtle. I wrote about it in 2003, and again in 2006. I asked Kip Hawley, who runs the TSA, about it in 2007. Today, any terrorist smart enough to Google \"print your own boarding pass\" can bypass the no-fly list.\n\nThis gaping security hole would bother me more if the very idea of a no-fly list weren't so ineffective. The system is based on the faulty notion that the feds have this master list of terrorists, and all we have to do is keep the people on the list off the planes.\n\nThat's just not true. The no-fly list -- a list of people so dangerous they are not allowed to fly yet so innocent we can't arrest them -- and the less dangerous \"watch list\" contain a combined 1 million names representing the identities and aliases of an estimated 400,000 people. There aren't that many terrorists out there; if there were, we would be feeling their effects.\n\nAlmost all of the people stopped by the no-fly list are false positives. It catches innocents such as Ted Kennedy, whose name is similar to someone's on the list, and Yusuf Islam (formerly Cat Stevens), who was on the list but no one knew why.\n\nThe no-fly list is a Kafkaesque nightmare for the thousands of innocent Americans who are harassed and detained every time they fly. Put on the list by unidentified government officials, they can't get off. They can't challenge the TSA about their status or prove their innocence. (The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decided this month that no-fly passengers can sue the FBI, but that strategy hasn't been tried yet.)\n\nBut even if these lists were complete and accurate, they wouldn't work. Timothy McVeigh, the Unabomber, the D.C. snipers, the London subway bombers and most of the 9/11 terrorists weren't on any list before they committed their terrorist acts. And if a terrorist wants to know if he's on a list, the TSA has approved a convenient, $100 service that allows him to figure it out: the Clear program, which issues IDs to \"trusted travelers\" to speed them through security lines. Just apply for a Clear card; if you get one, you're not on the list.\n\nIn the end, the photo ID requirement is based on the myth that we can somehow correlate identity with intent. We can't. And instead of wasting money trying, we would be far safer as a nation if we invested in intelligence, investigation and emergency response -- security measures that aren't based on a guess about a terrorist target or tactic.\n\nThat's the TSA: Not doing the right things. Not even doing right the things it does."}

{"text": "Night of the living computers\n\nAs Halloween looms, zombies worm their way into our consciousness once more. But these days your traditional zombie has a rival \u2013 not exactly a clone, but a modern version with equally nasty habits.\n\nWhere the original zombie was said to be typically a reanimated corpse or a human being controlled by someone else by use of magic, today's computer version is controlled by cyber criminals who are usually after your bank, social network or webmail credentials.\n\nTraditional zombies originated in the West African spiritual belief system of voodoo, and became a popular device in modern horror fiction, largely because of the successful 1968 film Night of the Living Dead.\n\nFour decades later, we are still fighting zombies. The computer variety connects to the Internet after an innocent user's PC has being compromised by a hacker, computer virus or malicious software called a trojan. Usually, a compromised machine is one of many in a botnet, which will be used to perform malicious tasks of one sort or another under remote direction.\n\nMost zombie-infected computer owners are unaware that their system is being used in this way. This lack of awareness is why such computers are compared to traditional zombies.\n\nThe modern zombies have been growing in strength and power over recent times. The bad news for their victims is that today's industrialised hackers are demystifying two zombie myths: (1) zombies are uncoordinated, and (2) zombies are slow.\n\nWith just a few clicks, a hacker can issue command and controls (C&Cs) to waken a group of zombies. This group then becomes part of the attacker's 'botnet' \u2013 a cyber-army under his/her control. The attacker then issues different C&Cs to the botnet to perform the required cyber-attack.\n\nA major goal of these botnets is to probe Web application vulnerabilities and extract valuable data, such as:\n\nSocial network credentials to hijack a victim's profile and scrape their friend list and send out spam.\n\nWebmail account credentials to gain personal information on the individual for spear-phishing.\n\nThe bottom line is, beware of zombies because today's sophisticated hackers can conduct fully muscular attack campaigns, using a corporate 'dashboard' detailing attack movements and advancements, within an hour!\n\nHow do you fight a computer zombie? Avoid being the next victim, use common sense. If a link seems too good, don't click. Update your computer with the latest patches; and ensure your anti-virus software is always enabled and up-to-date.\n\nSo, safe computing for Halloween, plus the rest of the year. And watch out for those 'real' zombies!"}

{"text": "Tag Archives: ZXArps\n\nThis week's installment of what's-old-is-new-again in the world of malware comes from one of the many groups making and distributing phishing Trojans in China. Earlier this year, someone discovered a hacktool called ZXArps, and began distributing it in earnest as a payload from another malicious downloader.\n\nUnlike most malware we see these days, ZXArps (which dates back to 2006, and was discovered by the English-speaking security community the following year) isn't designed to perform a single task. It's more like a Swiss Army knife, giving its users a great deal of control over not only the computer on which it's running, but the immediate network environment in which that computer sits.\n\nIn essence, the tool is designed to inject specially-crafted data packets into the network, and some of those packets can manipulate the behavior of the infected computer as well as others on its network. In most networks, a router or gateway acts as a sort of traffic cop, directing information between computers on that network and other networks, and to/from the Internet. The power of ZXArps comes from its ability to impersonate that traffic cop, fooling the network into directing traffic wherever the malware-maker wishes.\n\nAnd in this case, infected PCs are directed to Web sites hosted in China which, when visited, infect the computer with even more malware. It's a nasty trick, and it works beautifully. Read on for its damage potential. Continue reading \u2192"}
{"text": "13 Greatest Hackers in History\n\nIn the hacking industry, guys can either be considered good or bad depending on the activities they participate in. There have been notorious hackers that have developed operating systems that really revolutionized the Internet, and there have been guys on the other end of the spectrum who hack into major companies, trying to make millions of dollars by obtaining information or software. Nonetheless, each of the men on this list are extremely talented and their abilities should be recognized\n\n12. |\n\nJohn Draper\n\nJohn Draper was known as a \"phone phreak\" because of his abilities to hack into phone lines and use pay phones free of charge by using a small plastic whistle. The whistle, when having one hole glued shut, induces a clear 2600 Hz tone, the exact sound telephone systems used to indicate a phone call was completed. This allowed him to conduct free long-distance calls since the phone system thought the call was over due to the tone from the whistle.\n\n11. |\n\nGordon Lyon\n\nGordon Lyon is referred to as \"Fyodor\" (the nickname came from a Russian author named Fyodor Dostoyevsky) on the Internet, and is considered one of the \"good\" hackers in the industry. He doesn't involve him self in crime, and is constantly attempting to enhance online security for the well-being of Internet users all over the world. In 1997, Lyon was responsible for developing the Nmap Security Scanner, which discovers hosts and various services on a given computer network. He also owns his own websites and business, has written several books and articles, and was the President of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility.\n\n10. |\n\nRobert Morris\n\nRobert Morris is known as the first hacker to release a worm virus into the digital world, eventually infecting over 6,000 computers owned by the military and various university computers across the country. His intent wasn't to harm any of these machines, but he tried gaining access to them, including federal government systems. After the last of the worm destruction was finished, the estimated worth of all the damage done was as high as $10 million. Luckily for Morris, he got off with just a $10,500 fine and 400 hours of community service.\n\n9. |\n\nTsutomu Shimomura\n\nTo be the best you have to beat the best, and Shimomura did just that. After having his computer hacked by infamous super-hacker Kevin Mitnick, Tsutomu decided to join the FBI in tracking his rival down. He finger-hacked his cellphone and listened in on calls at Capitol Hill while federal agents were overseeing him. Shimomura reportedly used a cellular frequency from an antenna on a laptop that allowed him to almost pinpoint Mitnick's position. Since then, books and movies have been produced from this thrilling story.\n\n8. |\n\nRichard Stallman\n\nRichard Stallman was the mind behind the free operating system named GNU. Millions of people use it today, and it's all because of Stallman and his movement to making operating systems entirely free. He was part of the MIT AI Lab, but quit it when he started focusing on his GNU project so that they couldn't claim any copyrights to the software. Stallman went on to earn eight awards including being elected into the United States National Academy of Engineering.\n\n7. |\n\nDouglas Engelbart\n\nMr. Engelbart is responsible for the computer mouse, computer video teleconferencing, hypermedia, email, the Internet, and windows, all of which are being used today. He had a lab at the Augmentation Research Center at the Stanford Research Institute where he participated in his cyberspace activities. Basically, without Engelbart, there would be no Internet hacking at all, so he could be considered the grandfather of it all.\n\n6. |\n\nAdrian Lamo\n\nAdrian Lamo may have the greatest resume in terms of major corporations that he was able to get information from. He broke into the computer networks of Microsoft, Yahoo!, Citigroup, Bank of America, Cingular, and The New York Times. He used to use Internet connections at local Kinkos or coffee shops to hack into company security systems, and would then inform the business of their security flaws.\n\n5. |\n\nKevin Poulson\n\nKevin Poulson was a well-rounded hacker, but he was known for his extraordinary telephone line hacking skills. He started his journey by reactivating aged Yellow Page escort phone numbers for one of his acquaintances who wanted to run a virtual escort agency. When he did this, as well as hack into the FBI database and federal computers, his name was the focus on NBC's Unsolved Mysteries. When he realized he was wanted, NBC's phone lines went down and were unusable. Coincidence? Poulson also used his amazing talents to hack into the phone lines of radio stations so he could undoubtedly make himself the qualified caller to win the prize, where he won a nice Porsche, as well as other prizes.\n\n4. |\n\nVladimir Levin\n\nVladimir is the stereotypical hacker, as he used his knowledge of the concept to gain access to a list of Citibank user codes and passwords. He used this information to transfer over $3.5 million via wire transferring to his group accounts in several countries. He was eventually caught and sent to prison, while having to repay Citibank over $200,000.\n\n3. |\n\nLinus Torvalds\n\nMuch like Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds developed an open-source operating system that is still in use today. Linus absolutely hated the operating system, MS-DOS, that was being used for Microsoft computers, so he started Linux, sent it to a few other programmers to tinker with and improve, and major companies took notice of its potential. Numerous companies started selling versions of Linux for their own benefit, becoming a huge breakthrough for computers.\n\n2. |\n\nJonathan James\n\nAs a 16-year-old kid, Jonathan James was enjoying the challenge of hacking and participating in activities no other kid his age had ever experienced before. Jonathan went big early, as he hacked into impressively large organizations like NASA and an agency of the Department of the Defense, Defense Threat Reduction Agency.\n\nFrom the latter, he only received usernames and passwords of some of the members in the organization and read through extremely confidential emails. Then came NASA, where he stole software that controlled the temperature of the physical environment inside the International Space Station. They were forced to power off the entire network because of the hacking done by Jonathan.\n\n1. |\n\nKevin Mitnick\n\nKevin Mitnick is the most well-known hacker to ever live, as well as the most feared because of what he was capable of. Highly touted as \"the most wanted computer criminal in United States history\" and \"the most dangerous hacker in the world,\" Mitnick went from a phone hacker into a full-out hacking menace. He used his cellphone to gain access to computers by touch-tone and voice control. At one point he was able to manipulate the Motorola network. He had to brach four thick layers of cyber security to get in, but e eventually did and had unlimited access to the company's internal network. He was capable of ultimately anything he wanted to get into, but he actually believed it was immoral and unethical, so he slowed down up until the point he got caught."}
{"text": "Attackers behind espionage software that infected Iranian computers targeted hard-to-exploit weaknesses in a cryptographic algorithm, a feat that allowed them to counterfeit a Microsoft digital credential, a member of the company's security team said.\n\nDetails of the \"cryptographic collision attack,\" which came in a blog post published Monday afternoon, are the latest testament to the skill and sophistication that went into engineering the Flame malware. While theoretical, collision exploits in real-world attacks are virtually unheard of. As a 2008 attack on the MD5 cryptographic algorithm demonstrated, collision attacks require huge amounts of computing power, even when exploiting decades-old hashing functions. To pull it off, researchers had to wield the power of 200 PlayStation 3 gaming consoles.\n\nCryptographic algorithms are used to transform words, documents, or computer files into ciphertext that can never be converted back to their original form. These hash functions are used to digitally sign e-mails, ensure documents haven't been tampered with, and verify that software and software updates available online originated with a particular person or group. The integrity of the entire system relies on each unique piece of plaintext generating a unique string of ciphertext. The ability for someone to find a collision, in which two different plaintext sources generate the same ciphertext, completely undermines the system, since it relies on the plaintext remaining secret and unique."}

This was done by changing the Domain Name System (DNS) settings on a computer to point towards malicious websites. In November last year an FBI investigation into the attacks led to six arrests in Estonia.\n\nThe threat surfaced in 2007 and the FBI says it could have infected more than 500,000 computers in the US alone. The criminals used DNS Changer to manipulate internet advertising, netting them \u00a314m in revenue. In its investigation the FBI found that in some cases system updates and anti-virus software stopped working, exposing infected computers to more threats.\n\nWhen the arrests took place, the FBI took control of the rogue DNS servers and removed the malicious software. The servers were left running in order to give users of infected computers time to remove the DNS Changer by changing DNS settings.\n\nTime is now running out for people to check and change their DNS settings if necessary.

It would seem that Anonymous is not quite done with Sony yet, announcing today that the PlayStation Network has yet again been infiltrated and its ten million accounts are at risk. The group boasts of a 50GB database of usernames and passwords.\n\nWhether real or not, incidents like this usually indicate a good time to update your details just to be as careful as you can. Folks are claiming the announcement (or rather, the hack being announced) is fake. Best to be safe than sorry, of course.\n\nAt the moment, the official PSN site says it's down for maintenance when attempting to log in.\n\nLike every other site on the planet, we've contacted Sony for more details.

We'll keep you in the loop regardless!\n\nWhen I read the title, I unwittingly blurted \"Oh my god...\" in a Togos. Why the hell would anyone get off to this? I guarantee there will be \"HAHAHA, serves Sony right for *stupid reason*\" comments in this post, too.\n\nI thought it was pretty much a given by now that nobody trusts Sony with any important information anyway.\n\nWell, it's Anonymous. 'They' can claim anything, because there is no 'they'. I mean, 'Anonymous' is anywhere between 1 and 6.9 billion people, all of whom are entirely anonymous. Anybody can claim they have done absolutely anything under the name 'Anonymous'.\n\nSo, they probably have hacked PSN. And they probably haven't. Someone or someones, who has(have) decided to call themselves Anonymous, has almost certainly, at some point, nicked a load of info off PSN. But there is no 'group' that's done it, nor can 'Anonymous' do anything with any infomation they have obtained. That would imply organistation, a hierarchy and claiming responsibility, none of which is compatible with anonymity.\n\n@djnealb & Andreas Neuhalfen\nThey're anonymous. There can't be any reason or organisation behind anything they do. If there was then they couldn't be anonymous. A complete lack of rationale and responsibility is inherent in the movement.\n\nUgh. Ya know, part of what's good about the Anon ideal is that they're an unregulated group of random individuals on the internet. There's no structure, there's no order, there's no leaders, there's on agenda. They do what they do. And when it comes to grey hat stuff like tracking down pedophiles who post on 4Chan and shutting down the NYPD in retaliation for police brutality, it's fucking awesome and I'm glad groups like that exist out there.\n\nWhen they go around attacking Sony for removing half assed Linux support from their console in order to make sure they can actually afford to continue supporting that console in the future, it's fucking childish and stupid.

That was likely the smartest business move that Sony and NIS could have ever made. They have too much to lose now,being one of the favorite games of many in their number.\nIt's better than using a human shield, granted the human shield was a adorable Japanese woman/girl.\n\nAs a result, no future PSN/SEN hacking/DDoS attack threat will be genuine again ever.\n\n\"All so they can rally around Geohot, some kid on the internet who wasn't hugged enough as a child and spends his days fucking with other people's money because he hasn't nothing better to do with his life. \"\n\nWTF???

{"text": "11, 2008\n\nApple hackers increasing\n\nHackers have started to pay greater attention to Apple devices as their popularity worldwide has expanded. Security experts claim that hackers have focused efforts towards the Windows platform because Microsoft has controlled more than 90 percent of the global market for years. This ensured hackers would have a wealth of targets to exploit.\n\nCameron Hotchkies, a Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) security analyst, believes Macintosh computers have been gaining market share and in the same process catching the interest of hackers. \"It has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in,\" said the security specialist. Hotchkiesis a part of a team devoted to studying programming holes and crafting \"patches\" to prevent hackers from exploiting weaknesses, specifically on Apple software.\n\nHotchkies noted that this year there was a spike in the number of DefCon attendees carrying Macintosh laptops. DefCon is an annual conference where specialists such as Hotchkies gatherer and hold sessions on weakness in todays electronics. It is also noteworthy that more than a thousand people crammed into his DefCon talk about hacking Apple software, a number far greater than seen in the past.\n\nAnother problem may be that developers who re-craft their software to work on a Mac, may not be capable of building security components as they are not familiar with platform. \"Windows developers take their code and make it work on Apple,\" Hotchkies said. This, in theory, is good for Macs as it brings familiarity to the OS for potential switchers. \"They [windows developers] could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform,\" explained Hotchkies.\n\nIt should be noted that regardless of similar claims over the last 2 years, no attacks have reached Mac OS X consumers. Several proof-of-concept attacks have been displayed, but these typically required users to consent to installation of a 'disguised' virus.\n\nYes, yes, we know Macs aren't exploit-proof, they're just exploit-resistant. Luckily resistance is not futile, especially when IE is still wearing the ActiveX underpants with the \"please exploit me\" label on the waistband.\n\nThere is nothing new here. What is the point of this article? The Mac is growing in popularity and there is a belief that hackers are now focusing on the Mac platform. Wow, I'm surprised I didn't get a CNN Newsflash on this!\n\nSeveral proof-of-concept attacks have been displayed, but these typically required users to consent to installation of a 'disguised' virus.\n\nHow many new Windows 'virus' are out there? From what I've seen, most either get through IE (which require plug-in installation which the user usually has to OK - and apparently do without thinking) or trojans (if it requires installation, its not a 'disguised virus', but a trojan).\n\nNumber of hackers use Macs, but doesn't mean they hack OSX. They typically boot into linux to hack windows. They use OSX for when they are surfing the web, etc. They use windows for games. All done on the same Mac, easily.\n\nLet me know when these so-called \"hackers\" are able to do something to my Mac without physically sitting in front of it with my admin password in hand. Honestly, the FUD is just retarded. Spend more time reporting the truth of the situation and less time spreading FUD.\n\nIs anyone else tired of that lame \"no one attacks Macs because there aren't enough of them.\" People - even .1% of the market is millions of machines. It's hard for me to imagine hackers sitting around saying, \"golly, let's not code a Mac virus, even though we would be incredibly famous for doing it, because it would only run on a small percentage of computers.\"\n\nDoofuses. And these so-called \"computer security experts\" are even bigger doofuses."}

(If you haven't seen this movie, stop now. The rest of this is spoilers.)\n\nIn that same scene is a bunch of incoherent drivel written in gratuitously and purposefully bad English grammar, which reminded me of almost every lamer and script kiddie I've run into. (e.g. \"u have tread on my domain and must now suffer who are u?\" and \"leave B 4 U R expunged\") I don't know whether to find that insulting, stupid, or funny.\n\nThen he hacks the sprinkler system in the school and sets it to test during morning classes to get back at the people who embarassed him the day before. This is obviously intended as a relation to the fiasco regarding the grading system in the New York Public School System in the late 1980s.\n\nMeanwhile, the head Secret Service guy, Richard Gill (he's a dick, get it?), is busy trying to get every bit of media attention he can. He doesn't know anything about computers, but tries to act like he's very clueful when confronted by a reporter. He rattles off the same speech again and again, every time the media interviews him. The media, of course, swallows it up without question. Sounds like the real U.S. Government and media.\n\nThe writer also made it a point to note that when the U.S. Government suspects someone, even if they don't charge them, they take their equipment and basically destroy it. You may or may not get it back later, but when you do, it's been gutted, wrecked, and probably has D.A.R.E. stickers all over it.\n\nOf course, the movie was undoubtably cheezy. I'd like to see a movie which slams the government, slams the average clueless idiot, and so on. Unfortunately, that wouldn't sell, so it will never be done.\n\nNevertheless, Hackers is a blatently hilarious movie that I highly recommend for those of us who have a clue. The clueless might watch it and be entertained, but the majority of the jokes and metaphors require a clue to recognize. That assumes that I'm not watching some blatently horrible film where the writer just happened to get lucky. I think it's more likely that either the writer was trying to make a point, or they had a technical consultant who took them for a ride.\n\nThe music isn't that bad either. I just wish I could find the song they were using in the movie trailers/promotions. I can think of a few fun things to do with it, a few other parts, and a video editor. And the soundtrack unfortunately didn't include all the songs in the movie, such as Grand Central Station which is the theme during the last part of the credits and during the hack of the Gibson."}

{"text": "DDoS\n\nDDoS attack though used criminally but is an intelligent technology. It has evolved with time and now follows the domain name and the IP address it points to. It is somehow a layered threat and hinders the access to the site in following different ways\n\nVulnerable Zoombies Attacks: A DDoS attack directs hundreds or even thousands of compromised \"zombie\" hosts against a single target. These zombies are unintentionally recruited from the millions of unprotected computers accessing the Internet through high-bandwidth or always-on connections. By planting \"sleeper\" codes on these machines, hackers can quickly build a legion of zombies, all waiting for the command to launch a DDoS attack. With enough zombie hosts participating, the volume of an attack can be astounding. DDoS Threats Over the last few years, attackers have refined their methods. As developers make software more reliable and more resilient to DoS, the attack vectors have changed to target hard-to-secure parts of a service.\n\nBandwidth and Traffic Bottlenecks: A server that has a bandwidth of 100 Mbit/s can easily be attacked by a DoS attack with a machine that has a little more bandwidth than this which will make it loss packets and finally will make it unusable. This creates bottle necks for other site surfers and will make the server itself dormant.\n\nSYN Attacks: SYN (synchronous) stacks are becoming frequent nowadays. This attack can prevent access to your mailbox, WWW and other critical servers. The SYN attack (sometimes referred as SYN flood attack) sends TCP connections requests faster than a machine can process them. The SYN attacker creates a random source address for each packet and sets the SYN flag in each packet. Victim responds to spoofed IP address, then waits for confirmation that never arrives. Victim's connection table fills up waiting for replies. After table fills up, all new connections and legitimate users are ignored. Once attacker stops flooding server, it usually goes back to normal state (SYN floods rarely crash servers).\n\nMaking Applications Flawed: DDoS attacks do not only attack over the network layer but the their inscrutable nature is that they even make the applications malfunctioning. This might also be achieved by deploying load-intensive WebPages"}
{"text": "Who the PlayStation Network Hack Really Affects\n\nThe external intrusion, as Sony is wont to refer to it, into the PlayStation Network is kind of a big deal. Straight from their Q&A about the situation, Sony confirms that there are 77 million accounts that could possibly have completely compromised data. All data from the profile, such as name, email, birthday and address, plus maybe more, is in the hands of those who hacked the network.\n\nSmooth move, Sony.\n\nThat said, they have finally announced that they have no evidence that credit card information had been gleaned. Unlike their personal data tables, they'd deigned to encrypt all of that. That hasn't stopped people from coming out of the woodwork to blame Sony's data leak for their own financial issues however. As other outlets have pointed out, that's possibly due to being on high alert for such things.\n\nHaving established that this \"intrusion\" is a big deal, the question then becomes is it really a Big Deal like many are making it out to be? If Sony's correct in stating that credit card data was safe from those pesky hackers, then it's more likely that a PSN user will drown in their bathtub than have financial repercussions stemming from this breach. In fact, considering that the chances of that data being out in the open is close to nil, it's more likely that a PSN user will do\u2026 anything rather than having financial repercussions.\n\nIn reality, the Big Deal that everyone seems to be concerning themselves with is almost a non-event for the average user. For a vast majority of people, all of that personal data that might now be out there in the aether could be found with a quick Google search. It's surprising the number of people who volunteer information to be shared publically. With just a name and a general location, a plethora of information can be dug up on just about anyone. If nothing else, the RealID incident with Blizzard taught us that.\n\nSo, having eliminated any real threat to the common folk, the repercussions fall almost entirely on Sony. Due to their mishandling of the situation, they have opened themselves up to various forms of litigation. A class-action lawsuit already brews on the horizon. Add to that that there's some speculation that storing personal data without encryption might land them in hot water in other ways as well.\n\nBut the week delay in notification and the very, very small chance that any issues arise from the theft have more or less put Sony's approval rating in the toilet. Yes, the service is free to the public, but that doesn't excuse the response time. It doesn't help that it happened the week that Portal 2, Mortal Kombat and SOCOM 4 hit shelves. All three require PSN connectivity for many of their functions. Given that it's been down this long, there's no doubt that it's hurt what might have otherwise been a phenomenal week for the PlayStation 3.\n\nAnd now that any trust they had previously garnered is gone, Sony will have to build it back up again in ways that this writer can't imagine. That, or they'll simply chalk it up as a loss and move on. Either way, this whole saga has been one huge tech no-no after another. Sony failed to encrypt, failed to inform and just overall failed to keep up their end of the bargain. Their response\u2014when it finally came\u2014seems appropriate and thoroughly researched. But it came too late.\n\nThere are many folks out there arguing that Sony isn't responsible for the attacks on their network; the real perpetrators are the criminals involved here. That isn't entirely untrue. Sony the company is hurt most of all by this action, with the consumers being factored in as a tangential factor. It's not about what those hackers will do with the information.\n\nWell if it's a hacker he hacked into their system, all while Sony was defending attack's from a hacking group. So how is it their fault please tell me?. So your'e basically saying if i hack the government it's the government's fault because they didn't stop me before i could hack into their system's, it's hacker's job to hack system's not Sony's fault not at all."}
{"text": "Is there such a thing as a \"Digital doomsday device\"?\n\nThe FBI decided they had to assault the Dotcom Compound in Australia with massive power, and speed because they believed that Kim Dotcom had a \"Digital Doomsday Device\" that would instantly erase servers around the world.\n\nMr Wormald said he was told by the FBI that Dotcom \"carried a device with him to delete servers around the world\". Earlier evidence stated no such device was ever found.\n\nMr Davison, who had called it a \"Doomsday\" device, was told the device could have been triggered in seconds from any computer, laptop or phone in the possession of about 20 people on the propertyBut honestly? Maybe not a doomsday device per say... but it depends how you define that. Similarly it is possible to cause solar flares which do emit large amounts of electromagnetism (consequentially - and often - disrupting radio waves and electronics).\n\nMy friend specialized in designing EMP weapons in the military but noted they usually require too much power and the yield is generally little (now a-day it takes quite a bit of punch to restart a single computer let alone a server farm). But should the right sort of power source be used to create a sustained/strong electromagnetic pulse, it may be possible (quite unlike most movies where EMPs do major damage... was sad to hear this).\n\nThere are, of course, more practical things. Like botnets to consider... plus as I noted in my security piece on IPv6 on my website, as IPv6 is adopted to a larger degree, so too will security technician's need to explore adequate protection for both home users and servers. As with any new technology, unless it is studied thoroughly and things like firewalls are ready for it (to guard against it and to provide support for it), there are a lot of inherent security risks (IPv6 has a bit of a problem with types of DDoS).So, you believe there could be a hand held switch(or a device that can send a signal) that, when pressed, could/would erase all of the selected servers(by that I mean all of the evidence of illegal activity on those servers) around the world?\n\nI mean, even EMP is only line-of-sight. There would be no way for an EMP to reach every selected server around the earthTrue... and no I don't know about the hand held switch. That I doubt. But I do think things can disrupt our technology as a whole, globally, all at once. Like something that causes a massive solar flare, or one caused by itself. But yeah, doomsday switch, not sure on that oneThere's no way a device like that would exist. You need a real person in front of a computer to manually remove data. Such a device if existed would have to be coded for that exact use. This isn't the X-Files hereCreating a virus or bot that talked to a command center waiting for instructions (such as removing files) is nothing new. All bots these days do it from Zeus, conficker, etc however those are installed manually or by infection\n\nDo I think he had this device on his servers? No\n\nNaming is doomsday just makes it sound scary and grab people's attention\n\nWhy is everyone over thinking this and talking about EMPs and calling this X-Files? If you have access to your own server, then all you have to do is create an executable that will reformat the hard disc. Here's one example.the\n\nAgreed. My main assumption was getting access, hence botnets or malicious code on said servers. But I maintain that I don't think a doomsday device is possible (with the exception of nuclear payload to the sun causing massive solar flares or *insert random scifi catastrophic event here*). But a doomsday device, one device that... on earth... can do this? I don't believe it.\n\nPlus that whole access argument is moot. To my knowledge no person or group has access to every server and/or administrative access to every device on earth. That's stupid.\n\nAlmost as dumb as the notion that \"the government monitors and controls everything.\" Come on. I have a network that isn't even connected to the internet as a whole I use for testing!\n\nI guess doomsday to me means something else. I'm talking about all electronics, including servers online and off, dead. Which will naturally occur the day the earth's magnetic polarity switches as a whole one day... man made or not. Geology class told me it'll occur in the distant future or something.... best scenario I can see is that it is FBI FEAR MONGERING.\n\nImpossible? What is your role in technology these days? You do realize that its not complicated to make some software that calls home at your desire times or have it setup to listen for instructions.\n\nWe dont know the extent of his reach into what exactly what his control over the the servers were afaik. With the amount of money he was making your guess is good as mine. To answer your question to do it is not hard, a small set of code and that listens or checks for instructions is not complicated\n\nOne thing I wil admit to, if the servers were taken off line fast enough data destruction of a hard drive takes a good amount of time to do a certain amount of wipes were the drives where the data is not recoverable.\n\nThat's true. Imagine if botnets/malicious code was shipped - for example - in server software/firmware, preinstalled and the attacker(s) had remote access to this (Stuxnet's possible deployment is coming to mind; realize I know that Stuxnet was designed for a very specific system, I mean in deployment only). Or forget shipping out with it from a manufacturer, just the basics of what GZ is saying: malicious code that somehow finds its way on the right systems worldwide. Botnets, malicious code, root keys, etc... if written to deliver a crippling payload could potentially be a big threat.\n\nIf you could somehow infect big enough systems or the right systems, GZ is right. It would be devastating. Tier 1 and 2 providers? Interrupt service/cripple the internet?\n\nI was saying unlikely because affecting that many systems to have the end result of a \"doomsday scenario\" is improbable. But possible? That's another story. Still... I have a tough time thinking of that as a \"doomsday scenario,\" but I do think it'll be very crippling to the internet.\n\nAgain that's part of the problem. How do you define a \"doomsday scenario,\" OP? Stopping electronics worldwide/crippling technology like that or just crippling the normal course of business on the internet? I think those two are very different... anyone else agreeDoomsday to their case, which sounds like it was already doomed from the start last I heard\n\nThe article is written in a way that doesn't say if they are talking about wiping the data from his servers or what. I didn't read it as wiping ALL of piracy records all over the world from all servers because that isn't possible. I read it from the standpoint of wiping all the servers he was using/accessing of piracy evidence"}

{"text": "The Enemy Within\n\nTwenty years ago, computers were bedeviled by hackers. These were savvy outlaws who used their deep knowledge of operating systems to invade, steal, and destroy, or sometimes just to tap into secure facilities and show off their skills. Hackers became heroes to a generation of teenagers, and had all sorts of motives, but their most distinctive trait was a tendency to show off.\n\nSome had truly malicious intent. In his 1989 best seller, The Cuckoo's Egg, Cliff Stoll told the story of his stubborn, virtually single-handed hunt for an elusive hacker in Germany who was using Stoll's computer system at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory as a portal to Defense Department computers. For many people, Stoll's book was the introduction to the netherworld of rarefied gamesmanship that defines computer security. Stoll's hacker never penetrated the most secret corners of the national-security net, and even relatively serious breaches like the one Stoll described were more nuisance than threat. But the individual hacker working as a spy or vandal has evolved into something more organized and menacing.\n\nAndre' M. DiMino, a computer sleuth who is part of the Conficker Cabal, is considered one of the world's foremost authorities on botnets. He stumbled into his avocation on a Monday morning a decade ago, when he discovered that over the weekend, someone had broken into the computer system he was administering for a small company in New Jersey. DiMino has an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering with an emphasis in computer science, but he has mostly taught himself up to his present level of expertise, which is extreme. At 45, he is a slender, affable idealist who keeps a small array of computers in an upstairs bedroom. When I stopped by to talk to him, he baked me pizza. His day job is doing computer forensics for law enforcement in Bergen County, New Jersey, but he has a kind of alter ego as what he calls a \"botnet hunter.\"\n\nBack when he discovered the weekend break-in, DiMino assumed at first that it was the work of a hacker, a vandal, or possibly a former employee, only to discover, based on an analysis of the IP (Internet Protocol) addresses of the incoming data, that his little computer network had been invaded by someone from Turkey or Ukraine. What would someone halfway around the planet want with the computer system of a small business-management firm in a New Jersey office park? Apparently, judging by what he found, his invader was in the business of selling pirated software, movies, and music. Needing large amounts of digital storage space to hide stolen inventory, the culprit seemed to have conducted an automated search over the Internet, looking worldwide for vulnerable systems with large amounts of unused disc space\u2014DiMino equates it to walking around rattling doorknobs, looking for one door left unlocked. DiMino's system fit the bill, so the crooks had dumped a huge bloc of data onto his discs. He erased the stash and locked the door that had allowed the pirates in. As far as the company was concerned, that solved the problem. No harm done. No need to call the police or investigate further.\n\nBut DiMino was intrigued. He reviewed the server logs for previous weeks and saw that this successful invasion was one of many such efforts. Other attackers had been rattling the doors of his network, looking for vulnerabilities. If there were bad guys actively exploiting other people's computers all over the world, designing sophisticated programs to exploit weaknesses \u2026 how cool was that? And who was trying to stop them?\n\nDiMino set about educating himself on the fine points of this obscure battle of wits. He eventually co-founded the Shadowserver Foundation, a nonprofit partnership of defense-minded geeks at war with malware, effectively transforming himself into a digital Sam Spade\u2014indeed, the graphic atop Shadowserver's home page features a Dashiell Hammett\u2013style detective emerging from shadow.\n\nBoth sides in this cyberwar have become astonishingly sophisticated, operating at the cutting edge of programming theory and cryptography. Both understand the limits of security methodology, the one side working to broaden its reach, the other working to surpass it. Because malware has been automated, the good guys usually can only guess at who they are up against.\n\nTrojans, Viruses, and Worms\n\nRodney Joffe heads the cabal that has been battling Conficker. He is a burly, garrulous South African\u2013born American who serves as senior vice president and chief technologist for Neustar, a company that provides trunk-line service for competing cell-phone companies around the world. Joffe's interest in stopping the worm did not stem just from his outrage and sense of justice. His concern for Neustar's operation is professional, and illustrative.\n\nThe company runs a huge local-number-portability database. Almost every phone call in North America, before it's completed, must ask Neustar where to go. Back in the old days, when the phone company was a monopoly, telecommunications were relatively simple. You could figure out where a phone call was going, right down to the building where the target phone would ring, just by looking at the number. Today we have competing telephone companies, and cell phones, and a person's telephone number is no longer necessarily tied to a geographic location. In this more complex world, someone needs to keep track of every single phone number, and know where to route calls so they end up in the right place. Neustar performs this service for telephone calls, and is one of many registries that oversee high-level Internet domains. It is, in Joffe's words, \"the map.\"\n\n\"If I disappear, there's no map,\" he says. \"So if you take us down, whole countries can actually disappear from the grid. They're connected, but no one can find their way there, because the map's disappeared.\"\n\nA botnet like Conficker could theoretically be used to shut down Neustar's system. So Joffe helped form the Conficker Cabal. He scoffed when he read in late 2009 that the Obama administration's Department of Homeland Security planned to hire \"a thousand\" computer-security experts over the next three years. \"There aren't more than a few hundred people in the world who understand this stuff.\"\n\nMost of us use the word virus to describe all malware, but in geekspeak, it means something more specific. There are three types of the stuff: Trojans, viruses, and worms. A Trojan is a piece of software that works like a Trojan horse, masquerading as one thing to get inside a computer, and then attacking. A virus attacks the host computer after slipping in through a hole in its operating system. It depends on the computer-operator\u2014you\u2014doing something stupid to activate it, like opening an attachment to an e-mail that appears innocuous, or clicking on an enticing link. A worm works like a virus, exploiting flaws in operating systems, but it doesn't attack once it breaks in. It generally doesn't have a malicious payload. Exactly like the most-sophisticated viruses in the biological world, it does not cripple or kill its host. It is primarily designed to spread. The instructions that will put a worm like Conficker to work are not embedded in its code; they will be delivered later, from a remote command center.\n\nIn the old days, when your computer got infected, it slowed down because your commands had to compete for processing with viral invaders. You knew something was wrong because the machine took 10 times longer to boot up, or there was a delay between command and response. You began to get annoying pop-ups on your screen directing you to download supposedly remedial software. Programs would freeze. In this sense, the old malware was like the Ebola virus, a very scary strain that messily kills nearly everyone it infects\u2014which is another way of saying that it is grossly ineffective, because it burns out the very host organisms it needs to survive. The miscreants who created computer viruses years ago learned that malware that announces itself in these ways doesn't last.\n\nSo today's malware produces no pop-ups, no slowdowns. A worm is especially quiet, since all it does, at least initially, is spread. Conficker stealthily sets up shop without making a ripple, and\u2014other than calling home periodically for instructions\u2014just waits. Its regular messages to its command center amount to only a couple hundred bytes of data, which is not enough to even light up the little bulb that flashes when a computer hard drive is at work.\n\nAfter Phil Porras and others began snaring Conficker in increasing numbers, they began dissecting it. The worm itself was exquisite. It consisted of only a few hundred lines of code, no more than 35 kilobytes\u2014slightly smaller than a 2,000-word document. In comparison, the average home computer today has anywhere from 40 to 200 gigabytes of storage. Unless you were looking for it, unless you knew how to look for it, you would never see it. Conficker drifts in like a mote.\n\nIt exploited a specific hole, Port 445, in the Microsoft operating systems, a vulnerability that the manufacturer had tried to repair just weeks earlier. Ports are designated \"listening\" points in a system, designed to transmit and receive particular kinds of data. There are many of them, more than 65,000, because an operating system consists of layer upon layer of functions. A firewall is a security program that guards these ports, controlling the flow of data in and out. Some ports, like the one that handles e-mail, are heavily trafficked. Most are not; they listen for updates and instructions that deal with a narrow and specific function, usually routine procedures that never rise to the notice of computer-users. Only certain very specific kinds of data can flow through ports, and then only with the appropriate codes. Windows opens Port 445 by default to perform tasks like issuing instructions for print-sharing or file-sharing. Late in the summer of 2008, Microsoft learned that even a system protected by a firewall was vulnerable at Port 445 if print-sharing and file-sharing were enabled (which they were on many computers). In other words, even a well-protected computer had a hole. On October 23, 2008, the company issued a rare \"critical security bulletin\" (MS08-067) with a patch to repair that hole. A specially crafted \"remote procedure call\" could allow the port to be used by a remote operator, the security bulletin warned, and \"an attacker could exploit this vulnerability without authentication to run arbitrary code.\" The patch Microsoft offered theoretically slammed the door on a worm like Conficker almost a month before it appeared.\n\nTheoretically.\n\nIn fact, the bulletin itself may have inspired the creation of Conficker. Many, many computer-operators worldwide\u2014you know who you are\u2014fail to diligently heed security updates. And the patches are issued only to computers with validated software installations; millions of computers run on bootlegged operating systems, which have never been validated. Microsoft issues its updates on the second Tuesday of every month. Every geek in the world knows this; it's called \"Patch Tuesday.\" The company employs some of the best programmers in the world to stay one step ahead of the bad guys. If everyone applied the new patches promptly, Windows would be nigh impregnable. But because so many people fail to apply the patches promptly, and because so many machines run on illegitimate Windows systems, Patch Tuesday has become part of Microsoft's problem. The company points out its own vulnerabilities, which is like a general responsible for defending a fort making a public announcement\u2014\"The back door to the supply shed in the southeast corner of the garrison has a broken lock; here's how to fix it.\" When there is only one fort, and it is well policed, the lock is fixed and the vulnerability disappears. But when you are defending millions of forts, and a goodly number of the people responsible for their security snooze right through Patch Tuesday, the security bulletin doesn't just invite attack, it provides a map! Twenty-eight days after the MS08-067 security bulletin appeared, Conficker started worming its way into unpatched computers"}

{"text": "Schneier on Security\n\nNovember 26, 2010\n\nPsychopaths and Security ashortreadinglist.\n\nMost of the non-obvious part of the talk came down to: don't create an attractive nuisance for trolls aka don't provide  gaming activities; and, make them invest some resources.\n\nOn the other hand, lower risk psychopaths can be very reliable at counterintelligence and pen testing. The fact that they just don't give a damn is very useful. They have to be carefully monitored and controlled, though, for rather obvious reasons. Its also advantageous to ensure the psychopath has a personality that lowers their risk, esp. regarding destructive behavior.\n\nWell, the fact that MI6 did a study which concluded that you can't profile against propensity to commit acts of terrorism, made it to the popular press - it would be interesting to do a \"compare and contrast\" with this.\n\nWhile I'm no psychologist, I suspect it boils down to \"are psychopaths born, or made, potentially in adulthood\"?\n\nGame theory might suggest that psychopaths are still rational actors and that they will choose that action that benefits them regardless of the cost to them. So, in theory we should be able to model psychopath behavior and associated threat.\n\nSteve and Bruce, this has been a serious discussion among many of my friends, ranging from psychologists to doctors to sociologists. Among topics we discuss is the appeal of certain activities that will attract a disproportionately higher number of sociopaths and psychopaths than the average percentages normally found in society.\n\nIt is estimated that at any given time, at least 8 - 10% of our population are sociopaths. One of my thoughts was that given the physical violence in a sport such as football, you could make the assumption that the game would probably attract a higher proportion of sociopaths and psychopaths. Legalized violence? A godsend!\n\nThat said, the Internet would surely also have a high appeal based on several factors which would certainly include a false sense of \"anonymity,\" the ability to stir up large crowds quickly (manipulation and control), as well as new avenues of access to all kinds of supposedly secure data. A psychopath's delight.\n\nWhich leads me to one of my current pet theories: Is it that far a cry to assume that Julian Assange and his Wikileaks is a clear example of socio/pyschopathic behavior? He exhibits absolutely no remorse in any of the potential consequences of his actions and his arguments always seem to draw a narcissistic response rather than any serious rationale for doing what he does. Would love to see more discussion and examples on such issues in the security community. I'm sure the FBI and the other alphabets already have some profiling done on such subjects and people.\n\nRobertinSeattle and others seem to want to not talk about a fact well-known among psychologists, but apparently not to the public at large: that despite the media's stereotype, sociopathy is alive and well among positions of power in this country - think megabank executives and politicians. It's hilarious to see Robert finger Assange given the more plainly obvious sociopathy that goes on regularly among just the two groups I just mentioned. (Consider for example the well-documented starvation that happened in many nations in 2008 thanks to agriculture commodities speculation by bankers.) We would do well as a society to figure out a way to keep sociopaths from these positions of power.\n\nWhat sort of vulnerability do you think exists in our social or socio-technical systems that makes them vulnerable to psychopaths in ways that they aren't vulnerable to any other random person who wants to break them?\n\nPeople are exhibiting a lack of precision when they equate a \"psychopath\" and a \"sociopath\".\n\nTechnically, a psychopath is someone suffering from a major mental disorder, generally a psychotic one characterized by gross distortions in reality testing or disorganized thought process.\n\nA sociopath is more vaguely defined, with most agreeing that a required characteristic is a lack of remorse for actions which hurt other people and any willingness to change those actions.\n\nA psychopath may be a sociopath, but most sociopaths are not psychopaths. In fact, psychopaths (those suffering from a major mental disorder) are poor sociopaths because major mental disorders tend to reduce the ability to perform sociopathic actions.\n\nThe distinction is important because the highly successful sociopaths do not display any evidence of major mental illness. They look and act perfectly normal except for the harmful behaviors they indulge in. Those who confuse the two are more easily caught off guard because they expect to observe signs of a mental disorder in a sociopath, which are usually not present.\n\nYou need to realise that as with autism there is a sociopath spectrum that covers 5-15% (depending on your values markers) of the population (by the way the term sociopath is less used in Europe).\n\nImportantly those that suffer autism appear to stit on one tail of the bell curve and those that have sociopath tendencies sit on the other tail of the bell curve.\n\nNow you have both high functioning autistics and high functioning sociopaths both are very much needed by society (that is society as we currently know it would not exist). The sociopaths are very goal orientated with human activities (business leaders) and the autistics tend to be goal focused with non human or technical issues (engineers). Which makes them almost symbiotically dependent on each other to function within the more general society.\n\nThe bulk of the population(80%) tend to be in the middle of the bell curve but are generaly not high functioning and tend to be the \"sheeple\".\n\nWhich suggest that the ability to be high functioning may be an integral part of both the autistic and sociopath spectrums.\n\nThe fact that those with high fuctioning autism can train them selves to be good at business in a mechanistic way well beyond the comprehension of non high function persons gives rise to a philosophical debate as to if there is some mechanism that predicates high function but that has a \"handedness\" component of autism or sociopath.\n\nThose who grace the corridors of academia know of the \"Bursur gone despot\" syndrome. I've jokingly heard it refered to as \"switch to the dark side\". What happens is a not so good academic rises not on their research or teaching skills but develops political and business skills and often ends up turning against the academics in a power grab which usually results in more and more money being diverted away form core academic activities (research & teaching) into other activities.\n\nThus students see rising tuition costs and tutors and researchers see falling funding, and the institution sees rising numbers of \"administrators and their ilk\" in their midst telling them what they must do not only in terms of direction of core activities but in what happens to the proceads of such activities.\n\nIt has got to the point now in some institutions that any original thought by either staff or student automaticaly become the property of the institution, and in some places academics are finding that their research results are being censured for the \"commercial reasons\" of sponsors...\n\nHow can you say that a psychopath is threat? Who made a normal person psycho? What are reasons for a normal person to choose a psychopath? May be a normal person is pretending to be a psycho. He knows more than psychologists, probably, because of his know how of Psychology.\n\nIntriguing. It seems like a sizeable number of people live in constant fear of socio/psycopaths (or 'mutants' as one of those links puts it). I can't help but suspect that the fear of such people does serious harm, just like terrorism.\n\nAnyway good luck ousting those psychos from BT Mr Schneier :)\n\n@Nick P, I'm pretty sure very few penetration testers feel guilty about helping a company in this manner. I certainly don't.\n\nIt's far from obvious to me that a sociopath, still less a psychopath, would be useful in a sporting team. However vicious they were, their self-centredness and deceit wouldn't be helpful at all. I can think of possible examples but they're all of failure, or at least of mediocrity achieved in the face of talent, rather than success.\n\nI know that psychopaths don't exist because it's impossible for someone to be supremely charming and charismatic, emotionless, manipulative and intelligent, irresponsible, temperamental and violent. Those are incompatible traits. Humans aren't innately good, but we are innately similar; we're not a caste species that gives birth to pure evil subhumans. If people aren't innately good, then criminals don't have to be born bad, just raised badly.\n\nAs for \"psychiatric consensus\", these are the same people who presented Munchausen syndrome and satanic ritual abuse as scientific facts. If they don't understand something, they create a story to explain it. It doesn't have to be true or even make sense - it only has to be popular and comforting. In this case, they've stacked every evil, creepy thing they could think of into a medical diagnosis applied to people who piss you off. (That's what lovefraud.com is about - ex-spouses who are evil in every possible way, regardless of consistency.) I'm just pointing out that psychiatric consensus is worthless as evidence.\n\n@Gweihir: That's exactly the point. You only need to prevent the smart ones from the crimes that do actually pay (or make sure that they don't pay anymore, which is easy in theory but hard in practice since the sociopaths are the ones who will have to decide on this).\nBut in politics the moralists do at least as much damage as the sociopaths - and on top of that *they* are usually completely irrational and unpredictable.\n\nStopping some one from doing politics is not solution of threat. Instead, the solution lies in understanding what make a normal person to choose psychopath. Millions effected as a result of a blunder and this effected their mentle health in some way. How many of those mentle people will be stopped? They are in million and their recovery will atleast take a generation...\n\nThe normal persons will easily choose a high functioning psychopath or sociopath over a \"normal\" individual for many reasons.\n1) They don't know him/her enough to detect the problem\n2) The psychopath have less problem to tell sweet lies than a \"normal\" individual\n3) The psychopath is more confident, or able to project confidence, than a \"normal\" person. Others will reflexively react trusting the confident more than the not confident.\n\nThe only way to reduce the possibility and incentive for psychopaths to have power is to reduce the amount of power anyone can have. This imply a reduction of the power and the scope of the government. The thieves are attracted by a big vault full of treasures more than many little vault with little treasures.\n\nMoralists can be psychopaths as much as not moralists. They are simply different types of psychopaths. Both will not feel any trouble if people suffer for their actions. They consider them justifiable anyway.\n\nThe first two links were interesting, the third was a little on the woo-side of things, and the last seemed to be run by a nutjob (who couldn't even get his facts right). Come on Bruce, you can do better than that, just because someone quotes you doesn't mean they are otherwise on the ball...\n\n\"The new research, however, examines what they have in abundance -- impulsivity, heightened attraction to rewards and risk taking.\"\n\nPeople matching this characterization should be particularly easy to catch with honey-traps, and traps with bait that has actual value would be hard to resist even if they knew it was a trap (a real reward with nothing but a heightened risk in the way).\n\nI was in the security team of a major IT vendor between 2000 and 2004, where I sat on the company's standards review council. At the same time, I was dealing with someone who was clearly a sociopath (specifically, Antisocial Personality Disorder with co-morbid Narcacistic Personality Disorder). In studying the ~1% to 5% of people who could not seem to comply with company policy, and having discussions with them about it, it was hard not to miss a lot of commonalities between them and the aforementioned sociopath.\n\nIt really isn't hard to figure out why. Sociopaths fundamentally feel that rules don't apply to them (exceptionalism), that everyone else is inferior (superiority), compulsively lie and self-aggrandize (fantasize), externalize responsibility for failure, and indulge in high-risk activities through most of their life. This couldn't be further from a responsible and compliant employee.\n\nThe problem is what to do about it. I don't have an answer there, but note that concern about \"corporate psychopaths\" is rising, primarily due to the damage such individuals cause others around them. It is also notable that some corporate psychopaths can be high-achievers, if their personal goals are aligned with the corporation's. Although that observation is, I personally believe, incomplete as the secondary cost of their success might be huge.\n\nPsychopathy and sociopathy are very similar, but with a small semantic difference. The important thing is that they both share the important commonality of a reduced (or non-existent) ability to empathize with others. In other words, psychopaths don't care if you're hurt (even if they're hurting you). Normal people process others' pain with some level of emotion, whereas psychopaths process this information cognitively. There are other typical characteristics as well (such as impulsiveness) that are relatively common.\n\nSome criminal psychopaths (or sociopaths) are violent, some are seemingly non-violent but nonetheless manipulative and hurtful in the non-physical sense. Behavior might be indicative of psychopathy, but a clinical eval is required to ascertain the disorder with greater certainty (the Hare checklist).\n\nSome aspects, eg, psychosis and depressions, are triggered by infections and stress which implies an involvement of the immunity and stress-hormone systems (cortisol).\n\nThey have been part of humanity as far back in history as can be traced at all. Autism and ASPD spectra can also be seen as an evolutionary strategy where an individual's \"genes\" bet on less or more social life-styles. Note that both (weak) autists and psychopaths are parasitic. They are troublesome because they tend to take more care from others than they give back.\n\nA very interesting suggestion is that these spectrum disorders are collateral damage from an epi-genetic battle of the sexes. In evolutionary sense, mothers can raise more children if each demands less care (autism). Fathers get more successful children if they sire cuckoo young that each demand as much care as they can (psychopathy). Things go pathological when either parent cannot \"imprint\" their child correctly.\n\nSee:\n\nBattle of the sexes may set the brain\nChristopher Badcock1 & Bernard Crespi2\n\nWinter: Please try and cite a reference showing that children on the Autism Spectrum require less care. All the evidence I've seen shows the exact opposite.\n\nAlso please try and cite a reference showing that demanding more care has historically been a good thing for a child. My guess is that a demanding child will in some situations diminish the ability of their parents to provide a reliable supply of food, and that as for most of history (and even a large portion of the world population now) food supplies have been short this would be an evolutionary issue.\n\nIt seems to me that children who are close to the median in most measures have historically been most likely to survive to adulthood. For the greatest number of grandchildren there is an advantage in a high-stakes measure for sons (not daughters as they are limited to ~1 child per year). A genetic combination that results in most sons having fewer children than average but some sons having many more than average can spread.\n\nFinally it is generally regarded that the incidence of both psychopathy and autism is significantly greater among males than females. This would be due to some combination of females being less likely to have such traits or less likely to be diagnosed.\n\nThe fact that children on the Autism Spectrum don't need less care and the fact that there aren't more Autistic women than men seems to kill the Badcock and Crespi theory.\n\nNB I haven't read their paper and won't read it. I've read more than enough strange theories about Autism already. If they want to promote their ideas they can start by publishing them under a CC license.\n\n@Russel Coker\n\"Please try and cite a reference showing that children on the Autism Spectrum require less care. All the evidence I've seen shows the exact opposite.\"\n\nI can only say, read the paper. It contains a long list of references. The linked paper tries to make sense of the high prevalence of such harmful disorders. It is not proposing a cure, nor does it assigns blame.\n\nNote of correction:\n\nI was a little hasty and should have reread the paper.\nI intermixed the paternal/maternal drive behind autism and paranoia. Autism leads to an extremely \"male\" things-person (paternal imprinting) and paranoia/schizophrenia leads to an extremely female peoples-person (maternal imprinting).\n\nAlthough the paper directly refers to autism and paranoia, it does not actually names ASPD as a disorder it tries to explain. I thought the pattern fitted perfectly for ASPD, but that was my interpretation, and mine alone.\n\nOne big part of securing systems against sociopaths and psychopaths is, imo, mitigating the information lost due to scaling and traversal of hierarchy levels. Sociopaths are ultimately analogous to defectors in the prisoner's dilemma game, and in an iterated game defectors are weeded out. (Or in more common parlance, they're the people everybody in their community or workplace knows not to trust or to get on the wrong side of.)\n\nSo a winning strategy for the sociopath/psychopath is to keep moving around so that they can access new pools of suckers, or to move up a hierarchy at least to a level where they're insulated from the consequences of what people know about them. Hierarchies can also (as people have noted) protect sociopaths because the people at the top (who may be more than a little off themselves) value the short-term results produced by the sociopath's behavior over the longterm organizational damage, and believe that they'll never be playing against the sociopath themselves. That's assuming, of course, that the people at the top are actually aware of the behavior in question, rather than just the veneer of charm or the manipulated numbers.\n\nHow to preserve the kind of information that would help secure systems against sociopaths and psychopaths is an open question -- those same channels could of course easily be gamed if the reward were considered worthwhile.\n\n\"Finally it is generally regarded that the incidence of both psychopathy and autism is significantly greater among males than females. This would be due to some combination of females being less likely to have such traits or less likely to be diagnosed.\"\n\nIn the case of autism at least, there is an increasing body of evidence that the latter is true. The full explanation is too long and off-topic to go into here.\n\nTo the degree that persons on sychopathy/sociopathy spectrum are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system perhaps our \"socio-technical systems\" are already addressing them.\n\nIt seems that psychopaths know right from wrong, they just don't feel bad about doing wrong. They do seem to take precautions to avoid detection. Is non-emotional preparation predictive of success in an criminal conspiracy? Probably a little, but I don't see how that helps us defend against them. I wonder if the ability to lie dispassionately when interviewed about a crime doesn't put them a step ahead of the average perpetrator, but that's an investigative rather than a prevention issue.\n\nPsychopathy/sociopathy can cut both ways. A degree of remorselessness can be a useful trait in those who protect us from evil. There are portions of \"On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society\" by Dave Grossman, A Back Bay Book, which speak to the issue of the small percentage of soldiers who are not uncomfortable killing, and law enforcement officers who are not uncomfortable applying physical violence in service of the public order.\n\nFor further reading I recommend \"The Psychopathic Mind: Origins, Dynamics, and Treatment\" but J. Reid Meloy, Publisher Jason Aronson Inc. It may be a little dated, but it's accessible to the layreader.\n\n>It is estimated that at any given >time, at least 8 - 10% of our\n>population are sociopaths.\n\nThat sounds far too high to me. I don't believe our society could function at that level as too many \"normal\" people would be spending too much time dealing with the sociopaths trying to manipulate them.\n\nThat statistic I've seen is 1%.\n\nAnd the accompanying idea that the dumbest third are in jail, the smartest third on Wall Street (everyone wave to Bernie Madoff!), and the rest are distributed around society where they make our lives miserable when we're sucked into their sphere of influence.\n\nNot everyone in jail is a sociopath. Not everyone on Wall Street is, either. Abnormally high percentages, sure.\n\nMatt from CT: There is obviously a spectrum of psychopaths. A large and complex society couldn't survive with 1% being like Hannibal Lector, most aren't like that. Most of the psychopaths do minor things, probably most of them have no great inclination towards violent crime.\n\nThe justifications of psychopathy in terms of situations where violence is necessary (armed forces and police work) are interesting. It's this type of thinking that permits all manner of bad things to be done. There is no evidence to show that non-psychopathic people have any collective lack of ability to commit acts of violence when there is good reason. There are some people who couldn't function in police work due to being unable to handle the violence, but there are a lot of nice caring people who are willing to use force to protect others.\n\nWinter: I'm not going to pay to debunk every bit of bad research on ASDs. If the idea has any value then someone will publish something similar in public and I'll read it.\n\nI take serious objection to the conflation of sociopathy and autism. The conflation of those two conditions is absurd, and shows ignorance of both conditions. Just because both are spectrum disorders is utterly irrelevant.\n\n@Russell Coker, \"There are some people who couldn't function in police work due to being unable to handle the violence, but there are a lot of nice caring people who are willing to use force to protect others.\": Except that police have one of the highest suicide rates because police work is a soul-draining gauntlet of constantly dealing with (one part of) the scum of society and those most victimized by that scum. Normal people can't handle that long term no matter how well-intentioned they are and either promote out, become assholes, burn out or commit suicide.\n\n\"There are some people who couldn't function in police work due to being unable to handle the violence, but there are a lot of nice caring people who are willing to use force to protect others.\"\n\nBut they are not naturally inclined to it (sometimes to the point of an inability to act) or will feel bad about it (sometimes to the point of disability) unless they are rigorously trained beforehand and carefully counseled and supported afterwords.\n\nDon't get me wrong, a generalized aversion to violence is a good problem to have to work around. Still, before this was well understood, a fraction of this 1% - those toward the \"good guy\" end of the spectrum - may have been doing more violence with less remorse than the rest.\n\n\"I take serious objection to the conflation of sociopathy and autism. The conflation of those two conditions is absurd, and shows ignorance of both conditions. Just because both are spectrum disorders is utterly irrelevant.\"\n\nTo take your point's in reverse,\n\nThe fact that they are both spectrum disorders is actually relavent for a number of reasons, however I would agree that the fact that two things are similar and have other apparent connectives does not make them the same or of necessity connected except via some fundemental mechanism.\n\nBut things can be related as opposites or as orthagonals. As I noted above they appear to be near opposites when involving high functioning, that is in the choice of focus but not to the exclusion of human emotion or empathy. Thus they appear as opposit outliers on some distrubutions.\n\nI suspect the conflation occurs because of the apparent exclusion of human emotions in both disorders appearing the same to many people.\n\nHowever this is as far as I'm aware an active area of debate, it is argued that those on the autistic spectrum lack the ability to recognise emotion in others thus not \"learn emotions\" (ie have no emotional intelligence). Whilst those on the Psych/sociopath spectrum may well recognise emotion in others very well but it does not engender any emotional response in them.\n\nAs always with research in to the human brain and it's functioning the issue of \"handedness\" arises. Most researchers exclude left handed people from their study groups or fail to investigate it's potential effects/consiquences in other studies. This has implications for all studies of the human mind and ignoring it potentialy renders an investigator \"colour blind\" in what they observe.\n\nI was wondering why we had all these hits from the \"Schneier on Security\" website. I will say, that of the 900 articles on the Lovefraud Blog, the Autostereograms one was an odd choice. That was a post by a guest author, and was somewhat metaphorical.\n\nIn reference to some of the discussions above - the mental health profession has not agreed on what to call this disorder - sociopath, psychopath, antisocial personality disorder. In fact, the American Psychiatric Assn has proposed yet another term - \"antisocial/psychopathic type.\" We haven't figured out what to do with that one.\n\nThe professionals have also failed to agree on diagnostic criteria. There's a standoff between the psychology PhD researchers (who use \"psychopath\") and the psychiatrists - MD clinicians (antisocial personality disorder, or perhaps the new name). All this does is leave the public confused, and makes our job trying to educate the public more difficult.\n\nHow many are there? I use the figure 1% to 4% of the population - Dr. Robert Hare says 1% (psychopaths), the psychiatrists say 4% (antisocial personality disorder).\n\nAn interesting note - Dr. Hare, who claims that 1% of general population are psychopaths, also says that 3% of corporate executives are psychopaths.\n\nI invite all of you to visit more of Lovefraud.com - our discussion of this disorder is quite thorough."}

If the botnet operators do find them, the IP addresses often are blacklisted quickly by reputation systems and are then useless for the attackers. Now, in one effort to get around these systems, some attackers are taking advantage of the lack of IPv4 space by either purchasing or renting blocks of IP space with good reputations that have been built up over the course of several years. A number of legitimate trading and auction sites appeared as the IPv4 space became scarcer, and the attackers have gotten involved as well, getting their hands on known good IP blocks and using them for C&C or hosting malware.\"\n\nI call BS. Hackers don't rent or buy IP addresses for botnets. The bots run on machines each of which has an IP address already. And when they do need IP addresses, they steal them: find an address assignment not currently routed on the Internet and forge papers they present to the ISP claiming to be the actual registrant.\n\nThere are a number of protections in place at ARIN and the other Internet Registries which do a reasonably good job preventing hackers from taking actual \"ownership\" of blocks of IP addresses.\n\nWhile there is such a thing as a \"legitimate trading and auction sites,\" there are also a lot of snake oil salesman out there right now claiming legitimacy. Here's a hint: the legitimate ones don't cater to the hacker crowd because they know perfectly well they can't effect a registry transfer without meeting the registry's criteria for \"legitimate need.\"\n\nIt should be justifiable homicide to shoot and kill spammers, phishers, malware authors, and those asshats attempting dictionary attacks against a bunch of pop3 accounts looking for a new spam vector.

{"text": "Anonymous hacks Boston Police, publishes officer details\n\nAnonymous has hacked the servers of the Boston Police and other police-related sites, releasing the information late Friday in response to what they call unprovoked mass arrests and brutality experienced by Occupy Boston protesters on October 11.\n\nThe hacktivist group made public the passwords and usernames of 1,000 of the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association, as well as the names, addresses and social security numbers of 1,000 Birmingham, Alabama officers. The International Association of Chief of Police website was also targeted, and the group also released a client list and financials of the Matrix Group, a DC-based web design firm with law enforcement customers.\n\nSome of the sites hacked had homepages defaced and were replaced with an anti-police rap video. They claimed to have taken down 40 police-related websites, including the International Association of Chief of Police website that remained unreachable for the majority of the weekend.\n\n\"Let this be a warning to BPD and police everywhere: future acts of aggression against our movements will be met with a vengeance,\" the group said in a statement posted over at Pastebin.\n\nOn Friday evening, BPD addressed the situation: \"It has come to the attention of the Boston Police Department that various websites used by members of the BPD, including the website belonging to the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association have been hacked into and possibly compromised. In light of this information, the Boston Police Department is requiring all department personnel to secure their login information by resetting their passwords on the BPD network.\"\n\n\"I will confirm that it has happened, and there is an active federal and local investigation into it,\" said Thomas Nee, President of the BPPA when speaking with the Boston Herald yesterday.\n\nOccupy Boston members have stated that they did not ask Anonymous to do the hacking, but refused to publicly criticize the hacker collective saying they feared their own emails would be hacked.\n\nLast month the Austrian branch of Anonymous published the information of 25,000 police officers in protest of a proposed change to the law that would see telecommunications companies forced to save details of all telephone and internet traffic for a minimum of 6 months, and provide them to police when requested.\n\nUser Comments: 26\n\nAh yes, so they yet again base an attack on their tunnel-vision viewpoint of what they have perceived as a wrongdoing... Yet even the supposed \"victims\" of the wrongdoing won't condone their actions, which target and victimize an entire population of people (all police officers in this case) in an attempt at some type of misguided retribution. Sounds awfully familiar, rather like the ramblings and justifications that radical terrorists use for their actionsJust because Anonymous calls something police brutality doesn't mean I'm going to take their word for it. From what I've read, the Occupy Boston arrests were due to protestors stepping on certain property which they were repeatedly warned not to do, and did not have permission to do. They were trespassing. They disobeyed the law. Anonymous clearly supports these Occupy * movements. Anonymous is defending those who were arrested for disobeying the law. Anonymous subsequently disobeyed the law in 'defending' them.\n\nI abide by the law, Anonymous does not. Anonymous defends the breaking of the law through breaking the law. Anonymous labelled the arrests as \"police brutality\", however I've not found any evidence to support that outside of their word for it. They lied to you and sold you their BS. CongratulationsSo you're saying that Anon needs to lower themselves in order to make their point?\n\nI'd bet if you were an officer for the BPD, you'd have a very different view.\n\nThis kinda reminds me of when the kids at /b/ would find someone, like the lady putting the cat in the trash can, or whatever, and find their info and publish it so that they get some justice...except in this case, they published the information of everyone on the block that the cat lady lived on, you know, cause they live on the same block as her.\n\nI mean, why take the time to identify which officers were involved in any acts of brutality. Lets just target everyone who works for the department. Who cares, they're all guilty cause they wear a badge. Not as if the cops actually do anything for the public, they all just beat suspects, and abuse their authority. They never actually bring any thugs, killers, rapists, etc to justice. And of course, cue some punk kids commenting, cause some cop chased them off from trespassing, or doing something else illegal, so of course all cops are evil assholesReally? Oh right, you mean because they don't serve their own self-righteous agenda, don't feel the ends justify the means (however potentially destructive they are), don't care who gets hurt by their actions, and don't categorically apply bold strokes when blaming an entire facet of society for whatever their perceived injustices are? You should understand that I wasn't comparing the severity of the results, but the mentality and motivations of misguided actions.\n\nIf Anonymous had specifically targeted the police officers involved in the transgressions that they are protesting, and only exposed the personal information for those few, then I would have respect for them. Instead, they blanket attack an entire group for what they perceive as the sins of a few against their cause. That, my friend, is the cyber equivalent of walking a suicide bomber into a populated area and lighting a fuse, with zero regard for whether those in the blast zone are innocent or guilty. There is nothing idiotic about the comparison - either way they don't care about the collateral damage, as long as they can hurt someone and take credit for it to further their cause. The mentality is scarily similar between the 2 groups.\n\nI agree, yes going against Anon wont equal death or physical harm but it wont be pleasant either.\n\nI will say Anon have knowingly broken the law to enforce their own sense of justice, to a point where they have people scared to publicly criticize them for fear of repercussions, granted repercussions in this instance does not equal death like certain terrorist groups, but fear none the less. They also to appear to welcome and encourage this fear as well. Not to mention they went after the entire BPD, not individuals, most of which i assume were undeserving but guilty by associationAnonymous has always been an anarchist group. One of their key inspirations is Alan Moore's \"V for Vendetta\". The character V is a symbol for anarchist ideology and does whatever he must to bring down the totalitarian government.\n\nI don't know where the hacktivist label comes from but it really doesn't make much sense.\n\nAnonymous doesn't have \"branches\" or central leadership of any kind. When a member (or spectator in disguise) says he's the mouthpiece, he's not. That's either co-opted disinformation or someone outside describing their view of the insideI kindof disagree with both of you guys. I would say that are doing what they believe to be right. Meaning that, people shouldn't be herded like sheep by a federal or state force doing what they believe is right. Also, they quoted one person and I seem to believe it may be a biased statement, if it is even a statement at all and not a ramble from the editor. Police are good when they stop bad guys, but they are bad and overstepping when they start to punish us against the constitution. Federal government is the same way in that regard. They want you to be mindless and patriotic, calling anything against the US is unpatriotic and whatnot. However it would seem that if you look at it logically. It would almost be the opposite. I don't agree that rich people should have higher taxes like they do. (Im not rich by any means). But I also believe that poor people shouldnt be carried like they are today. I believe the government shouldnt have to pay for half the stuff it does today. I also believe that some paychecks need to be cut off in the White house and H.O.R. as well as benefits. Anyone else think they would give themselves a raise if they had the opportunity?\n\nAnyway, there are alot of things that need to change. But it seems like none cares, it's ok though. Keep watching your reality TV shows and just stay silent, you won't even notice your rights going into the garbage until it's too late.\n\nNobody here compared Anon to a \"murderous suicide civilian bombing terrorist.\" Yes, they have been called a terrorist, but a terrorist doesn't just kill people. Perhaps you should open the dictionary. Terrorism does not always involve death.\n\nAnd to those cheering them on...REALLY?! You see nothing wrong with posting names, addresses, and social security numbers of everyone in the department, even if they weren't involved? And did you even take the time to see WHY people get arrested at these protests? Of course not. I'm predicting Anon to hack the Houston PD again because of the arrests that were made yesterday. But Anon will ignore the reason why they were arrested, which is because the protesters were blocking the entrance of a bank, preventing people from going in and coming out. This is disruption of business, trespassing (as the bank owner asked them to move from the entrance and they didn't) and also a violation of safety codes. But hey, morons like you and Anon would never take the time to look these things upI have a friend who is a police officer (not in Boston) that had his information leaked a few months ago. It is not a joke. He and his family received death threats, he had to change all his phone numbers and online accounts, and they are hoping to move to a new address soon.\n\nIt is one thing to raise awareness of an incidence (the alleged police brutality), it is another to violate the privacy of thousands of individuals, especially when those individuals will likely become targets for all sorts of threats, spam, further hacking, and even violence."}

{"text": "Cybersecurity Threats II \u2013 DoS and DDoS attacks\n\nIn a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, a hacker launches an attack against a single target computer system by taking control over multiple user's computers to send enormous amount of information to the targeted website or to send spam emails to a targeted account.\n\nA typical DDoS attack starts with the hacker finding and manipulating vulnerabilities in a computer system and making it the DDoS master. This DDoS master is used to identify and communicate with other computer systems that are compromised in a second step. The hacker loads cracking tools on multiple computers before starting the attack against the target system. Finally, with a single command, the hacker launches the ultimate attack by activating the cracking tools on the multiple compromised computers flooding the targeted system with information that causes the DoS. The DDoS attacks inflict serious damage to the target systems but also may cause collateral damage to associated nodes.\n\nMultiple hacker groups such as \"Anonymous\" are known for targeting business websites such as Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, Amazon, Bank of America or PostFinance Bank and governmental agencies promoting their political views in several conflicts around the world.\nMost targeted systems of DDoS attacks, however, are online financial markets, ecommerce (stores, auctions, sale message boards etc.) with 25% of all registered attacks followed by trading sites with 20% and gaming sites and banks with 15% each in 2011.\nThe number of DDoS attacks was growing by 57% in the second half of 2011 associated with an increase of DDoS botnets around the world. The number of attacks are still growing with hackers using new ways to launch the attacks.\n\nTo escape the increasingly complex DDoS attacks, governments and businesses will need to improve their technologies since DDoS attacks will get more complicated with hackers now increasingly using peer-to-peer (P2P) networks displacing the centralized botnets."}
{"text": "Security quotes of the week\n\n[Posted February 6, 2013 by jake]\n\nI continue to be amazed that elected officials can read constant articles\nabout hacking, and yet readily accept the assurances that there will be no\nproblems with internet voting. If the SBE [State Board of Elections] is so\ngood at stopping attacks,\nperhaps they should supplement their paltry budget by providing security\nfor banks, Federal government agencies like DOD [Departement of Defense],\nand the nation's leading\nnewspapers!\n\nThe Internet's design isn't fixed by natural laws. Its history is a\nfortuitous accident: an initial lack of commercial interests, governmental\nbenign neglect, military requirements for survivability and resilience, and\nthe natural inclination of computer engineers to build open systems that\nwork simply and easily. This mix of forces that created yesterday's\nInternet will not be trusted to create tomorrow's. Battles over the future\nof the Internet are going on right now: in legislatures around the world,\nin international organizations like the International Telecommunications\nUnion and the World Trade Organization, and in Internet standards\nbodies. The Internet is what we make it, and is constantly being recreated\nby organizations, companies, and countries with specific interests and\nagendas. Either we fight for a seat at the table, or the future of the\nInternet becomes something that is done to us.\n\nTechnTheGood luck getting Joe Public to figure out and handle a public key :) Especially when any software he uses will now be a huge spyware target.\n\nAnd of course, this is in addition to the requirement that all code be correct and open and securely installed ...\n\n> I also have no doubt that the government will never, ever, be able to accomplish this task.\n\nI think that, even if you had a private board of cryptographers, security researchers and programmers, with infinity money and a love of democracy, you'd still be unable to produce a system the public could use.\n\n> Alternately, you could allow multiple votes and only count the most recent one, which is easy to do if everybody has a unique encryption key.\n\n\"most recent\" what does that mean? You've just moved a problem in security into one of atomicity and global timekeeping. I think Einstein would have some thoughts on how plausible this approach would be.\n\nThe obvious question is \"hash chains of what?\" I think you are pretty aware of one major challenge which is simplicity in that you earlier said:\n\n> TheSo lets replace \"time YYY\" with \"most recent publicized hash base.\" It needs to be something public otherwise Fox News would have a field day. Pay a bunch of people to vote for Obama and submit that, and then wait until after the results are announced to produce a few thousand new votes properly signed with the government public key, and chained against the individuals previous vote in the register that are for Romney. THE ELECTION WAS RIGGED!!!! VOTERS CHANGING TO ROMNEY DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY!!!!!\n\nSo the government manages a clock/checkpoint which takes in all votes V_i arriving at time T, computes and publicizes a hash H_{T+1}=H(H_{T},V_1,...,V_n), and each vote includes as part of its signature H_{t} for some publicized t. If the vote has a stale Hash as the base to its signature I should reject it and notify the voter to resubmit.\n\nThere is still a synchronization point, but at least people will know about a failed vote and can resubmit. The problem here is that its split one vote counting problem into a few thousand vote counting problems. Every Joe who submits his vote at 11:59pm and sees it rejected is going to think he was targeted in his vote denial and not that his web connection was a bit slow.\n\nThere is also no simple way to verify that H_T was properly computed from the incoming votes and previous hash values. Independent observers will see votes arrive in a different order than the official hashing agent, and will compute different hashes as a result. Trying to reconcile that is going to be a mess and cause people to lose confidence in the system. My Server saw Joe's vote arrive at 11:01pm, but your server claimed it didn't arrive until 12:15am. Clearly you have a bug in your server's queue so I question every vote you tally or refuse to tally beginning at 11pm.\n\nI'll back up a bit and challenge a more fundamental assumption: > You'd still get improved count efficiency and consistent audit trails.\n\nCount efficiency. Who says that is a problem? The vote is in November the but politicians don't begin serving until January. That leaves plenty of time to count and recount and recount again, and yet again. The only times that the outcome has been in doubt is when there is some disagreement about what constitutes a proper vote or a proper voter. ie hanging chads or provisional ballots. There are still \"hanging chads\" with electronic voting where the touchscreen gets miscalibrated or the machine crashes, and provisional ballots are entirely unaffected by electronic systems.\n\nA judge isn't going to care that he can order up a spreadsheet that lists the winner and loser under a bunch of different potential rulings (ie we count the votes from Machine 23875 that failed in district 12, but not from machine 12123 in district 8 that was miscalibrated). In many ways the plausible existence of such a spreadsheet makes things worse for the judge. Its much easier to defend a ruling that says \"count the hanging chads as yes\" when you don't know for sure what the outcome will be.\n\nConsistent Audit Trails. What makes a bunch of computer records a substantially better audit trail than a big heavy stack of papers in boxes that have to be physically moved around and physically manipulated to introduce fraud. In what way do we currently fail to have a consistent audit trail?\n\nI'll take the contrarian position and argue that secrecy is bad for elections. It grants politicians a monopoly on corruption and denies it to Joe Public.\n\nThere seem to be two arguments for secrecy one is to prevent a \"Boss Tweed\" system. I don't see how that would be so much worse than what we currently have. We have a Boss Tweed system where big corporations make donations to politicians who use that money to run ads and convince people they will help them and then do nothing of the kind because they know what side their bread is buttered on.\n\nIf a big corporation could instead just buy the votes of the poor in mass, the result might still be the same but at least the poor are getting some benefit from their vote and the corruption will be a lot more obvious. I see that as a win.\n\nThe other \"secrecy is a requirement\" argument comes from authoritarian dictatorships, but those systems don't have a legitimate vote counting process to begin with. Secrecy allows those dictators to claim that the results are correct and prevents independent agencies from demonstrating that they are fradulent. The UN can say \"lots of boxes which we suspect were for the opposition were loaded into a truck and disappeared so we decertified the election\" but they can't say that they were in fact for the opposition.\n\nIf everyone voted publicly in those countries then the dictator might be forced to choose between stepping aside and recognizing the correct count, or mass slaughter on a regular basis of those who publicly try to subvert his authority.\n\n> I'm sure that the UVF and the Provos would both have loved to have a public roster of who voted which way in Northern Ireland during the Troubles.\n\nAnd would that have lead to a meaningful difference in the outcome or a substantially greater loss of life? It was already a violent period so would it make much of a difference if the violence was better targeted?\n\nI don't know that I've seen anyone address that question directly. Everyone assumes that privacy is a requirement, and that makes the process of creating a secure, reliable, and understandable electronic voting system essentially impossible.\n\nI'm not in favor of electronic voting in general because I don't think paper voting is that bad, but if on insists on exploring the idea you might as well explore a more substantive change in the way we vote and challenge all the assumptions to make sure you have the correct system requirements.\n\n> TechnI'd suggest you examine how Debian handles voting. I'm not extremely familiar with how it works, but AFAIK it provides (a) and (b), but fails (c) (you have to be part of the Debian's Web of Trust to have your signature accepted) and arguably simplicity (because they use Condorcet's method). I think the Project Secretary is the weak link, because someone has to decrypt the actual votes and count them, so there is a possible leak there. But it's OK because everybody trusts the Secretary :)\n\nHow does the current, paper-based, non-internet system hold up to these requirements?\n\n> But you need to have (a) a public record (everyone can see what they voted),\n\nNot possible, you do not get a copy of your ballot\n\n> (b) privacy (nobody can see what anyone else voted for),\n\nMore or less guaranteed that public members will not have access to your vote\n\n> (c) accessibility (nobody needs special ID or keys or anything).\n\nIn most countries that I have been in, you do need ID (in some countries like India you need a \"special\" ID).\n\nAlso, in most countries with paper ballots, ballots are numbered, and the counterfoil has your name on it. So although the person counting the votes does not know which is who, in principle (and during allegations of fraud) a court can match each person to a ballot.\n\n> And you need a simple enough system that people will trust you when you tell them that these points are satisfied.\n\nYes. We do not need a foolproof system, just one that is good enough.\n\nThere _will_ be election fraud. We can hope that most will be detected, and punished. That is all that a good system requires, I think.\n\nHaving a public record of the vote is extremely dangerous, since it means that you can prove to other people how you voted.\n\nLet's rephrase that. It means that other people can demand you prove to them how you voted, and punish you if you didn't vote the way they wanted you to.\n\nHavingThis sort of thing is why a lot of countries make it a criminal offence to take photographs inside the voting booth.\n\n> Having a public record of the vote is extremely dangerous, since it means that you can prove to other people how you voted.\n\nOn the other hand, having no public record means that the vote-counters can change your vote and you'd be none the wiser.\n\n> HavingI'd bet money there's some combination of asymmetric crypto and hash tricks that would let you:\n\n1. Vote as many times as you want, choosing which vote is the \"real\" one.\n2. Publicize the entire voting record so that it's possible for anyone to sum all real votes.\n3. Despite (2), nobody can tell which votes are real, even their own, nor can anyone tell how many times somebody voted.\n\nThen if the algorithm and voting record were both publicized, you'd be assured that your vote was correctly counted (because you trust the algorithm, not because you can read the record).\n\nWith only these three points, maybe the government could drop votes from the record selectively. (Drop vote, recount. Didn't help me? Put it back, drop the next one, recount...).\n\nBut this could be solved if you could also \"vote\" a signature of others votes. You'd encrypt this signature with some secret. Then, say, your local watchdog group could sign the votes of you and all of your friends. If your votes go missing or the signature goes missing, the watchdog will notice and publicize the secret needed to verify this. Otherwise, the watchdog does nothing and nobody even knows what was signed.\n\nYou could even be your own watchdog, though if a lone guy is saying \"my signature is bad, they're tampering!\" people would likely assume he just did the signature wrong and ignore him. But if the ACLU were to say this, that would be a big deal. And since nobody could match the signature to the watchdog until their secret was published (after the election), any tampering would therefore run a risk of being noticed.\n\nYes, there are indeed such crypto tricks. Unfortunately, they fall foul of another requirement of voting systems: that they must be understandable by the common voter. If only Ron Rivest and his fellow crypto deities can understand said system and be satisfied that it is secure, then the thing is useless, be it ever so wonderful.\n\nVery Complex systems. ie most people won't check, and it would be reasonably easy to predict those who might check.\n\nIn a country where 50% of the people don't vote and don't care because they recognize it doesn't make a difference who they vote for this means that:\na) You can fraudulently insert votes from individuals who didn't vote and expect them not to check and verify that there vote was not recorded.\nb) [Potentially] Change votes of some voters who match certain criteria (unemployed, not connected to a politically active group, low education) and reasonably expect that they will not attempt to verify their vote matches what they claim to have voted for.\nc) If anyone does step forward brush them aside as a crackpot.\n\nThere is also a strong incentive for a reverse attack on the system from the losing side.\na) If you know you will lose cast the wrong vote (ie vote for the winner or somehow spoil your vote).\nb) Complete the protocol for the correct vote to try and introduce an inconsistency in the tabulation.\nc) Complain that the election is rigged. Most people won't understand the arguments one way or the other and come down on the side of their party in believing that either the voter screwed up (if they favor the winner) or that the election is rigged (if they favor the loser).\n\nSecure electronic voting from a polling booth is theoretically a solved problem. The keywords to search upon are \"end to end verifiable voting\". Like all good crypto protocols, these at first appear to do the impossible. They do not depend on trusting the voting machines, the counting process the people or anything else in the middle. Thus they don't require open source to work. They do publish every vote so voters can verify their vote has been counted, but they do so in a way that preserves anonymity and prevents voters from selling their vote.\n\nAt lease one state in Australia (Victoria) is implementing it now - this was covered in a talk at LCA 2013. They are using the Pr\u00eat \u00e0 Voter scheme, which sadly they omitted to mention in their talk. Possibly not the best detail to omit at an LCA conference. Instead they talked about what is I guess their most pressing problem - creating an interface for a voter who is possibly blind, or deaf, or can't write - maybe because they have Parkinson's disease.\n\nOthers have said this, but I'll re-phrase it slightly: Any robust voting system must ensure voters can't reliably sell their vote.\n\nI don't know of any internet based voting system that can do this and preserve the other features we want in a voting system, like anonymity and verifiability, despite heavy research into the area spanning decades. Ergo I unlike you I very much doubt it can be made to work.\n\n> Any robust voting system must ensure voters can't reliably sell their vote.\n\nWhy not? What is so bad about that? I voted for a third party and got nothing for it. Seems better to sell the vote for the highest price and then use the proceeds either for my own benefit of the benefit of the party I support."}
{"text": "5 Takeaways From Black Hat 2010\n\nBlack Hat, the largest and most visible hacker conference, is winding down in Las Vegas. It always brings a series of shocks and this year didn't disappoint. What did we learn this year?\n\n1. Your money isn't safe - Researcher Barnaby Jack demonstrated how to hack automated teller machines (ATMs). He did it both by physically opening the machine and installing malware on it and by compromising it over the network. It turns out these machines, or at least some of them, aren't all that aggressively secured.\n\n3. Your electric service isn't safe - Jonathan Pollet, founder of Red Tiger Security, told Black Hat attendees of the weaknesses in Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems used in utilities like power companies to manage and monitor equipment. SCADA vendors and users are way behind IT generally when it comes to security. Vulnerabilities go for long times unpatched. Unnecessary software, like chat clients, are used on critical systems, which are sometimes connected to the Internet. Pollet also warned of the weak security state of \"smart meters\" being rolled out all over the country.\n\n4. Your home router isn't safe - A new trick found by researcher Craig Heffner makes it easier for attackers to gain usable access to your home network. Hacking into the router can be done in many ways, but once you're in it's hard to get an address on the internal network. Heffner showed a Javascript hack that allows an attacker to use DNS Rebiding to gain an internal address. There are mitigating measures you can take, but they're complex or inconvenient.\n\n5. Black Hat itself isn't safe - For the first time this year, Black Hat made their sessions available through a video feed, using a 3rd party service, for a $395 fee. One subscriber realized that it was easy to trick the service into providing the videos for free. It's not a good thing to show weakness like this to the Black Hat"}

{"text": "Computer scientist looks for bad guys in cyberspace\n\nFeb 11, 2013\n\nSandia National Laboratories computer science researcher Jeremy Wendt concentrates on working on a program to find potential targets of nefarious emails. Credit: Randy Montoya\n\n(Phys.org)\u2014The weakest link in many computer networks is a gullible human. With that in mind, Sandia National Laboratories computer science researcher Jeremy Wendt wants to figure out how to recognize potential targets of nefarious emails and put them on their guard.\n\nHis goal is to reduce the number of visitors that cyberanalysts have to check as possible bad guys among the tens of thousands who search Sandia websites each day.\n\nUltimately, he wants to be able to spot spear phishing. Phishing is sending an email to thousands of addresses in hopes a few will follow a link and, for example, fall for a scam offering millions of dollars to help a Nigerian prince wire money out of his country. Spear phishing, on the other hand, targets specific email addresses that have something the sender wants.\n\nWendt has developed algorithms that separate robotic web crawlers from people using browsers. He believes his work will improve security because it allows analysts to look at groups separately.\n\nEven if an outsider gets into a Sandia machine that doesn't have much information, that access makes it easier to get into another machine that may have something, Wendt said.\n\n\"Spear phishing is scary because as long as you have people using computers, they might be fooled into opening something they shouldn't,\" he said.\n\nIdentifying malicious intent\n\nSandia cybersecurity's Roger Suppona said the ability to identify the possible intent to send malicious content might enable security experts to raise awareness in a potential target. \"More importantly, we might be able to provide specifics that would be far more helpful in elevating awareness than would a generic admonition to be suspicious of incoming email or other messages,\" he said.\n\nWendt, in the final stretch of a two-year Early Career Laboratory Directed Research and Development grant, presented his work at a Sandia poster session.\n\nWendt has looked into behaviors of web crawlers vs. browsers to see if that matches how computers identify themselves when asking for a webpage. Browsers generally say they can interpret a particular version of HTML\u2014HyperText Markup Language, the main language for displaying webpages\u2014and often give browser and operating system information. Crawlers identify themselves by program name and version number. A small number Wendt labels \"nulls\" offer no identification, perhaps because the programmer omitted that information, perhaps because someone wants to hide.\n\nWhat Wendt is looking for is a computer that doesn't identify itself or said it's one thing but behaves like another and trolls websites in which the average visitor shows little interest.\n\nGoing to an Internet site creates a log of the search. Sandia traffic is about evenly divided between web crawlers and browsers. Crawlers tend to go all over; browsers concentrate on one place, such as jobs.\n\nCrawlers, also known as bots, are automated and follow links like Google or Bing do. \"When we get crawled by a Google bot, we aren't being crawled by one visitor, we're being crawled by several hundreds or thousands of different IP addresses,\" Wendt said. An IP or Internet Protocol address is a numerical label assigned to devices on a computer network, identifying the machine and its location.\n\nDistinguishing bots and browsers\n\nSince Wendt wants to distinguish bots from browsers without having to trust they're who they say they are, he looked for ways to measure behavior.\n\nThe first measurement deals with the fact bots try to index a website. When you type in search words, the crawler looks for pages associated with those words, disregarding how they're arranged on a page. That means a bot pulls down HTML files far more often.\n\nWendt first looked at HTML downloads. Bots should have a high percentage. Browsers pull down smaller percentages.\n\nMore than 90 percent of the nulls pulled down nothing but HTML\u2014typical bot behavior.\n\nA single measurement wasn't enough, so Wendt devised a second based on another marker of bot behavior: politeness.\n\nBots could suck down webpages from a server so fast it would shut down the server to anyone else, he said. That might prompt the site administrator to block them.\n\nSo bots take turns. \"They say, 'Hey, give me a page,' then they may crawl a thousand other sites taking one page from each,\" Wendt said. \"Or they might just sit there spinning their wheels for a second, waiting, and then they'll say, 'Hey, give me another page.'\"\n\nSome behavior is 'bursty'\n\nBrowsers go after only one page but want all images, code, and layout files for it instantly. \"I call that a burst,\" he said. \"A browser is bursty; a crawler is not bursty.\" Bursts equal a certain number of visits within a certain number of seconds.\n\nNinety percent of declared bots had no bursts and none had a high burst ratio. Sixty percent of nulls also had no bursts, lending credence to Wendt's identification of them as bots.\n\nBut 40 percent showed some bursty behavior, making them hard to separate from browsers. However, normal browser behavior also falls within set parameters. When Wendt combined both metrics, most nulls fell outside those parameters.\n\nThat left browsers who behaved like bots. \"Now, are all these people lying to me? No. There could be reasons somebody would fall into this category and still be a browser,\" he said. \"But it distinctly increases suspicions.\"\n\nHe also looked at IP addresses. Unlike physical addresses, IP addresses can change. Say you plug your laptop into the Internet at a coffee shop, which assigns you an IP address. After you leave, someone else shows up and gets the same IP address. So an IP address alone doesn't necessarily distinguish users.\n\nThere's another identifier: a particular browser on a particular operating system, which leads to what's called a user agent string. There are thousands of distinct strings.\n\nIP addresses and user agent strings can collide, but Wendt said odds are dramatically lower that two people will collide on the same IP address and user agent string within a short period such as a day. That tells him they're probably different people.\n\nNow he needs to bridge the gap between splitting groups and identifying targets of ill-intentioned emails. He has submitted proposals to further his research after the current funding ends this spring.\n\n\"The problem is significant,\" he said. \"Humans are one of the best avenues for entering a secure network.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\nComputer scientists in India have developed a two-pronged algorithm that can detect the presence of a botnet on a computer network and block its malicious activities before it causes too much harm. The team ...\n\nWeb site policy makers who use robots.txt files as gatekeepers to specify what is open and what is off limits to Web crawlers have a bias that favors Google over other search engines, say Penn State researchers whose study ...\n\n(Phys.org)\u2014How unsafe are mobile browsers? Unsafe enough that even cyber-security experts are unable to detect when their smartphone browsers have landed on potentially dangerous websites, according to areAs someone that has pored over accesslogs daily since 1997 this is obvious. I wrote a daemon that runs as root and accepts piped weblog output and automatically bans suspicious ip addresses with iptables, and distributes the knowledge via mysql replication to other servers to defend themselves. Length of ban is proportional to number of times banned, or any other combination of rules, and I have collected over a million hacked ip addresses and spams from zombies and proxies. One day it might be useful to someone.\n\nAgent strings can't be trusted at all, and behaviour can be synthesized, especially if attacker reads this!\n\nFor email, best way of avoiding spear phishing is to prominently display the source ip address and resolved address. Even an idiot can tell that it isn't from paypal if it came from Vietnam, however cleverly crafted the mail. Outlook and mobile phone mail apps do not show this basic info unless the user jumps through hoops to find it. SPF & DKIM should be enforced too"}

{"text": "Above: Gary McKinnon and his mother, Janis Sharp. Below, a guest opinion post by Oxblood Ruffin, a writer and human rights activist based in Munich, Germany.\n\nGary McKinnon is a Scottish technical expert, or as he is referred to by US federal prosecutors, the perpetrator of \"the greatest military hack of all time.\" This claim is \"total fucking bullshit\", a phrase common amongst information security professionals.\n\nAlthough Mr. McKinnon has high name-recognition factor in the United Kingdom he is virtually unknown to the American public. He is a mentally challenged hacker who waltzed through ninety-seven US military Web sites before being caught. Mr. McKinnon was looking for evidence of UFOs. He has Asperger Syndrome, a form of autism. It doesn't make him Rain Man but it does create a different perceptual framework.\n\nGary McKinnon was arrested in the UK in November 2002 after a thirteen month hacking spree into US military networks. He was eventually caught because he used his own email address to download a program called RemotelyAnywhere. Before the bust McKinnon had been under surveillance by Britain's High Tech Crime Unit. But then he did that, dare I say, retarded thing.\n\nGary McKinnon left his email address plus a number of taunting messages such as, \"Your security is crap\" on US military servers. Personally, I think the messages were on the polite side. America's military network security is the cyber equivalent of Swiss cheese. My granny could have pulled off McKinnon's hacks and she was well in the grave before they even transpired. Because remember, if you wanted to intrude into US military sites in 2001 all you had to do was key in: user = guest; password = hello.\n\nAnd so Gary McKinnon was arrested by the High Tech Crime Unit in Britain. He detailed everything and confessed without an attorney being present. Now bear in mind, this is a guy who has Asperger and didn't fully comprehend the consequences of what he had done. Yet his confession was signed-off on, and the process began.\n\nUS Federal prosecutors told McKinnon's attorney that if he traveled to America and pleaded guilty that he'd only get eighteen months to three years in prison. McKinnon declined as the offer was not put in writing, although a similar offer was later filed in court papers. Accordingly, Mr. McKinnon was charged in the United States with seven counts of computer fraud at ten years per count [PDF Link] Then came the Lapdog Treaty.\n\nIn March 2003 - one year after Gary McKinnon was nabbed - David Blunkett (then home secretary to Tony Blair) secretly popped over to America to sign the 2003 Extradition Act. It was a legal arrangement between Britain and the US to fast track terrorists from one side of the Atlantic to the other. The terms of the agreement can most charitably be described as asymmetric. Legal scholars can have a wank-fest over the minutiae of the arrangement but it boils down to this. If America wants someone from the UK they need only apply reasonable suspicion. Whereas, if the UK wants someone from America then they must prove probable cause.\n\nReasonable suspicion is the standard to make an arrest; probable cause is the standard to indict.\n\nIn real terms, British prosecutors are required to surmount an evidential barrier that American defendants can contest before extradition to the UK. But American prosecutors can extradite any British citizen with substantially lower standards. Even if British citizens were not in the vicinity of a crime, they could not argue to the contrary. It's the law. Check it out on Google.\n\nThe sad fact is that it''s easier to extradite a British citizen to the US than it is to extradite a New York resident to California. If the 2003 Extradition Act were a two way street then one side would be a superhighway and the other side would be a dirt road, with potholes. Compounding this nonsense is that the treaty was intended to be applied to terrorists, and not utilized retroactively against mentally-challenged eccentrics.\n\nFrom McKinnon's arrest in 2002 to date, his case has garnered an extraordinary amount of ink in the UK. It started with hysterical claims by US federal prosecutors; traversed the fact and fiction of the file; included McKinnon's diagnosis as an Asperger sufferer; circumnavigated the extent of the British judicial system; personified McKinnon as the victim of the Lapdog Treaty; saw famous musicians record a song in his support, and celebrities flock to his cause; and generally, piss off the British press and every sensible person in the United Kingdom. All of this was in no small measure due to the efforts of Janis Sharp, Gary McKinnon's mother. She is best described as a cross between the mother that everyone would love to have and the Archangel Michael. For the atheists out there, this equation represents an ocean of love mixed with a tidal wave of whup-ass.\n\nAlthough most people accept that politicians steal candy from the same children they kiss for the cameras, the public draws the line at inhumanity. No government is allowed to play Russian roulette with a person's life. Because what is fundamental to this case, once you strain away Labour's craven mendacity, is that Gary McKinnon's life is at risk. He suffers from an anxiety-prone version of Asperger that is exacerbated by stress. And that is what the British public understands even if the government refuses to confront the truth.

They're the medical opinions of leading experts in their fields.\n\ntoyg\n\nPeople arguing that \"he should be punished where the server is\" make me laugh. The US routinely refuse to accept the (otherwise commonly-held) notion that military personnel, while off-duty, should abide by the law of the land where they are physically located. An off-duty US soldier kills some people in a pub in (say) Japan, runs to his base, is shipped back to the States in no time and the US is under no obligation to punish him. But when somebody f*cks with a server\u2026 then physical location is all important! Give me a break.\n\nThis is just the US military flexing muscles because they've been found with their pants down. They are reacting like all bullies do: beating the little guy. That was to be expected. What it was not expected was the shameful behaviour of the UK government, so appallingly accepting of his new status as province of the northamerican empire, directly ruled from Washington. That extradition treaty is terrible and is obviously being misused. Labour should accept this fact and work to renegotiate it or drop it, but all politicians nowadays seem to be completely unable to accept they've been wrong, even when it results in them looking like Lemmings walking towards their electoral annihilation.\n\nMoriarty\n\n\"Bill Gates has Asperger's syndrome. Would you argue that he can never be held responsible for a crime because he's so mentally challenged?\"\n\nThere is a lot of speculation that he might, but he's undiagnosed. You shouldn't repeat that is if it's fact, considering the amount of misinformation around.\n\nAnd, obviously, it's a spectrum condition. Bill Gates' aspergers, if he has it, is almost certainly not like McKinnon's. Also remember that (bolded for general emphasis, not yelling at you) there is much more to aspergers than just being socially awkward and having intense interests. \"Nerd\" /= aspie.\n\nAkula971\n\nWow , just when people over here in the UK thought that the US government could not get any more unpopular they did this. Just for the record, most British people did not want a war in Iraq, or to go into Afghanistan. We don't really approve of our poorly equipped troops being killed on a daily basis in support of American foreign oil policy. Our pathetic Labour government will be consigned to the scrap heap at the next election, because we will remember that they took us into an immoral illegal war. Most people think that the UK does not have a bill of rights, but we do and they like to keep it quiet. Made in1689, one of its provisions is that no UK citizen shall be subject to foreign laws.\n\nNote to American visiting the UK and Europe. Pretend to be Canadians\u2026LOL\n\nRazzabeth\n\nThe US is being an idiot. Why don't they do with this hacker what they have done with hackers in the past?\n\nUsually they say, \"You have done a very terrible thing, for which you may be terribly punished with many years in prison. Unless, of course, you agree to come and work for us.\"\n\nPerfect solution. US government gets their security upgraded by the man who broke it all down, damages and costs are reversed, mentally different man gets job security for the rest of his life while at the same time realizing the weight of what he did and being appropriately punished for it (by becoming a \"slave\", though a slave with health/dental, sick pay, vacation time, pension, etc). UK government realizes their mistake when they let another government take a very valuable resource from their country. Everyone wins!\n\nAnonymous\n\nThose stressing the legal necessity of extraditing Gary have completely missed the point\u2026 it is to be done according to a treaty signed one year after the crime! THAT'S NOT LEGAL. So everyone can agree that the extradition is bullshit, and Gordon Brown is a craven prison bitch of a man for even letting things go this far.

People with Aspergers aren't mentally \"slow.\" Besides, if he learned how to hack sites, he had a very good understanding of what it meant and why others considered it wrong. Confessing before talking to a lawyer was stoopid, but can't be blamed on him being an Aspie.\n\nAntinous / Moderator\n\nIf he really has Asperger's, and not some other form of autism, then he knew exactly what he had done! People with Aspergers aren't mentally \"slow.\"\n\nI think that you grossly underestimate the effects of Asperger-related problems like the inability to comprehend metaphors. Daniel Tammet (whose IQ is in the 150s) talks about how hard it was for him to realize that \"Take a seat\" didn't mean \"Pick up a chair and leave.\" That kind of difficulty can seriously compromise one's ability to understand social constructs like private space. Some people with Asperger may have mild Aspie symptoms and not be particularly bright. Others might be geniuses with severe inabilities to function in the world. There's not a single profile.\n\nRevEng\n\nThat's a tough fight these people have on their hands.\n\nWhile this guy's intentions may have been, in some ways, honorable, he also broke dozens of federal laws. Defacing websites? Trying to access classified information? Guys, this is what computer laws were designed to protect against. It doesn't matter that he thought he would only get a few years, or that he wasn't trying to be malicious \u2014 he was fully aware that he was breaking the law.\n\nWhile I agree the US is going to take him to town (and make an example out of him), which is COMPLETELY unfair (you should be punished in accordance with your crimes, not in accordance with how much of a spectacle the court desires), the crime he committed was perpetrated mainly on American victims and broke American laws, so he should be tried in an American court under American law. If he doesn't like it, maybe he shouldn't have been hacking American military systems.\n\nMcKinnon is probably right. The US military's security is crap. They are probably hiding information about UFOs. But that's not an excuse to break the law and hack into their computer systems.\n\nIf he really was obsessed with it, maybe he can get a psychologist to claim he has some sort of insanity and toss him in a psyche ward. It's probably better than spending 70 years in a federal penitentiary.\n\nknodi\n\nI can see arguing that extradition isn't the best tool for this job\u2026 but this guy is NOT retarded. An autistic person probably wouldn't be held responsible for their actions, but asperger's is not the same thing. Bill Gates has Asperger's syndrome. Would you argue that he can never be held responsible for a crime because he's so mentally challenged?\n\nThis guy knew what he was doing was wrong. So his motive wasn't to give our secrets to the terrorists\u2026 Fine. Call that a mitigating circumstance. Don't extradite him; the british have a perfectly adequate court system.\n\nBut stop saying he's not guilty because he's \"not mentally competent\" or that \"he was only looking for proof of UFOs\". That's disingenuous, to say the least.\n\nLaws shouldn't be written so vague that they are then applied tangential things without consideration of severity.\n\npretending to shoot someone with a toy gun should not be prosecuted as severely as actualy shooting someone with a real gun.\n\nand as a Canadian who watches America go against NAFTA whenever it doesnt hand them the best deal (ignoring WTO), but applies it hard when it funnels them cash (taking enemies to task with WTO), I totally expect to see them making unfair deals such as the US/UK extradition law for many years to come.\n\nMadMolecule\n\nThe reasonable suspicion/probable cause issue seems to be a red herring in this case. If this article is to be believed, there's no real question as to whether he committed these cybercrimes; the \"probable cause\" and \"reasonable suspicion\" tests are both met.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but I suspect the outrage here is because hacking is seen as a \"victimless\" crime. Which is absurd.\n\nAnonymous\n\nIve met people who are guilty and admit it. But I never met a person who is guilty, admits it and doesnt expect to do any time. The porblem is that not a lot of international law is written. Asperger syndrome aside, a crime was commited. Someone has to be punished. Just because a car is sitting on the street with keys in ignition does not mean that a person is free to take it. If he does, thats a crime.\n\nThe problem in this case is Asperger. I do not agree with the US stance on wanting to jail him. An appropriate sentence would be to take away his computer priveledges and put him on probation with observation.\n\nAntinous / Moderator\n\nSomeone has to be punished.\n\nThat's a deeply disturbing statement.\n\nAnonymous\n\nSo, US military sites can be hacked into by 'some guy' in the UK and the only way they found him was due to him stuffing around by sending messages and using his real email address.\n\nDo you think foreign governments are doing this without sending stupid remarks or using their 'real' email address.\n\nMaybe they should start the x-prize for US military sites. If you can hack in and you tell us how you did it, we'll give you $1,000,000. Pretty cheap for covering up such a major security hole IMHO.\n\nOnigorom\n\nIf one criminal steals from another criminal, would we call that a crime? Of course the criminal who is stolen from, would call it 'illegal'. The US have a vicious criminal record, and the military is a major part of it, so I don t think it is illegitimate to steal from them. Actually, I believe it is a moral obligation (but not necessarily a political one).\n\nLaw is nothing but a societal manifested form of violence. Law is a violation of law already. When we breach it we are subjected to this very form of violence. The hacker mimics the procedures of state institutions: if he were a nation state his activities would be called espionage. It is not the act of hacking but the fact that he is alone that subjects him to the law, to violence.\n\nAnonymous\n\nThe \"general protestor\" in the green jacket appears to be Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty.\n\nTakuan\n\nall he is guilty of is telling pompous bastards they aren't the center of the fucking universe.\n\nKanedaJones\n\n@Madmolecule\n\n\"If they don't prosecute, that will set a precedent that it's OK to hack into government computers as long as you don't hurt anything while you're in there.\"\n\nyour sentence breaks down into \"it will let people know its ok if you dont hurt anything\" and I find that funny.\n\nBut I'm assuming you really mean like how jaywalking isn't prosecuted often and we are so overrun by them?\n\nsound fine to me.\n\nand yes I know it costs a gazillion dollars for the US to ping the bastards who hack them.. so send people the bill when they do that.

(for the record us Canadians are Britian's good kid who can do no wrong lol)\n\nAnonymous\n\nThe aspect of this case which is left out from this summary is that while (pending court appeals, etc) the US seems to have the right to demand extradition from the UK, but if the nations were switched then the UK would NOT have the right to demand such a hacker be extradited from the US.\n\nWhile a lot of the talk centres on the fact that he has Aspergers, was looking for UFOs, didn't really mean any harm etc, I think a lot of the strength of feeling that powers the debate is rooted in this disparity.\n\nWhich is to say: people talk about his mental age, and so forth, but at the same time they're defending a UK citizen against a foreign power, and attempting to correct a lopsided power balance in the international relationship.\n\nShorter UK citizens: \"Cry me a river\".\n\nAnonymous\n\n\u2026 or perhaps the outrage is because the computers he hacked had weak security\u2026 and breaking into an easy target is really just giving the owner of that system what they're asking for\u2026 y'know, kinda like the girl with the provocative outfit walking down the dark street and\u2026 oh wait, blaming the victim is wrong now?\n\nKanedaJones\n\n@53 Onigorom\n\npeople trade freedom from other's force of will, for the benefits of collectives.

This is a non reciprocal treaty in that America has no obligation to extradite one of its own citizens to the UK if said citizen was caught hacking through the Ministry of Defence Network\u2026.\n\nThat f**ing stinks \u2013 Thank you very much Tony Blair.\n\nThe same laws were also used to extradite bankers who were involved in the shady dealing behind the ENRON collapse. Now whilst I can understand why there are some folk in the US that are a bit pissed about that happening, once again If it was some US bankers bringing down BP You can be damn sure the US wouldn't extradite them to the UK.\n\nThe aspergers thing is a bit of a side issue really. The main problem is that the UK government, much like the US have used 9/11 and surrounding events as an opportunity to eat away at our respective countries civil liberties.\n\npmhparis\n\nHere's my take on the car analogies:\n\nThe driver for a number of ambulances/police cars/whatever leave the vehicle open in an open car park with minimal surveillance. Some idiot thinks that it would be a great joke to sprinkle talcum powder all over the interiors & leave a note saying \"You should have locked it, I spread anthrax so you're now DEAD!\".\n\nSome people say, well it was just a prank, ha ha their security sucks.\n\nI say, the prankster maliciously caused the vehicules to be unavailable because they needed to be decontaminated as their was no way to be certain that it was ALL just talcum powder. The prankster is thus liable for every expense subject to his acts.\n\nTo all the left wingers who joyously proclaimed \"Obama was elected, The world is SAVED!\": Note that it is now Obama's justice dept that is continuing to try & lock the twit up.\n\nmdh\n\nkaneda \u2013 do you understand that the difference between a reason and an excuse is your own bloodlust?\n\nOxblood Ruffin\n\nWell, this has been fun. Who would have guessed that Gary McKinnon could excite so much discussion, some of it even reasonable.\n\nAt the end of the day the only thing that Mr. McKinnon's supporters want is that he is tried in the UK and receives proper healthcare.\n\nHe can either do time or community service, whatever the courts decide. But the paramount piece is that he receives psychological counseling and is talked down from the ledge of taking his own life.\n\nAlthough I do think that what he did was trivial, I don't believe it is excusable. There should be some consequences, but consequences commensurate with the actual crime; not a typical over-reaction to something that neither caused property damage nor physical harm.\n\nRob Beschizza\n\nThis case is obscured by the nonsense written about it; it's been heavily mythologized by the press in the U.K., which repeatedly suggests he's going to federal pound-me-in-the-a prison for the rest of his life, when if fact he's already turned down a publicly-disclosed deal that would have him out much sooner.The likely out come is that he'll be flown over, he'll receive a short custodial sentence, serve a few months and be shipped home. Everyone knows this, but it isn't a story that can be sold to little Englanders who want a nice Love Actually moment to cherish.\n\nMadMolecule\n\nInteresting you should use a word with such a specific meaning to describe something so vaguely related. I thought lawyerin' required razor sharp discourse.\n\nCorrect. It does. Surfing BoingBoing is not lawyering. You're still ignoring my point.\n\nI could also have pointed out the long established principle of the proportionality of the penalty, but it's evidently long been forgotten in the US (example: 3 strike bullshit).\n\nI haven't said a word about what penalty I think he should receive. I do believe, for the reasons I've stated above, that a penalty of some kind is fully appropriate.\n\n56: \"I'm sure we've both broken laws in our lives; does that mean we're incapable of commiting crimes against one another?\"\n\nNobody is incapable of commiting crimes, which is why there is a law. But to 'commit a crime' and to 'breach a law' are two entirely different aspects.\nMy point was that among criminals there is not such a thing as 'crime' if one's own group is concerned. And this resembles procedures of state. Historically, for example, the colonial robbery of land found later legal justifications ('private property').\nCases as the above just remind me of this genuine gesture of land grabbing, feeling oneself above the law and hoping that ones action will become law one day. \u2013 just to remind you of the pirate parties.\n\nNixarInteresting you should use a word with such a specific meaning to describe something so vaguely related. I thought lawyerin' required razor sharp discourse. I also believed that DAs or US attorneys had a large degree of discretion in what/how they prosecute.\n\nAlso, here's a free debating tip: Responding to a point by saying \"whatever\" has never convinced anyone of anything.\n\nI could also have pointed out the long established principle of the proportionality of the penalty, but it's evidently long been forgotten in the US (example: 3 strike bullshit).\n\nTakuan\n\nor maybe he'll die.\n\nNixar\n\n@Moriarty: IWell if you did that, you'd be charge withd breaking and entering.

The attackers missed a chance to make reference to a recent mass marketing campaign from the White House justifying recent healthcare reforms that some have described as spam as supposedly justifying an \"aggressive response\", for example.\n\nVisitors to the ropey site punted by the spam are told to come back regularly for updates and warned that security scanner software may come to identify the software on offer as malign, and consign it to quarantine.\n\nThat's certainly true, though not for the reasons suggested.\n\nThe \"DDoS Obama\" spam was one theme of a larger spam run, reports email security firm Proofpoint. Other spam messages in the series offered more typical lures, such as pornography, while again pointing to the same malware download.\n\nAs Proofpoint helpfully explains, users would be foolhardy to take the description offered by hackers at face value.

Organized protests are what political parties do between elections. At elections they organize the turnout. All parties, all countries. The Democrats control both houses of congress, and they can pass anything they can get all the Democrats to agree on. Obama will sign it.

{"text": "The importance of Security for every Internet User\n\nThis past week, I presented at a large cybersecurity conference in Monterrey, Mexico. The conference wasand attended by many leading companies based in Latin America. Mexico is a gateway to Latin America from the United States and is important in a large number of ways to the cybersecurity of both the region and the global Internet community. Monterrey is a city that is home to a large number of multinational corporations and Mexico City, the country's capital, is also one of the world's largest cities. Both of these facts highlight the critical importance of Mexico to cybersecurity.\n\nOne issue raised during the conference is worth special attention. Some of the attendees expressed uncertainty about how the individual Internet user can contribute to cybersecurity. The view seemed to be that government and corporations have greater power to secure infrastructure, so the individual has only a minor role in cybersecurity. I believe this is a misguided view. This is much like saying that because the government maintains the roadways, that we can ignore the safety of cars on the roads. This is clearly illogical, yet the same view is sometimes applied to cyberspace. Individual Internet users may actually be increasing in importance to cybersecurity.\n\nFor years, Cybercriminals have harnessed the collective power of unsecured computers to operate \"botnets\" --groups of remotely controlled computers. These botnets are used to launch \"denial of service\" attacks against governments and companies. Such attacks can paralyze a business by blocking online communication channels. Botnets may also be used to send vast amounts of spam, some of which may even contain phishing attacks designed to infect new computers. Looking closer at the corporate environment, cybersecurity is only as strong as the weakest link. Some recent threats against industrial machines are believed to have been introduced by individuals who ignored good security practices and infected the systems.\n\nThe individual Internet user needs to follow good security practices not only for their own protection, but because of the critically important contribution that each individual makes to the security of the entire Internet eco-system. A lack of security at the individual level risks an entire government or corporate network. An individual infected device can also be used as part of a botnet to harm other individual users. For these reasons, the individual Internet user remains critically important to maintaining a safe Internet for everyone."}
{"text": "Categories\n\nSubscribe\n\nArchive\n\nSecurity\n\nAre you a sitting duck for hackers?\n\nOur global Internet neighborhood continues to grow at an astounding rate. And like almost any other neighborhood, it can be dangerous. In the real world most of us intuitively know the do's and don'ts of staying reasonably safe: don't take candy from a stranger, don't flash loads of cash, etc. We know this from experience and from what our parents have taught us.\n\nUnfortunately, in the brave new world of the Internet, things are not as straightforward. The underlying reason why this is the case is that our perception of what is happening inside our computers is very limited. For example, if somebody was trying to steal your wallet, you would be able to see it and feel it. If, on the other hand, a hacker is stealing credit card information from your computer, you may find out about this months later.\n\nSo how do you minimize your chances of being a victim of computer crime? One of the best things to start with, is to realize that some online behaviors are much more risky than others. For example, using file sharing software, such as Morpheus or LimeWire virtually guarantees a spyware infection, unless your computer is equipped with industrial-strength security software that is properly configured and up to date."}

UK researchers have also hacked consoles to investigate game piracy.\n\nWhy is the US military interested in combing through your saved games, though? It could be that the navy is checking Gamer scores to recruit video-game-trained future soldiers, but it's more likely interested in extracting any sensitive information exchanged through the messaging services found in modern consoles.\n\nBritish tabloid The Sun recently reported that \"terrorists\" are using games like Call of Duty as \"training tools\". That's highly unlikely, unless al-Qaida has decided to take up pawning noobs \u2013 but it is possible that plotters worried about phone or email taps may have turned to alternative modes of communication."}
{"text": "If you think about it, this could provide more information on your opponents. Though it is a bit of a gamble - can you get valuable information without too much risk? Or, is it worth the risk?\n\nThink about the whole process of infiltration. Once you get your foot in the door you start gathering information and testing the waters to see what you can do. If you don't think you've been discovered, but you have, then the defenders have some good opportunities. They can feed you false intelligence, make you think you are burrowing into an important control system that's actually a honeypot, give them a false sense of accomplishing their goal, waste their time and resources. Done properly, this is very useful counter-intelligence.\n\nFooling the other guy is valuable. Tricking the other guy into thinking he's fooled you can be even more valuable. I think that's the core of what this is about. But as I said before, it's a risk, and could get out of control.\n\nAnd then when something bad happens they'll blame it on incompetence and say they need better tools to prevent attacks like this and roll out the next round of cyber laws they have sitting in the drawer targeted at domestic citizens.\n\n\"According to reports, which were confirmed Friday by ICS-CERT, an active Phishing campaign is responsible for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issuing three warnings since the end of March that the natural gas industry has been under ongoing cyber attack.\"\n\nA phishing campaign. Because companies shouldn't already be protecting against these.\n\nMore, \"The specter of a cyber attack against critical infrastructure is a reality, but not because the DHS is guarding the Internet, but because the networks running the critical infrastructure are so poorly protected. It's gotten to the point that simple Phishing attacks, things that proper email protection and awareness training cover, rate three separate warnings and alerts.\"\n\nSo it's obvious we need widespread and over encompassing legislation like CISPA that bypasses any and all existing laws and regulations regarding privacy, and that grants the NSA a legal mandate and access to any and all information collected... to protect against phishing attacks.\n\nIt could be any of that. It could be my neighbor, for all I know. DHS has cried wolf enough times that they can't be trusted anymore. Maybe they are honest some of the time - like you pointed out, that certainly could be the case here - but... meh.\n\n\"A US military spy plane illegally entered Chinese airspace and collided with a Chinese interceptor, killing the Chinese pilot.\"\n\nReally?\n\nThat's not exactly correct. US surveillance aircraft do not violate China's sovereign airspace, but Chinese fighters would routinely harass US aircraft in what China claims as an \"exclusive economic zone\" in the South China Sea, not recognized by the US, and not considered sovereign airspace. \"The PRC interprets the Convention as allowing it to preclude other nations' military operations within this area, while the United States maintains that the Convention grants free navigation for all countries' aircraft and ships, including military aircraft and ships, within a country's exclusive economic zone.\"\n\nChina's fighters routinely buzzed US EP-3's, and if you're actually asserting that an EP-3 is maneuverable enough to cause a collision with a Chinese J-8 fighter, then you are either deluded, or a member of the PRC's 50 Cent Party. The US EP-3 had to enter Chinese airspace in order to conduct an unauthorized emergency landing on Hainan Island, after which NSA's secure operating system was completely compromised by China [newyorker.com], with a US Admiral later observing, \"It was grim,\" and a US official responding to a question of whether China could be \"that good\" by saying, \"they only invented gunpowder in the tenth century and built the bomb in 1965. I'd say, 'Can you read Chinese?' We don't even know the Chinese pictograph for 'Happy hour.'\"\n\nSo yeah, go ahead and assert that China would somehow be a better global steward of human rights.\n\nNot reacting immediately to advanced, targeted intruders is standard tactics, and recommended by most experts in the field. This is news to Slashdot because folks here usually only deal with mass criminal attacks, which are a different beast entirely.\n\nThis isn't a DHS conspiracy, not even one for new funding. It's just the government advocating reasonable measure even though I'm sure they knew they'd get pilloried for it. I rarely respect the DHS, but in this case I may make an exception.\n\nNo; real world equivalent; there are a bunch of possible terrorists wandering around the airport carrying things that look like bombs but you don't know if they really are or how they are triggered. Your visiting security experts have identified a few of them but you know there are many more. You quickly work out that the terrorists can go in and out of the building at will completely bypassing the security gate and have been doing so for weeks on end, but you don't know how. You tell the guy in charge of the security thugs at the door not to alert the terrorists until you have time to get back up and hopefully wait for a quieter gap between flight arrivals."}
{"text": "Public Transport card fully hacked\n\nWhat experts foresaw last December and the Dutch research institute TNO denies was possible in their recent report has been done. The deepest level of data-encryption on the NXP Mifare RFID chip has been hacked. Cash from cards can now be copied to other cards through cloning and that makes this system utterly unsuitable for serious applications involving real people and real money.\n\nBut this is essentially old news. The more interesting news as far as I'm concerned is the fact that TNO was immediately re-hired by the company implementing the card system to do more research on the validity of the hack. You have to wonder what the thinking is here. This company dropped the ball on at least three separate occasions in this area so why do they get another chance to write a big rapport to claim 'there is no problem' ? And this is not the first time, on the sensitive subject of voting computers (now banned in The Netherlands) they also kept telling us 'all is well'.\n\nIf you merely want a paper to reassure yourself just ask the secretary to print out a pretty picture from the Interweb with a caption that says 'everything will be ok'. That's a lot cheaper then hiring a company like TNO, and apparently just as valid.\n\nDoes TNO just write down whatever the customer asks of them or do they really not know any better? Either alternative is troublesome. As an important expert-adviser to the governments we should hold TNO to a higher standard. When faced with an impossible request from a client they should respectfully decline the job explain that the client's request is either technically impossible or not in line with laws concerning citizen privacy and such.\n\nOur government (and parliament!) allowing such organizations to indirectly guide technology policy is a real problem that will continue to cost us dearly (in real money, privacy violations, theft and missed technology opportunities).\n\nNext up for big IT-projects is a road-toll system that should allow for more flexible costs of (pay-as-you-go) owning and using a car. Hopefully it won't be as insecure as this project, that could be expensive for government or the citizen (or both).\n\nTomorrow there will be a meeting in parliament on this matter. The independent experts (the ones that got it right from day 1) have decided to boycott this meeting since they are not allowed access to the 'secret' paragraph of the most recent TNO rapport. They wisely refuse to legitimize more 'security-by-obscurity' bullshit."}
{"text": "A hacker wearing a fake beard and dark sunglasses took the stage at a computer security conference in Miami on Thursday and showed a group of about 60 security researchers how to intercept the radio communications between Silver Spring Networks, a maker of smart grid technology, and its clients, which include major utilities like Pacific Gas and Electric and Pepco Holdings.\n\nThe hacker, who goes by the moniker Atlas, stopped short of showing how to inflict damage to these systems, but the implication of his presentation was clear: If you can understand the way these systems speak to one another, the potential to hack them is very real. And, the logic continues, if you can hack these systems, then you could tinker with an oil or gas pipeline, or cause a power failure.\n\nPerhaps the reason he \"stopped short of showing how to inflict damage to these systems\" is because he can't. As far as I can tell from this article, he's intercepting encrypted communications, and if he can't decrypt them, then the system is working as designed. But it would be too much to ask the NYT to think critically about the dots a guy in a disguise is connecting.\n\nThis is a good piece on how Internet-connected devices like pacemakers, smart meters, and coffee machines are designed without much thought given to security. This is true and articles like this one thankfully sound the alarm. But what to make of this:\n\nThe same thing was true of computer-software companies, he pointed out. Not until credit-card numbers by the millions began to be stolen did they begin to pay attention. \"We live in a reactive society,\" McClure went on, \"and something bad has to happen before we take problems seriously. Only when these embedded computers start to kill a few people\u2014one death won't do it\u2014will we take it seriously.\"\n\nIs this a lament? I for one wouldn't like to live in a 'proactive' society where innovation took a back seat to security and we had to be sure something was safe before it was allowed. Yeah, some harm is going to have to happen (not just speculated) before the market reacts, and that's a feature, not a bug.\n\nAllegedly stolen from PricewaterhouseCooper's Tennessee office on Aug. 25. The group wants $1 million in bitcoins from Romney by September 28 or they say they will make them public. So lulzy if real, but why would they make their extortion demand public if it's true?\n\nThat's the proposition I am defending in a week-long online debate at The Economist versus Symantec CTO Greg Day. Please check out our opening statements, and by all means feel free to vote for my side.\n\nBy the way, didn't it just come out inThe Washington Post that the United States helped attack Iran with Flame, Stuxnet and related programs? If they did this to us, wouldn't we consider it an act of war? Didn't we just take a major step toward militarizing the internet? Doesn't it seem plausible to you that the cyber-assault is not yet over and thus we face immediate questions looking forward? Won't somebody fairly soon try to do it to us? Won't it encourage substitution into more dangerous biological weapons?\n\nThose are good questions. Let's take them in turn.\n\nIf they did it to us, would we consider it an act of war? I tend to agree with Franz-Stefan Gady's perspective that Stuxnet should not be considered an act of war. One of the most overlooked aspects of the great reporting done by the NYT and WaPo uncovering the details of Stuxnet is that the U.S. did not \"hack in\" to Iran's nuclear facilities from thousands of miles away. Instead it had to rely on Israel's extensive intelligence apparatus to not only understand the target, but to deliver the worm as well. That is, humans had to physically infiltrate Iran's operations to engage in the spying and then the sabotage.\n\nEspionage is not an act of war under international law. Nations expect and tolerate espionage as an inevitable political practice. Spies are sometimes prosecuted criminally when caught, sometimes traded for other spies, and often simply expelled from the country. Sabotage I'm less certain about, but I think it inhabits a similar space as espionage: frowned up, prosecuted criminally, but not an act of war per se. (I've been trying to find the answer to that question in vein, so if any international law experts would like to send me the answer, I'd appreciate it.)\n\nSo what do we have with Flame? It's essentially spying, albeit in a frighteningly efficient manner. But, it's not act of war. Stuxnet is similarly not an act of war if we assume sabotage is not. There's little difference between Stuxnet and a spy infiltrating Natanz and throwing a wrench into the works. Stuxnet is just the wrench. Now, it's key to point out what makes Stuxnet political sabotage and not terrorism, and that is that there were no deaths, much less civilian deaths.\n\nDid we take a big step in militarizing the Internet? Won't somebody fairly soon try to do it to us? Well, it's already happening and it's been happening for years. U.S. government networks are very often the subject of espionage\u2014and maybe even sabotage\u2014by foreign states. If something feels new about Stuxnet, it's that for the first time we have definitive attribution to a state. As a result, the U.S. loses moral high ground when it comes to cybersecurity, and if someone doing it to the U.S. gets caught, they will be able to say, \"You started it.\" But they're already doing it. Not that it's necessarily a good thing, but the militarization of cyberspace is not just inevitable, it's been well underway for some time.\n\nFinally, Tyler asks, Won't it encourage substitution into more dangerous biological weapons? The answer to that, I think, is a definitive no. \"Cyber weapons\" are completely different from biological weapons and even chemical or conventional, and certainly nuclear. For one thing, they are nowhere nearas dangerous. No one has ever died from a cyber attack. Again, short of already being in a shooting war, these capabilities won't be employed beyond espionage and surgical sabotage like Stuxnet.\n\nThat raises the question, however, if we're in a shooting war with a Lybia or a Syria, say, will they resort to cyber? Perhaps, but as Thomas Rid has pointed out, the more destructive a \"cyber weapon\" the more difficult and costly it is to employ. Massively so. This is why it's probably only the U.S. at this point who has the capability to pull off an operation as difficult as Stuxnet, and then only with the assistance of Israel's existing traditional intelligence operation. Neither al Qaeda, nor Anonymous, nor even Iran will be able to carry out an operation on the same level as Stuxnet any time soon.\n\nSo, Tyler, you can sleep well. For now at least. ;o) Yes, we should have a national discussion about what sorts of weapons we want our government employing, and what sort of authorization and oversight should be required, but we should not panic or think we're a few keystrokes away from Armageddon. The more important question to me is, why does one keeps $2.85 million in bitcoin?\n\nOne [DHS] official used a technique known as \"spear fishing\" to gain access to his colleague's computer. With spear fishing, a hacker targets a computer user with an email containing an infected attachment.\n\nIn the demonstration, the official sent an email pretending to be his colleague's boss. The email included an attachment that appeared to be a copy of the Lieberman-Collins cybersecurity bill, but actually included malicious code. The hacker was then able to download confidential documents from the infected computer and even activate and view video from the computer's webcam.\n\nI'd like to know what part of the Liberman-Collins bill would prevent spear fishing attacks.\n\nI don't think you have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure out what is going on here. You've had three leaks of intelligence that paint the president as a strong leader. I don't think it's an accident that you have three stories within about 45 days that paint the Obama administration as being effective in the war on terror at our national security detriment.\n\nWhat's amazing to me about this is that the outrage is over the leaks (and their political consequences), not the fact that the president (and his predecessor) unilaterally ordered a cyberattack on another country. Dennis Kucinich seems to be the only one pointing this out.\n\nThis is a delicate issue since the Pentagon's own cyber strategy holds that \"computer sabotage coming from another country can constitute an act of war.\" At what point does executive control over covert activities cross the line? Is it good enough to brief just a few friendlies in Congress (and then swear them to secrecy)? Those are the question we should be debating.\n\n\n\nPreet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, in the NYT:\n\nThe alarm bells sound regularly: cybergeddon; the next Pearl Harbor; one of the greatest existential threats facing the United States. With increasing frequency, these are the grave terms officials invoke about the menace of cybercrime \u2014 and they're not understating the threat.\n\nAlso from the NYT, check out this archive of the 100+ stories they ran on \"the Y2K Problem.\"\n\nOne thing Mr. Bharara is right about, though, is the need for breach disclosure laws.\n\nThe unusually tight collaboration with Israel was driven by two imperatives. Israel's Unit 8200, a part of its military, had technical expertise that rivaled the N.S.A.'s, and the Israelis had deep intelligence about operations at Natanz that would be vital to making the cyberattack a success.\n\nWithout the extensive knowledge the Israelis had acquired about Natanz, and without their ability to get the worm into Natanz, the project would likely not have been possible. That is, the cybermagic depended on an elaborate, expensive and dangerous old-school spying operation. Again, cyberweapons like Stuxnet are not within reach of groups like Al Qaeda or Anonymous. Not even Iran today."}

{"text": "Vigilance is the only realistic defence in cyber war\n\nThe Ministry of Defence is recruiting hundreds of new cyber specialists, while the Pentagon has decided that an attack on US computer networks from another country may be deemed an act of war, meriting an armed response. Both moves are merely acknowledgement that the internet, once considered a background support system, is now a front line of modern conflict, both commercial and military.\n\nOnce the phenomenon was a curiosity, lending itself to a film such as the 1983 Wargames, about a teenage hacker who breaks into a Pentagon supercomputer and almost unleashes World War III. Today, the threat is perhaps less dramatic but more dangerous and complicated. Cyber attacks are pernicious, pervasive, and constant. The past 12 months have seen well-publicised assaults on Google, Sony, and Lockheed Martin, the largest US defence contractor. But a myriad others go unreported.\n\nCyber attacks have two main purposes: to steal and to disrupt. The former, exemplified by the Lockheed Martin incident, is but a 21st-century version of espionage, the world's second oldest profession. The second, as the Pentagon's new approach underlines, is war by other means. Imagine, for instance, the devastating impact of an invisible cyber bomb that took out the electricity grids of London or the north-east US for any length of time. The problem is how to deal with such attacks.\n\nRetaliation, whether in kind or otherwise, is clearly one response \u2013 but against whom?. Consider the 2010 Stuxnet computer worm attack that disrupted Iran's suspected nuclear arms programme: perish the thought that the US and/or Israel had anything to do with it. The source of a cyber attack can be hard to pin down: is it a malicious hacker, a corporate rival, a terrorist group, or a national government? In other words, is it mischief, or is it war?\n\nA better response might be reinforced international co-operation, perhaps an international convention. But given the nature of the cyber-beast, that is akin to trying to corral the wind. The only realistic defence is constant vigilance. Cyber wars are likely to become even more pernicious and pervasive in the future.\n\nBuy the new Independent eBook - \u00a31.99 A celebration of those who risk their lives for women's rights, a century after Emily Wilding Davison's death."}

And not the good hackers (developers who \"hack\" constructive things like data sets and platforms), but malicious hackers \u2014 the ones who produce malware, steal information and harm your computer. Or, increasingly, your mobile device.\n\nA Mobile Threats Report from the Juniper Networks revealed that the amount of malware created for mobile devices across all operating systems more than doubled in 2011. Most of it was spyware \u2014 the stuff that steals your information. More than 63 percent of the malware found could track a phone's location and collect financial information.\n\nLast August, The New York Times reported that Android is the number one operating system targeted by hackers, mostly because Google does not use a vetting process to monitor new mobile apps. Apple demands that each app in the app store be approved, so it's more secure, though not perfect.\n\nAnd apps aren't the only way hackers can target your mobile device. Dangerous Trojans can be sent via text message. Juniper reported that 36 percent of malware found were Trojans sent via SMS.

{"text": "Don't fear the digital bogeyman. Virtual conflict is still more hype than reality.\n\nVery unlikely. When news of Stuxnet broke, the New York Times reported that the most striking\naspect of the new weapon was the \"collateral damage\" it created. The malicious\nprogram was \"splattered on thousands of computer systems around the world, and\nmuch of its impact has been on those systems, rather than on what appears to\nhave been its intended target, Iranian equipment,\" the Timesreported. Such\ndescriptions encouraged the view that computer viruses are akin to highly\ncontagious biological viruses that, once unleashed from the lab, will turn\nagainst all vulnerable systems, not just their intended targets.\n\nBut this metaphor is deeply\nflawed. As the destructive potential of a cyberweapon grows, the likelihood\nthat it could do far-reaching damage across many systems shrinks. Stuxnet did\ninfect more than 100,000 computers -- mainly in Iran, Indonesia, and India,\nthough also in Europe and the United States. But it was so specifically\nprogrammed that it didn't actually damage those machines, afflicting only\nIran's centrifuges at Natanz. The worm's aggressive infection strategy was\ndesigned to maximize the likelihood that it would reach its intended target.\nBecause that final target was not networked, \"all the functionality required to\nsabotage a system was embedded directly in the Stuxnet executable,\" the\nsecurity software company Symantec observed in its analysis of the worm's code.\nSo yes, Stuxnet was \"splattered\" far and wide, but it only executed its\ndamaging payload where it was supposed to.\n\nCollateral infection, in short, is not necessarily\ncollateral damage. A sophisticated piece of malware may aggressively infect\nmany systems, but if there is an intended target, the infection will likely\nhave a distinct payload that will be harmless to most computers.
