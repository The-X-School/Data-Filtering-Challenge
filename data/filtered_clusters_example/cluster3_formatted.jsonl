It should also be money that you feel comfortable risking. Think of your commodity account as an investment in a business. Many businesses fail. That's life. Make sure you won't be so afraid of losing money that it will affect your ability to make correct trading decisions.\n\nThe next part of your trading plan involves how you will make your actual buying and selling decisions.

They are: 1) Trade with the trend, 2) Cut losses short, 3) Let profits run, and 4) Manage risk. These building blocks are so basic and important that I have written a whole book about them. You should make sure your strategy includes each of these requirements for success."}

{"text": "The roof pattern is one I discovered\nin early 2005. I thought of it as a half diamond but a friend called it a roof pattern and\nthat's more descriptive.\nI found 203 roofs in 500 stocks from July 1991 to July 1996. That's one pattern for\nevery 12 years of data, which makes\nit a rare one indeed. Since it's performance is dreadful, it's not one you\nshould concern yourself with.\n\nRoof Trading Tips\n\nReference the Measure Rule figure to the right. Compute the height (the difference between the\nroof's high, A, and the low,\nB) and then multiply it by the above \"percentage\nmeeting price target.\" Subtract the result from the lowest low in the pattern\n(B) to get a target. The Measure Rule figure to the\nright shows the measure for a downward breakout.\n\nUptrends\n\nThe best performing roofs appear at the top of uptrends lasting less than 3 months in duration. A strong downtrend usually follows a sharp uptrend, returning\nprice back to (or slightly above) the launch point.\n\nConfirmation\n\nWait for confirmation before placing a trade because the breakout can be upward (but it's rare, occurring just 17% of the time)\n\nTall patterns outperform short ones.\nMeasure the height from highest peak to the horizontal bottom and divide it by the price of the horizontal bottom (the breakout\nprice). Height to breakout price values over 8.82% are considered tall.\n\nThe Measure Rule\n\nRoof Example\n\nThe above figure shows an example of a roof chart pattern. This is an unusual one because it has an upward breakout.\nHowever, it was so well defined, that I just had to show you. Aren't you impressed?"}

{"text": "some advice regarding a design approach for a complex strategy. (I'm ok with programming, I don't anticipate running into problems I can't handel -- famous last words.)\n\nQ1. Is it necessary to open a chart to run a strategy?\n\nQ2. The strategy I am planning involves an single indicator/oscillator derived from from three instruments and trading three other instruments together as a basket. Each of the first three instruments needs two timeframes. There is no obvious bar series (either from the indicator or the basket) that stands out as a preferred default. Do I just pick any one instrument as a default, open a chart and specify one of the time frames? What are the possible/likely unanticipated consequences of this undesired asymmetry between instruments?\n\nQ3. Do I have to open a separate chart for every instrument I wish to trade? If so, does each chart have to recalculate the oscillator separately? How do I keep the basket in synch?\n\nQ4. Is it possible to put the complete traded basket on a single chart, together with the oscillator from the non-traded instruments?\n\n1) No, see \"strategies\" tab and related docs\n2) Multi series indicators are not supported at this time. Strategies are though. Does not matter which series is the first\n\nThanks. I see.\n\nSo this raises a question. In my strategy code, how do I know which of the 6 currency pairs I have chosen (from the strategy dialog) as the default first series? Alternatively, how can I make the data series specified in the strategy dialog always be a default choice that the strategy code knows and the user can't change?\n\nI'm guessing that the answer to both questions is that I can't. And I can live with that answer (uncomfortably). But this irks me as I don't like to sacrifice generality, particularly when it requires me remembering unimportant stuff that I have put into the code (like which indicator pair I must always use for the first series).\n\nNow I have some different questions concerning the order of event handling.\n\n1. I have three instruments each with two Added bar series. The first is a multi-minute bar and the second is an indicator built on the first, but with an OnBarUpdate method called per tick. The OnBarUpdate method for the complete strategy also functions per tick. For any given instrument, which OnBarUpdate method gets called first? (In other words, how do I know if the indicator has already been updated when the strategy method is called?)\n\n2. If a tick coincides with a bar close, which event triggers OnBarUpdate first, the bar close or the tick?"}

The price falls below the former trough and then rises again. 3. Finally, the price falls again, but not as far as the second trough.\n\nOnce the final trough is made, the price heads upward toward the resistance found near the top of the previous troughs.

{"text": "Counter trend trading is affected by market cycles and more sensitive to the bar period than trend trading. Bob has told Alice that bar periods that are in sync with the worldwide markets - such as 4 or 8 hours - are especially profitable with this type of trading. Therefore she has set the bar period to a fixed value of 4 hours, or 240 minutes:\n\nBarPeriod = 240;\n\nThe counter trend trade rules are contained in the following lines that calculate the buy/sell signal:\n\nThe first line sets up a price series just as in the last workshop. The next one calculates the dominant period. That's the most significant cycle in a price curve which is normally a superposition of many cycles. If prices would oscillate up and down every two weeks, the dominant period would be 60 - that's the length of two weeks, resp. 10 trade days, counted in 4-hour-bars. Alice uses the DominantPeriod() analysis function with a cutoff period of 30 bars for finding the main price oscillation cycle in the range below 100 bars. The result DomPeriod is a series of dominant periods.\n\nBecause the dominant period fluctuates a lot, the next line passes the series through a lowpass filter, just like the price curve of the last workshop. The result is stored in a variable (not a series, thus no '*') LowPeriod that is the lowpass filtered dominant period of the current price curve.\n\nIn the next line, a highpass filter is fed with the price curve and its cutoff frequency is set to the dominant period. This removes the trend and all cycles that are lower than the dominant period from the price curve. The HighPass() function is similar to the LowPass function, it just does the opposite, and leaves only high frequencies, i.e. short cycles, in the price curve. The result is a modified price curve that consists mostly of the dominant cycle. It's stored in a new series named HP (for HighPass).\n\nAlice is not finished yet. The HP series is now compressed into a Gaussian distribution by applying the Fisher Transformation. This is an operation used to transform an arbitrary curve into a range where most values are in the middle - around 0 - and only few values are outside the +1...-1 range. For this transformation she calls the Fisher() function. It compresses the last 500 bars from the HP series into the Gaussian distributed Signal series. This method of trading with highpass filters, cycle detectors, and Fisher transform was developed by John Ehlers, an engineer who used signal processing methods for trading.\n\nThe next two lines define a new variable Threshold with a value of 1.0, and place a stop loss at an adaptive distance from the price, just as in Alice's trend trading script from some lessons ago. The ATR function is again used to determine the stop loss.\n\nWhen the Signal curve cosses the negative threshold from above - meaning when Signal falls below -1 - the price is supposedly at the bottom of the dominant cycle, so we expect the price to rise and buy long. When the threshold is crossed from below - meaning Signal rises above 1 - the price is at a peak and we buy short. This is just the opposite of what we did in trend trading. For identifying the threshold crossing we're using the crossOver() and crossUnder() functions.\n\n- Obviously, these trade rules are somewhat more complicated than the simple lowpass function of the previous lesson. So Alice needs to see how the various series look, for checking if everything works as supposed. The next line (at the end of the script)\n\nplot(\"DominantPeriod\", LowPeriod, NEW, BLUE);\n\ngenerates a plot of the LowPeriod variable in a NEW chart window with color BLUE. We can use this function to plot anything into the chart, either in the main chart with the price and equity curve, or below the main chart in a new window. The Signal curve and the upper and lower Threshold are plotted in another new chart window:\n\nThe first statement plots the Signal[0] value as a red curve (as we remember, adding a [0] to a series name gives its most recent value). The next two statements plot the positive and negative Threshold with two black lines in the same chart window. Note that the plot function always expects a value, not a series - that's why we needed to add the [0] to the Signal name.\n\nPlotWidth = 1000;\nPlotHeight1 = 300;\n\nThis just sets the width and height of the chart window. Below is the resulting chart. Load the script workshop5_1 and make sure that EUR/USD is selected. Click [Test], then click [Result]:\n\nThe blue curve in the middle window is the plot of LowPeriod. It moves mostly between 25 and 40 bars, corresponding to a 4..7 days dominant cycle. The bottom window shows the Signal series. The black lines are the thresholds that trigger buy and sell signals when Signal crosses over or under them. Plotting variables and series in the chart greatly helps to understand and improve the trade rules. For examining a part of the chart in details, the StartDate and NumDays variables can be used to limit the number of bars to plot and 'zoom into' a part of the chart.\n\nWe can see that the script generates 139% annual return. This is already better than the simple trend trading script from the last workshop; but the equity curve is still not satisfying. Alice has to do more for her fee and improve this strategy further. We'll do that tomorrow.\n\nAre the functions you referenced (fisher, lowpass, highpass, dominantcycle) already included with Zorro?\n\nIf so, are they open source?Today we'll learn how to improve a strategy's performance with optimization. That basically means that some essential strategy parameters are optimized to achieve the maximum profit for a certain bar period, asset, and market situation. That's why all better trade platforms have an optimizer, usually with an extra window or program outside the script. With Zorro, the script controls anything, and thus also determines which parameters are optimized in which way.\n\nAlice's has added some commands to the strategy for parameter optimization (select Workshop5_2):\n\nParameter optimization requires some additional settings at the begin of the script:\n\nset(PARAMETERS);\nBarPeriod = 240;\nLookBack = 500;\n\nPARAMETERS is a \"switch\" that, when set, tells Zorro to generate and use optimized parameters. LookBack must be set to the 'worst case' lookback time of the strategy. The lookback time is required by the strategy for calculating its initial values before it can start trading. It's usually identical to the maximum time period of functions such as HighPass() or Fisher(). If the lookback time depends on an optimized parameter, Zorro can not know it in advance; so we should make it a habit to set it directly through the LookBack variable when we optimize a strategy. In this case we set it at 500 bars to be on the safe side.\n\nSome parameters have now been replaced by optimize function calls. We also notice that the line with the Threshold variable has now moved to the begin of the code. This is because more important parameters should be optimized first, and the most important is Threshold which determines the sensitivity of the strategy and has the largest influence on its profit. It is now set to the return value of the optimize function. optimize is called with 3 numbers; the first is the parameter default value, which is 1 - just the value that Threshold had before. The next two numbers, 0.5 and 2, are the parameter range, i.e. the lower and upper limit of the Threshold variable. So Threshold can now have any value from 0.5 to 2. During the optimization process, Zorro will try to find the best value within this range.\n\nAlice has selected two more parameters to be replaced by optimize calls: a factor for the HighPass time period, and a factor for the stop loss distance. The default values are just the values used in the first version of the counter trading script. Theoretically, there could be even more parameters to optimize - for instance the DominantPeriod cutoff value, or the number of bars for the ATR function. But the more parameters we have, and the larger their range is, the higher is the danger of overfitting the strategy. Overfitted strategies perform well in the simulation, but poor in real trading. Therefore only few essential parameters should be optimized, and only within reasonable parameter ranges.\n\nFor training the strategy, click [Train] and observe what the optimize calls do. During the training phase, which can take about one minute depending on the PC speed, you'll see the following charts pop up:\n\nParameter 1 (Threshold)\n\nParameter 2 (LowPeriod factor)\n\nParameter 3 (Stop factor)\n\nThe parameter charts show how the parameter values affect the performance of the strategy. The red bars are the profit factor of the training period - that is the total win divided by the total loss. The dark blue bars are the number of losing trades and the light blue bars are the number of winning trades. We can see that Threshold has two profit maxima at 1.10 and 1.50; the LowPeriod factor has a maximum slightly above 1. The Stop factor - the 3rd parameter - has a maximum at about 7. We can also see that a distant stop, although it increases the risk, also increases the number of profitable trades, the 'accuracy' of the strategy.\n\nThe 3 optimized parameters are stored in the file Data/Workshop5_2_EURUSD.par. Different parameter sets could be generated for other assets. A click on [Test], then on [Result] displays the equity chart of the optimized strategy:\n\nWe can see how training has improved the script. The annual return now exceeds 200%, meaning that the invested capital doubles every 6 months. The new Sharpe Ratio is well above 1, meaning that this strategy is really tradable. Or is it? Well, in fact it's too good to be true. If Alice would deliver the strategy with this test result, she would have made a severe mistake and Bob would probably not get as rich as expected. What's the problem?\n\nAlice has used the price data from the last 4 years for optimizing the parameters, and has used the same price data for testing the result. This always generates a too optimistic result due to curve fitting bias. It also has a second problem. In 4 years, markets change and trading strategies can become unprofitable. It is not recommended to trade an optimized strategy unchanged for 4 years.

{"text": "Why do the historical high/low values for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) differ from other sites?\n\nDescription\n\nThis document provides an explanation for why the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) high/low historical prices might not be the same on Yahoo! Finance when compared to other sites.\n\nResolution\n\nUsers are often curious why the intraday high/low data we show for the Dow Jones Industrial Average ^DJI differ from other sites reporting. The short answer is that there are two different methods to calculate high and low prices for the index\u2014Theoretical and Actual\u2014and we choose to display the Theoretical high/low data in historical prices since the data ranges back to 1928, versus 1992 for the Actual data.\n\nThe intraday data we display for ^DJI on the quote summary page is Actual data. Explanations of both calculation methods are below.\n\nThe Theoretical Dow Jones Industrial Average assumes all index components hit their high or low at the same time during the day. At the end of the trading day, the daily highs for all 30 Dow components are used to calculate the index high for the day, and the same is performed for the index low.\n\nIn 1992, Dow Jones started using the Actual method, which calculates the index every 10 seconds throughout the trading day. Before 1992, the Actual method did not exist. Since all index components almost never hit their highs and lows at the same time, the Theoretical high is almost always higher than the Actual, and the Theoretical low is almost always lower than the Actual."}

But it changed by now...:-(\n\nBest,\nJ\n\n@Net Excess Spread: You have to deduct the guarantee fee. It is \"Net\" excess spread. So the correct answer was 0.15.\n\n@Liquidity Duration: It said that the trader wants to liquidate a max. of 15% of MARKET volume.\nSo I think you have to calculate the avarage - which was indeed around 5.\n\n@DV01-GAP ==> Mistake by GARP:\nThere was one apparent mistake in a question regarding DV01 gaps: The question gave liabilities and assets plus\ntheir modified duration and asked to calculate the gap in DV01s. However, the answers presented referred to the\ngaps in modified durations. Choices were in the millions (correct: 700 million) while DV01-gap was in the\nthousands (770,000)\n\n@Option pricing using binomial tree ==>Inconsenstency by GARP\nThey sated in the beginning that any calculations are done using continously discounting. That was not true.\nThere was one question which asked to calculate the value of a bond call option using risk-neutral probabilities.\nWith continously compounding this yielded 0.53 USD, with annual compounding 0.52 USD (which was one of the choices)\n\n@Question with formula for probability of default:\n\npd = e^x/(e^x + 1) and x = a + b/LTR + g*DSCR\n\nAsked for range of b and g; correct answer was (a): b < 0 and g < 0.\n\nCould have been derived analytically or by the given choices: Since LTR and DSCR both influence PDs any choices\nwith b>=0 or b<=0 or g>=0 or g<=0 could not work. This left only (a)\n\n@Question with LVaR and Constant Spread Approach:\nChoices were VaRs with different confidence level. Asked for which of those Liquidity ADJUSTMENT will be highest.\nThis is the case for the LOWEST VaR value, since Liquidity Cost are CONSTANT:\nI think this was option (a): 90% + 5 day horizon\n\n@Question with Barrier Options: Correct answer was 40; Explanation was given above@Volatility smile + asked for which option is undervalued: the ONLY correct answer was out-of-the-money-calls,\nbecause for those the quoted volatility is higher than that for at-the-money options.\n\n@Question with Senior + Equity tranche and pool of 2 bonds with notional of 100 each and equal PDs p. Notional of Senior Tranche was 100. Asked for default probability of equity/senior tranche:\n\nYou had to note that the equity tranche already defaults, when the first\nbond defaults, because than there is only monies left to serve the senior tranche. This made it a calculation of binomial probabilities:\n\n@Macroprudential policies: Asked, which one would be a leading indicator that a shock is a HEALTHY shock:\nAnswered, that capital aedaquacy ratios do not change much. All other options were not unique to a healthy shock. However,\nthis question was badly phrased.@Some question to calculate PD for a 1year CDS paying 10% and recovery rate of 0%, default occuring at END of the year.\nSolution was to solve PD*LGD = CS for PD = 25%.\n\n@Some question about which model focus the most on debt structure ==> KMV\n\n@Some question with VaR-Results calculated with historical simulation, delta normal and monte carlo simulation;\nConsitency questioned by trader. What is the most plausible explanation for this inconsistency?\n==> Answered: Different model assumptions; However, it could have been data problems as well. In my opinion both choices are possible; But even if you would have perfect data, you will have differences,\ne.g. because Delta-Normal does not account for non-linearities, assumption of parametric distribution does not need to match the historical distribution@Some question regarding which bond to use to collateralize a financial innovation?\n==> I selected the bond with the LOWEST correlation with the financial innovation, even though it had 3rd highest volatility. Any opinions?I did 700M but how can DV01 could be so high and 100's of millions. I think GARP screwed up again.\n2. Surprisingly there was no question related to Merton Model. Just one straight forward question from KMV model (not quant question) only. The short term debt and long term debt are given. Then the question asks with model uses information related to such captial structure. Obviously KMV...@Liquidity Duration: It said that the trader wants to liquidate a max. of 15% of MARKET volume.\nSo I think you have to calculate the avarage - which was indeed around 5.\n\nLD = shares/ (.15* Total number of shares)... so do the math, i forgot the numbersyes, because asian options payoff depend on average price.\n\n@Volatility smile + asked for which option is undervalued: the ONLY correct answer was out-of-the-money-calls, this q was able to be used without watching the q, since the answers were: 1. ITM call 2. OTM put 3. ATM call 4. OTM call\n\nthe first two answers are always togethor, so the choice of one of them is not correct. ATM call, is out of discussions, since we are talking about smirk\n\ny forgot the first year, which was in the q itself, which add another performance fee,,,, D, 2.99100% it is answer a\n\n@Some question with VaR-Results calculated with historical simulation, delta normal and monte carlo simulation;\nConsitency questioned by trader. What is the most plausible explanation for this inconsistency?\n\ni answered with D, programming error, & frankly i'm not sure about iti choosed \" credit triggers, bkz all the expoures are +, & increasing collateral in my opinion will not be possible, since it required from the counterparty not the bank, also it has A rating, so it is a quite high rating, so i answered CT.\n\n@Some question regarding which bond to use to collateralize a financial innovation?\n==> I selected the bond with the LOWEST correlation with the financial innovation, even though it had 3rd highest volatility.

The other people are the ones that enter the trade only buying the stock for a swing trade or maybe even a trend trade and when the stock is getting mature in its swing they sell calls against it looking for a consolidation when the stock drops you can usually get most the premium in a few days thus enhancing their return while still owning the stock.

The two most common ways I hear is the spread between months (although generally that is referred to as term structure). The other and more common use of the term has to do with the relation of the level of implied volatility of puts relative to the ATM options or OTM calls. Shops use several different methods to measure skew. Many use the 25 delta call relative to the 25 delta put at either 30, 60 or 90 days to expiration. Others measure puts and calls relative to ATM option (my preferred method). The CBOE SKEW Index uses the relation of far out-of-the-money puts (sometimes called tail risk puts, swan puts, or units) relative to more standard OTM puts.\n\nMark Sebastian offers up some pioneering research and analysis of the CBOE SKEW Index and its suitability as a tool for helping to predict the direction of the VIX."}

Granted, that's over a smaller time period than CALMAR typically measures, but I have decent trade data going back to 2009, although the strategy has evolved since then, so that data would need to be re-checked under the current strategy.\n\nMy bet sizes are typically bigger, yielding deeper drawdowns, but going in the opposite direction and making the bets smaller to avoid those drawdowns is easy enough. If, all things being equal, you could get a 98% gain with a 13% drawdown, or 49% with 6.5% drawdown, by cutting bet size in half or by 3/4, I would think that would be attractive.

The trading frequency is actually closer to 150 trades per year. And, yes, the strategy has evolved somewhat so that the actual data I have is for just under a year, but the strategy could easily be backtested going back as far as there was 1-minute data for any market you'd like to test.

{"text": "Reading from \" - the copy reads \"Binaries are similar to traditional options but with one key difference: their final settlement value will be 0 or 100. This means your maximum risk and reward are always known and capped.\".\n\nIsn't that true when you are using traditional options? (Assuming the markets are the same.)\n\nAddition: Can't you essentially replicate the payoff of a binary option using a vertical ATM option spread?\n\n5 Answers\n\nThe text of your question doesn't actually match the question title. The answer to your title is of course yes binary options make sense. And as others have pointed out with binary options your reward is limited, and conversely the risk involved in writing them is less.\n\nTo answer your additional question you can replicate a binary option with a tight call spread around the strike (not ATM as you suggest). So for example, if you have a binary call struck at K, which pays off 1 if it's ITM and 0 if not, you can replicate that with\n$$\n(C(K+\\epsilon) - C(K))/\\epsilon.\n$$\nWhere $\\epsilon$ is typically the smallest strike unit you can trade.\n\nRisk managing these positions can get tricky when the level of the forward gets close to the strike, as the greeks can change sign.\n\nThey would make sense in certain narrow applications; one can perhaps think about scenarios where binary option might be the most efficient, quickest or easiest way to either benefit from a particular insight OR to hedge against some sort of event ... the real question is whether the volume in the markets for binary options will continue to sufficient to generate enough liquidity to render them as a practical alternative for different people who might have a reason to engage in either sides of the trade.\n\nIn other words, whether they make sense or not depends upon whether there are enough people who believe that other enough people will believe that they make sense. This is true for any any asset or derivative market. All markets fail (i.e. stop making sense) when people stop believing that other people believe that the market has stopped making sense for anyone.\n\nYes. To me binary options seems to have more of a \"gambling\" feel than standardized options. Possibly due to the ease of use as described. it does seem like a product which might have mass appeal. \u2013 Ralph WintersMay 13 '11 at 19:21\n\nBinary options have a lot more gambling involved for the arb crowd, because the problem of being \"pinned\" at the strike near expiration is much worse. \u2013 Brian BAug 18 '11 at 16:35\n\nI short binary FOREX options to hedge my long FOREX position, and don't really think of them as gambling. \u2013 barrycarterNov 4 '11 at 16:06\n\nFor a long or short position in a vanilla put, the maximum risk/reward is known and capped. For a long position in a vanilla call, the maximum risk is also always known and capped. The maximum reward is therefore known and capped for a short vanilla call position. However, the reward is unbounded for a long vanilla call position, and therefore the risk is likewise unbounded for a short vanilla call."}

{"text": "Stochastic Oscillator\n\nThe Stochastic Oscillator Technical Indicator compares where a security's price closed relative to its price range over a given time period.

{"text": "Adaptive Frequency Weighted Moving Average (AFWMA)\n\nOne of the unique aspects of modelling financial time series is that recent data is more important than previous data. This is because forecasts need to be made for the next time period, and prices compound in value over time. The other unique aspect of time series data is that there tends to be a combination of random noise and mean-reverting tendencies (especially at shorter frequencies). The researcher often faces a tradeoff between weighting based on recency versus amplifying the noise and mean-reversion that exists at shorter frequencies. This tradeoff is logical, and should be captured explicitly as a function in an adaptive framework (success-weighted) versus back-testing different weighting schemes hindsight.\n\nRecency is easily captured by a weighted moving average (wma). In this scheme, prices are weighted in direct proportion to their recency (the recency rank divided by the sum of recency ranks times the price at time t). This link demonstrates the calculation :\n . Alternatively, the best way to eliminate disturbances induced by shorter frequencies is to middle weight the data. That is, we want to give data closest to the middle higher values than more recent data. This is best accomplished using a triangular moving average, which is essentially a moving average of the moving average of the same length. The smoothing induced by a triangular moving average creates maximum weighting on the middle value. The calculation is described here:\n .\n\nTo keep things consistent, we should use a weighted triangular moving average (wtma), which is exactly the same except it uses the weighted moving average versus the simple moving average in the calculation. Thus the Adaptive Frequency Weighted Moving Average can be calculated simply as:\n\nAFWMA= w*(wma)+ (1-w)*(twma)\n\nwhere \"w\" is a constant between 0 and 1\n\nThe purpose of the AFWMA is to find the optimal balance between recency and avoiding short-term noise. This can be found by solving for \"w\" to best minimize out of sample error in a forecast format, or to best maximize out of sample sharpe in a trading strategy format. It is a simple and logical way of compressing the value/information content that differs between the weighted and triangular moving averages without resorting to blind optimization (or worse yet the beliefs/opinions of a technical analysis \"guru\")."}

The net cost was $126.\n\nNote: none of the figures in this post accounts for commissions.\n\nThis is an example of a bull call spread \u00f1 buying one call option and selling another at a higher strike.\n\nSelling the higher strike option reduces the cost of the spread, but it also caps the potential return. Buying a 140 call and selling a 150 call for the same month means the spread can never be worth more than $1,000 \u00f1 the difference between the two strike prices.\n\nRisk 1 to make 7\u00d6\n\nBob\u00eds spread is an out-of-the-money (OTM) call spread because both strikes are higher than the stock price of 126.64.\n\nIf the stock does rise, Bob could conceivably make $874 \u00f1 the $1,000 the spread might be worth minus the $126 he paid for the spread, which is his maximum risk.\n\nSo Bob is risking $126 to make $874, roughly the same as \u00ecrisking 1 to make 7.\u00ee\n\n\u00d6or risk 8 to make 2?\n\nAs for me, I was thinking about another call spread: Buy the 110 call for $1,850 and sell the 120 call for a $1,045 credit for a net cost of $805.\n\nThis is an example of an in-the-money (ITM) call spread because both strikes are lower than the current price of the stock.\n\nSo I\u00edd be paying $805 on a spread that can\u00edt be worth more than $1,000. My maximum net profit would just under $200 \u00f1 so I\u00edd be risking 8 to make 2.\n\nI know what you might be thinking that\u00eds a fairly poor risk/reward profile. You might even have a point.\n\nBut would it change your mind if I pointed out that unless the stock price changes, time decay works against Bob\u00eds position while it works in favor of mine?\n\nTheta: Headwind or tailwind\n\nHere\u00eds the theoretical value of these two call spreads at various times until expiration. The purple arrow shows the price of the stock when the trade is established.\n\nNote how Bob\u00eds OTM call spread seems to lose value if the stock doesn\u00edt rise. He needs to see the stock move up \u00f1 the sooner the better. My position, however, gains value even if the stock just drifts around its current price.\n\nThe chart also shows that at least in theory, if Amazon falls, even fairly late in the expiration cycle, I could conceivably close my position for a loss of perhaps $300. There\u00eds no guarantee, of course, but that would turn my trade into more of a \u00ecrisk 3 to make 2\u00ee scenario.\n\nThis difference in time decay is because ITM and OTM call spreads each have different levels of theta.\n\nTheta is the option Greek that measures the theoretical impact of time decay on an option position. If you\u00edre long an option with a theta of -0.025, for example, in theory (all other things being equal), the position will lose $2.50 per day from time decay. If you\u00edre short the option, you theoretically gain $2.50 per day.\n\nTheta does change based on time and stock movement. Here\u00eds another chart that shows the ITM and OTM call spreads along with the theoretical theta of these positions at various stock prices.\n\nGood theta vs. bad theta\n\nWhy would these option spreads have different time decay patterns?\n\nBy definition, any bull call spread means being long one option, where theta works against you and short another, where theta works with you. But each spread offers different amounts of each.\n\nHere\u00eds a chart that shows the theta of these options at the time the spread is first established. With the OTM call spread, the bad theta (in red) outweighs the good theta (in green) providing negative net theta (in yellow). The ITM spread has an opposite profile.\n\nAn even better choice: A bull put spread\n\nI\u00edve compared these two spreads to demonstrate how the strike prices you select impacts the theta of your position. But I probably wouldn\u00edt consider the 110/120 ITM call spread just to take advantage of theta.\n\nThat\u00eds because there\u00eds a better choice, at least in my opinion.\n\nYou see, for almost any bull call spread, there\u00eds an equal and opposite bull put spread you can establish that offers a similar risk/reward ratio. So let\u00eds look at those option prices again, this time showing the puts and the calls.\n\nInstead of risking $805 for the 110/120 bull call spread with a maximum profit of $195, I could switch these strikes over to the put side.\n\nBy selling the 120 put for $400 and buying the 110 put for $191, I\u00edd collect a credit of $209. This is an example of an OTM bull put spread.\n\nThis provides basically the same deal at the ITM bull call spread. If all goes well and the stock stays above 120, I keep the $209 net credit I received. If all doesn\u00edt go well, the 110 put I bought caps my loss at $791 (the difference between the $1,000 I\u00edd have to pay to buy back the spread less the $209 I collected).\n\nThe theoretical profit chart shows that these two positions are virtually identical. Although not shown on the chart, they do have similar time decay properties.\n\nBut the put spread does offer a couple of advantages.\n\nFirst, the out-of-the-money puts tend to have much narrower bid/ask spreads than the in-the-money calls. Second, if all goes well, I\u00edd have to pay another set of commissions to close the call spread, but with the put spread I could just let both options expire worthless and keep the credit I collected.\n\nI should point out that a bull put spread like this requires keeping $1,000 in margin available, but that\u00eds not much different than paying $805 for the bull call spread (and in fairness, Bob\u00eds OTM call spread costs far less and the position requires no margin).\n\nKey takeaways? Regardless of your view on the movement of a stock, you can have theta working for you or against you. And with spreads like these, the options market usually offers equivalent risk/reward profiles whether you use calls or puts.\n\nImportant Note The Greeks represent the consensus of the marketplace as to the how the option will react to changes in certain variables associated with the pricing of an option contract. There is no guarantee that these forecasts will be correct.\n\nWhile Theta represents the consensus of the marketplace as to the amount a theoretical option\u00eds price will change for a corresponding one-unit (day) change in the days to expiration of the option contract"}

I was under the impression that it's improper (or at least not technically correct) to label such things as double bottoms until they're confirmed, and I say this despite the common definitions of the term \"double bottom\" that we may happen upon when doing a quick internet search.\n\nI was under the impression that such bottoms aren't double bottoms but instead equal bottoms. In other words, the correct term to use when reading the hard right edge of the screen is \"equal bottom\"\u2014when we see them. It's not until later after confirmation that we look back and see whether it was or wasn't a 'true' double bottom.\n\nBasically, and according to my understanding, the term \"equal bottom\" doesn't imply knowledge whereas the term \"double bottom\" does. The knowledge I'm talking about is that of price action. The price either has or hasn't touched or passed through the previous cycle high (when going long). Only the benefit of hindsight should lead us to refer to an equal bottom as a double bottom\u2014if my understanding is correct.\n\nThere can be a series of broken equal bottoms (sometimes improperly, I believe, referred to as double bottoms) until we finally reach a genuine double bottom. After all, if a double bottom is a reversal pattern, then referring to a bunch of failed equal bottoms as double bottoms seems to me to be improper. I could be misguided on that notion.\n\nTo put it another way, when trading, we know we're looking at an equal bottom when we see it, but we can't be sure it's a double bottom until after the fact.\n\nThis may seem like semantics, but there is genuine distinction to be made and communicated with others whether we use those terms or not. I've been thinking about possible counterarguments, and I can't rightly say that my views are solidified, but I thought I'd share my understanding (or perhaps misunderstanding) with others to see if they had any views on the subject\u2014other than simple repeated references to definitions."}

To find the mean look for the red horizontal line between the two yellow horizontal lines on the light blue volume profile.\n\n@Jharwood21,\nGreat question. Many times a stock will gravitate towards it's volume mean as that is where the most amount of volume was traded in the past. Funny thing is, using that idea\u2026 BIDU would be down and AMZN would be down today too\u2026 Today, BIDU did come down towards it's volume mean but AMZN bounced off the 200 level.

{"text": "Do You Use Stops? Why and How Do You Set Them?\n\nAugust 14, 2012 at 6:07 PM | written by s.c.a.n. Editor\n\nDo you use stops and targets in your longer-term investments? What techniques or features of StockCharts.com help you set them accurately? The Parabolic SAR is a guide, but standard parameters yield a rather loose initial stop point.\n\nTrading experts like Alexander Elder or Seykota advocate the use of stops. Others, like the Motley Fools, follow Buffet's approach and do not use them. I am in Elder's camp, but see my exposure to another flash crash or to sharpies hunting for my stop in less liquid positions.\n\nIf you do not use stops, what StockCharts features do you use to help protect you from severe draw downs?\n\nOne of the benefits of technical analysis is that you can find logical places to set your stops rather than trying to use a P/E ratio that looks better and better as the stock fails. Fundamental analysis does not offer logical stop setting.\n\nOne of the main ideas behind setting stops is to protect capital, to let your winners run. You can also use mental stops, but most technicians agree that the stop is one of the primary benefits of technical analysis.\n\nLets say you are trading the Tom Demark 11-day breakout. A stock is making new 2-week Highs. When you enter the trade, the best time to enter is as the trade starts to move. It is also a time when the trade falls apart. In this example, the trade fell apart almost instantly 4 times in a row. See the black lines for the setting of the stop at the 22-DMA (one-month moving average).\n\nYou can look on the chart and pick the same as your entry price, or the 20-dma, or a lower Bollinger Band (or anything else) as your stop. The difference between the buy price and the sell price is your risk on the trade. I have picked a chart in a downtrend to illustrate how the stops at the 22-dma would avoid serious losses. This chart also shows how sensitive the breakout location is to failure."}

{"text": "This is a quest that's I've been on for the last 16 years. Now I know the answer to that question, but it wasn't always like that. It takes time to get there, moving through the jungle of wanna be traders, cheats, and several dozen of useless trading books. Before you say that trading books are worth something think again. If someone is good, really good, he or she is not interested in writing a book, period. There is much greater reward awaiting good traders and lots of free time. What do you think, what's your experience before you finally reached that level, that you no longer look elsewhere?\n\nI'd say the biggest obstacle to overcome is one's mind and ego. Once a trader takes that aside, the sky is a limit. At least based on my experience. Out of curiosity I checked zulu performance a while back and was disappointed reading messages from some of the top (pun intended) traders. I understand, many would love to know how, but majority doesn't know how, hence they become followers. Nothing wrong with this, I go o a doctor when I'm sick, but reading some of those comments, from gurus like cruise control makes me think how naive the following crowd really is, and how desperate they want to make their equity grow. If they only knew that the real key is in psychology of a trade, they would perhaps gone places in forex. Looking back in time (for me) it was 50% know how and 50% ego...lol. Now it's more like this: 1. know how = 5% (every one knows how to click a mouse and chances are 50/50) 2. trading psychology (read mass psychology) = 60% 3. money management = 30% 4. lady luck 5% 5. ego = 0% (that was actually my biggest enemy in the past :-) )\n\nAnyways, I know what I am and what I'm capable of. I was more interested in what others do to make their trading 'wishes' come true...\n\nI've got few PMs asking about systems I use and tips. It would be a repetition since I over the years on forexfactory as raczekfx. Most of it is buried in James16 chart thread. It would simple take too much of my time to repost all of it here, but there are some good bits and pieces in a mentioned thread if you care to do some digging.\n\nI would say being in the green most of the time is irrelevant. What relevant is make more than you lose. You can be in green +1000 one week and the next two -100 each, and this is how real traders work. You don't need to be right. You need to be in money.\n\nI was fortunate enough to meet someone a couple of years ago who taught me a whole lot about the currency markets.

{"text": "Selling yourself short.(ECONOMIC OBSERVER)(short selling of stocks)\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIN REACTION to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, governments around the world moved to ban the short selling of financial industry stocks. Short selling is a strategy employed by investors who believe a stock or other financial instrument will soon fall in price. Politicians and regulators feared that short sellers would drive down the stock price of financial firms, worsening their already weak condition. However, short sellers and other market participants were expressing their judgment regarding the health of these companies--a judgment that governments wished to suppress. Rather than listening to what the markets were saying, governments tried, ultimately without success, to present an alternate reality.\n\nSo, what is it, exactly, to short a stock?

{"text": "4 Answers\n\nThe precise origin of the phrases \"bull market\" and \"bear market\" are obscure. The Oxford English Dictionary cites an 1891 use of the term \"bull market\". In French \"bulle sp\u00e9culative\" refers to a speculative market bubble. The Online Etymology Dictionary relates the word \"bull\" to \"inflate, swell\", and dates its stock market connotation to 1714.[14] The fighting styles of both animals may have a major impact on the names. When a bull fights it swipes its horns up; when a bear fights it swipes down on its opponents with its paws.[15] When the market is going up, it is similar to a bull swiping up with its horns. When the market is going down it is similar to a bear swinging its paws down.\n\nPerhaps because a bull is considered an aggressive animal, one that charges against its enemies, it has been connected to initiative and activity that marks an upward trend. On the other hand, bears spend a long time hybernating in winter, therefore being inactive, a trait that could have connected them to a downward trend in markets.\n\nSome suggestions as to possible etymologies are made here citing various characteristics of bulls and bears; I don't believe a word of it myself, and I'd think a far better answer is to be found here; for what it's worth, I'd bet on the estimable Mr Quinion.\n\nTo summarise (for bear):-\n\nA noble gentleman of this city, who has the honour of serving his country as major in the Train-bands, being at that general mart of stock jobbers called Jonathon's, endeavouring to raise himself (as all men of honour ought) to the degree of colonel at least; it happened that he bought the Bear of another officer.\n\nThe Tatler, 7 July 1709. This tongue-in-cheek tale is saying that the\nmajor, wanting to buy a promotion, speculated by selling some stock\nshort. When the transaction went wrong, the story goes on, the major\ndescribed his fellow officer as a bear-skin man, among other epithets,\nand called him out, satisfaction being achieved through a fist-fight,\nneither man being keen on firearms.\n\nOne argument that has been put forward for Bull vs Bear is that bearskin traders would sell bearskins they did not own, and hope to make a profit by later purchasing skins from trappers at a lower price. This would be an early form of short selling where the delivery of the skins to the ultimate end use would occur later. Because a bearskin trader made money in a falling market, a falling market became known as a \"bear market\".\n\nIf this explanation is correct then the term \"bull\" market comes from the idea that people bull and bear were mortal enemies and if a bear market meant a falling market, then a bull market must mean the opposite."}
{"text": "Technical Analysis, Charts Drawings:\n\nQuadrant Lines\n\nQuadrant Lines can be compared to Fibonacci Retracement, as well as to Tirone Lines by both the principle of drawing and the principles of interpretation. When Quadrant lines are drawn, a user selects the trend-line that connects major top (resistance) and major bottom (support) levels. Then the vertical distance between marked support and resistance levels is divided into four equal parts by three horizontal lines which, together with the support and resistance horizontal lines, form the Quadrant lines.\n\nIn technical analysis, Quadrant lines are used in the same way as Fibonacci Retracements are used. Like Fibonacci Retracement, Quadrant lines have a middle line at the 50% level. The basic principle behind an analysis of the Quadrant lines is an assumption that, when the price moves close to one of the lines, the trend is considered to be vulnerable and predisposed to a change of its direction. Once the trend breaks one of the lines, the next sensitive level becomes the next line"}
{"text": "As the article points out, decay works to your disadvantage in volatile markets that go nowhere, but works to your advantage in strongly trending markets. For example, if you look at the NASDAQ 100 vs it's 3-times ETF TQQQ from the low of 8/27/10 to the high of 11/9/10, the NASDAQ 100 was up 25.9% while the TQQQ was up 97.3%, or nearly 4x the NASDAQ 100!\n\nSince the Market Direction Model (MDM) switches signals on average between 12 to 20 times a year and usually exits after the uptrend or downtrend reverses, decay should have only a small impact if any. That said, some may wish to take the decay advantage/disadvantage out of the MDM model equation by shorting normal leveraged (2-times and 3-times) ETFs on a sell signal instead of buying inverse ETFs provided you can get the borrow. Be careful of high fees associated with shorting ETFs. In our experience, there are enough ETFs out there that can be borrowed with little to no fees.\n\nImportant note: The UVXY model switches far more frequently than the MDM. That said, UVXY SELL signals tend to last longer than UVXY BUY signals since the general market tends to trend higher in a more orderly manner. In other words, when the general market is in an uptrend, UVXY tends to be in an orderly downtrend. Thus, these 2-times leveraged ETFs reap additional profits because of the downtrend."}

{"text": "Some days this blog has a couple short sentences, and others it has what seems like pages, and understandably it causes inconsistency. Unfortunately that's just the way things turn out sometimes.\n\nI'm glad I'm still paper trading, even with how promising the TT (triple threat) strategy looked. The most important thing you can do for yourself is to do your own work if possible. While I like the TT, I don't fully agree with all the stops such, and that's good for me. A good trader should trade with his or her own style and judgement, not based on what a \"better\" trader teaches them.\n\nSo, I did my own work. Pipwoof said he backtested his system for 4 pairs over 18 months. That's quite a lot of work by hand, so I decided to start small: 1 pair for 1 month. Now, I ran into a bit of a problem, as the following picture shows. The system is based off of the previous days data, so.. that's kind of important to know which days are which.\n\nUnfortunately I ran into some consistency issues of my own: The top clearly says the 8th, while the 3 boxes on the left say the 7th. Which to trust? Considering I made this screen shot today (the 8th) I decided to trust the top number over the bottom.\n\nDaunting I know, but after sorting through it, it's not too bad at all. Step by step, removing the excel stuff if I can help it. If anyone is curious to know about how the functions work or what exactly they are (or if you want the excel file itself) just let me know:\n\nA: Just the date, removing Saturdays\n\nB: Day of the week; important because the breakout system works differently on Mondays than it does others\n\nC/D: PDH/PDL or the previous day's high and low. Pretty self explanatory.\n\nE/F: BT/ST, the Buy and Sell triggers. The excel function first checks if the day if either a Sunday or a Monday. I made a judgement call about trading on Sundays, and put it to the same test as Mondays: The buy/sell trigger has to be 11 pips above the Previous Day's High/Low.\n\nG/H/I: Just data. I recorded that day's High, Low, and Close according to my Platform in EST.\n\nUp to this point nothing special, just data. The only numbers worth using practically as a trader are E and F, the Buy and Sell triggers. Everything else is necessary only to make the functions work, and to be organized.\n\nJ: Trigger? This is a simple function that answers the question: \"Did a Buy or Sell signal appear? This is just to know if the day is trade-able. It lets me know how often I get action using this method. (answer: almost everyday) If a day doesn't trigger, I wouldn't trade it, so the data for that cell (profits, etc) is worthless. Note that these appear on Sundays and Mondays, days where the system of cautious about trading anyway.\n\nK: Both Triggers Hit? This is another simple function that answers the question: \"Did BOTH the buy AND sell signals appear?\" Depending on how the day goes, it is possible for price to move up to trigger a buy, and later retrace all the way to create a sell signal as well. This was made mostly out of curiosity and for fun, but it has uses later, and it is worth noting that it is quite rare for both signals to trigger in a day. Also be aware technically what this means on the chart if both signals DO appear. An engulfing pattern. Yea?\n\nL: Daybreak. Daybreak is a simplified version of the TT. Instead of the 3 exits, you simply hold until the end of the day. I wanted to check if this was profitable, so I made a function that states \"If the close for the day is higher than the BT, or lower than the ST, then Yes. Otherwise, No.\" Either of those options create a profitable day, depending on if I buy or sell in accordance to the trigger.\n\nM: Pips via Daybreak. This cell runs the numbers: It finds out which trigger is made, the buy or sell, makes the trade, buy or short, and then finds out what the profit/loss is at the end of the day.\n\nN: Pip Reach. This is where the more interesting stuff starts to appear. If a buy signal appears, this uses the daily high finds out the max profit on a long. If a sell signal appears, this finds the max profit on a short\n\nO: Nearest 25. The more technical label would be \"Rounded down to the nearest 25 pips\" If I use a variation on the TT system, taking my first profit at the nearest 25, rather than \"at least 25 but no more than 50\", and then moving stops every 25 from that point, this is what I would get. Thus, while N (pip reach) would require me to have psychic abilities to catch its profits, This one does not. This is basically my backtest to the system. This answers the question \"If a trigger is made and I trade on it, taking my first profit/loss at 25 pips, and moving up my stops up 25 at a time, what would my profit on the day be?\" Note that in this backtest, I'm cashing out both position 2 and 3 at the same price, which nets more profit than the actual TT system (since TT would require me to hold another 25 pips of loss)\n\nSo what's the result for the month of July(and a little bit of August)?\n\nIf you scroll over to the \"W\" column there are some statistics. Nearest 25 pip total: 650. If you trade this system the MOST you would be making is 650 pips a month, which is really good. For some perspective, if you traded 1k cash on a 50:1 leverage, you could get at least 25k units of any of the big pairs. Over the course of a month this nets a little over 1.5k. that's over 100% profit. Imagine doubling your stack every month. Of course, this isn't how the system actually pans out in real life. This data assumes that if you don't net at least 25 pips of profit on the position, you break even. Note that in the \"O\" column, there are a lot of 0s. This shows that, say, if a buy trigger was made, that the daily high wasn't higher than 25 pips. Now, if we played the system rules, and took a 25 pip loss on every position that wasn't a gain, how much profit would we have? The statistics show that there are 7 profitable days, and 11 unprofitable days. 11 unprofitable days means 275 lost pips. 650-275=375 pips. Still good, but note that we haven't gone over any charts. We have no idea what's going on. We're pretty safe knowing thatgenerally 1 signal and 1 signal only shows per day, but those mishap days could turn a profitable strategy into an unprofitable one. I could look at the charts true, but I don't care so much about the past as I do the present and future."}

Depending on how you are coding this. What are you checking? The IOrder for a fill or the actual execution event for a fill? You cannot check the IOrder for a state of filled because the IOrder can be filled while you have not received all the execution events for that fill yet. You need to run your own check for fill manually via tracking the quantity of the execution events received. execution.Quantity and compare it to your order quantity.\n\nSo I wasn't using the IExecution value being passed to OnExecution().\nI'm just checking Position.MarketPosition (so I'll fix that), but in this case the order was for a single contract, so a partial fill wasn't possible.\n\nSo given that, in this case shouldn't the check 'Position.MarketPosition == MarketPosition.Long' be sufficient to safely call EnterShortLimit() ?\n\nI was also wondering if OnBarUpdate() might be executed at the same time as OnExecution() as a result of multi-threading, but note that I have CalculateOnBarClose = true;\nbeing set in Initialize(), so I was thinking OnBarUpdate() wouldn't be called again until the next bar started forming (this was a 1 minute chart).\n\nI recommend you not use MarketPosition from OnExecution. If you are using OnExecution I recommend you access the IExecution object directly. You may even want to go even further down and just use OnPositionUpdate.\n\nOk. The documentation recommends using OnExecution() to drive strategy logic based on fills, and states that On Execution() is always called after OnOrderUpdate() -- but when is OnPositionUpdate() called ??\n\nI didn't get a clear idea of the difference between OnExecution() and OnPositionUpdate() from the documentation.\n\n().\n\nThanks for all the help, and the quick replies -- I wish the support people at TradeStation would respond like this.\n\nOnPositionUpdate comes after OnExecution. It is easiest to program a closed loop from OnPositionUpdate. You need to be careful though, you are not guaranteed to receive an OnPositionUpdate() event for every execution event."}
{"text": "Moving Average Relative Strength Index (RSI) interpretation of the MARSI indicator is the same as the RSI. When the stock or security price closes above the 70 level, the market becomes overbought and when it closes below the 30 level, it becomes oversold. Contrarian trades buys when the market becomes overbought (meaning that RSI or MARSI is higher than 70 or 80) and sells when the market becomes oversold (meaning that the RSI or MARSI is lower than 30 or 20).\n\nThe MARSI indicator has two parameters. The first one is the moving average period and the second one is the RSI period. The default value for the moving average lookback period is 13 and the default value for the RSI period is 14.\n\nExample:\nrule1 = cross(MARSI(13, 14), 70);\n\n\"Rule1\" returns a trading signal if the MARSI indicator crosses above 70. In other words, it returns a signal if the 14-Bar RSI of the 13-Bar moving average of the close price crosses above 70."}

{"text": "that generates buy/sell signals on stocks on a 1-day basis. The strategy employs a good deal of indicators with considerable lookback periods (e.g. 75-day SMA etc.).\n\nNow the obstacle that needs to be coped with is: I keep getting major inconsistencies when employing the strategy on various PCs. That is, there are several PCs, each of which should have an accurate historical dataset for the stock prices. These datasets have been obtained via working with this and other strategies for quite a while, adding historical data to the database when needed via Yahoo / Google connections. The NT program settings on the PCs being in use are the same.\n\nWhat happens is: I do the same analysis on two independent PCs, which both have a \"correct\" set of historical data. On the one PC the strategy tells me it has a current AAPL position of 60 pieces, whereas on the other PC it thinks it is flat. It might as well be strategy on PC#1 thinks it has 50 YHOO, whilst the PC#2 strategy thinks it has 95 YHOO. Therefore, the signals being generated differ on the PCs being used - pretty incomfortable to think that the signals don't stem from the strategy, but more likely rely on the underlying data...\n\nCan anyone think of a procedure to establish a \"clean\" dataset, meaning I can do this procedure and then do the analyses on either PC without having to worry about the data possibly being different (I'm not saying wrong) from the other PC's data?\n\nThe best way to ensure identical databases is to export the data from one computer and import it to the next. That will ensure 100% identical data sets across both machines. You can do this process through the Historical Data Manager.\n\nHowever, I think this kind of misses the point a bit - if I get two versions of datasets, how do I know which one is the \"correct\" one (assuming both have been obtained in proper ways)? I mean, I'd want the signals to be generated in the most accurate possible way.\n\nUnfortunately there is no metric to determine one is better than the other as this is subjective in nature. What you get is what is provided by the data provider you use. In deciding which one you ultimately want to use is up to you to decide.\n\nWell, the thing is: I get varying results even when using the same (!) data source on the different systems. I agree with you that the data just has to be consistent \"in itself\" (such as varying minute objects), but at least the results should match when applying the system on different PCs.\n\n- different indicator setting on one PC (myself being stupid there, I admit)\n\n- had to update dividends and splits on every stock in order to bring the results in line.\n\nThanks for helping Josh, and sorry for causing trouble.

To sort out causality, we use the start of autoquoting on the NYSE as an exogenous instrument for algorithmic trading.

{"text": "How to trade forex?\n\nYou can read more about how to trade forex while watching this video, or refer to the text below if something in the video remains unclear.\n\nYou trade currencies in pairs\n\nAll currencies are traded in pairs and each currency has an official abbreviation, for example GBP for British pound, USD for US dollar and EUR for the euro.\n\nThe \"base currency\" is the first currency in the pair and the \"quote currency\" is the second currency. These are commonly referred to as the bid and ask price.\n\nPrice differences create trading opportunities\n\nYou can trade currencies because the values of currencies change. The exchange rate tells you how much of one currency you need to pay to buy one unit of another. In forex trading, exchange rates are displayed as the bid and ask price for a currency pair.\n\nThe difference between the bid and the ask price is known as the spread and it's how your broker generates much of its revenue. Spreads can vary from broker to broker, so look out for tight spreads in order to minimise your trading costs and maximise your profits.\n\nKnow what's behind the spread\n\nIt's important for you to understand how spreads are measured. For example, if GBPUSD has a bid price of 1.5530 and an ask price of 1.5533, the spread is three points. Although in forex trading, most people call them pips.\n\nA point or pip is the smallest movement up or down in the price of a currency.\n\nYou can trade in bullish and bearish markets\n\nWhen you trade forex, you're buying one currency and selling another at the same time which means you can speculate on rising and falling markets. This is one of the major advantages of forex trading.\n\nYou are likely to hear forex traders talk about bullish and bearish markets. When a market is rising or believed to be about to rise we call it \"bullish\"; when it's falling or believed to be about to fall it's called \"bearish\".\n\nHow you can place your first trade\n\nFirst of all, consider whether the currency you wish to trade is likely to rise or fall. This forms the basis of your trading strategy.\n\nIn a buy position, you believe that the value of the base currency, in our example the euro, will rise against the quote currency, the US dollar.\n\nLet's assume the price of the EURUSD is 1.3038 on the bid price and 1.3040 on the ask price. Therefore, the spread is two pips. When you buy, your trade is entered at the ask price of 1.3040.\n\nLater you decide to close your trade and the bid price of the EURUSD pair is 1.3072 and the ask price is 1.3074. Your trade has gained 32 pips. If each pip was worth one US dollar, you would have made a USD32 profit.\n\nNow let's see what happens with a sell position. You believe that the value of the base currency will fall against the quote currency. Using the same example, this means you believe the price of the euro will weaken against the US dollar.\n\nThe current value of the EURUSD pair is 1.3038 on the bid price and 1.3040 on the ask price. As you're selling, your trade is entered at the bid price of 1.3038.\n\nLater in the day, you look at the position and the EURUSD is now at 1.3072 on the bid price and 1.3074 on the ask price. Your trade has lost 36 pips. You decide to close your position at the current price of 1.3074 and accept your losses. If each pip was worth USD1, you would have lost USD36.\n\nFind out more about related topics by visiting our other videos and fact sheets"}
{"text": "You have written about the flash crash and its impact on how the markets are working. Has there been anything done to assure that it won't happen again, or to make the spreads tighter for the average trader? \u2014Maverick99Boston\n\nTalk about a timely issue! My first reaction was to say, \"Of course things are much better\" \u2014 but then I asked Dennis Dick, one of my resident experts, on the topic. He had just put together an article about the subject. Some excerpts:\n\nI bought 500 shares of IBM on the opening print today. You would think 500 shares would be pretty easy to liquidate within a penny or two considering how our market scholars claim that the market has deeper liquidity and tighter spreads than ever before. Anyway, a minute after the open, this is the quote that I was trying to liquidate that 500 shares into (Figure 1).\n\nFIGURE 1: IBM TIGHT SPREAD\n\nYes, that's right, you are reading the quote correctly. The spread was 37 cents \u2014 100 shares x 100 shares. Looks pretty thick and deep to me. And why does the quote change so many times in the one-second increment? High-frequency trading (HFT) liquidity providers change their quotes continuously in that increment, usually trying to aggressively penny each other, but then canceling their orders simultaneously.\n\nSo if I wanted to sell my 500 shares at the market, I could be filled on 100 shares at 203.10 and pay that 37-cent spread. And on the last 400 shares, who knows where I would be filled?\n\nWell, IBM is a $200 stock, so of course the spread is going to be wider. This isn't the case with other Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) components, is it? No, they are indeed tighter.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) had a nice tight spread of 21 cents, 19 seconds after the open. Coke (KO) had an 11-cent spread, in the first 30 seconds of trade. MMM had a cool 25-cent spread after the open."}

{"text": "Though the SEC compared the stock and stock futures markets, there's no discussion of fixed income markets' behavior that day.\n\nGayed argues that there may have been something else contributing, particularly a delayed response to bond investor skittishness. He cites the following chart.\n\nThe chart on top is a 1 minute price chart on the S&P 500 ETF (Symbol: SPY), while the bottom chart shows what the price action of the SPDR High Yield Junk Debt ETF (Symbol: JNK) was during the exact same time period. In a span of 10 minutes, JNK dropped from peak to trough about 6% (a substantial decline given the volatility characteristics of Junk Debt on average). The SPY ETF in a span of 10 minutes dropped roughly 7%. But this was NOT during the same 10 minutes.\n\nWhat caused this fast movement down and up in debt yields?\n\nAre these events related?\n\nIn an interconnected financial world, those seem like important questions.\n\nEspecially since the SEC's explanation has drawn some criticism \u2014 most notably from data firm Nanex that mapped Waddell's trades looking for evidence of its role and found less connection to the market's overall moves than would be expected. (Waddell supplied that data, though it was confirmed by another party, Barclays, which also has business dealings with Waddell.)\n\nAccording to Nanex:\n\nthe W&R trades do not appear to be near the point we believe is the ignition point at 14:42:44:075. Furthermore, the W&R trades are practically absent during the torrential sell-off that began at 14:44:20. The bulk of the W&R trades occurred after the market bottomed and was rocketing higher \u2014 a point in time that the SEC report tells us the market was out of liquidity.\n\nLike this:\n\n2 Responses\n\na few reports also mention a way out of the money put purchase in the S & P 500 (50,000 options) prior to the large emini sale. Why isn't this mentioned in most discussions? Better yet, evidently the purchaser was anticipating a large drop within a month, as the put strike was equivalent to the S$P trading 800. What did the purchaser know??? For sure there is way more to the story than what the SEC is focusing on, as you point out in the JNK chart.\n\nSean,\nThe firm you're referring to makes bets on \"Black Swan\" events, i.e. low probability, high impact events. While there are theories that argue that the put options could have also triggered the crash, the trade was put on because yields were exploding higher before equities collapsed. The decline in Junk debt was substantial adjusted for historical volatility and a significant event, and yet there seems to be no focus on that asset class"}
{"text": "Implication\n\nDescription\n\nA moving average is an indicator that shows the average value of a security's price over a period of time. This type of Technical Analysis occurs when a shorter and longer moving average cross each other. The supported crossovers are 21 crossing 50 (a short term signal) and 50 crossing 200 (a long term signal).\n\nA bullish signal is generated when the shorter moving average crosses above the longer moving average. A bearish signal is generated when the shorter moving average crosses below the longer moving average.\n\nThese events are based on simple moving averages. A simple moving average is one where equal weight is given to each price over the calculation period. For example, a 21-day simple moving average is calculated by taking the sum of the last 21 days of a stock's close price and then dividing by 21. Other types of moving averages, which are not supported here, are weighted averages and exponentially smoothed averages.\n\nTrading Considerations\n\nMoving averages are lagging indicators because they use historical information. Using them as indicators will not get you in at the bottom and out at the top but will get you in and out somewhere in between.\n\nThey work best in trending price patterns, where an uptrend or downtrend is firmly in place. Using a crossover moving average as an indicator is considered to be superior to the simple moving average because there are two smoothed series of prices which reduces the number of false signals\n\nCriteria that Supports\n\nCriteria that Refutes\n\nMoving averages do well in trending markets but they generate many false signals in choppy, sideways markets"}
{"text": "Frequently Asked Question\n\nHow does somebody make money short selling?\n\nShort selling is a fairly simple concept: you borrow a stock, sell the stock and then buy the stock back to return it to the lender.\n\nShort sellers make money by betting that the stock they sell will drop in price. If the stock drops, the short seller buys it back at a lower price and returns it to the lender.\n\nFor example, if an investor thinks Ben's Brewing Business (BBB) is overvalued at $25 and is going to drop in price, he or she may borrow the stock and sell it for $25. If the stock goes down to $20, the investor, after buying it back and returning it, would make $5 per share. However, if the stock goes up to $30, the investor would lose $5 per share.\n\nIf you can't see the amplified risk right now, let's make it obvious: when you buy a stock (or go long) you can lose only the money that you've invested. So, if you bought one BBB share at $25, the maximum you could lose is $25 because the stock cannot drop to less than $0. However, when you short sell, you can theoretically lose an infinite amount of money, because a stock's price can keep rising forever. So, for example, if you had a short position in BBB (or short sold it) and BBB ended up rising past $60 before you exited your position, you would lose $35 per share ($60-$25) - even more than the stock's original price.\n\nWhile short selling does present investors with an opportunity to make profits in a declining or neutral market, it should only be attempted by sophisticated investors and advanced traders"}

{"text": "I was thinking about two types of parameters one can use in a model. Open-ended parameters like SMAs or percentage-based filters, where the value used can be anything from zero to infinite and those like percent, where the value can only be within a certain range, like 0% to 100%.\n\nAre either of these two types more susceptible to curve-fitting? It would seem that you could say the first type is because the ability to calibrate the value of the parameter to historical data is nearly infinite, so someone could come to the conclusion that the 53-day SMA with a 13.2% volatility filter were the optimal values for an entry strategy, whereas with the second type, your ability to fit to a curve is limited by the range the variable can take on, meaning you'd be better off basing a model on the second type, to the extent that you can.\n\nI'm just thinking out loud a bit, so if this simple comparison and conclusion is flawed, I'm happy to hear why. I realize that you'd kind of have to ignore the potential for infinite subdividing of the range-constrained parameter, so that you don't end up with a value like 15.898798798% as your model input.\n\nOpen-ended parameters are contrained by maxbarsback. If you have 4,000 bars in a file it does not make any sense to use a 4001 bars sma. So there goes you otherwise nice try.\n\nOK, so there is a practical difficulty, in some cases.\n\nDoes that mean that the distinction is invalid and that there really aren't two types of parameter here?\n\nI suppose on the most macro level, if a market has been traded for 50,000 days, it can't make sense to use the 50,001 SMA, so not only would there be data limitations on the parameter values, there would be historical limitations as well.\n\nIt still seems intuitive (which isn't always correct, obviously) that the fewer values a parameter can take on, the less susceptible to curve-fitting the model would be, which would mean that binary parameters would be the least likely to be curve fit, which seems correct had me until you mentioned needing to look at it as a function of time.\n\nSounds like you are saying the less sensitive, the better, unless you want to use polynomials. Personally, I do not use them, with one exception.\n\nI know relatively little about advanced statistics and the science of modeling. However, I have worked with Neuroshell for a number of years ( a neural networking program for the market). I have found that range limited items work better for longer modeling periods. If I look at the change in the Close over a period of years, as the price of an instrument climbs, the network sees a $1 change in a $50 stock as different than a $2 change in the same stock when it is at $100. However, if I look at the percent change in the close (2%), the net sees the same value. Thus, range limited info, for longer-term models, seems to get more robust results. Short-term modeling does not suffer to the same extent. At least this is true in the models I can develop. More sophisticated modelers might not find this to be true in their models. This might not apply to instruments, which by their nature are more range-bound, like short-bonds. But I've never tried modeling them.\n.\nJack"}

If I run the indicator I get a set of values based on Close[0] (the current price) but if I remove the indicator from the chart and re-add it, the calculations are now different because presumably Close[0] is the single closing price for the bar, not the current price at each tick. Is that true and is there a way around that?\n\nYes, Close[0] represents only the last tick of a bar. It sounds like you designed your indicator to work on the change in close values within a bar that is currently forming. If this is the case, it's not really applicable to historical data. You'll only have the four data points of the bar, and not any of the price changes that were made to create the bar.

{"text": "Exelon: Get In At $34.90 Or Double Your Yield In 7 Months\n\nAnBenefits associated with selling puts\n\nIn essence, you get paid for entering a \"limit order\" for a stock or stocks you would not mind owning.\n\nIt allows one to generate income in a neutral or rising market.\n\nAcquiring stocks via short puts is a widely used strategy by many retail traders and is considered to be one of the most conservative option strategies. This strategy is very similar to the covered call strategy.\n\nThe safest option is to make sure the put is \"cash secured.\" This simply means that you have enough cash in the account to purchase that specific stock if it trades below the strike price. Your final price would be a tad bit lower when you add the premium you were paid up front into the equation. For example, if you sold a put at a strike of 20 with two months of time left on it for $2.50; $250 per contract would be deposited in your account.\n\nTime is on your side. Every day you profit via time decay as long as the stock price does not drop significantly. In the event it does drop below the strike you sold the put at, you get to buy a stock you like at the price you wanted. Time decay is the greatest in the front month.\n\nIt has tested the $36.00 ranges twice, once in June ($36.34) and once in July (36.27). After a long correction, it is generally a more bullish sign when a stock puts in higher lows. In this case, it has put in lower lows so there is still a chance that it could spike below $36.00 on an intra day basis. The stock has taken a serious drubbing, and it appears to be trying to put in a bottom. A weekly close above $39 will turn the outlook to bullish. If you are bullish on the long-term prospects of this stock, you can implement the following strategy.\n\nWe would wait for the stock to pull back to the $36.50-$37.00 ranges and then attempt to the sell the Jan 2013, 37 puts. These options are currently trading in the $1.85- $2.05 ranges. A pullback to the stated ranges should drive the price of these options to the $2.05-$2.30 ranges. For this example, we will assume that we can sell these puts for $2.10 or better. $210 will be deposited into your account for each contract sold.\n\nIf the stock trades below the strike price, the shares could be put to you (assigned to your account). If this is the case, you have the opportunity of getting into this stock at a much lower price. Your final price per share will be $34.90 ($37.00 minus $2.10). If the stock is not assigned to your account, you walk away with a gain of 5.6% in roughly 7 months. This is basically equivalent to its current annual yield.\n\nYour Potential Risk\n\nThe only risk factor here is that you have a change of heart after selling the puts. Perhaps you now feel that the stock could trade well below the strike price. In this case, the solution is to roll the put. Purchase the put you sold back and sell new slightly out of the money puts. Your break-even point in this trade is $34.90.\n\nCompany: Exelon Corp\n\nBasic overview\n\nRelative Strength 52 weeks = 55\n\nCash Flow 5 -year Average = 7.72\n\nQuarterly revenue growth = -5.40%\n\nQuarterly earnings growth = - 70%\n\nProfit margins = 10.87%\n\nGrowth\n\nNet Income ($mil) 12/2011 = 2495\n\nNet Income ($mil) 12/2010 = 2563\n\nNet Income ($mil) 12/2009 = 2707\n\nEBITDA ($mil) 12/2011 = 6982\n\nEBITDA ($mil) 12/2010 = 7981\n\nEBITDA ($mil) 12/2009 = 7751\n\nCash Flow ($/share) 12/2011 = 7.64\n\nCash Flow ($/share) 12/2010 = 8.42\n\nCash Flow ($/share) 12/2009 = 8.07\n\nSales ($mil) 12/2011 = 19184\n\nSales ($mil) 12/2010 = 18644\n\nSales ($mil) 12/2009 = 17318\n\nAnnual EPS before NRI 12/2007 = 4.31\n\nAnnual EPS before NRI 12/2008 = 4.17\n\nAnnual EPS before NRI 12/2009 = 4.12\n\nAnnual EPS before NRI 12/2010 = 3.95\n\nAnnual EPS before NRI 12/2011 = 4.16\n\nDividend history\n\nDividend Yield = 5.6\n\nDividend Yield 5 Year Average = 4.00\n\nDividend 5 year Growth = 4.96\n\nDividend sustainability\n\nPayout Ratio = 0.74\n\nPayout Ratio 5 Year Average = 0.49\n\nPerformance\n\nROE 5 Year Average = 23.37\n\nCurrent Ratio = 1.30\n\nCurrent Ratio 5 Year Average = 1.2\n\nQuick Ratio = 0.60\n\nCash Ratio = 0.4\n\nInterest Coverage = 82.9\n\nConclusion\n\nOnly implement this strategy if you are bullish on the stock, and you are ready for the possibility that the shares could be put to you.

{"text": "Options Trading News\n\nIn Chicago, home to the CBOE and CME, many people know what an option trader is. But that's clearly not the case in other parts of the country.\n\nRecently I was asked what I did for a living by someone in the Northeast, and I had trouble with the answer. I often feel like making something up when this happens--but I realized that some aspects of trading are analogous to online poker, without the negative gambling connotations.\n\nSome of you will immediately see the correlation. And many professional traders, especially option traders, are in fact also poker players.\n\nFrom a certain perspective, telling someone that I am essentially a professional online poker player makes sense because many people already think that trading is as good as gambling. And it certainly can be.\n\nSome \"traders\" would probably be better off going to a roulette wheel and laying all their money on black or red, as that may well be the best they could do without having a probability edge. But therein lies the difference between my job and the tables.\n\nGambling is laying down your money where you don't have an advantage--or, as Dickson Watts writes in \"Speculation as a Fine Art,\" where there is no calculation.\n\nAnother way of looking at the difference is that of luck versus skill. Winning at roulette is usually just a matter of luck; winning at poker, at least consistently, is a matter of skill.\n\nThe same can be said of traders. Those who are simply lucky may find a winning trade, but most of them won't last long in the market because they are gambling. Those who have skill, on the other hand, may lose a given trade but still have the probability of success on their side in the long run.\n\nPart of that skill is trade structure, and part of it is risk management. Leveraged put selling, for instance, requires relatively little skill yet can make money most of the time if done properly. But when one of those \"fat tails\" comes along, those traders get crushed.\n\nRisk-managed volatility selling, on the other hand, does require skill and won't be subjected to potential ruin in the same way. Such trading is essentially the focus of Thorp's \"Beat the Market.\"\n\nSo the next time someone asks me what an option trader really does, I might just tell them it is like being an online poker player and see where the conversion goes.\n\n(A version of this article appeared in optionMONSTER's What's the Trade? newsletter of June 27"}

{"text": "Best Answer - Chosen by Asker\n\nThe percentage of your account risk per trade depends on what kind of account you have. For instance, you risked 1% of your standard account on a trade, that would translate mean a 10% risk if you had a micro account.\n\nSome traders like to have multiple positions open on different pairs. If a trader of a standard account had 5 trades with 1% risk each, his total risk is only 5%. If the same trader had a micro account with the same position size, his total risk would become 50%. If his trades don't go his way, I bet he'll get margin called!\n\nWho found this interesting?\n\nIndeed. Micro accounts limit exposure and are a great way to familiarise with live trading, particularly for those making the transition from demo trading. Standard accounts take it up a notch, and only really for those with a substantial trading capital and developed trading skills."}

{"text": "Mining Isn't a Good Bet For Stock-Market Predictions\n\nBy JASON ZWEIG good at this point.\n\nThere is no end to such rules. But there isn't much sense to most of them either. An entertaining new book, \"Nerds on Wall Street,\" by the veteran quantitative money manager David Leinweber, dissects the shoddy thinking that underlies most of these techniques.\n\nThe stock market generates such vast quantities of information that, if you plow through enough of it for long enough, you can always find some relationship that appears to generate spectacular returns -- by coincidence alone. This sham is known as \"data mining.\"\n\nEvery year, billions of dollars pour into data-mined investing strategies. No one knows if these techniques will work in the real world. Their results are hypothetical -- based on \"back-testing,\" or a simulation of what would have happened if the manager had actually used these techniques in the past, typically without incurring any fees, trading costs or taxes.\n\nThose assumptions are completely unrealistic, of course. But data-mined numbers can be so irresistible that, as Mr. Leinweber puts it, \"they are one of the leading causes of the evaporation of money, especially in quantitative strategies.\"\n\nMr. Leinweber got so frustrated by \"irresponsible\" data mining that he decided to satirize it. After%% accuracy.\n\nBut the entire exercise, he says, is a total crock. There is no conceivable reason why U.S. stock returns would be determined by Bangladeshi livestock returns.\n\nMr. Leinweber's exercise isn't much more absurd than some actual examples of data mining. One recent scholarly paper purported to show that you can predict stock returns by tracking the number of nine-year-olds in the U.S. Another academic study asserts that stocks are more likely to go up on days when smog goes down.\n\nThat points to the first rule for keeping yourself from falling into a data mine: The results have to make sense. Correlation isn't causation, so there needs to be a logical reason why a particular factor should predict market returns. No matter how appealing the numbers may look, if the cause isn't plausible, the returns probably won't last.\n\nHeath Hinegardner\n\nThe second rule is to break the data into pieces. Divide the measurement period into thirds, for example, to see whether the strategy did well only part of the time. Ask to see the results only for stocks whose names begin with A through J, or R through Z, to see whether the claims hold up when you hold back some of the data.\n\nNext, ask what the results would look like once trading costs, management fees and applicable taxes are subtracted.\n\nFinally, wait. Hypothetical results usually crumple after they collide with the real-world costs of investing. \"If a strategy's worthwhile,\" Mr. Leinweber says, \"then it'll still be worthwhile in six months or a year.\"\n\nMr. Leinweber still gets inquiries from money managers who want him to share his data on Bangladeshi butter production so they can get the latest numbers and build a trading strategy around them. \"A distressing number of people don't get that it was a joke,\" Mr. Leinweber sighSlicing and dicing data to predict the future can get dicey."}

{"text": "Key Concepts\n\nA B Andrew's Pitchfork is a trend-channel drawing technique consisting of three lines \u2013 parallel upper and lower lines and a median line that bisects the distant between the two. It is named after its developer, Alan Andrews. The chart below shows an example of a Pitchfork drawn from the March 2009 low on a weekly chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). There are three reference points used to draw the Pitchfork: the initial low (A), a subsequent swing high (B), and a subsequent swing low (C). The process is identical for creating down-sloping Pitchforks from highs. The slope of the Pitchfork is determined by the median line, which connects the initial low with the midpoint of the line connecting points B and C. The Pitchfork is a trend channel intended to provide boundaries to price action, with penetration of the outer lines implying a reversal of the preceding trend. Note that reference highs and lows are chosen subjectively. Different selections will result in different Pitchforks, different trend definitions and different implied reversals.\n\nAverage and median: The mean (or average) of a set of values is the sum of the values divided by the number of values in the set. If a set consists of 10 numbers, add them and divide by 10 to get the mean.\nA statistical weakness of the mean is that it can be distorted by exceptionally large or small values. For example, the mean of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 200 is 28.5 (228/8). Take away 200, and the mean of the remaining seven numbers is 4, which is much more representative of the numbers in this set than 28.5.\nThe median can help gauge how representative a mean really is. The median of a data set is its middle value (when the set has an odd number of elements) or the mean of the middle two elements (when the set has an even number of elements). The median is less susceptible than the mean to distortion from extreme, non-representative values. The median of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 200 is 4.5 ((4+5)/2), which is much more in line with the majority of numbers in the set.\nAverage true range (ATR) is simply a moving average of the true range\nover a certain time period. For example, the five-day ATR would be the\naverage of the true range calculations over the last five days.\n\nBid-to-cover ratio: The ratio of the number of received bids to the number accepted bids in a Treasury auction. A ratio of 2 (twice as many bids received as accepted) is typically considered a sign of strong demand and a successful auction.\n\nBollinger Bands: Bollinger Bands are a type of trading \"envelope\" consisting of lines plotted above and below a moving average, which are designed to capture a market's typical price fluctuations.\nThe indicator is similar in concept to the moving average envelope, with an important difference: While moving average envelopes plot lines at a fixed percentage above and below the average (typically 3 percent above and below a 21-day simple moving average), Bollinger Bands use standard deviation to determine how far above and below the moving average the lines are placed. As a result, while the upper and lower lines of a moving average envelope move in tandem, Bollinger Bands expand during periods of rising market volatility and contract during periods of decreasing market volatility.\nBollinger Bands were created by John Bollinger, CFA, CMT, the president and founder of Bollinger Capital Management. By default, the upper and lower Bollinger Bands are placed two standard deviations above and below a 20-period simple moving average.\n\nBollinger Bands highlight when price has become high or low on a relative basis, which is signaled through the touch (or minor penetration) of the upper or lower line. However, Bollinger stresses that price touching the lower or upper band does not constitute an automatic buy or sell signal. For example, a close (or multiple closes) above the upper band or below the lower band reflects stronger upside or downside momentum that is more likely to be a breakout (or trend) signal, rather than a reversal signal. Accordingly, Bollinger suggests using the bands in conjunction with other trading tools that can supply context and signal confirmation.\nBack to top\n\nC D\n\nCarry trades involve buying (or lending) a currency with a high interest rate and selling (or borrowing) a currency with a low interest rate. Traders looking to \"earn carry\" will buy a high-yielding currency while simultaneously selling a low-yielding currency.\n\nPublished weekly by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Commitments of Traders (COT) report breaks down the open interest in major futures markets. Clearing member firms, futures commission merchants, and foreign brokers are required to report daily the futures and options positions of their customers that are above specific reporting levels (for each market) set by the CFTC.\n\nFor each futures market, report data is traditionally divided into major reporting categories: commercial, non-commercial, and non-reportable positions. The first two groups are those who hold positions above specific reporting levels. The \"commercials\" are often referred to as \"large hedgers.\" Commercial hedgers are typically those who actually deal in the cash market (for example, agribusinesses and oil companies, who either produce or consume the underlying commodity) and typically have access to supply and demand information other market players do not.\n\nNon-commercial large traders include large speculators (\"large specs\") such as commodity trading advisors (CTAs) and hedge funds. This group consists mostly of institutional and quasi-institutional money managers who do not deal in the underlying cash markets, but speculate in futures on a large-scale basis for their clients. The final COT category is called the non-reportable position category \u2014 otherwise known as small traders \u2014 i.e., the general public.\n\nIn an effort to make the COT data more transparent, in 2009 the CFTC began publishing a more detailed \"disaggregated\" report that breaks down traders into the following four groups: Producer/Merchant/Processor/User (traditional commercial hedgers); Swap Dealers (traders that deal primarily in commodity swaps and uses the futures markets to manage or hedge their risk); Managed Money (CTAs and other professional funds); and Other Reportables (all other traders).\nCOT data can be accessed at \n\nConfidence levels: Confidence levels offer a more precise estimate of an average value by setting upper and lower limits for a data set's central tendency. This range can suggest how precise a statistic is (mean, correlation, etc.) according to a certain probability. For example, 98-percent confidence levels suggest that the market is likely to have traded outside of therange just 2 percent of the time.\n\nAssume the S&P 500's average monthly move is 1.76 percent over the past 12 months, and we want to find the upper and lower confidence levels for this mean at the 95-percent confidence interval. (The higher the confidence interval, the wider this range is.)\n\nThe site  offers relatively easy-to-digest definitions of this and other statistical terms.\n\nCorrelation coefficient, sometimes referred to simply as correlation, refers to the degree of similarity between two variables. In the markets, correlation is typically used to measure how close the relationship is between two price series (e.g., two distinct stocks or markets), between an individual stock (or trading fund) and an index, and so on. Correlation coefficients range between -1.00 and +1.00, with +1.00 representing perfect positive correlation (i.e., two variables moving precisely in tandem); -1.00 represents perfect negative correlation (i.e., two variables moving exactly opposite to one another). A correlation coefficient of zero means the two variables have no discernible relation. The site  offers relatively easy-to-digest definitions of this and other statistical terms.\n\nCurve-fitting refers to the process of tailoring or optimizing a trading system's rules to produce the best result (typically, the highest profit) on a particular set of price data. However, trading rules that are overly fit to specific data in this fashion almost invariably produce poor results in actual trading because the exact conditions of the test data are never repeated precisely in the future.\n\nElliott Wave is a descriptive form of technical analysis based on the concept that price action unfolds in identifiable, structured waves that define both trend and countertrend moves.\n\nRalph Nelson Elliott (1871-1948) introduced his ideas through a series of letters to Charles J. Collins, who help Elliott publish The Wave Principle in 1938. Also with Collins' aid, Elliott published a series of articles in Financial World magazine in 1939. Today, Elliott Wave theory is probably best known through the work of Robert R. Prechter Jr., who in 1978 coauthored with A.J. Frost Elliott Wave Principle: Key to Stock Market Profits (John Wiley & Sons, 10th edition, 2001).\n\nElliott Wave theory contains elements of a concept known as a fractal, which is an object or shape that has self-similarity on different scales. Fractals are found in a variety of phenomena. For example, if you look at a mountain from a distance, you may see a peak with relatively smooth sides. As you move closer, you begin to see how the sides of the mountain are actually made up of smaller sub-peaks and sides, which consist of even smaller peaks and sides, all sharing a similar basic structure or pattern.\n\nSimilarly, part of wave theory is the idea that any wave cycle is part of a larger wave cycle that adheres to the same rules, and is also composed of smaller wave cycles with the same structure. Many devotees of Elliott Wave consider price action to be a natural phenomena driven by human emotion, which makes the fractal aspect of wave patterns a valid way to understand and describe the price movement.\n\nExponential moving average (EMA): While the simple moving average (SMA) calculation gives every price point in the average equal emphasis \u2014 for example, a five-day SMA is the sum of the most recent five closing prices divided by five \u2014 weighted moving averages emphasize more recent price action. An exponential moving average is a type of weighted moving average that uses the following formula:\n\nEMA = SC * price + (1 - SC) * EMA(yesterday)\n\nwhere: SC is a \"smoothing constant\" between 0 and 1, and EMA(yesterday) is the previous day's EMA value.\n\nYou can approximate a particular SMA length for an EMA by using this formula to calculate the equivalent smoothing constant:\n\nSC = 2/(n + 1)\n\nwhere: n = the number of days in a simple moving average of approximately equivalent length.\n\nFor example, a smoothing constant of 0.095 creates an exponential moving average equivalent to a 20-day SMA (2/(20 + 1) = 0.095). The larger n is, the smaller the constant, and the smaller the constant, the less impact the most recent price action will have on the EMA. In practice, most software programs allow you to simply choose how many days you want in your moving average and select either simple, weighted, or exponential calculations.\n\nFibonacci series: A number progression in which each successive number is the sum of the two immediately preceding it: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, and so on. As the series progresses, the ratio of a number in the series divided by the immediately preceding number approaches 1.618, a number that is attributed significance by many traders because of its appearance in natural phenomena (the progression of a shell's spiral, for example), as well as in art and architecture (including the dimensions of the Parthenon and the Great Pyramid). The inverse, 0.618 (0.62), has a similar significance.\nSome traders use fairly complex variations of Fibonacci numbers to generate price forecasts, but a basic approach is to use ratios derived from the series to calculate likely price targets. For example, if a stock broke out of a trading range and rallied from 25 to 55, potential retracement levels could be calculated by multiplying the distance of the move (30 points) by Fibonacci ratios \u2013\u2013 say, 0.382, 0.50, and 0.618 \u2013\u2013 and then subtracting the results from the high of the price move. In this case, retracement levels of 43.60 [55 - (30 * 0.38)], 40 [55 - (30 * 0.50)], and 36.40 [55 - (30 * 0.62)] would result.\nSimilarly, after a trading range breakout and an up move of 10 points, a Fibonacci follower might project the size of the next leg up in terms of a Fibonacci ratio \u2013\u2013 e.g., 1.382 times the first move, or 13.82 points in this case.\nThe most commonly used ratios are 0.382, 0.50, 0.618, 0.786, 1.00, 1.382, and 1.618. Depending on circumstances, other ratios, such as 0.236 and 2.618, are used.\n\nWhile Fibonacci retracements are used to calculate the possible partial correction levels of a previous price move (i.e., a reversal of up to 100 percent of a previous price swing), Fibonacci extension levels are used to extrapolate moves in the same direction as a previous price swing \u2014 for example, projecting a target for a new upswing that represents a 161.8-percent gain from a certain price level based on the size of the previous upswing.\n\nKeltner channels: Price bands formed by placing lines above and below a moving average of the \"typical price\" (the average of a bar's high, low, and closing prices) by a distance equal to the moving average of the daily ranges over an n-day period. The following definition uses a 10-day simple moving average (SMA) for both calculations.\n\nKey reversal: A basic key reversal high is a bar that makes a significantly higher high than the preceding high but reverses intrabar to close near the bottom of the bar's range. (Different definitions require the close to be below the close of the preceding bar, etc.) A key reversal is essentially a \"spike\" high that closes weakly. The traditional implication is that price has expended upside momentum and turned lower, foreshadowing further selling. (A key reversal low is the opposite pattern.) However, although such bars can often be observed \u2013 in retrospect \u2013 at market turning points, traders are apt to overlook them when they are followed by more price movement in the same direction. As with all patterns, objectifying such concepts as a \"significantly higher high\" and \"near the bottom\" are necessary to be able to consistently identify and test key reversal bars in different markets. Linear regression (\"best-fit\") line: A way to calculate a straight line that best fits a set of data (such as closing prices over a certain period) \u2014 that is, a line that most accurately reflects the slope, or trend, of the data.\nA regression line is calculated using the \"least squares\" method, which refers to finding the minimum squared (x*x, or x2) differences between price points and a straight line. For example, if two closing prices are 2 and 3 points away (the distance being calculated vertically) from a straight line, the squared differences between the points and the line are 4 and 9, respectively.\nThe squared differences are used (instead of just the differences) because some differences are negative (for points below the line) and others are positive (for points above the line). Squaring all the differences creates all-positive values and allows you to calculate a formula for the straight line.\nThe \"best-fit\" line is the line for which the sum of the squared differences between each price and the straight line are minimized.\nThe formula for a straight line (y) is:\n\ny = a + b*t where: t = time a = the initial value of the line when \"t\" is equal to zero (sometimes called the \"intercept\" value \u2014 i.e., the point at which the line intercepts the vertical y-axis) or the point at which a specific line begins b = the slope of the line, which is the rate at which the line rises or falls (e.g., 0.75 points per day). Back to top\n\nM N\n\nMoving average convergence-divergence (MACD): Although it is often grouped with oscillators, the MACD is more of an intermediate-term trend indicator (although it can reflect overbought and oversold conditions). The default MACD line (which can also be plotted as a histogram) is created by subtracting a 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) of closing prices from a 12-period EMA of closing prices; a nine-period EMA is then applied to the MACD line to create a \"signal line.\"\n\nMACD = EMA(C,12)-EMA(C,26)\n\nSignal line = EMA(MACD,9)\n\nMoving average crossover: A trend-following approach that signals a trend change when a shorter-term moving average crosses above or below a longer-term moving average.\nBack to top\n\nO P\n\nOpen interest: The number of outstanding (unclosed) positions in a given futures or options market.\n\nOptimization (and walk-forward optimization, walk-forward testing, in-sample, and out-of-sample: The\nprocess of testing a range of system parameters on historical price\ndata to find the \"best\" values for use in trading. For example, a\ntrading system that enters long when price makes an n-bar high might be\noptimized to find the value of n, from 10 to 100, that produces the most\nfavorable results. There is a great deal of debate over the benefits of\noptimization, because the process is often simply used to find system\nparameter values that produce the highest net profit on a certain set of\nhistorical data, with the expectation these values will produce similar\nresults in the future. However, this is rarely the case. Highly\noptimized parameters typically do nothing more than reflect the specific\ncircumstances of the data set from which they were derived; they will\ntypically underperform in the future because price action never unfolds\nexactly as it has in the past.\nSome traders believe optimization of any kind is potentially damaging.\nHowever, there is an argument that optimization can be used to find\nless-idealized but more reliable parameter settings by identifying\nranges of values with comparable, positive results. In the case of the\naforementioned n-bar breakout system, it might turn out that a 23-bar\nbreakout produced the best results over the initial test period, but the\nresults for 20-, 21-, 22-, 24-, 25-, and 26-bar breakouts were all\nnegative, and even n values up to 30 produced sub-par results. This\nsuggests the 23-bar results were an anomaly, and using this parameter\nwould likely result in poor performance in the future. By contrast, if\nall n values from 35 to 47 produced positive, comparable results \u2014 even\nif they were much less profitable than the 23-bar breakout \u2014 a\nrepresentative value from this stable range (i.e., the median value, 41)\nis much more likely to produce success in actual trading.\nTypically, parameter values are optimized on an initial data set (the\n\"test,\" \"sample\" or \"in-sample\" data), and then tested on a new,\ndifferent data set (the \"out-of-sample\" data) to simulate the process of\ntrading the system. This can be repeated several times \u2014 the process of\n\"walking the system forward\" on new data is the reason this approach is\nreferred to as \"walk-forward\" optimization. If the optimized values do\nnot perform consistently on new, out-of-sample data, they are not suited\nfor trading. Some system designers choose to re-optimize system\nparameters on relatively short data periods and use these parameters on\nthe next set of data, believing the price behavior from the more recent\npast has a greater chance of persisting into the near future. Others\nbelieve this simply results in a highly optimized system that will\nalways be one step behind the market.\nFinally, among the many problems of optimization is the challenge of\ndetermining what constitutes a \"best-performing\" value. Traders are apt\nto look exclusively at net profit, without incorporating measures of\nrisk (e.g., drawdown depth and duration) and consistency (e.g., winning\npercentage, average trade) that are likely to make future profitability\nmore likely.\n\nPoint-and-figure charts display price independently of time. Price advances and declines are represented by columns of Xs and Os, respectively. (Note: Charting programs often replace Os with squares.) Each time price advances by a certain amount, called the \"box size,\" an X is added to the ascending column of Xs. For example, when analyzing a stock, a box size of 1.00 point would mean an X would be added every time price gained 1.00 point. If the box size was .50, an X would be added every time price rallied 0.50 points, and so on.\n\nTo begin plotting a column of Os, price first has to decline a certain amount, called the reversal size. A reversal size of \"2\" would mean price would have to drop by two box sizes before you would end a column of ascending Xs and begin plotting a column of descending Os. Similarly, to begin a new column of Xs, price would have to turn back up at least 2.00 points.\n\nThe larger the box and reversal sizes, the more price fluctuations a point-and-figure chart will filter out. For more detail, you simply decrease those values.\n\nPurchasing power parity: The idea that an exchange rate should reflect the level that results in the same price (in the two currencies) for a product purchased in two countries. For example, if a certain automobile costs 50,000 British pounds in Great Britain, it should cost 25,000 U.S. dollars in the United States if the current British pound/U.S. dollar rate (GBP/USD) is 2.0000.\nBack to top\n\nQ R\n\nQuantitative easing is a tool a central bank uses to attempt to stimulate the economy when cutting interest rates is not feasible \u2014 such as when rates are already at or near zero. Through quantitative easing, the central bank purchases assets (e.g., treasuries, mortgages, securities) from financial institutions to pump money into the financial system. Quantitative easing is often referred to as \"printing money.\" Critics contend the practice runs a high risk of creating high inflation, among other drawbacks.\n\nR2 (r-squared): A measure of correlation strength. It is the square of the correlation coefficient, which is the measure of association of two variables ranging from +1 (perfect positive correlation) to -1 (perfect negative correlation), where zero represents no correlation. R-squared is always a positive number, ranging from zero to +1.\n\nSimple moving average (SMA). The simple moving average (SMA) is the mean price of a stock, futures contract, currency, or other instrument over a specific time period:\n\nN-day moving average = Sum (Pricet, Pricet-1 \u2026 Pricet-N)/N\n\nwhere,\n\nPricet = today's price\nPricet-N = price N days ago\n\nFor example, a 20-day SMA is the sum of the prices of the most recent 20 days, divided by 20.\nThe closing price is usually used in moving average calculations, although the high, low, opening price, or average price of a price bar is sometimes substituted. As the market moves forward in time, the newest price is added to the average and the oldest is dropped from it.\nMoving averages can be calculated for any time increment \u2013 daily, intraday, weekly, monthly. For a five-minute bar chart, for example, a 10-bar SMA would be the average price of the 10 most recent five-minute bars. Moving averages are typically used to highlight trend direction and filter out smaller fluctuations (or \"noise\") from a data series. The degree to which they do this depends on the length of the average: A longer moving average reflects a longer-term trend and filters out shorter-term fluctuations, while a shorter moving average reflects the more immediate trend and filters out less noise. However, this filtering comes at a cost: The longer the average, the more it lags behind the movements of the data series.\n\nThe European currency \"snake:\" A short-lived agreement among European member states in the early 1970s to limit currency fluctuations within a proscribed percentage band.\n\nStandard error channel (linear regression channel): The linear regression line is a straight line that minimizes the distance between itself and every data point in a series. A standard error measures the variance from the linear regression. Subtracting the standard error from the linear regression line yields the bottom of the standard error channel, and adding it to the linear regression value gives you the top of the channel.\n\nThe standard error channel is a parallel concept to Bollinger Bands, which use the standard deviation calculation to set boundaries above and below a moving average to capture variance away from the average. Because the moving average is a wavy line, the Bollinger bands are wavy, too, and also widen or narrow as variability rises or falls. The standard error does the same thing, only with straight lines. The critical difference is that you don't need to choose a starting and ending point for Bollinger Bands, because they track a moving average that constantly discards old data and refreshes itself with new data. To construct a useful linear regression channel, however, you have to subjectively select starting and ending points.\n\nSupport and resistance: Support is a price level that acts as a \"floor,\" preventing prices from dropping below that level. Resistance is the opposite: a price level that acts as a \"ceiling;\" a barrier that prevents prices from rising higher.\n\nSupport and resistance levels are a natural outgrowth of the interaction of supply and demand in any market. For example, increased demand for a stock will cause its price to rise, creating an uptrend. But when price has risen to a certain level, traders and investors will take profits and short sellers will come into the market, creating \"resistance\" to further price increases. Price may retreat from and advance to this resistance level many times, sometimes eventually breaking through it and continuing the previous trend, other times reversing completely.\n\nSupport and resistance should be thought of more as general price levels rather than precise prices. For example, if a stock makes a low of 52.15, rallies slightly, then declines again to 52.15, then rallies again, a subsequent move down to 52 does not violate the \"support level\" of 52.15. In this case, the fact that the stock retraced once to the exact price level it had established before is more of a coincidence than anything else.\n\nTrue range (TR): A measure of price movement or volatility that accounts for the gaps that occur between price bars. This calculation provides a more accurate reflection of the size of a price move over a given period than the standard range calculation, which is simply the high of a price bar minus the low of a price bar. The true range calculation was developed by Welles Wilder and discussed in his book New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems (Trend Research, 1978).True range can be calculated on any time frame or price bar \u2014 five-minute, hourly, daily, weekly, etc. Using daily price bars as an example, true range is the greatest (absolute) distance of the following:\n1. Today's high and today's low.\n2. Today's high and yesterday's close.\n3. Today's low and yesterday's close.\n\nAverage true range (ATR) is simply a moving average of the true range over a certain time period. For example, the five-day ATR would be the average of the true range calculations over the last five days.\nBack to top\n\nU V\n\nUlcer Index: A measure of the depth and duration of a drawdown from an equity peak.\n\nVariance and standard deviation: Variance measures how spread out a group of values are \u2014 in other words, how much they vary. Mathematically, variance is the average squared \"deviation\" (or difference) of each number in the group from the group's mean value, divided by the number of elements in the group. For example, for the numbers 8, 9, and 10, the mean is 9 and the variance is:\n\n{(8-9)2 + (9-9)2 + (10-9)2}/3 = (1 + 0 + 1)/3 = 0.667\n\nNow look at the variance of a more widely distributed set of numbers: 2, 9, and 16:\n\n{(2-9)2 + (9-9)2 + (16-9)2}/3 = (49 + 0 + 49)/3 = 32.67\n\nThe more varied the prices, the higher their variance \u2014 the more widely distributed they will be. The more varied a market's price changes from day to day (or week to week, etc.), the more volatile that market is.\nA common application of variance in trading is standard deviation, which is the square root of variance. The standard deviation of 8, 9, and 10 is: sq. rt. 0.667 = .82; the standard deviation of 2, 9, and 16 is: sq. rt. 32.67 = 5.72.\n\nVolatility: The level of price movement in a market. Historical (\"statistical\") volatility measures the price fluctuations (usually calculated as the standard deviation of closing prices) over a certain time period \u2014 e.g., the past 20 days. Implied volatility is the current market estimate of future volatility as reflected in the level of option premiums. The higher the implied volatility, the higher the option premium.\nBack to top"}

{"text": "Price, Range and Volume Filters filters in this next lesson are fairly straightforward, but there are a few details I want to highlight.\nIn a previous lesson I showed you the formulas for the size of the weekly and monthly range, along with the price movement for these time periods. The intraday versions of these filters work in a similar way. The 15 minute range is the difference between the high and the low for the last 15 minutes. The 5 minute price movement is the difference between the price 5 minutes ago and the current price. These are all available as dollars or percent.\nIntraday volume is similar. We look at the total volume for the last 5, 10, 15, or 30 minutes. These are always listed in percent. 200 percent means that the stock has traded twice as much as it normally does in the same time frame.\nNow let's look at some special cases. First, what happens if I'm looking at the 10 minute price change when we are in the middle of a 10 minute candle? That's simple. We don't look at 10 minute candles. We always look at one minute candles. For the 10 minute filters, we always look at the last 10 complete candles. If a candle in in progress, then we also look at that candle. So the 10 minute filters actually look at a time frame of 9 to 10 minutes.\nThese examples only show a 10 minute filter, but the rules are the same for other time frames.\nNext, what happens if there is no trading at all during one or more candles? Different software packages handle this case in different ways. For these filters we fill in the missing time periods with very simple candles. Notice that these 10 minute filters will always look back 10 minutes, regardless of how much or little the stock traded in that time.\nFinally, what do these filters show in the morning, before we have a lot of candles? If necessary, we look at pre-market data. At 9:35, the 10 minute filters will look at data from 9:25, 5 minutes before the open. These filters never look at yesterday's data. If we do not have 10 minutes worth of data, then we'll look at all the data that we do have.\nSome of our filters use other rules for these special cases. I put this group of filters all into one lesson because they all follow the same rules."}

{"text": "Margin\n\nMargin is a minimum amount of cash and/or securites that must be held in a trading account in order to trade a particular market. For example, in order to trade the DAX futures market, a trader must have at least 10,125 Euros in their trading account. For most day trading markets (such as futures, options, and stocks), the margin amount is set by the exchange that offers the market, but for some markets (such as the forex markets) the margin amount is set by the brokerage.\n\nHow is Margin Set?\n\nMargin varies from one market to another (even for the same type of market). For example, the margin for the ZC (Corn) futures market is $2,025, but the margin for the ZW (Wheat) futures market is $6,075. Margin amounts vary based upon the volatility of the market, and the tick value of the market. For example, the ZG (Gold) futures market moves approximately 200 ticks per day, and is worth $100 per point, whereas the ZI (Silver) futures market moves approximately 500 ticks per day, and is worth $5,000 per point. As as result of these differences, the margin for the ZG futures market is $4,455, but the margin for the ZI futures market is $10,125.\n\nHow is Margin Used?\n\nWhen a trading account is flat (no active trades), it will have its full amount of margin available for trading. When the trader enters a new trade, the amount of available margin is decreased accordingly. While the trade is active, the margin will remain unavailable as it is being used to cover the active trade. When the trader exits the trade, the margin will become available again, and can then be used to enter a new trade on the same market or any other market. If the balance of a trading account drops below the margin amount required for a particular market, the trader will not be able to enter any new trades on that market until the account balance is increased."}

The spreadsheet also generates the pricing lattice, which can be viewed.\n\nAmerican options allow the holder to exercise an option contract at any time before the expiry. European options, on the hand, can only be exercised at the expiry date. This means that for any given situation, American options demand a higher price than European options because of their greater flexibility.\n\nUnlike European puts, American puts cannot be valued analytically. Therefore numerical techniques (such as monte-carlo simulation, the method of lines, the Bjerksun-Stensland model, or binomial trees) must be used . This article, for example, describes a novel Monte-Carlo method to price American Options\n\nBinomial trees divide time (from the current time to maturity) into a large number of slices. At each stage, stock price can either increase (with probability p) or decrease (with probability 1-p) in value. Call and puts are then priced by moving backwards in time (this is known as backwards induction).\n\nThis method gives the price of an option at multiple points in time (and not just at the expiry date, as with the standard Black-Scholes model). Binomial trees are hence particularly useful for American options, which can be exercised at any time before the expiry date.\n\nAdditionally, binomial trees can help analysts decide when best to exercise an American option because the change in option price is given over time.\n\nPrice an American Option with a Binomial Tree\n\nThe Excel spreadsheet is simple to use.

{"text": "Screening with the composite indicators\n\nUpdated on 2010-11-09\n\nComposite indicators are very powerful and they can be easily used in the screener tool as trading rules or to display data. The screener basic function is to show you a list of symbols that pass the screen conditions/rules you have specified. If you want to display stocks with an increasing volume then simply adds the appropriate trading rule, for example: volume >= hhv(volume, 10).\n\nThe screener uses an initial list of symbols, calculates, for each symbol, the filter rules you have specified then checks the filter value at a specific date or bar. It will check that value for a specific date if you instruct it to do so otherwise it will check for a bar number (Last bar number minus a lag value - could be equal to zero). These settings can be defined in the \"Screen\" tab of the Screener form.\n\nWhen using composite/index function in the screener, a lot of QuantShare users do not get the expected results when analyzing the screen using the \"Bar\" method.\nFor instance, if they are analyzing 5 stocks and using the \"AddColumn\" function to display the rank of each stock based on the close price value, they may get results that at first appear to be wrong. But these results are not wrong and there is a good reason why they are usually different from what you can expect.\n\nComposite indicators/functions are calculated by dates, which means that, for each trading date, the composite function gets the appropriate values from the stock quotes and then performs its calculation based on these values (from the specified stocks and for the same date). If a stock does not contain a value for that date, then it will not be used (for that date).\nWhen screening by bar, the values displayed by the screener are those from a specific bar number and therefore they are not necessarily based on the same date (Stock1 may have its last bar ends at 10-10-2010 and stock2 may have its last bar ends at 10-11-2010).\nAs a result, composite values that are displayed in the screener grid could be based on different dates and our 5 stocks ranking values may not appear as expected."}

The photos shows one of their top 20 strategies there. I looked at the summary of that strategy.\n\nAs you can see, this strategy made 296 pips and has executed 141 trades. This means that if you pay 1 pip for every trade, you would have made only 155 pips on this strategy (296 minus the 141 pips that would have paid for per trade). That is about 50% of the reported performance. So in this specific example, 1 pip equates to 50% of the gain you could have made. I would say that's pretty expensive, not to mention the same 144 pips would have been paid if the strategy had lost you money.\n\nThe big problem of charging traders with a spread increase is that you are not only defining a pricing structure that is not properly defined, but you are also creating a motivation of the signal provider to trade more often as opposed to incentivize them for successful (and profitable) trading"}
{"text": "Bollinger bands are comprised of three bands which are referred to as the upper band, lower band and central band. The central band is a simple moving average which is normally set at 20 period and the upper and lower band represent the chart points at 2 standard deviations from the central band.\n\nThe following is an example of Bollinger bands indicator on the EURJPY currency pair.\n\nBollinger Bands Indicator On EURJPY Currency Pair\n\nBollinger bands are used to measure markets volatility. When there is not much volatility Bollinger Bands are close together. When market has a lot of volatility Bollinger bands spread apart. Check the following picture. In the following picture you can see the areas where Bollinger bands are close together and there is very less volatility. You can also see the areas where the Bollinger bands are spread apart and you can see a lot of volatility. This can also be told in a reverse way. When the Bollinger bands are coming closer together means the volatility of the currency pair is decreasing. When the Bollinger bands are moving away from each other that mean the volatility is increasing.\n\nBollinger Bands Contrasting and Expanding\n\nHow to trade using Bollinger Bands:\n\nBollinger Bands Squeezing: When the Bollinger bands squeeze that means when the bands come very close together that means a break out is about to occur. If the price starts to break the upper bands then that means the price will usually go up. If the Bollinger bands start to break the lower bands means the price will usually go down. Check the following picture. In the following picture after the bands squeezed together it broke the upper bands and moved upwards.\n\nCheck the following picture. It is a USDJPY hourly chart. You can see the Bollinger bands squeezing in the highlighted area. The price broke the lower Bollinger bands and it went down.\n\nUSDJPY Bollinger Bands Squeezing and Breakout\n\nUsing Bollinger bands in range markets: You can use Bollinger bands with any other indicators like stochastic, CCI etc. in a range market. You can identify range markets with Bollinger bands easily. In a range market the Bollinger bands are parallel or almost parallel to each other and horizontal. In such conditions if the stochastic indicator goes in to an oversold condition and the price touches or breaks the lower Bollinger bands you can buy the currency pair. If the stochastic indicator goes into an overbought condition and the price touches or breaks the upper Bollinger band you can sell the currency pair.\n\nCheck the following picture. In the following picture the Bollinger bands are parallel to each other and you can see the buy and sell opportunities when the stochastic indicator goes into the oversold and overbought regions.\n\nBollinger Bands and Range Market\n\nUsing Bollinger bands in trending markets: When the Bollinger bands are parallel to each other but moving in upward or downward direction, it is a trending market. When the trend is upward or downward you should not enter trading immediately. You have to enter the market at price reversals. When the market is trending generally the price reverses to the middle band and the middle band acts a strong resistance. Sometimes the price also reverses until the other band then starts to follow the trend again. You can look at other indicators like stochastic or use other techniques like candlestick patterns to enter the trading in the direction of trend at this point. When the price reaches the middle band or the opposite band and an engulfing candlestick pattern is formed in the direction of trend, you can enter the trading. Or if the price reaches the over bought or oversold regions you can enter trading in the direction of trend. Check the following picture the Bollinger bands are parallel to each other and moving upwards. That means the price is trending upwards. You can see that the price reverses until the middle band a lot of times and then followed the trend again.\n\nBollinger Bands Upward Trending Market\n\nTrend Line Breakouts: This technique can be generally used in daily chart. Using this technique you can get 50 to 100 pips profit. I will explain you this technique using the following picture. The following is a daily chart of EURGBP currency pair. You can see the trend line I have drawn for this. The trend line is broken with a strong bullish candlestick. Moreover it also broken the middle band and closed above the middle band. There is around 50 pips distance between the current candlestick and the upper band. You can take advantage of this and enter trading. You can close the trade when the price touches the upper band. Moreover stochastic indicator is not also in the overbought region.\n\nBollinger Bands Trend Line Breakout\n\nChart Patterns: You can use chart patterns with Bollinger bonds. Check the following picture. The following is the daily chart of EURUSD and you can see a reverse head and shoulder pattern for the currency pair. The neckline was broken by a strong bullish candlestick and it also broke the Bollinger bands. You can see the strong upward trend after that.\n\nEURUSD Neck Line Breakout\n\nBollinger bands and 123 pattern: You can use 123 pattern with Bollinger bands to find the beginning of a trend. You can also use candlestick patterns with this. Check the following picture. It is again the daily chart of EURGBP. You can see the 123 pattern I have identified. The price touched the upper Bollinger bands and returned to middle of the bands. Then a doji and then a strong bullish candlestick formed. This is the entry point. The stop loss can be placed below the bullish candlestick. You can see the trending market after the 123 pattern. It went up to almost 300 pips.\n\nBollinger Bands and 123 Pattern - Picture 1\n\nThe following is another 123 pattern for the same currency pair. Now at the third point a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern is formed. As you can see I have entered a sell trade at this point. I am expecting a large move at this point. I will move my take profit levels and stop loss levels accordingly."}

At the basic level the journal is a record or log of trades taken, the day and time of the trade, the entry and exit prices, long or short, size, stops and targets, number of points made, commissions and net profit/loss.\n\nTrading seems so easy on the surface.

Let us first give a definition of setting a goal.\n\nIs that necessary to keep the stops so religiously even before the forex beginner actually starts live trading ?

{"text": "The chart patterns we have already looked at focused on one or two candlesticks at a time. In addition to these candlestick patterns there are also a number of different larger chart patterns which are formed by many candlesticks. Just like the candlestick patterns they are used to gauge the mood and psychology of the market.\n\nHead and shoulders pattern\n\nOne of the most commonly used chart patterns is the Head and shoulders pattern. It indicates that the buying pressure (in the case of an uptrend) is being exhausted. This is a reversal pattern which comprises of 3 peaks and 2 lows with the central peak being higher than the other two. The level joining the two lows are referred to as the neckline. Once the pattern is complete and the price breaks through the neckline it is expected to continue downwards.\n\nThe pattern can also appear at the end of a downtrend as an upside down mirrored version of the one drawn above with the head being lower than the two shoulders\n\nIt should be noted that the Head and shoulders pattern is often not perfectly shaped with the neckline often ascending or descending or one shoulders being higher/lower than the other. In order to qualify a pattern as a head and shoulders when this happens, the lowest point of one shoulder should be lower than the peak of the other. Often even once the price breaks the neckline there may be a temporary pullback to the neckline (to test the resistance level created by the broken support level) before the price resumes its course downwards."}

{"text": "In a down or flat market, it can be tough to invest or trade. One way to\nraise cash in a slow market, without selling positions, is to sell covered\ncalls. If you are right about the overall market trend and the trend of your\nparticular stocks, you can generate a modest return while waiting for overall\nconditions to recover.\n\nSelling Covered Calls In A Slow Or Down Market\n\nSelling covered calls is another way to take advantage of a slow or down market.\n\nThe tactic is particularly useful when you already have a position in a stock\nyou intend to hold for some time (at least longer than you expect the market\ndown trend to be). Selling covered calls can take the sting out of the paper\nlosses you must endure while continuing to hold the stock.\n\nThe upside of a covered call tactic is immediate cash in your account. The\ndownside is that it ties up your position (until you close the call position)\nand a possible assignment of your option, which means you must deliver the\nstock.\n\nHowever, if you feel that the market truly is headed down for a while, and you\nare right, selling covered calls can put cash into your account immediately\n(subject to clearing) without ever having to deliver the stock to the person who\nbuys the call option.\n\nMeanwhile, you can continue to hold your stock position until the market\nrecovers.\n\nCovered Calls - Definitions\n\nA call is an option that gives the holder the right to buy 100 shares of stock\nfrom the selling of the call-option-contract at a specified \"strike\" price.\n\nThe \"strike price\" is the amount that the holder of a call option will pay if he\ndecides to exercise the option. If the strike price is $50 and the option is\nexercised, then the holder will pay $5,000 ($50 times 100 shares) to the seller\nof the option.\n\nThe \"option price\" is the amount that a single option contract costs. Option\nprices are always quoted in per-share prices, but a single option contract\nalways covers 100 shares. The total cost of purchasing an option is always the\n\"option price\" times 100 shares.\n\nAn \"in-the-money\" option is one whose strike price is lower than the currently\ntrading price of the option. The total \"option price,\" however, is usually high\nenough to prevent the option from being exercised for an immediate profit. When\nthe stock price rises high enough so that the total strike price paid plus the\ntotal option price is lower than the total market value of the shares, there is\nan incentive to exercise the option. Often, option holders will simply sell the\noption for a profit rather than exercise it. Many times, the purchaser of the\noption in this case is someone who original sold the option, with the intent to\nprevent his actual shares from being called.\n\nA \"covered call\" is a term describing a call that is sold by a person who\nalready owns enough shares of the stock in question to deliver those shares, if\nthe option is assigned.\n\n\"Assigned\" means that the person holding a call option makes the decision to\nexercise it, pay the strike price for the shares and have the stock delivered to\nhim. The \"assignment\" occurs when the exchange tells the seller that someone has\nexercised the option and the shares must be delivered. Generally, no action\nneeds to be taken by the option seller; the sales proceeds appear and the stock\nis removed from your account.\n\nNote: You should probably not try this tactic as your first experience with\noptions, however. Start with simply purchasing options. As a purchaser, you\npotential loss is always limited to the amount you spend for the option itself.\n\nChoices\n\nWhen you decide to sell a covered call option, there are several chooses you\nneed to make:\n\n-Expiration date\n-Strike price\n-Number of shares\n\nFor expiration dates, there are usually several choices of varying length. The\nlonger the expiration date, the higher the premium for the option will be, but\nthe more risk you take that the stock might be called.\n\nThere are also usually numerous choices for a strike price. In general, the\nnumber of outstanding options at any time is higher for options that are\n\"in-the-money.\" Choosing an option contract with a higher number of outstanding\ncontracts means greater liquidity. Higher volume can provide better pricing, but\nalso \"fresher\" bid/ask data (which can sometimes be a problem).\n\nFor a \"covered call\" tactic, the number of contracts you can sell is limited by\nthe total number of shares you already own. You must have at least 100 shares to\nwrite a covered call contract. You can sell any number of contracts for which\nyou own 100 shares. For example, if you own 850 shares of a stock, you can sell\nup to 8 covered call contracts.\n\nAfter you have made these choices, you are ready to actually sell the covered\ncall. All you need to know is the ticker symbol for the call option.\n\nMost brokerages provide an \"options chain\" capability for easy lookup of the\nticker symbol. Although there is a standardized convention for option ticker\nsymbols, clicking on the \"options chain\" link at your online brokerage is a lot\neasier.\n\nSelling A Covered Call\n\nWhen you decide to sell a covered call option, you place an order with your\nbroker, just as with any sales order.\n\nThe actual steps to place the order vary by brokerage; check with your broker\nfor the exact procedure.\n\nPricing\n\nAs with any sales order, you have the choice of a market or limit order.\n\nPricing is determined by a bid/ask system, just as with stocks and the same\ncautions about marker orders exist with options.\n\nThe exact price offered for any option is set by the market. The theoretical\n\"correct\" pricing involves mathematics that is beyond the scope of this article.\n\nBefore placing an order, verify the date of the most recently traded option with\nthe same strike and expiration date. Sometimes, the bid/ask data shown for a\nparticular option can be quite old for a thinly traded contract. If so, do not\nplace a market order to sell the contract.\n\nReceipt of Proceeds\n\nWhen you sell a covered call, the proceeds from the sale appear in your account\nas cash. The amount earns interest or offsets your total margin balance, just as\na sale or other check deposit would (and unlike short sale proceeds).\n\nHowever, while the option contract is open, a restriction is placed on your\nshares. In general, the underlying shares for the stock behind a covered call\ncannot be sold unless the open call contract is first closed. If the shares were\nsold prior to the option position being closed, the call would become a \"naked\"\ncall. Generally, a brokerage firm will not allow an open option contract to\nconvert from covered to naked status while the position is still open.\n\nIn addition, the value of the shares behind your open covered call position will\nnot be used to determine your overall margin capability (generally). Selling a\ncovered call lowers you margin capability (in most cases).\n\nThe Upside\n\nSelling covered calls provides you with the following benefits in a down market:\n\n-Cash proceeds, which can offset the paper losses during a down market\n-The ability to \"set your price\" for selling the underlying stock\n-The holding period for the underlying stock is unaltered by selling the calls.\n(Important if you are close to the long-term capital gains period)\n\nIf all goes well with the \"selling covered call\" strategy, the option expires\nwithout you having to ever do anything. At that point, if you still think the\nmarket is headed down, you can sell new covered calls against the very same\nshares of stock.\n\nThe \"set your price\" concept involves picking a strike price at which you would\nhappy to sell the stock. For example, if you original envisioned selling the\nstock at $50 a share, but the current price is just $42 a share, it may be\nbeneficial to sell a covered call with a strike price of $50. This is what you\nwould have sold for anyway, but by selling the covered call, you increase the\ntotal proceeds from your sale.\n\nThe Risks\n\nThe risks associated with selling covered calls are largely related to the stock\nprice rising unexpectedly and include:\n\n-Having to close your call option position by buying the option at a higher\nprice than you sold it for\n-Having to deliver your shares as a result of the call option being assigned to\nyou\n-Limiting your ability to sell the underlying shares while the option is still\nopen\n\nThe last risk is probably minimal, as the covered call tactic is primarily\ndesigned for situations where you want to continue holding a stock during a down\nmarket period.\n\nBefore embarking on any covered call sales tactic, you should determine if you\nwould be comfortable actually selling the stock if the strike price were\nreached. If not, rethink your approach.\n\nMore Information On The Selling Covered Calls Tactic\n\nFor an excellent discussion on the covered call strategy, we recommend the\nfollowing book: \"The Short Book On Options, A Conservative Strategy for the Buy\nand Hold Investor \" by Mark D.

{"text": "Another must read things that make you go hmmmm\n\n\"What is being requested is financial assistance. It has nothing to do with a rescue\"\n\u2013 Luis de Guindos, Spanish Finance Minister\n\nClassical conditioning (also Pavlovian conditioning or respondent con- ditioning) is a form of learning in which one stimulus, the conditioned stimulus or CS, comes to signal the occurrence of a second stimulus, the unconditioned stimulus or US. The US is usually a biologically significant stimulus such as food or pain that elicits a response from the start; this is called the un- conditioned response or UR. The CS usually produces no particular response at first, but after conditioning it elicits the conditioned response or CR. Classical conditioning differs from operant or instrumental conditioning, in which behavior emitted by the organism is strengthened or weakened by its conse- quences (e.g. reward or punishment).\n\nConditioning is usually done by pairing the two stimuli, as in Pavlov's classic experi- ments. Pavlov presented dogs with a ringing bell (CS) followed by food (US). The food (US) elicited salivation (UR), and after repeated bell-food pairings the bell also caused the dogs to salivate (CR).\n\nIn short, by associating the sound of a ringing bell with the appearance of food, Pavlov condi- tioned dogs to salivate merely at the sound of the bell.\n\nFor many years, this classical conditioning has been prevalent across financial markets the world over but, while its prevalence cannot be doubted, it has remained unobtrusive for one reason and one reason only\u2014it has worked al- most flawlessly. On Wall Street, however, no suc- cessful idea was ever an orphan and so classical conditioning's fruits were passed off as those of heightened intellect amongst the great and good of the financial world.

{"text": "Elliot Wave Theory (EWT)\n\nBasics of Elliot Wave Theory\n\nThe basic tenet of Elliot Wave Theory is that the movement of stock market indexes and prices can be described as a series of waves, and that there are 9 degrees of waves that cover different lengths of time, which Elliot named from the longest time span to the shortest:\n\nGrand Supercycle\n\nSupercycle\n\nCycle\n\nPrimary\n\nIntermediate\n\nMinor\n\nMinute\n\nMinuette\n\nSubminuette\n\nEach wave of a specific degree is composed of waves of lesser degrees, so the Grand Supercycle wave is composed of Supercycle waves, which is composed of Cycle waves, which is composed of Primary waves, and so on.\n\nEach wave consists of a motive wave where its main direction is that of the Elliot Wave of the degree immediately above it, and is followed by a corrective wave that moves counter to the motive wave. The impulse wave can be further componentized into 5 subwaves, usually numbered from 1 \u2013 5. Subwaves 1, 3, and 5 move in the direction of the motive wave itself, while subwaves 2 and 4 are corrective waves that move counter to the motive waves. The corrective wave can also be broken down into 3 subwaves, usually designated by the letters A \u2013 C. Subwaves A and C move counter to the preceding motive wave, while subwave B is in the direction of the preceding motive wave. The complete motive wave plus the complete corrective wave constitutes a cycle.\n\nThe subwaves have a fractal quality\u2014each Elliot Wave is part of another Elliot Wave of the next higher degree, and is, itself, composed of Elliot Waves of the next lower degree. Specifically, each 2 adjacent subwaves of an Elliot Wave is composed of the 8 waves of the next lower degree, and those waves in turn are also composed of waves of the next lower degree, and so on. So, in the above diagram, Wave 3 would be considered the motive wave of the next lesser degree wave, while Wave 4 would be the corrective wave of the next lesser degree wave.\n\nWhen a wave moves in the same direction as the Elliot Wave in the next higher degree, it is called an actionary wave (aka trend wave); if it moves in the opposite direction, it is called a reactionary wave (aka countertrend wave).\n\nElliot Waves are actually much more complex than even the above discussion would imply. There are 6 specific rules that are considered inviolate\u2014if they are not satisfied, then a wave cannot be considered an Elliot Wave. These basic inviolate rules are the following:\n\nImpulse waves move in the same general direction as the wave of the next higher degree.\n\nImpulse wave consists of 5 subwaves.\n\nSubwaves 1, 3, and 5 of the impulse wave are also impulse waves of 1 less degree, and subwaves 2 and 4 are corrective waves of 1 lesser degree.\n\nSubwaves 1 and 5 may have an impulse or diagonal pattern.\n\nSubwave 3 is always an impulse wave.\n\nIn cash markets, within an impulse pattern, subwave 4 never overlaps subwave 1, but it may do so in futures markets.\n\nThen there are guidelines, which may or may not be present or may vary in detail. An important quality of Elliot Waves is that while their form is specific, the amplitude and duration of the waves will vary, which greatly lessens their value as a forecasting tool.\n\nThe main practical application of Elliot Wave Theory is considered to be that it restricts the number of possible future paths of the market and that it allows an Elliottician to assess the relative probabilities of each path. Generally, the more guidelines that are satisfied by a particular path, the more likely it will occur.\n\nFibonacci Sequence and the Golden Ratio\n\nBoth Collins and Elliot had a fascination with the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio.\n\nA Fibonacci sequence is formed by taking 2 numbers\u2014any 2 numbers\u2014and adding them together to form a 3rd number; then the 2nd and 3rd numbers are added again to form a 4th number, and this is continued to any desired length. The ratio of the last number over the penultimate number approaches 1.618, and this ratio can be found in many natural objects, and for this reason, this ratio is called the golden ratio. The golden ratio is actually an irrational number, like pi, and is often denoted by the Greek letter, phi (\u03a6)."}

{"text": "Related Topics\n\nWhen you buy stocks it is very important to understand equity derivative.\n\nEquity derivative\n\nIn finance, an equity derivative is a class of financial instruments whose value is at least partly derived from one or more underlying equity securities. Market participants trade equity derivatives in order to transfer or transform certain risks associated with the underlying security. Options are by far the most common equity derivative, however there are many other types of equity derivatives that are actively traded.\n\nEquity options\n\nEquity options are the most common type of equity derivative. They provide the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a quantity of stock (1 contract = 100 shares of stock), at a set price (strike price), within a certain period of time (prior to the expiration date).\n\nWarrants\n\nIn finance, a warrant is a security that entitles the holder to buy stock of the company that issued it at a specified price, which is much higher than the stock price at time of issue. Warrants are frequently attached to bonds or preferred stock as a sweetener, allowing the issuer to pay lower interest rates or dividends. They can be used to enhance the yield of the bond, and make them more attractive to potential buyers.\n\nConvertible bonds\n\nConvertible bonds are bonds that can be converted into shares of stock in the issuing company, usually at some pre-announced ratio. It is a hybrid security with debt- and equity-like features. It can be used by investors to obtain the upside of equity-like returns while protecting the downside with regular bond-like coupons.\n\nEquity futures, options and swaps\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to the equity markets using futures, options and swaps. These can be done on single stocks, a customized basket of stocks or on an index of stocks. These equity derivatives derive their value from the price of the underlying stock or stocks.\n\nStock market index futures\n\nStock market index futures are futures contracts used to replicate the performance of an underlying stock market index. They can be used for hedging against an existing equity position, or speculating on future movements of the index. Indices for futures include well-established indices such as S&P, FTSE, DAX, CAC40 and other G12 country indices. Indices for OTC products are broadly similar, but offer more flexibility.\n\nEquity basket derivatives\n\nEquity basket derivatives are futures, options or swaps where the underlying is a non-index basket of shares. They have similar characteristics to equity index derivatives, but are always traded OTC (over the counter, ie between established institutional investors), as the basket definition is not standardized in the way that an equity index is.\n\nThese are used normally for correlation trading.\n\nSingle-stock futures\n\nSingle-stock futures are exchange-traded futures contracts based on an individual underlying security rather than a stock index. Their performance is similar to that of the underlying equity itself, although as futures contracts they are usually traded with greater leverage. Another difference is that holders of long positions in single stock futures typically do not receive dividends and holders of short positions do not pay dividends. Single-stock futures may be cash-settled or physically settled by the transfer of the underlying stocks at expiration, although in the United States only physical settlement is used to avoid speculation in the market....\n\nEquity index swaps\n\nAn equity index swap is an agreement between two parties to swap two sets of cash flows on predetermined dates for an agreed number of years. The cash flows will be an equity index value swapped, for instance, with LIBOR. Swaps can be considered as being a relatively straightforward way of gaining exposure to an asset class you require. They can also be relatively cost efficient.\n\nEquity swap\n\nAn equity swap, like an equity index swap, is an agreement between two parties to swap two sets of cash flows. In this case the cash flows will be the price of an underlying stock value swapped, for instance, with LIBOR. A typical example of this type of derivative is the Contract for difference (CFD) where one party gains exposure to a share price without buying or selling the underlying share making it relatively cost efficient as well as making it relevantly easy to transact.\n\nExchange-traded derivatives\n\nOther examples of equity derivative securities include exchange-traded funds and Intellidexes"}

{"text": "Confirmation On A Chart\n\nDefinition of 'Confirmation On A Chart'\n\nAn indicator or chart pattern that provides evidence that the initial trading alert in question is indicative of an actual trading opportunity. Traders look to other technical indicators to confirm their expected prediction so that they can have as many technical factors working in their favor as possible. This increases the probability of making a highly successful trade.\n\nInvestopedia explains 'Confirmation On A Chart'\n\nFor example, a trader who witnesses a short-term moving average cross above a longer-term moving average would predict that the upward momentum over the coming weeks is likely to increase. Before this trader decides to place an order for the security he or she may want to look to other indicators as confirmation of the initial prediction. This chart confirmation is used to increase the conviction of the trader, and it generally becomes more influential when three or more indicators are predicting the same type of movement"}
{"text": "What To Do On A Day Like This\n\nFrance elects an anti-austerity government that quickly ensures its CDS are the ones going up the most.\n\nThe markets, all around the world, go into a crazed risk off dive. The tree shakes, and it shakes bad. Speculators all around drop to the floor as if they were over-ripened fruit long past its due date.\n\nWhat can a reasonable trader do in a day like this? It's actually quite simple, if care was taken before this day came, one would have a few short hedges in place, and obviously, one wouldn't have any excess exposure. Also useful, one would have compiled a \"to buy\" list. So in a day like this, one could remove a bit of short exposure and add some positions from the buy list. Say, Exelon (EXC), because of the natural gas (UNG) thesis. Or other more common stocks, such as Intel (INTC) or Apple (AAPL). If one is going to buy those stocks, might as well do it in these dips, and not when they're flying high.\n\nThe stocks on a \"buy list\" need two things:\n\nThey need to be fundamentally sound and fairly valued, where the only thing missing is the buying dip;\n\nA thesis for them to resume their upward trends once the dip is gone.\n\nI've already talked about how I expect natural gas to go up in price during 2012 and 2013, so that's the thesis for Exelon. As for stocks like Apple or Intel, one just needs to remember that Bernanke is not going to sit tight forever with the market going down the tubes and employment numbers also turning weak again. So, as the stock market drops, long exposure needs to be built up slowly for the inevitable QE-fed rebound.\n\nBut not exposure in any kind of stock. One needs to buy quality. There are still stocks, such as Salesforce.com (CRM) or Amazon.com (AMZN) that trade entirely on hope, not fundamentals. Those might rebound as easily as the other stocks, but they also carry the risk of permanent and heavy losses. One day, they'll fall and not come back. They'll fall 50% and not come back.\n\nFor now, Intel and Apple don't share those risks. For instance, in Apple one has the near certainty that it's about to launch their smart TV. The chatter is building up strongly, and it can't be long before it's announced. That, along with China, will provide it with enough ammunition to come back from even a substantial rout in the market.\n\nConclusion\n\nDays like today are days where you should remove some of the short exposure and build some long exposure in quality stocks. If you don't have a \"buy list\" set up already, you should use some time to build one, so that when faced with days like these, you do some buying"}
{"text": "\".\"\n\n\"It is also a tactical admission (though a silent one) about their limitations in providing context and creating a new advertising model.\"\n\nIn other words, when there appears to be \"excess\" demand for stock on the IPO, the lead underwriter has the ability to sell 15% more shares than it has already agreed to sell. In selling these shares, the bank takes a short position in the stock, by selling shares it doesn't yet own. If the bank were doing this as a \"naked short\"--selling shares it didn't have a right to buy later at a specific price--the bank would be taking huge risk: The stock might go up, forcing the bank to buy back stock to cover its short at a much higher price. But the \"overallotment option\" allows the bank to buy another 15% of shares from the company at the IPO price, thus allowing it to sell additional stock on the IPO without taking the risk that the stock might go up.\nImportantly, the bank gets paid its full IPO commission on the extra shares it sells if exercises its option, so it has an incentive to sell them regardless of how much excess demand there is. And there's no risk to the bank if the stock price jumps, because the bank can cover its short buy buying the stock back at the IPO price.\n\nAnd if the stock drops after the IPO?\n\nWell, then the bank really cashes in.\n\nBecause then the bank makes money from:\n\n- IPO commissions\n- And proceeds from shorting the stock at the IPO price and then buying it back at a lower price.\n\nAnd that's just what happened with Facebook.\n\nWith Facebook, we all remember, the underwriters \"supported\" the stock for the first day, helping it close just above the IPO price. Then the underwriters gave up on supporting it. And the stock has traded pretty much straight down from there.\nAnd at some point, shortly after the IPO, the underwriters covered the short position they established by \"over-allotting\" Facebook stock on the IPO...and they covered at a lower price."}
{"text": "This question is the subject of many debates but it really shouldn't be so disputed. The answer is yes, charts absolutely work and do exactly what they're supposed to do, but the reason so many people argue this fact is because their idea of what they're supposed to do is skewed. Charts don't tell you the future, when to buy, when to sell, etc. What they do is reflect everything that has happened and everything that is known about the security (stock, stock option, future, bond, fund, or any other financial asset) being charted, and it is the job of the trader to take any clues they may see in that chart to make educated guesses, then translate those guesses into trades. If one hundred traders all looked at the same chart and all of them decided to go long (buy) and none of them decided to go short (sell), you may assume that the chart is predicting a move up. Then, if the stock happens to crash, would you say that the chart was wrong? Nope. The traders were wrong, the chart did exactly what it was supposed to do, reflect the action. As soon as your expectations of what charts are supposed to do become realistic, then you can start to take advantage of them. I can't tell you how many times I've heard people say things like \"Charts are meaningless on this stock because it's a news play\" or some other excuse. Then you have chartists who add more confusion to the situation by saying things like \"This stock is moving because of the chart\". Again, a chart is never meaningless because it will always reflect exactly what is happening, and stocks don't move because of charts, but they may give you clues as to when they're going to move.\n\nBeing a successful trader is all about playing the odds, and though a chart will never give you a definitive, guaranteed to work buy or sell signal, when used properly they can help you identify trades where the odds are in your favor. That's all it comes down to, if you can identify the setups where the odds are better than 50% in your favor, over time you will be profitable if you only take those trades. That's also assuming that you practice proper money and risk management, but that's beyond the scope of this article. Here's an example of how I may use a chart to identify a possible trade with limited risk and where the odds are better than 50% in my favor: Say the stock GOOG (Google) has been hit with some heavy selling and the price has been severely beaten down for a few days. Based on the chart, I identify an area of potentially strong support at 350, and the price is starting to fall to that range. In this article I won't get into what to look for to identify support and resistance, but what they represent is areas where in the past have been met with heavy buying or selling, and therefore it's reasonable to assume it may happen again. Eventually the price makes it's way down to the 350 range and now I start to see an increase in volume, as well as the price start to level off, even going up a little. How do I know this? Well the volume is easy to see on the chart and so is the rising price. So here's what I know: GOOG had been declining in value at a rapid pace, there is potential support around 350, the volume has picked up since the price got to the the 350 range, and the price has even slightly rebounded from it's lowest point. Those are all facts and they are all reflected in the chart, now it's my job to take those facts and decide whether or not I see a potential trade, and what that trade should be. Based on all that is reflected in the chart, I decide that the stock is currently oversold, at least temporarily, and that the market is starting to find buyers in this 350 range, so there's a good chance that the sellers are exhausted and therefore GOOG could see a nice bounce soon. Should this bounce materialize, it's not the chart that was right, it was my prediction based on what I saw in the chart. So I end up buying GOOG at 352, but then a new wave of sellers come in and quickly drop the price to 340. My prediction was wrong, the sellers weren't exhausted and the buyers that came in at the 350 support were only enough to slow the free fall temporarily. Again, the chart wasn't wrong, just my prediction. The good news is that charts can also help you limit your risk on a trade too. Since I identified the support range at 350, I knew to bail when I saw the sellers bring the price below it, and I was stopped out at 345, for roughly a 2% loss.\n\nI think so many people are skeptical of charts and the possible benefits they offer because they have unrealistic expectations from them, they aren't willing to put in the time it takes to learn to read them and then properly use them, and they've heard from so many other people that they're useless. I forget where I read this, but I remember an article that supposedly debunked the use of chart technical analysis and it's effectiveness, and it did so by implementing and testing some sort of simplistic method based on moving average crossovers. If you're not familiar with what that is, it's basically one of the most simple buy or sell signals that I know of. Though it can be useful in the right context, without other indicators or confirming criteria, it's a method that is destined for failure. People are often looking for the holy grail when it comes to charts and buy/sell signals. Just like the person who supposedly debunked the effectiveness of charts, they want some sort of simple to follow signal that makes them money every time or nearly every time. If it were that simple, everyone would know about it and everyone would be rich.\n\nSo do charts work? If by 'work' you mean provide you with easy to read buy and sell signals that will instantly make you a great trader, then no they don't work. If by 'work' you mean reflect everything that is known by the market about that security, then yes, they work every single time. Are there people out there that use the clues from charts to develop sound trading strategies and an in depth perspective into how a security trades? Absolutely, and that's a fact.\n\nIn my last article I stated that charts completely reflect everything that is known about a particular security, but what exactly can you learn from them and how can you use it to your advantage? Charts may not be able to predict the future like Ms. Cleo, but certain information they reveal can definitely help you make better educated guesses as to what is going to happen. I think possibly the most important bit of information a chart can very easily tell you is whether the trend is up, down, or flat. There are always multiple trends at work, depending on what time frame you look at. A stock may be in a short term uptrend, meaning it's been going up recently, but if you pull back to a longer term time frame, it may be in a downtrend. If I was looking to invest in a company, I would want that stock to be in a long term uptrend, but the short term trend isn't nearly as important, in fact I may want to be a buyer when the short term trend is down. If I'm looking to make a quick trade, say maybe a couple of days, the longer term trend isn't too much of a concern, just the short term trend (since I'm trying to profit from a short term move) and possibly the mid term trend. Being able to identify what direction the trends are will almost instantly make you a better trader and can even help out your long term investments. Once you become more comfortable with identifying the different trends, you can start to base your trades off of multiple time frames. The longer term time frames hold more weight than the shorter term trends, but doesn't it make sense to combine them so multiple time frames are working with your trade? You can break the different time frames down into three basic categories, short term, mid term, and long term. There is no one way to do this, but here is an example of one stock viewed through three different time frames.\n\nThe first is the short term time frame, and for this one I'll use a daily, three month chart. Every candle here represents one day and the entire chart goes back three months.\n\nHere is the same chart, only now the time frame is a bit longer term, so it goes back a full year. Each candle still only represents one day.\n\nFinally, here is the same chart, but viewed through a longer term time frame. This one not only goes back three years, but each candle now represents a week's worth of trading.\n\nIt's important to understand that time frames are completely relative. For a daytrader who's trades last minutes on average, a long term time frame may be a sixty minute chart (each candle represents an hour) that goes back five days and a short term chart may be a one minute chart that goes back five hours. The examples I gave you above would probably be for a swing trader that held anywhere from overnight to a few months, depending on which of the three time frames they're using. For a long term investor, a short term chart may be the swing trader's long term chart. It's critical that the time frames you trade off of suite your style and time frame for trading. If you're trying to daytrade off of a swing trader's time frame, even the short term, you're going to have major problems.\n\nOther than the different trends at work, charts can tell you other important things. The price action on a chart can give you a lot of insight as to what the market considers a fair value. If you heard that a stock finished the day up 5%, you'd probably assume that it had a good day and overall it was bullish. What if at one point in the day the stock was up 35%, but it only could manage to hold a 5% gain on the day? To me, that shows that the market felt that the price was overvalued when it was up 35%, and the fact that it closed so much lower tells me that the higher prices were essentially rejected. Price tug of wars like this are very obvious when you look at them through a candlestick chart, which I'll be going over more in depth in the future.\n\nIn addition to the different trends at work and the price action, the last thing I want to mention is support and resistance. Support is basically a price range on a chart where historically there have been enough buyers to keep the price above a certain point, and resistance is the opposite, a price range where sellers have prevented the price from moving above a certain point. Once support has been successfully broken, that old support is now new resistance. The same goes for when resistance is broken, it then becomes support. Don't look at support and resistance as specific prices, but as general ranges. If I said there is support at 375 for GOOG, that doesn't mean the second it hits 374.99 that support has been broken. The price could dip well below the support range, but if it quickly recovers and establishes it's self back above it, that is a successful hold for support. Support and resistance, just like most aspects of chart analysis are not exact sciences. I actually would consider chart reading in general more of an art form than a science, though it has it's scientific elements too.\n\nThe point of this article wasn't to go into detail about how to identify support and resistance, the current trends, or how to analyze price action. I just wanted to point out the key things I look for in a chart, and probably the most revealing. If you know what the trends are, how to spot price rejection and acceptance, and where the major support and resistance lies at, you're in a position to make an informed and educated guess about how to execute your trade. This is true from the daytrading scalpers up to the long term buy and holders. Will this guarantee that every trade is a profitable one? Absolutely not, but it not only swings the odds into your favor but it will limit your risk on each trade. This is the difference between someone who is able to consistently make profits and someone who is trading on whims, which to me is essentially gambling, and a professional trader is not a gambler.\n\nThere are a number of different chart types, and the difference between them is how they display the data. All charts plot the data by individual periods, and each period can represent as much or as little time as you want. One chart may have each period set to five minute intervals and another may be set to weekly intervals. The three most popular types of charts that are used are probably the line chart, bar chart, and the candlestick chart. On a line chart, the only thing that is plotted is the closing price of each period. Regardless of what the period is, whatever the last price of that period happens to be, that's what you'll see. Basically you're drawing a dot for each period's closing price, then connecting them to form a line. Here's an example of what one looks like.\n\nA line chart is better than no chart, but the information it reveals is extremely limited. You have no idea what the security opened at, or what the high and low were for that period. A bar chart, other wise known as an OHLC chart (Open, High, Low, Close), gives you that information. On a bar chart, each period is represented by a vertical line with a horizontal line sticking out from each side. The line sticking out on the left side is where the price opened at for that period, the top of the vertical line is the high of that period, the bottom of the vertical line is the low, and the line sticking out of the right side is the closing price for that period. Here's an example of a bar chart.\n\nClearly, the bar chart is much more revealing and helpful to traders, but the problem with them is you really have to zoom in to see each period's action. If you look at a daily chart with a year's worth of bars, you're basically just going to see a bunch of vertical lines, and if you squint hard enough you may be able to notice that there are lines sticking out of the side. It's still not easily recognizable whether each period finished even, positive, or negative. This is where candlestick charts really shine. Technically, they reveal the exact same information as a bar chart (open, high, low, and closing prices), but they do this in a way that is much easier to quickly identify. All candles will fall into one of these three categories; candles that open and close at the same price, candles that close higher than they opened at, and candles that close lower than they opened at. Here is a chart that breaks down a couple of candles, one that represents a negative day (left, red candle) and one that represents a positive day (right, white candle).\n\nThis chart was zoomed in to show only three candles for simplicity, but even on a chart with hundreds of candles, it's still pretty obvious what each one is saying. First off, they're color coded. Without the different colors, you wouldn't be able to tell where it opened or closed at. Most charts will have a red candle to represent down days and either a white or green candle for up days. Some charting platforms will have a different color (usually black) for candles that closed lower than they opened, but still higher than the previous candle, or closed higher than they opened, but still lower than the previous candle. Each candle is made up of two basic parts, the body and the wicks. The body encompasses the opening and closing points and everything in between. If the open and close are identical or close to it, you'll have basically a horizontal line for a body. The wicks represent the trading that took place outside of the range of the open to close. If you see a candle with a very long upper wick, you know that at one point the price was much higher than it finished. If you have a real time charting platform, you can watch as each candle will change depending on the price action.\n\nThanks to the color coding and the contrast between the wicks and the body, it's easy to get a good idea of what took place during that period, even with just a glance. A long white candle means the price went up from the start to finish, a long red candle means the price went down from the start to finish, and any long wicks will inform you that there was a struggle between the buyers and sellers. This isn't to say that each candle will tell you exactly what happened during each period. If you had a long white candle that formed on a daily chart, you may assume that the price had risen all day, when in reality it may have been flat all day up until the last five minutes when it went crazy. So it may not tell you exactly how it played out, but it gives you a very good idea, and to see more detail you can always break the candles down to a shorter time frame. On a daily chart, each candle represents one day. Like I said, you don't know exactly how that candle got to where it's at, but if you break your chart down from a daily chart to an intraday chart (like an hourly chart), then you can see the price action from that day more in depth. So in my example where the stock was flat all day but ended up running in the final minutes, an intraday chart would be able to tell you that.\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg for using candlesticks. Besides telling you the basic info about a trading period, there are much more advanced methods to using them. Candlestick patterns are at minimum an incredible compliment to most trading strategies, and for some traders they are the backbone of their methodologies. I'll identify and break down some of the more popular and commonly seen patterns in a future article, but for now you need to be able to fully absorb the basic information that each candle is telling you. If you don't already use candlestick charts, I highly recommend you start now. If you feel like you're trading in the dark, candlesticks will certainly help add some light for your path.\n\nIf someone says to you that the market is in an uptrend, do you know what they mean by that? Obviously they mean the market is going up, but specifically what are they referring to? It's been going up for a day? A week? A year? Uptrend and downtrend are two terms that are thrown around a lot, but often people don't really have a clear cut definition of what that exactly means. Many people define an uptrend by saying it's where the chart makes higher lows and higher highs. The problem with this is which lows and highs do you look at? Maybe for the past week it's made higher lows and higher highs, but if you go back and look at the last three months the highs have gotten lower. Then go back and look at the last year and it may be different as well.\n\nLook at this chart and tell me if the trend is up, down, or flat.\n\nYou could have said any one of the three and been correct because there are many trends at work here. In the last month or so the highs and lows have gotten lower, so one person might say it's in a downtrend. Another might say it's clearly in an uptrend since the highs and lows have gotten higher since the December low, and they'd be correct as well. Then the longer term trader comes in and points out that ever since the August 08 high, we've failed to even come close to making a higher high, so it's undoubtedly in a downtrend. Since the first and third person both would agree that it's in a downtrend, you'd think they were on the same page, but they're talking about two very different time frames. Finally, you may have someone that says the stock is uptrending because all they are thinking about is the last couple of weeks where price has gone from 400 to 425, not even looking at the highs or lows. Confusing, isn't it? So you've heard the cliche before that the trend is your friend and that you should trade with it, not against it, but how do we do that if we're not even sure how to figure out what the trend is? Unfortunately, there is no official explanation to determine what the trends are, and that's why there's so much ambiguity when people speak of them. The method of looking at the lows and highs is better than nothing, but as I pointed out it can be very subjective.\n\nBefore I show you the method that I use to determine the trends on a chart, I want to give complete credit to the trader who I learned it from. Dr. Barry Burns is a market veteran who has a great set of instructional videos, I'd highly recommend that you at least check out his blog. I have a lot of respect for him as a trader, not only because he has some good methods, but because he preaches about aspects that a lot of teachers seem to ignore, like the psychology of trading, money management, risk management, etc. As far as his trend identifying method, it's extremely simple, but I've found that a lot of traders like to make things more complicated than they need to. What's good for me isn't necessarily going to be good for you, but in my experience taking a simple approach has often been the most effective.\n\nTo start, the one indicator that you'll need for this trend identifying method is the moving average. The moving average is a line that represents the average price of a security for any set amount of time at any specific point. If I said the 50 day moving average for GOOG is currently at 412, that means over the past 50 days the average price has been 412. Since the price is always changing, the moving averages will always move as well, and if the price has been increasing, the moving averages will move up as well. The shorter the moving average time period is, the quicker it will react. A 5 period moving average will quickly react to any price movement, whereas the 200 MA will hardly blink at short term moves. Here is the GOOG chart again, only this time I added the 50 period moving average.\n\nThe basis for this method is simple, use a short term moving average to determine the short term trend, mid term moving average for the mid term trend, and long term moving average for the long term trend. This isn't a science, so there is no right or wrong one to use, but I use what Dr. Burns suggests because they make sense to me. He recommends using the 15 EMA (exponential moving average, puts more weight on the most recent periods so it's quicker to react) for the short term, 50 MA for the mid term, and the 200 MA for the long term trend indicator. I tend to focus on the mid term trend indicator, the 50 MA. I really like using this one because it's not too short or too long of a time period, it's right in between and really it's relevant to both the short and long term trends. The thing to look for is the angle of the line, if the angle is up the trend is up, a flat line is a flat trend, and a descending line is a down trend. It's also good to note where the price is in relation to the line. If the 50 MA is angling down but the price is trading above it, that may be an indication that the mid term trend is trying to turn around. Right at the beginning of 09, the price started to trade above the 50 MA, even though the 50 MA was angling down very sharply. It didn't happen right away, but that was the start of the trend reversing. The longer the trend, the longer it takes to reverse. The run that GOOG went on from the end of January to the beginning of March was impressive, and by the middle of it the 50 MA had started to angle up. From mid February to mid March GOOG corrected and went straight down, and obviously the short term moving average would have been angling down with it (confirming the short term down trend), but the 50 MA was still up. For those who recognized that the mid term trend was up, they may have been buying into that dip, and they would have been able to ride the wave up in what turned out to be a very impressive rally. Now let's look at GOOG with all three moving averages applied to it.\n\nIt should be clear as day that the long term trend (200 MA, red line) has been down for pretty much the entire chart, though now it's started to level off since the price has been trading above it. See how long it takes for that line to react to the price movement? The short term trend has done what we'd expect it to do, pretty much follow the general price movement pretty closely. GOOG wouldn't have gone from 300 to 440 in such a short period of time without the short term trend being up the majority of the way. Ever since the peak in June though, you can see the 15 EMA (green line) has either been flat or down, so that would indicate that the short term trend has at least stalled, if not started to reverse. The mid term trend (blue line) is still up at the moment, though the weakness in the short term trend may be a precursor to the mid term trend turning around. I don't want to do any speculating, just make observations as to what the current trends are.\n\nLike I said, this isn't the official way to determine what the trends are because there isn't one. This is just a simple to use method to quickly sum up a chart and give you a better perspective on the current market conditions. If I'm looking to play a chart setup, I better know if the trend is working with me or against me. If I'm looking to buy into the market's pullback, which many people like to do, I'd really like to know if I'm buying into an uptrend or downtrend, and what time frame those trends are on. Trend identifying alone isn't enough to turn you into a profitable trader, but it's about as solid of a foundation as I can think of to start from.\n\nBefore I tell you how I identify support and resistance, I'll briefly explain what they are. Support is generally thought of as a price range or level where the security (stock, future, etc.) has historically had difficulty falling below, and resistance is the same principle except it's a price range where the security has had trouble getting above. If a security's price is going down and reaches a certain point that brings in enough buyers to make the price bounce, that general range would be an area of support. As long as the price stayed above that point, you can consider that area support, but once a support range is broken, it becomes resistance (and vice versa). It's important to remember a couple of things about support and resistance. One, they're not specific price points, but general ranges. If someone says that support is at $100 and the price hits $99.99, that doesn't mean that support has been broken. Even if the price temporarily breaks well below it but quickly recovers to get back above it, that would still be considered a successful test of support. The second thing to remember is that no matter how strong you think support or resistance may be, they can always be broken. If someone says that support is at $100 and it falls through that range, that doesn't necessarily mean that they were wrong about it being support, it just means that the selling was strong enough to wipe out the buyers at that support range.\n\nThe main types of support and resistance are horizontal price levels and diagonal trendlines, but there are others too, such as moving averages and fibonacci retracement and extension levels. This article is going to focus on how to spot trendlines and horizontal lines. At first, these may be difficult to spot, but after you've looked at so many charts they start to jump out at you. In essence, every high and low on a chart is a horizontal support or resistance level, but if you drew a horizontal line for every one of those your chart would be a mess and it would only hurt your trading. The key is to find the price levels that correspond with multiple pivot highs or lows, the more the better. Here's a 6 month chart of GOOG with one obvious area of support that I see. The red arrows point to where the level acted as resistance and the green arrows point to where it acted as support.\n\nIdentifying support and resistance is not an exact science, it's more of a rough estimation. A helpful tip I've heard is to pretend you're drawing your support and resistance lines with a big crayon, that way you're not pinpointing one specific price line but more of a zone. Notice on that horizontal line I drew that the price doesn't always hit precisely on the line, but it comes close enough. I could've even drawn the line a little higher or made it wider to include a larger range. I'd actually say that the whole 390 \u2013 400 area is the support or resistance zone (depending on if the price is above or below it). One question that comes up a lot is whether the lines should be drawn at the tops/bottoms of the wicks or the actual candle bodies. Again, this isn't a science so the answer could be either one, but the candle bodies hold more weight than the wicks so I like to focus on those. I actually like it when wicks are formed under a support line or over a resistance line because that shows that the market is rejecting the attempt to break through and further confirms the support or resistance. Spotting horizontal support/resistance lines will become second nature to you after you start to look for them in every chart.\n\nDiagonal trendlines are similar to horizontal support/resistance lines in that they connect pivot highs and lows, but they are either ascending or descending to show the direction as well as the speed of the price movement. They generally connect a series of higher lows (uptrend) or lower highs (downtrend). Some may be very obvious on the chart and some may not be as noticeable. I've found that trendlines tend to be more subjective (depending on the trader drawing them) than horizontal support/resistance lines. Here is an example of a trendline on GOOG's chart.\n\nBack from March through May, GOOG was riding this steep trendline for the entire rally. Any time prior to May that the price came back down to that trendline would have been a good time to pick up some shares. A trendline that steep isn't going to be able to sustain itself for too long, and in May it finally ended up breaking below it. That wasn't the end of the party though as the price still pushed it's way considerably higher after that. The trendline still existed though, but at this point it was acting as resistance since the price was below it. In early June the price ran right into that trendline and that marked the top of that particular move.\n\nThere are going to be many trendlines and horizontal support/resistance lines on a chart, your job is to identify the ones that look the most obvious or stand out the most. The more times the line has been tested, the more it confirms it as a critical area of support or resistance. You could also say the more it's been tested the stronger it is, but when you start to see a line get tested multiple times in a short period of time, that's very often a clue it's going to be broken soon. The best way to become proficient at identifying support and resistance lines is to look for them on every chart, draw them where you think you see them, then follow the action to see if the lines you drew get a reaction from the price. If you've correctly identified strong support or resistance, most of the time the price will have some sort of reaction to it, either by completely bouncing or at minimum stalling and consolidating (trading in a tight range). Consolidation right near support or resistance is also often a sign that the price is getting ready to break through, but it needs to rest first. Just like being able to identify trends, spotting support/resistance alone won't make you a successful trader, but it is one of the most important pieces to the puzzle. Once you can properly identify the trends and support/resistance, you then have a solid foundation to build your methods off of. When you start to apply these things to aspects of your everyday life, like \"My love life is in a downtrend\" or \"My bank account just broke it's support\", you'll know you're on the right path.\n\nMy last article went over how to spot support and resistance, but how exactly do you work that into your trades? This article will go over the basic methods of incorporating support and resistance into your trading. The first and most obvious method is to buy at support or short at resistance. For those that aren't familiar with shorting or short selling, it's where you sell shares/contracts that you don't own (your broker lends them to you), then buy them back later (also known as covering), ideally at a lower price than you sold them for. With shorting you are profiting when the security goes down in price.\n\nHere's a chart of GOOG, and I've identified the most obvious support and resistance lines I see.\n\nSo the plan here is simple, if the price comes into the resistance zone, you go short. If the price comes down to support, you go long (buy). What's nice about trading support and resistance is that it generally offers a good reward to risk ratio. If you short at resistance and the price breaks right through it to the upside, you exit the trade for a small or moderate loss. If it bounces off of resistance and comes back down, you should have a nice profit on the trade. The tricky part can be figuring out where exactly your stop loss should be at in relation to support or resistance. You have to give the trade a buffer to move around, you can't set your stops one tick above resistance or one tick below support. The price can penetrate through support/resistance, hit your stop price, then turn right back around and go in the direction you thought it would, leaving you behind to watch. So your stops should be far enough away to account for normal market fluctuations and volatility, but not so far that you're going to eat too large of a loss should it get hit. One other thing you can do is wait to enter the trade until the price has actually pierced support or resistance a little, in anticipation that it's going to bounce back still. Using the above chart as an example, the resistance looks to be a little above 440, we'll say 442. A lot of traders may look to go short at 442 on the nose, then maybe they'll set their stops at 444. Let's say that the market is extra volatile and it busts through the 442 resistance and ends up hitting 445, triggering your stop at 444, but then it comes back down and ends up crashing. Had you waited until the resistance was pierced a little and entered the trade at 444, you wouldn't have been stopped out. Another advantage to this method is that you can keep a tighter stop because you're entering on the far edge of support or resistance. There is a drawback to this though, and that is you'll end up missing out on some trades since they don't all hit the far end of support or resistance. For very conservative traders who don't mind missing out on some trades, it's a good fit.\n\nBuying support and selling resistance is the most obvious way to play them, but it's not the only way. Playing breakouts is a great trading method, and the basic concept of this strategy is waiting until resistance has been broken then going long (buy), or wait until support has been broken and going short. In the previous paragraph I mentioned that a conservative way to buy support or short resistance was to wait for the price to start to pierce through the respective zone, but that's exactly the opposite of what the principle is behind trading a breakout. In a breakout, you want to be a buyer when resistance is broken and a seller when support is broken, so how do you tell when you should be buying support/ shorting resistance or playing them as breakouts? There is no perfect answer to this, a huge part of trading is just making educated guesses and going with it, and if your guess was wrong get out of the trade. Here are some things to look at and consider when making your decisions.\n\nThe first thing I'd look at is the recent price action. How has the price arrived at this support or resistance area? Has it slowly and methodically made it's way into position or did it arrive there by making a sharp, violent move? If a stock is testing resistance right after it's already made a huge run, I would not initially be looking to play it as a breakout because I know that there are a lot of people who are looking to sell after making good profits in such a short amount of time. Another thing to look for is consolidation, which is basically where the price starts to trade in a narrow range for a while. If a stock has moved up to an area of resistance (or moved down to support) and starts to consolidate, that can often be a precursor to a breakout. Think of it as the price is resting and forming a base to take off from. Once the price starts to breakout and trade on the other side of support or resistance, normally you'd like for the volume to start to increase to show that others are seeing and trading the same thing you are. Without volume to confirm the breakout, you may be buying into a bull trap or shorting into a bear trap.\n\nThere is an alternate way to play a break of support or resistance, and this method is not only more conservative but in my experience it has a greater chance of success. The key is to wait for the price to clearly break through the support or resistance, then wait and watch for it to come back and test that area again. Old resistance will be new support and old support will be new resistance. The longer a trendline or horizontal line has been acting as support or resistance, the more likely it is to be tested. When you buy or short the test, it offers you an incredible reward to risk ratio. The drawback here is that the breakout points don't always get tested, so you will miss out on some trades by going this route. Here's an example of a breakout and then a test of support.\n\nLooking at the chart above, you can see that in February the price made a pivot high then came down. That previous peak is going to act as resistance, and when the price bounced straight back up to the range of that peak's price level, the resistance was also further reinforced by the fact that the 200 day moving average was right there as well. I mentioned in a previous article that moving averages can also act as support and resistance. Considering the price went almost straight up from 290 to that resistance zone around 380, my initial thought would be to go short when the price tested it. Had I done that, I would have been stopped out as soon as I saw the price start to blast through resistance, and not only that but the volume had an incredible surge which should tip you off as well. So I get stopped out for a small loss, but now I'm looking to go long if I see an opportunity. As luck would have it, the price does end up coming back down and tests the old resistance for new support. Remember, not only is that horizontal line support, but you also have the 200 MA acting as support as well. This is the perfect time to take a chance and go long, buying anywhere in that general support zone and your stop loss would be somewhere below it.\n\nThe methods I've gone over have all been in terms of entries, but you can easily use them as exit strategies as well. If you are in a long position and looking to sell, you would just use the short selling strategies since shorting is really just selling. If you're in a short position and looking to close it (cover/buy), you would just use the long (buying) strategies since covering a short is essentially just buying. Since I've now gone over the concept behind identifying trends and support/resistance, you can now combine the two for hopefully better odds of success. If the the mid term trend is down on the time frame you're trading and the short term trend is up, it may be a good idea to look for strong resistance to short into. Likewise, if the mid term trend is up but the short term trend is down, you might want to identify some solid support to but into. If I'm looking to play a breakout to the upside, I almost always want the mid term trend to be up. At this point you have more than a solid foundation to work with, you actually have enough to put together a legitimate method. There are still ways to add to and refine your strategy, but this should be the meat and potatoes of it, everything else will just be gravy. Just remember not to overdo it on the gravy, otherwise you'll ruin a perfectly good meal.\n\nThere are a ton of candlestick patterns out there, and some of them have very specific rules and real funny names. While it doesn't hurt to know all of them, I don't think it's necessary (at least not right away), to spend countless hours learning every last one as well as all of the very specific rules that apply to them. There are some basic principles to learn that I think are more important than any specific rule or pattern. Candles help you quickly identify where a security opened and closed at, as well as the high and low for that period. To oversimplify what these candles are essentially telling us is, if the it closes near it's high, that's bullish, near it's low is bearish, and in the middle is a sign of indecisiveness. Without learning one specific candle pattern, I think one of the most revealing things to look for is long wicks. When a candle forms a long upper wick, that means that the price finished well off of it's high point. If the bulls were in command, they would have been able to finish the period closer to the high point, but the fact that it didn't shows that the bears started to gain control late in the period. The opposite is true for candle's with long lower wicks. That shows you that the bears were able to knock the price down initially, but then the bulls came in and started to buy up the lower prices and they successfully closed the period well off of it's low point. Here is a weekly chart with the majority of the long wicks identified.\n\nFirst off, each long wick doesn't have to imply that a major reversal is coming. It may be the precursor for a major reversal, a small reversal, a stall in direction, or it could mean none of the above. On this chart, almost every single long wick came before either some sort of reversal or stall in price. The only real obvious time it failed was in September of 08 when the price formed back to back long lower wicks around 420. The price ended up breaking below that point, but a failed setup can often be a buy or sell signal in itself because as you can see the drop after the price failed to react to the long lower wicks was very sharp. Another thing to keep in mind that many traders overlook is the context of where the candles are being formed. If the price is chopping around in tight channel, a long wicks are just probably indicating a struggle between the bears and bulls and it's hard to take much meaning from it other than that. On the other hand, if the price has made an extended move in one direction and is clearly becoming overbought or oversold, long wicks can have very strong implications that the move is coming to an end. Try and remember that the candle itself means a lot less when the context around it doesn't make it clear what's going on. Also, a long wick doesn't have to mean the end of a move, but at minimum it means the opposing team is starting to put up a fight.\n\nNow I'm going to break down some of the specific patterns to look for. They won't be in any particular order as I don't necessarily have one favorite or any that work that much better than the rest. Like I said, it comes down to the context. The more the context is telling me to look for a reversal, the more I like that particular reversal pattern that is forming, no matter what pattern it happens to be.\n\nThe first pattern I am going to go over is the hammer or hanging man. They look identical, but the key is a hammer is formed after a downtrend and a hanging man is formed after an uptrend. These are formed when the price moves significantly lower than the opening price, but by the end of the period is has gotten back up to the range of the opening price, forming a long lower wick. Technically speaking, a hammer/ hanging man shouldn't have an upper wick to it, but that's being too picky in my opinion. If there is a slight upper wick, it may not be classified as a hammer, but it's still just about as valid. This is where the rules for some of these candle patterns become unnecessarily complicated. The important thing to note is the rejection of the lows for a hammer, and for the hanging man the rejection of the lows isn't the key, the fact that it traded below it's opening price all day is. Here is an example of a hanging man that was formed after an incredibly sharp uptrend.\n\nNext up on the list is the doji. Dojis can have many different appearances, such as long upper or lower wicks, short upper or lower wicks, and any combination of these. The main attributes that make them dojis are: The open and close have to be the same or very close (close enough that the body looks like a horizontal line) and there needs to be some sort of lower or upper wick, or both. Most dojis have both the upper and lower wicks, but a doji that closes at the low of the period (which would mean it also opened there) is a gravestone doji and a dragonfly doji is where it closes at the high of the period. The main thing to take from a doji is the indecision it's conveying. Again, if this is formed in a channel or anywhere without a major move to reverse/ correct, than it's not nearly as helpful as one that forms after an extended move that is overbought or oversold. Here is an example of one that is formed after a nice downtrend.\n\nRegarding the above chart, there are some other things to note. First off, you can see that the price doesn't immediately respond to the reversal candle. The next candle was a down day that even tested the lows of the doji again. You can't expect the price to immediately react all of the time. In this case, the market was still testing out what it wanted to do, and the candle following the doji ended up forming a long lower wick as well. Back to back long wicks are a pattern in themselves, known as tweezers (either tops of bottoms). Basically, the second one is just confirming the first, making it more of a reliable signal. You may even end up getting more than two long wicks, that just shows a major battle but the wicks continue to imply that the price continues to be rejected when it enters that range.\n\nAnother reversal pattern to be aware of is bullish and bearish engulfings. Whether or not it's formed after an uptrend or downtrend determines whether it's bullish or bearish. The characteristics to look for is one large candle that completely engulfs at least the previous day's candle, if not more. The chart I posted above that has the hanging man is actually an example of a bearish engulfing as well (look at the candle after the hanging man), though a truly ideal engulfing pattern completely engulfs the entire previous candle, not just the body of it like in that example. Here is an example of a bullish engulfing that formed after a downtrend. The price may not have instantly reversed after it was formed, but it did end up marking the bottom.\n\nThe last pattern I'm going to cover is a three candle setup that I've found to be reliable as well, but once again the key is that it needs to be formed after an extended move to be truly significant. This pattern is called either an evening star or morning star, depending on where it's formed at. An evening star is formed after an uptrend and is bearish, a morning star forms after a downtrend and is bullish. The characteristics of an evening star pattern is a long white candle that continues the uptrend, followed by a small candle that gaps up but finishes lower (than it opened), then the last candle gaps down and finishes down. Basically the middle candle needs to be isolated from the surrounding two. A morning star is the exact opposite, a long red candle followed by a small candle that forms after a gap down, followed by a candle that gaps up and closes up. Just like the middle candle on an evening star should close down a little, the middle candle on a morning star pattern should close up a little. If the middle candle is a doji, then the pattern is still essentially the same but it's now called an abandoned baby pattern. Depending on whether you consider this middle candle a doji or not, here is an example of either an abandoned baby or an evening star reversal pattern. Whatever you want to call it, the key thing to note is the isolated, indecisive candle that forms in the middle.\n\nAll of the candle patterns I went over today are considered reversal patterns. There are setups that are known as continuation patterns, but I haven't found them to be nearly as useful as reversals. If I'm buying into support on a pullback or selling into resistance during a rally, I'm looking for reversal candles/ patterns. If I'm selling on a break below support or buying on a break above resistance, I'm not looking for reversal patterns (since I'm not looking for a reversal), but I don't really look for specific continuation patterns either. It's basically a matter of making sure there is consolidation in the range of the support or resistance, then waiting for one of the candles to close either below support or above resistance. Since buying can mean covering a short position and selling can mean short selling, that pretty much covers all of the possibilities, and none of those possibilities really require the use of continuation patterns. Others may disagree with me, but the good thing about how I've presented the material in my articles is that by implementing what I've gone over, you won't be painting yourself into a corner so to speak. I believe that the things I've covered are pretty much universal, and they leave open the possibility to add whatever touch of TA you'd like use in addition. If you want to add continuation patterns, that's no problem. If you want to add RSI, MACD, Stochastics, or any other indicator for additional and confirmational buy or sell signals, awesome. Everything I've gone over so far is just the framework for my method of chart analysis. Though it may be just the foundation, it probably is more than three quarters of what I actually use in my trading.\n\nCandles alone are limited in what they can do, but when you use them to time your trades based on the trend and support and resistance, you have a very powerful, yet still simple, method for trading.\n\nNow it's time to combine the basic concepts I've already gone over in my previous articles and give you an example of how to use them together. You should have a good idea of how to determine the trend on a chart, spot support and resistance, and identify candle patterns that are hinting at a possible reversal. If you're still uncertain about these concepts, go back and reread the articles. Let me start off by giving you the chart I'm looking to trade as well as the time frame. This is a weekly chart for GOOG, and I'm approaching it as a longer term swing trader. I plan on using the 50 week moving average to identify the mid term trend on this time frame, and if all goes well a trade on this time period should take at bare minimum a few weeks, but should end up taking much longer. The only exception would be if the trade went against me and I got stopped out prematurely. Here is the chart.\n\nRight off the bat, you should notice that the stock has had a serious fall in price since it's peak. Hopefully you also noticed that the last two candles are reversal candles, specifically spinning tops, but even without knowing that (since I didn't specifically go over spinning tops), the long wicks should have tipped you off. Two long lower wicks side by side are their own reversal pattern in themselves, called a tweezers bottom (which I did go over). I don't want to base my trade on the candles alone though, so I'm going to apply the 50 MA to this chart and get a feel for what the mid term trend is.\n\nLooking at the chart now with the 50 MA applied, you can see that for the first three quarters of it, the stock was in an uptrend and the price was trading above the 50. The 50 MA can act like a magnet, and if the price gets too far away from it, expect it to correct itself (or at least trade sideways to let the 50 MA catch up). You can see that when the price peaked, it was the furthest it had been from the 50 in a long time. Now the 50 MA is leveling off and the price is trading well below it. Based on this, I'd say that the mid term trend on this has now flattened and even looks to be starting a downtrend, but like I just mentioned, the price has strayed very far away from the 50 MA and it looks like it's going to revert to the mean sometime soon. While I would be expecting a bounce here in the near future, the fact that the mid term trend is flattening after a long uptrend indicates that this won't be a trade where I ride a trend for a while. I'm mainly looking at playing the correction from this sharp drop in price. So I know what the trend is, and though it's not totally in my favor, there is an opportunity for a shorter term trade. I already pointed out the two reversal candles that have formed a reversal pattern, the last thing to do is spot support and resistance. Normally, you'd probably identify support and resistance first, then wait for the reversal candles to form. It just depends where the price is at when you start following the stock. Now here's a chart with what I see as the major areas of support and resistance. Remember, you can draw a ton of lines on the chart, but you really want to limit it to the ones with the most touches and reactions from the price.\n\nFirst off, the ascending trendline which held up for over two years is very critical considering how long it was in play. In early 08, the price ended up breaking below it, then it tried to bounce off of the support line around 500. It was support back then, now that the price is below it, it's resistance. You can see where the price had a reaction to it, I circled it in red. It broke below it, then climbed back above to form a hammer, which is a reversal candle. There was a mild bounce, but when that area was broken below for the second time, that was a failed bounce attempt and the bulls knew to give up and the bears were then clearly in control. Fast forward a couple more months and now we have the two spinning tops/ tweezers bottom forming, and you can see that there is definitely support in that general area. The first attempt to bounce at 500 was a failure, so that makes the current conditions even move oversold and a sharp bounce even more likely. Like I said in the previous paragraph, since the mid term trend is flat to down, I don't plan on buying this here for a long term hold, but the conditions are perfect for a sharp, shorter term bounce. I am going to look at those previous areas of support turned resistance for possible profit targets. First up will be the horizontal line at 500. Considering the magnitude of the drop, I think that target is fairly conservative, and next up after that would be the 50 MA. Remember, the major moving averages (50 MA, 200 MA, etc.) can often act as support and resistance, and since the price is below the 50, that would make it resistance at the moment. Finally, that trendline which held the price up for so long is going to be major resistance. The stronger something acted previously as support, the stronger it will act as resistance. The opposite is obviously true as well for resistance turned support. Should the price make it's way back up to that trendline, the chances of it knocking down the price are incredibly high. Even if the price eventually gets back over it, the initial contact with it will almost certainly get a very large reaction. Let me fast forward a few months to show you how this played out.\n\nYou can see that the stock did end up rallying very hard after it tipped it's hand with those reversal candles. Remember, the stock didn't move because of the chart, the chart just reflected what was going on. You can see that the rally took the price right through the resistance lines and through the 50 MA, but once it hit it's head on that trendline, that was it. The price tried to consolidate and regroup for an attempt to break back above it, but when it broke below that consolidation range, the bears quickly stepped in and took over.\n\nThis was just one example of how to possibly use these three aspects (trends, support/resistance, and price action/candles) of chart technical analysis. Not every trade has to have all three working perfectly in your favor, in fact this example didn't even have the trend on our side. If you really wanted to have everything working for you, you'd wait for a fresh uptrend (50 MA angling up after it's flattened), wait for the price to break over the 50 MA and make it's initial move, wait for the first major pullback, identify support, then time your entry. An example of that would be the first test of the trendline I drew on the chart, right around March 06. You wouldn't have known that was the start of the trendline since it was the first test, but you would have known that the 50 MA had just started to angle up and the price was pulling back to test it for support. If you look closely, you can see that there was also a nice reversal candle right at that point, giving you a perfect entry. Imagine if you'd have bought in then and rode the wave all the way up. Remember, this all applies to shorting as well, but instead you'd want a fresh downtrend (50 MA to start to angle down after it had flattened), wait for the first major move below the 50, wait for the first correction after that, identify resistance, then time your entry. That is just an example of the typical, ideal setup where everything is working in your favor, but there are many possibilities.\n\nThis example I gave you today was on a weekly chart, which is much longer term than most traders I know use. This method applies to any chart time frame you want, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc. I could trade exclusively using just setups like the one I posted, but this may only be the beginning for you. The longer you watch charts in action and are actually aware of the trends at play, support and resistance, and candles that form and where, you'll start to develop a sense for how stocks move. There is only so much I can actually tell you, eventually it becomes up to you to absorb these things first hand. So get out there, be aware of the trends at work, where support and resistance are at, and what the candles are hinting at. Once you can start to spot these things without much effort, the puzzle will really start to come together and the rest of the pieces will just fall right into place.\n\nAnd to top it off..\n\nProper Position Sizing\n\nHow large or how small should your position be in any given trade? Before I get into the answer to that, there is one prerequisite that supersedes everything, the liquidity of what you're looking to trade. You need to keep your position size to as small of a percentage as the average daily money volume. You can estimate the average money volume by taking the price and multiplying it by the average amount of shares traded daily. If a stock that is trading at $1 averages in between 10,000 and 30,000 shares, the average money volume is probably in the ballpark of $20,000. How much of the average money volume do you want to be? The less the better, but there is no official threshold to stay under. I'd say staying under 2% is pretty safe, but if you know what you're doing you can push that somewhat. This really only applies to penny stocks and other thinly traded stocks, but I figured I should cover that base just to be sure. If you're trading highly liquid securities like blue chip stocks, commodity futures, forex, etc. then this won't be an issue.\n\nAs long as you have the liquidity issue covered, here is how I determine my position size. To start with, I need to know a few things to figure out what my position size should be. Those are; how much I'm willing to lose on this trade, where my entry is, and where my stop loss is at. For example, say I'm watching a stock that is an uptrend, but it's currently falling back to support at $10. Since the longer term trend is up, I'm looking to buy into the support at $10, but if that support fails to hold, I'm going to bail. The most I want to risk losing on the trade is $200. That doesn't mean my position size will be $200 worth of shares, that means that should my stop loss get triggered I only want to lose $200. So my entry is at $10, and my stop loss will be enough below that to allow for normal market fluctuations, we'll say at $9.50. So now I know all the factors to determine my position size. My maximum risk is going to be $200, the entry is at $10, and the stop loss is at $9.50. Based on that, my position size would be 400 shares. 400 shares multiplied by $10 is $4000, and 5% of that (which is what my stop loss is set at) is $200. An easy way to figure this out is by dividing your maximum risk amount by the percentage of the stop loss. In this case, it would be $200/ 5%, which would give the $4,000 figure. You then just need to factor how many shares you can buy with that amount.\n\nIf you always risked the same amount on every trade and kept an arbitrary percentage for your stop losses, your position size would always be the same (in dollars). My problem with this is that an arbitrary percentage doesn't make sense to me since all stocks and charts are different. The stock (or whatever you're trading) and the chart should dictate your stop loss. A 5% stop may work great on one stock, but on another much more volatile oneit may get triggered way too easily. If you feel that on a certain trade you need a 10% \u2013 20% stop loss because of either the volatility, where the closest, most relevant support/resistance is at, or both, then use that wider stop, but adjust your position size accordingly. That way, you're still allowing the proper amount of buffer room for price fluctuations, but you're still risking the same amount if your stop gets hit."}
{"text": "4 ETF Lessons From Knight\n\nRELATED QUOTES\n\nAfter Knight lost a tremendous amount of money , it looked like it had stepped away from the ETF markets, and we published a back-of-the-envelope spot-check on how that might have effected ETF spreads . In that piece, I looked at noon spreads for the two days prior to last Wednesday, when Knight's algorithms ran amok, and compared that with Wednesday's and Thursday's spreads. I commented at the time that my analysis was extremely quick-and-dirty, looking at just one spread point a day, and assuming it was representative.\n\nWe spent the weekend buffing that out, grinding through the actual moment-by-moment spreads on all of the NYSE ETFs for which there are lead market makers (about 1,000) over all of the last week. The results, unsurprisingly, broadly match up with our original findings. The spreads on less liquid ETFs (those trading fewer than 50,000 shares a day, on average) widened out in the wake of Knight's issues.\n\nWe've done a few additional things here that are worth pointing out. First, based on this analysis, spreads on Knight LMM ETFs that already had low liquidity broadened out from 50 to 144 basis points during the crisis. However, by Friday, those spreads pulled way back in to 89 bps. From our analysis, this was not because Knight all of a sudden started making good markets.\n\nEven this morning, a spot-check of the less liquid ETFs showed Knight still very far outside the current bids and offers. Instead, what we've seen is that other market participants\u2014both market makers and regular traders\u2014have noticed the spreads on these small-but-still-trading securities and have jumped at the chance to be the guy offering just slightly better prices than we saw before.\n\nIn the most liquid ETFs, the situation is generally unchanged. That's to be expected, since they were essentially unaffected by all this kerfuffle in the first place.\n\nSo with things getting back to normal, I thought I'd address a few \"lessons learned\" from this experience.\n\n1. Lead Market Makers matter. The LMM system at the NYSE has been accused of essentially having no teeth in the past. The LMM for an ETF makes a commitment to provide liquidity by being on the inside of the bid/ask spread\u2014effectively, paying attention to the security throughout the trading day. They're measured (theoretically) by the exchange to make sure that for some reasonable portion of the time, they actually \"are\" making the best market. For this, they get payments from the exchange for helping keep trading flowing\u2014a rebate per share.\n\nIt turns out, having an LMM paying attention matters. At least, it certainly mattered if Knight was your LMM and they stepped to the sidelines like they did last Wednesday. The market-making system is far from perfect, and I'm still on the fence about proposals to make flat, nonflow-based payments to firms that show up for LMM on the first day a fund trades. But there's no question that having someone paying attention to your small ETF matters.\n\nNYSE seems to get this. As of this morning, NYSE has removed Knight's LMM status on hundreds of stocks and ETFs, temporarily reassigning those tasks to Getco .\n\n2. Markets Work. I don't mean this in any kind of Pollyanna-capitalism, uber-alles sense. What I mean is that the astounding thing about Knight's enormous software boo-boo is how well the market did exactly what it's supposed to do. Thousands of market participants quietly took the other side of all of these misplaced Knight trades, right until Knight hit the \"off\" switch. Then all those stocks just settled right back down. The end result of course was hundreds of millions of dollars being transferred out of Knight and into the hands of other traders.\n\nThat's exactly how the market is supposed to handle people who make bad calls. It's supposed to take their money in a calm and orderly way. It makes me extremely sad for the folks at a firm like Knight that end up suffering for the mistakes of the few folks likely responsible, but it's also an example of exactly what's supposed to happen. They ain't perfect, but markets work.\n\n3. Settlement Works. I got a lot of panicked calls from reporters over the last week asking what would happen to all of the trades Knight had made if they should spontaneously combust. It was a fair question, because at some points last week, the rumor mill was suggesting we might indeed have a midday bankruptcy. The basic premise of all these questions was, \"Well, if you bought 1,000 shares of CRUD yesterday from Knight, what happens when Knight doesn't exist tomorrow and those shares haven't yet settled?\"\n\nThe answer, of course, is you still get your shares. Any trade that gets confirmed at the end of the day by the NSCC goes into what's called their continuous net settlement process (CNS). A cornerstone of CNS is that once the trade is in the system, Knight is no longer your counterparty\u2014the NSCC is. And the NSCC has enormous cash reserves (contributed by members like Knight) that it controls precisely to handle things like the default of other members. So if Knight had sold you 1,000 shares of CRUD, went bankrupt, and turned out not to have 1,000 shares of CRUD on inventory at the NSCC, then the NSCC would have taken some of Knight's cash\u2014or at worse, some of its own reserves\u2014and bought your CRUD for you to make sure your trade settled.\n\nWe know this works, because we've seen it happen before. Even before the NSCC changed the rules to become the counterparty for all trades on submission , it successfully dealt with both Lehman and Madoff without having a penny of settlement failure. (Under the current system, that confirm slip in your email box is effectively ironclad.)\n\n4. Illiquid ETFs Need Helpers . Not everyone was particularly happy I pointed out the wide spreads on less liquid ETFs last week. They'll probably be unhappy I'm reiterating those spreads with the minute-by-minute analysis today. But the point remains that ETFs that only trade a handful of shares a day are enormously challenging for small investors.\n\nBut there's a catch. Even the least liquid ETFs\u2014something like the iShares MSCI ACWI ex US Information Technology Sector Index Fund (AXIT) can actually still be traded reasonably well. That might seem ludicrous when you look at the numbers. The fund trades less than 100 shares on an average day, and is consistently quoted at spreads of 2-3 percent. Can you get a fair deal by posting a trade for 5,000 shares in your Schwab account? Probably not. However, if you wanted to trade, say 50,000 shares, chances are you could make that trade for a handful of basis points off of fair value, just by working that trade through a liquidity provider like Wallach Beth; a market maker like Susquehanna; or a trading desk at a firm like ConvergEx.\n\nIt's not all roses\u2014in our IndexUniverse ETF Analytics system , AXIT rightly scores just a 22 out of 100 for tradability. But even there, it's possible. For most investors, however, illiquid ETFs remain a place where professional help is going to be the norm, not the exception.\n\nIt's All Good\n\nIn general, all four of these lessons are good news. There's a system here. Far from an investor-shaking flash crash, last week turns out to be a testament to just how well that system"}

{"text": "The Meaning of the Dow Jones Industrial Average\n\nIn the last week, the Dow Jones Industrial average closed at a thirteen month high and, at the same time, unemployment hit double digits for the first time since the early eighties. I thought that the Dow Jones was supposed to represent how the economy was doing, but that's not the case. What does it mean? What is the point of reporting it if it doesn't mean anything?\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (often called \"the Dow\" for short) is an incredibly common piece of news, yet the purpose of it is often really unclear to newswatchers. Is it an indication of the state of the economy? Not really. Is it an indication of the state of the stock market? Not really.\n\nWell, then, what is it? And why does it get reported so often?\n\nWhat Is the Dow?\nThe \"Dow\" usually refers to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It was invented by Charles Dow, a co-founder of Dow Jones & Company, which is a publishing and information company.\n\nThe \"Dow\" is simply an average of the value of one share each of thirty of the largest companies in the United States. It does not include any of the thousands of other publicly traded companies.\n\nOf course, a bit of math checking would reveal that if you added up the current market value of a share of each of the thirty companies in the Dow and divided by thirty, you would not get a number anywhere close to the current value of the Dow. There are several reasons for this, but the most important reason is that companies sometimes choose to split their stocks, basically exchanging two new shares for one old share (or some similar exchange). In order to make sure that such an exchange doesn't wreck the value of the Dow (because that would effectively mean one of the thirty companies just had a single share of their stock drop by half), Dow Jones & Company accounts for it by using a scaled average, in which they effectively keep track of past splits and multiply the values of each share accordingly. Thus, even when a company splits their stock, it doesn't affect the Dow average at all.\n\nSo, basically, the Dow is just a quick summary of the current value of shares of thirty large companies.\n\nThe Value of a Share\nBut what is the current value of a share?\n\nIn simplest terms, it's all about supply and demand, just like buying and selling anything. The stock market is basically no different than a giant flea market, with many, many people buying and selling thousands of items, all trying to make a profit. Depending on the news (and the behavior of others), the price of individual items goes up and down.\n\nIn simplest terms, if there are more people buying than selling, the price of a share goes up. If there are more people selling than buying, the price of a share goes down.\n\nWhat causes this shift? Information about a given company or about the economy in general. Predictions about what the future holds. The behaviors of others. All of these affect whether people are buying at the moment or selling at the moment.\n\nThe Value of the Dow\nIn effect, the Dow is just an average of thirty items from this giant flea market. What information can we get from that?\n\nGenerally, it's not ruled by news from one specific company. One company's bad news can affect it a little, but not enough to make a huge difference.\n\nIt's also not affected too much by how things are going right now. It's important to remember that when people buy and sell stocks, they're doing it based on what they think the future price holds. Thus, the value of the Dow will often go down well before real economic news (like the unemployment rate) turns bad, and the value of the Dow will often go up well before real economic news turns good.\n\nTo put it simply, at the first sign the economy is slowing at all \u2013 or that one sector is seeing real problems \u2013 the Dow will begin to drop, and often rapidly. At the first sign that a recession is slowing even a bit, the Dow will begin to go up, and often rapidly (and that's what's happening right now).\n\nSo, look at the Dow as a predictor, nothing more, nothing less. It's a predictor of the general direction of the economy over the next year or so. If the stock market is going up \u2013 as it is right now \u2013 the economy will generally improve from its current state over the next year"}

{"text": "Don't Gamble: Spread Betting and Gambling\n\nSpread betting might be taxed as a gambling activity, but that doesn't mean you should treat it like one. The difference between trading and gambling is quite significant, and it is an important one to bear in mind for the would-be successful trader. While the urges towards pushing the boundaries and going for that larger win are the same, the rules of engagement need to be totally different if you are to expect different results.\n\nBear in mind that the gambling industry generates multiple billions every single year, which is made up almost exclusively from the difference between the winnings paid out to gamblers and the stakes paid in to the bookmaker or casino - hardly a ringing endorsement of gambling as a way to make money.\n\nLikewise, when it comes to trading the markets some will gamble and take decisions that just 'feel' right, sometimes even with very little or no research to back them up. It could be jumping in to an unknown position, backing up more heavily than you should behind a 50/50 position or just taking a wild stab in the dark. While you might hit it lucky and actually win that particular trade, the moment you start taking uninformed gambles over researched, logical positions is the moment that your trading career is in trouble.\n\nThe Difference Between Gambling And Trading\n\nThe main difference between gambling and trading is manifest in the risk each strategy poses. A gambler knowingly takes on risk and is prepared to stake his money on a chance outcome. The FTSE might finish up on the day in 62 days time, or it might be down on February 22nd at 3.22pm, but without thorough and detailed research there's no valid reason that you should be taking this risk. OK, you might be rewarded with long odds from a bookmaker, but the chances are that a decision like this could easily go one way or the other. Worse still, if you don't know what you're talking about you could be backing an extremely unlikely result. Ignorance can and will cost you money.\n\nTrading on the other hand is a much more reasoned and logical practice. You're not staking money and crossing your fingers - the idea with sensible spread trading is to research the markets, and gain an understanding of the factors that come to bear on their movements in either direction. This process of researching your markets helps stack the odds more so in your favour, and helps reduce your exposure to risk down to the bear minimum.\n\nHow to Know When You're Gambling\n\nThe difference between gambling and spread betting lies almost squarely in method. When spread betting, there are broadly three decisions you can take, each requiring its own justification. Firstly, to open a position - ask yourself the reasons why a position will make you money before you enter it. If the logic is weak, or doesn't have any rationale underpinning it, you're probably taking a gamble and an unnecessary risk. Secondly, you can close a position - could this position run on and make you more money, or has it peaked? Don't just close out on a whim or because you get nervous - base your decision solely on the data. Thirdly, you can do nothing - again this needs its own justification. Are you doing nothing because you can't think what else to do, or is there a valid reason for holding on to your position?\n\nIf you find yourself unable to link up a thought process in your decision making, you're almost certainly taking a gamble that could work against you. The more gambles you take, the greater chance there is of a large, damaging failure. Make sure you're trading on reason and on the strength of your research work for best effect."}
{"text": "Share Dealing Guide\n\nTrading shares can seem like a terrifying prospect for the uninitiated, and the relatively introspective, elitist world of professional trading does little to encourage newcomers. While trading is no doubt a complicated subject, and one that requires hours of research time and pre-trade learning, that's not to say it's completely off-limits for 'ordinary' people, and indeed many individuals from all walks of life are turning to trading the markets as a supplement to or in place of the regular 9-5.\n\nShare trading at a basic level is relatively straightforward - you buy shares when you think the price is going to rise, only to sell when it does and lock in your profits (and vice versa when shorting stocks). Unfortunately, the markets are seldom so simple, and indeed if they were truly as predictable as we would like, all traders would be millionaires.\n\nBut because of the dynamism and the human element to trading, not to mention the vast array of variables that factor in to calculating a share's price, moving with the markets is a seriously difficult task that carries appropriate rewards for those that manage to get it right.\n\nAs a new trader starting out, there's very little you can do to stem the tides of the markets when they move against you, and it is inevitable that you will open losing positions from time to time. However, by ensuring you invest both your time and energies in preparation for trading, including researching and learning about the markets in which you wish you trade, and take adequate steps to preserve capital and minimize your losses when they do occur, you're working towards building more stable foundations on which to base your future trading success."}
{"text": "Options Education\n\nThe Components of Options Pricing\n\nTHE MAIN COMPONENTS OF OPTIONS PREMIUM The premium of an option has two main components: intrinsic value and time value.\n\nIntrinsic Value (Calls): When the underlying security's price is higher than the strike price a call option is said to be \"in-the-money.\"\n\nIntrinsic Value (Puts): If the underlying security's price is less than the strike price, a put option is \"in-the-money.\" Only in-the-money options have intrinsic value, representing the difference between the current price of the underlying security and the option's exercise price, or strike price.\n\nTime Value: Prior to expiration, any premium in excess of intrinsic value is called time value. Time value is also known as the amount an investor is willing to pay for an option above its intrinsic value, in the hope that at some time prior to expiration its value will increase because of a favorable change in the price of the underlying security. The longer the amount of time for market conditions to work to an investor's benefit, the greater the time value.\n\nTHE SIX MAJOR FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE OPTIONS PREMIUM There are six major factors that influence option premiums. The factors having the greatest effect are:\n\n* A change in price of the underlying security * Strike price * Time until expiration * Volatility of the underlying security * Dividends/Risk-free interest rate * Dividends and risk-free interest rate have a lesser effect.\n\nChanges in the Underlying Security Price can increase or decrease the value of an option. These price changes have opposite effects on calls and puts. For instance, as the value of the underlying security rises, a call will generally increase and the value of a put will generally decrease in price. A decrease in the underlying security's value will generally have the opposite effect.\n\nThe Strike Price determines whether or not an option has any intrinsic value. An option's premium (intrinsic value plus time value) generally increases as the option becomes further in the money, and decreases as the option becomes more deeply out of the money.\n\nTime Until Expiration, as discussed above, affects the time value component of an option's premium. Generally, as expiration approaches, the levels of an option's time value, for both puts and calls, decreases or \"erodes.\" This effect is most noticeable with at-the-money options.\n\nVolatility is the most subjective and perhaps the most difficult factor to quantify, but it can have a significant impact on the time value portion of an option's premium. Volatility is simply a measure of risk (uncertainty), or variability of price of an option's underlying security. Higher volatility estimates reflect greater expected fluctuations (in either direction) in underlying price levels. This expectation generally results in higher option premiums for puts and calls alike, and is most noticeable with at-the-money options.\n\nDividends and the Current Risk-Free Interest Rate have a small but measurable effect on option premiums. This effect reflects the \"cost of carry\" of shares in an underlying security -- the interest that might be paid for margin or received from alternative investments (such as a Treasury bill), and the dividends that would be received by owning shares outright"}

The Bank of International Settlements estimates that the average daily volume in the fx market is around $4 trillion, which makes it by far the largest financial marketplace in the world. Surprisingly, however, many novice investors and traders have never even heard of this market.\n\nUntil the late 1990's, the only players allowed to execute trades in the foreign exchange market were investment banks, hedge funds, and very wealthy private investors. Since the minimum contract size was generally $1,000,000, smaller traders were effectively denied entrance into the market.\n\nIn the late 90's, however, this all changed. The advance of the internet and technology led several online forex brokers to open shop and begin catering to smaller investors and traders.

In 2010, the National Futures Association instituted some major changes, one of them being a cap on leverage at 50:1. This means that an fx trader in the United States can trade on leverage at a ratio of 50:1. Thus, if a trader has $1,000 in his account, then he is able to leverage that $1,000 into $50,000 and trade much larger positions in EUR USD. Until the National Futures Association passed this regulation, some brokers were offering traders up to 400:1 leverage, which means that with a $1,000 account, traders were able to control a $400,000 position in the market. Note that leverage is a two-edged sword. It will increase both losses and profits.\n\nMargin\n\nMargin is the life of a trader. If a trader does not have enough margin, then he cannot open a trade. Furthermore, if a trader has an open position moving against him, he may eventually not have enough money to act as margin, which means his account would suffer a \"margin call.\"\n\nMargin is the amount of money required to open a leveraged position. For example, if Broker ABC offers 50:1 leverage, and Bob the Forex Trader wants to open a position of $100,000, then Bob has to put up $2,000 of margin. If Bob's trade begins to move against him to the point where his account equity becomes less than $2,000, Bob will suffer a \"margin call,\" which basically means that his broker will call for more margin if Bob wants to keep the position open.\n\nEquity\n\nEveryone knows that one of the leading causes of business failure is a lack of initial capital, and trading is no different. If a trader opens an account with a few thousand bucks and trades heavily leveraged positions, his chances of success are nominal.\n\nEquity is essential to trading success. The question many new traders have is, how much money do I need to open an account? Well, the answer to that question is different for everyone, and it largely depends on what your goals are. If you simply want to get some trading experience, but still have a full-time job, then a person can open an account with a few thousand bucks. However, if you are trying to generate enough capital gains to sustain a living, then the initial account balance should be much, much higher.\n\nLeverage, Margin, and Account Equity are three essential aspects of fx trading that every trader must be familiar with."}
{"text": "LONDON -- Currency brokers that cater to retail investors almost doubled their share of trading volumes in the foreign-exchange market last year... Foreign-exchange brokers...accounted for 18% of volume in the $4-trillion-a-day currency market, compared with 10% in 2010... (The Wall Street Journal, April 18)\n\nVadim Pokhlebkin\n\nJim Martens: First, currency markets are much larger than equity markets. By most estimates, the daily volume in forex is as much as 10 times larger than the combined volume of ALL of the world's stock markets. That makes it a very liquid market.\n\nPlus, we're also talking about a market that trades 24 hours a day. That means that if you are a short-term trader and the price spikes after hours, you can adjust your existing position or enter a new one without having to wait until the market reopens the next morning. Sometimes you can do that with stocks too, but typically the spreads (the bid/ask) in stocks after hours widen out, so you may have to pay extra to buy a stock that, for example, announced great earnings after the close of the stock exchange at 4 PM.\n\nThat's not the case with forex. Liquidity stays plenty deep for most investors around the clock. Yes, there are moments when currencies are less liquid, but for most participants, liquidity is fine even then. Spreads stay tight, too -- for example, for the euro-dollar exchange rate, or the EUR/USD, they are typically 2 pips (points) or less, and they may go to 3 pips when liquidity is not as high. But rarely do we ever see a major widening in spreads.\n\nSecondly, I think the ease of choosing a currency to trade is a big advantage. How many stocks now trade around the world? Between the U.S., European and Asian stock markets, there are at least 40 industries, each with a number of sub-industries, and each one of those with 100+ stocks. So we're talking about tens of thousands of stocks -- and you have to choose the right one! Even in bull markets, while \"the rising tide lifts all boats,\" as the saying goes, it may not lift your particular \"boat\" -- in fact, your stock may even decline if it's not the best stock in its peer group, or if you're in the wrong sector. Often, you see your sector or stock fall even as the general market rises, so you have to be very good -- or lucky -- at your stock picks.\n\nThe currency market has far fewer choices, and it's a good thing, because that makes your job much easier. Most forex traders stick to the major pairs; in fact, the bulk of trading is between the U.S. dollar and euro -- by some estimates, up to 70% of the total daily volume. Besides EUR/USD, we have 5 or 6 other major pairs -- and by watching those, you are basically watching the entire world.\n\nIn EWI's Currency Specialty Service, we track and forecast 12 most popular forex pairs, plus the U.S. Dollar Index.\n\nDollar Rates\n\nEURUSD\n\nGBPUSD\n\nAUDUSD\n\nDX, U.S. Dollar Index\n\nUSDCHF\n\nUSDJPY\n\nUSDCAD\n\nCross Rates\n\nEURCHF\n\nEURJPY\n\nEURGBP\n\nEURCAD\n\nAUDJPY\n\nGBPJPY\n\nOf course, we can expand forex trading into more cross rates -- those are non-U.S.-dollar currency pairs, like EUR/GBP, for example -- but even then we're still talking about maybe two dozen markets versus tens of thousands of stocks. So currencies are just easier to follow in that regard.\n\nThirdly, when you trade individual stocks, financial news plays a much bigger role: sector news, individual stock news like earnings, etc. With currencies, we focus on \"the big story\" instead. There are big economic data releases coming out of each country every week, but we watch economic data calendars and know when they are coming out -- and are rarely surprised by them. Instead, we spend more time watching forex markets' technical indicators.\n\nLastly, forex offers flexibility to go long and short with ease -- something that stocks just don't. When the broad stock market declines, most people are uncomfortable selling short -- that is, selling a stock they don't own in hopes of buying it back later, returning it at a lower price and capturing the spread. Most investors just don't do that, even with some new avenues for doing so that became open in recent years: mutual funds, ETFs, etc.\n\nIn forex, it's a whole different story. Whenever we quote a currency market -- take EUR/USD, again -- we are comparing one currency against the other; we are tracking the value of the euro against the value of the dollar. So even when we are selling one market, we are always buying another! We are always buying the base currency, which is the first one in name of the pair. In EUR/USD, the base currency is the euro. On the other hand, in dollar-Swiss franc (or USD/CHF) we track the value of the dollar relative to franc; the dollar is the base.\n\nForex markets have lots of volatility, too -- good for aggressive traders. And if you're a macro-trader, currencies are well-known for staying with the trend for a long time. Volatile at times, yes, but steadily trending.\n\nSo, there are several reasons why one might look at forex versus stocksJim Martens: Well, I'd go back to the first question you asked me. Easy? No. Easi-er than equities? Yes.\n\nIn forex, there are fewer markets, so you have fewer choices and less news to be concerned with -- so, fewer surprises. Our main goal is to find the one currency that looks the strongest against others, and one that looks the weakest. Found them -- now pair them together. Sounds easy, but in practice, keep in mind that when trading ANY vehicle, we are trying to predict the future, and that's a hard task. It's especially hard with individual equities, because you need a real system of how to approach first the broad market, then the sectors, then your stocks. That's why Wall Street investment houses have hundreds of equity analysts -- and maybe five technicians, the analysis who, like us at Elliott Wave International, focus on the markets' technical picture. That's also why a lot more forex traders use technicals than equity traders. But winning is hard in both markets.\n\nAs a technical trader, you can only control one thing when it comes to the future: How many viable chart pattern possibilities there are. Elliott wave analysis allows us to limit those down to a handful, and rank them in terms of their probability. That's a great advantage, but at the end of the day, trading is trading, so the requirements are the same:\n\nKnow at what price you are wrong before you get in the trade. (Elliott wave analysis is great at helping you determine that.)\n\nKnow your risk appetite and don't risk beyond what you can stomach. If you're only comfortable trading at, say, 5 times the leverage while risking 2% of your capital per trade, then don't push yourself beyond that limit. (It's different for everyone.)\n\nStick to your convictions. If your analysis strongly suggests the market will move in one particular direction, trust your analysis, not the \"noise\": the news, analysts' opinions, etc.\n\nManage money for YOUR own needs. This ties in with point #1: What are your goals? Are they realistic? How do you get there? Break it down to the smallest parts.\n\nVP: In your Currency Specialty Service, you and your teammates forecast forex using Elliott wave analysis. Why Elliott? Why not just watch the news and trade forex around the major economic report releases?\n\nJM: Yes, you should pay attention to the news! But relying solely on the news will get you into trouble. For example, let's say the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Will the dollar soar or fall? Using fundamental analysis, you can argue for both scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Higher interest rates are bullish for the U.S. dollar because it means the Fed thinks the U.S. economy is getting stronger.\n\nOR\n\nScenario 2: Higher interest rates are bearish for the U.S. dollar because they make borrowing more expensive, and that slows the economy.\n\nWith Elliott wave analysis, you don't have that. You know what the larger Elliott wave pattern is, so regardless of the news-driven volatility, you know the larger trend. Which means that can remain objective and not confuse yourself with the hour-by-hour news and the \"fundamentals.\"\n\nIn my work, I do follow the news -- I just use it differently. As technicians, we already know based on chart patterns where the market should go. We look at its reaction to the news and see how it fits into the Elliott wave pattern. Many traders shy away from taking risks around big news events, and I don't blame them, because volatility can be tremendous. But we've had some good success over the years at forecasting the markets before a big news report -- because we already know the larger trend! If wave patterns show a clear bullish or bearish setup in front of the news, we've often been able to use the subsequent volatility to our advantage.\n\nBesides that, why do I use Elliott wave analysis, in general? It just fits my personality.\n\nVP: How did you learn Elliott? How long was it before you were able to make confident forecasts? Where should one start with applying Elliott wave analysis to forex?\n\nJM: About 30 years ago, in mid-eighties, I first saw Robert Prechter, EWI's president, on TV. He had quite a following and was on almost every week. I watched his forecasts come true, for the most part; that certainly gets your attention. As many people did, I ordered his book, \"Elliott Wave Principle -- Key to Market Behavior,\" read it, and that was it.\n\nThe first 2 chapters tell you everything you need to know. It's not an easy read; you do have to stop and think. (Lots of pictures, though!) There is really not a wasted word in those 70-some pages. It took me several readings, and even now I go back and re-read them every once in a while.\n\nI started, like most people, by applying Elliott wave analysis to equities, but after joining EWI in 1993, I've applied it to virtually every market we cover (about 60 of them, give or take), in all time frames. So I've seen it work in every situation.\n\nHow long did it take to learn it? Well, I never stopped! Just the other day, I again watched one of Prechter's old videos on applying Elliott wave in practice. And I take the same approach with my subscribers. Every Friday, I record a 5-6 minute video for my Currency Specialty Service, where I explain our forecasts and also include an educational component, often about the basics. Learning the basics well will help you a lot. So, if you're a forex trader interested in Elliott, you start with Bob's book, you watch my videos, and then you progress to label your own charts.\n\nOver the years, I've seen that the most successful forex traders are not those who blindly follow my forecasts. It's those traders who do their homework, who do their own analysis, Elliott wave or something else. They think for themselves, and when they put on a trade, it's because they have their own conclusions. Once they've done that, then they look to see what my Currency Specialty Service is suggesting. If we agree on the trend, they have greater confidence. If we disagree, then the real work begins. Why do we disagree? What price levels need to break to make their wave interpretations work and mine fail, and vice versa?\n\nThat brings up another important point. Some say it's confusing that you may sometimes have a couple of different Elliott wave interpretations of the same price move. But the real question is, do they point in the same direction? If so, that's not confusing, it's a confirmation! Those subscribers who do their own Elliott, as long as their wave counts and mine give at least a common price target and stop-loss level, they can go ahead and act anyway. The market will eventually decide which Elliott wave count is right -- but if the trend is clear, go with it. That's how I use Elliott wave analysis"}
{"text": "In the broadest sense, a commodity is anything that has value, from watches to time to oranges. In a more specific market sense, however, it is an item which is roughly the same market value across the board, with no difference based on quality. Watches, for examples, are not market commodities, because a well-crafted, artisan watch might cost a hundred times as much as a cheap, lower-quality watch. Copper, on the other hand, is always roughly the same price at a given time, because copper is always copper.\n\nBecause of this feature, it acts as an excellent investment vehicle, and so fluctuates more or less entirely based on the market itself. A company that mines copper, for example, may gain or lose value based on any number of factors, including the hiring of a new CEO, new legislation in the company's home country, or simply a perceived weakness in the country. Copper itself, however, has a value determined only by the global supply, the global demand, and the amount of investment being shuffled into copper.\n\nMany other things could be considered a commodity as well, but they are not traded on a global spot market, and so aren't usually lumped in with the above items. These include things like rare metals, such as silicon, cobalt, lithium, titanium, selenium, or magnesium, minerals such as bromine or cement, or agricultural products like potatoes, eggs, or flowers.\n\nEach commodity is usually traded on a different market, and in a different currency. Each one also has a minimum quantity that must be purchased on the spot market. For example, the precious metals are traded in units of one Troy ounce, with gold and silver traded on the CBOT exchange, and platinum and palladium traded on the NYMEX, all in US Dollars (USD). Almost all of the industrial metals are traded on the London Metal Exchange, all in USD, and all by the metric ton. Most gasoline and oil futures are traded in minimum quantities of 42,000 US gallons. Livestock, on the other hand, is all traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, in 40,000 pound increments.\n\nGenerally, when the stock market becomes volatile, people tend to move their investments into the commodity markets, because they are less volatile. These markets are viewed as being one of the most efficient sorts of markets, responding rapidly to any shift in supply and demand, reaching an equilibrium point rather easily and without too much drastic fluctuation."}
{"text": "Long Condor (aka Iron Condor, Bull Call Spread Bear Put Spread)\n\nDescription\n\nLong one call and short another call with a higher strike; also long one put and short another put with a lower strike. Typically, the call strikes are above and the put strikes below the current level of underlying stock, and the distance between the call strikes equals the distance between the put strikes. All the options must be of the same expiration. An alternative way to think about this strategy is long a strangle and short an even wider strangle. It could also be considered as a bull call spread and a bear put spread.\n\nOutlook\n\nLooking for sharp move either up or down in underlying stock during the life of the options.\n\nSummary\n\nThis strategy profits if the underlying stock is outside the outer wings at expiration.\n\nMAXIMUM LOSS\n\nMotivation\n\nVariations\n\nInstead of a body and two wings, the body has been split into two different strikes so that there are two shoulders in the middle and two wingtips outside the shoulders.\n\nMax Loss\n\nThe maximum loss would occur should the underlying stock be between the lower call strike and upper put strike at expiration. In that case all the options would expire worthless, and the premium paid to initiate the position would have been lost.\n\nMax Gain\n\nThe maximum gain would occur should the underlying stock be above the upper call strike or below the lower put strike at expiration. In that case either both calls or both puts would be in-the-money. The profit would be the difference between either the call strikes or the put strikes (whichever are in-the-money), less the premium paid to initiate the position.\n\nProfit/Loss\n\nThe potential profit and loss are both very limited. In essence, a condor at expiration has a minimum value of zero and a maximum value equal to the span of either wing. An investor who buys a condor pays a premium somewhere between the minimum and maximum value, and profits if the condor's value moves toward the maximum as expiration approaches.\n\nBreakeven\n\nThis strategy breaks even if at expiration the underlying stock is either above the lower call strike or below the upper put strike by the amount of the premium paid to initiate the position.\n\nUpside breakeven = call strike + premiums paid\n\nDownside breakeven = put strike - premiums paid\n\nVolatility\n\nAn increase in implied volatility, all other things equal, would have a positive impact on this strategy.\n\nTime Decay\n\nThe passage of time, all other things equal, will have a negative effect on this strategy.\n\nAssignment Risk\n\nYes. The short options that form the wingtips of the condor are subject to exercise at any time, while the investor decides if and when to exercise the shoulders of the wings. If an early exercise occurs at a wingtip, the investor can exercise their option from the appropriate shoulder to lock in the maximum gain and continue to hold the other half of the position, which might still have value. So early exercise might be a good thing, although it would require borrowing stock or financing stock for one business day.\n\nAnd be aware, any situation where a stock is involved in a restructuring or capitalization event, such as for example a merger, takeover, spin-off or special dividend, could completely upset typical expectations regarding early exercise of options on the stock.\n\nExpiration Risk\n\nYes. If at expiration the stock is trading right at either wingtip the investor would face uncertainty as to whether or not they would be assigned on that wingtip. Should the investor not be assigned on the wingtip, they could be unexpectedly long or short the stock on the Monday following expiration and hence subject to an adverse move over the weekend"}

{"text": "Debit Spreads\n\nAll\nAbout Debit Spreads - Definition, An Example, and How to Use\n\nA debit\nspread comes about when you purchase one option and simultaneously sell an\noption (for the same underlying security, of course), and you have to shell out\nsome cash to buy the spread. When\nyou buy a debit spread, except in unusual circumstances (see below), you only\nhave to come up with the difference between what the option cost that you\nbought and what you received from selling the other option to someone else.\n\nDebit\nspreads are purchased to reduce risk.\nThe other side of the coin is that the maximum gain is limited. For example, you might buy a one-month\ncall option at the 70 strike for XYZ stock selling at $70 and pay $3.00. If you just bought the option, your\ncost would be $300 plus commissions, and that is the maximum you could\nlose. If the stock goes up to $80,\nyou could sell the option for $10.00 and make a whopping gain of $700. However, it doesn't happen that way\nvery often. Stocks usually don't shoot up by $10 in a single month.\n\nAnother\nchoice would be to buy a debit spread, sharing both the risk and potential\nreward with someone else. You\ncould probably sell a one-month 75 call on the above stock for $1.50. If you did that, you would collect $150\nfrom someone else and cut your total risk in half. (Your debit spread in this\ncase would be called a vertical spread.) If\nthe stock goes up to $75 in one month (a much more likely event that having it\ngo up to $80), you would make a gain of $350 less commissions on an investment\nof $150. At a $75 ending price,\nthe person who bought the 75 call would lose his entire investment while you\nmade over 200% on yours.\n\nIf the\nstock did manage to go up to $80, your debit spread would still earn you $350,\nbut that is the maximum you could ever gain. Meanwhile, at $80, the person who bought the 75 call would\nalso make $350 on his investment.\nIn the real world, however, your chances of a maximum gain are many\ntimes greater than the person who did not buy a debit spread, but only bought a\ncall option instead (and paying the same amount, $150, for his investment as\nyou did for your debit (vertical) spread).\n\nDebit\nspreads do not have to be only vertical spreads. A calendar spread, also called a time spread or a horizontal spread, is also a debit spread. Diagonal spreads can also be debit spreads. For example, you could buy a call\noption with many months of remaining life and sell a higher-strike call with\nonly a single month of remaining life.\nThat would be a debit (diagonal) spread. As with most debit spreads, you would only have to come up\nwith the difference between what you paid for the long option and what you\nreceived by selling the short option.\n\nThere are\ncertain spreads where you have to come up with more cash than the debit spread\ncost. For example, if you bought a\ndiagonal call spread, buying a 70 strike call with 6 months of remaining life\nand selling a 65 call with only a single month of remaining life, you might be\nable to buy the spread at a debit.\nHowever, theoretically, you could lose $500 on the spread (if the stock\nshot higher, above $70, and never returned.\n\nThe broker\nwould charge you a $500 maintenance requirement on this spread even though it is\nhighly unlikely that you would ever lose that much. At the end of the first month when the 65 strike call\nexpired, you would have to buy it back for its intrinsic value. Of course, it is unlikely that you would lose much if the\nstock did shoot up above $70. When\nyou bought back the expiring 65 call, your 70 call with several months of\nremaining life could probably be sold for a greater amount than it cost you to\nbuy back the 65 call.\n\nIn my\ndiscussion of spreads, I am assuming that you will never allow an in-the-money\ncall or put to be exercised (i.e., either buying someone's stock at the call\nprice or forcing someone to buy shares of your stock at the put price). The great majority of the time, option\ntraders choose to close out in-the-money options at or near expiration rather\nthan buying or selling shares of stock.\nShares of stock are for stock investors. Option investors are different - they prefer to tie up less\nmoney (while also trying to make a much higher return on investment than owning\nstock). Owning stock usually\ninvolves waiting patiently for years for it to go up. Option traders are not so patient. They like to see action today and tomorrow, not a decade\nfrom now.\n\nFor\na good explanation of debit spreads in action, get a free report\nentitled \"How to Make 70% a Year With Calendar Spreads\" when you sign up for our free newsletter"}

{"text": "ETF and Gamma Question\n\nSo I've been doing calendar spreads on volatile stocks like (GOOG), (PCLN), (AAPL) etc... Its been pretty crazy adjusting constantly due to the high volatility. I'm looking to try some ETF's for the first time. But when I pulled up some strategies with the ETF's in the P & L Graph I've noticed that the ETF's have a high amount of Gamma. I was under the impression that ETF options where less volatile than equity options. Yet due to the high Gamma, it seems the smallest move in the ETF spells disaster pretty quick.\n\nMy questions are: Why is this the case, or am I missing something? And can someone recommend some general tradeable ETF's?\n\n(for those who don't know; Gama is the incremental change of Delta for a one dollar move in the underlying)\n\nI'm not aware of any Gama difference if your underlying is stock, ETF or index. Gamma normally comes more into play closer to expiration. Are you selling the short side of your calenders close to expiration? (closer than 20 days) This might explain the Gamma.\n\nOn a different topic: You mentioned you were doing calenders on volatile stocks. That's perfectly fine, but calender spreads are hurt by decreasing volatility and helped by increasing IV. I use calender spreads when the relative IV is low and do credit spreads, butterflies and condors when the IV is high. These later positions are helped by falling volatility. I'm not saying you can't or shouldn't do calendars on high IV, but you can gain an edge if you're on the right side of the IV.\n\nDoogle, thanks for your response. So take this example: I pulled up a calendar spread in (ISRG): Selling front week April 27 580 call Buying the back month May 19 580 call Debit: 9.20 For this position, a 1-lot has -1.20 Gamma\n\nCompared to the ETF (QQQ): Selling front week April 27 66 call Buying back month May 19 66 call Debit: .63 For this position, a 1-lot has -9.81 Gamma.\n\nWhat am I missing from this discrepency? I do try to pick a position that is in a low range of its volatility, but it seems the gamma risk is pretty high with the weekly's which I understand. But it seems although the ETF's have a lower volatility than the equity options, the gamma seems crazier.\n\nI should start by saying I'm not aware of any gamma differences due to the type of underlying. So I'm sure we'd both welcome a more expert explanation.\n\nI would expect Gamma, with a week till expiration, to be high near the money. Highest near your short strike.\n\nLooking at your ISRG/QQQ example. One difference I notice is that ISRG options have low liquidity. The May ATM open interest is under 100 contracts. This might be messing with the price model that the P+L Calc uses due to wider bid/ask spreads. I think the QQQ, with May ATM open interest over 100,000, is probably a more accurate read.\n\nI plugged in a handful of stocks and ETFs to look for a trend, but didn't notice one.\n\nI'm sure you are just overlooking the definition of gamma. It the rate at which the option delta changes when the underlying asset changes by ONE POINT. For your high-priced stocks, one point is essentially nothing. Yet for the modestly priced options on ETFs, one point is a far more significant number.\n\nFor example, when trading SPY options, gamma seems to be much higher than that of SPX options. However, we know that a one-point move in SPY is equivalent to a 10-point move in SPX. The dollars earned from a 10-lot of SPY options is essentially the same as that earned from a one-lot (assuming the strikes are equivalent and the expiration is identical) SPX option.\n\nYou do not want to compare losses with an equal number of contracts. You want to compare an investment of an equal number of dollars. For example:\n\n\u00b7 When SPX moves 10 points, that is equivalent to SPY moving by one point.\n\n\u00b7 Ten SPY options (and all that gamma) still make or lose the same as one SPX option (assuming strikes are equivalent and expiration is identical) and it's much smaller gamma.\n\nOptionsWhile Delta represents the consensus of the marketplace as to the theoretical price movement of the option relative to the underlying security and Gamma represents the consensus of the marketplace as to the theoretical rate of change of Delta relative to the underlying security, thereHi Mark and thanks for your response. Not sure how you got that I dont know the definition of Gamma by reading my initial inquiry. Buy anyway I appreciate the response, and I understand your point. Its a proportinate thing.\n\nI was hoping you would chime in on this question with your knowledge and experience. I agree with your explanation, after all the stock price in squared in the denominator for gamma in the BS model. The more expensive the stock, lower gamma\n\nWhere I was struggling is that the question really is about calendar spreads, where gamma is the difference between two options, not individual options itself. The difference between two large numbers (QQQ options) can be a small number and vice vrsa. What is your take on it?"}
{"text": "How to Trade in Stocks Online\n\nTrading in stocks online is not like shopping at your local major retailer, where prices are set. Because investments are priced in real time through active bidding between buyers and sellers, there are techniques to buying and selling. When dealing with investments, you have five main ways to buy or sell them online:\n\nMarket orders: This is the most common type of order. You tell your broker to sell your shares at the best price or to buy shares at the current price. Because these orders are executed almost immediately and are straightforward, they typically have the lowest commissions.\n\nLimitorders: With a limit order, you tell your online broker the price you're willing to take if you're selling stocks and the price you're willing to pay if you're buying. The order will execute only if your price is reached.\n\nImagine you own 100 shares of ABC Company, which are trading for $50 a share. The stock has been on a tear, but estimate it will fall to $30. You could sell the stock outright with a market order, but you don't want to miss out on any gains in case you're wrong. A limit order would let you instruct your broker to sell the stock if it fell to $45 a share.\n\nLimit orders are filled only at the price you set. If the stock falls further than the price you set, the broker might be able to sell only some of the shares, or none, at the price you set.\n\n*Stop marketorders: Similar to limit orders stop market orders let you set a price you want to buy or sell shares at. When a stock hits the price you designated, the order converts into a market order and executes immediately.\n\nImagine that you have 100 shares of ABC Company, which are trading for $50 a share. But this time, you enter a stop market order for $45. And again, you wake up to find the stock plunged instantly to $25. This time, though, all your stock would have been sold. But, your online broker will sell the shares at whatever the price was the moment your order converted to a market order, which in this case could have been $25.\n\nStop limit orders: Stop limit orders are customizable. First, you can set the activation price. When the that price is hit, the order turns into a limit order with the limit price you've set.\n\nOkay, ABC Company is trading for $50 a share when you enter a stop limit order with an activation price of $45 and a limit price of $35. It would work like this: Again, you wake up to find that the stock plunged instantly to $25. This time, your broker would turn your order into a limit order after it fell below $45.\n\nWhen the stock fell to $35, the broker would try to fill orders at that price if possible. But Unlike with the stop market order, you would not dump the shares when they fell as low as $25.\n\nTrailing stops: Regular limit orders are either executed or they expire. Trailing stop orders get around this problem by letting you tell your broker to sell a stock if it falls by a certain number of points or a percentage.\n\nIf you're buying and selling individual stocks, trailing stops can be a good idea. Even before you buy a stock, you should have an idea of how far you'll let it fall before you cut your losses. Some investment professionals suggest never letting a stock fall more than 10 percent below the price you paid. If this sounds like a good idea to you, a trailing stop could work for you.\n\nSome brokers charge extra for limit orders, so check the commission fees before you start trading. And some brokers, such as Buyandhold.com, don't offer limit orders.\n\nWhen you enter an order for a stock, you have a few other levers you can pull, including\n\nDesignating lots: Many people buy the same stock many times. Each time you buy, that bundle of stock is called a lot. When you sell, your broker will assume you'd like to sell the lot that you've held for the longest time for recordkeeping purposes. If, for tax reasons, you'd like to sell a specific lot that's not the oldest, you can tell your broker which lot you'd like to sell.\n\nSetting time frames: You can enter an order for a stock that is active only for the day you place the trade. If it's not filled the order expires. You can also enter orders and let them stay active until you cancel them.\n\nPlacing rules: When you issue an \"all or none\" restriction on your trade, your broker must completely fill the order or not fill it at all company"}
{"text": "I just had a question on pairs trading in real-world. How are pairs trading done in real-world?\n\nMy understanding of the procedure:\n\n1. Test stock A using ADF to decide whether A is I(0) or I(1).\n2. Test stock B using ADF to decide whether B is I(0) or I(1).\n3. Using Johansen or Granger-2-stage methods to decide if A and B are cointegrated.\n4. Trade the pair if they are decided to be cointegrated.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Are steps 1 and 2 neccessary?\n\nIn real-world, most prices series are either I(0) or I(1). And if two stock prices series are I(0) and I(0), we can still do\n\npairs trading on them, no?\n\nDo we really need both series to be I(1) to do the pairs trading?\n\n2. In steps 1 and 2, there are different versions of the ADF tests: for example, in R, the function ur.df\n\nhas \"none\", \"const\", \"trend\", \"both\" options.\n\nHow can we select the best ADF options programatically and automatically, both cross-sectionally and along the time axis?\n\nFor example, if we have a large universe of stocks and if we need to do rolling-window ADF tests, choosing the ADF options \"automatically\"\n\nand \"programatically\" become tricky...\n\n3. In steps 1 and 2, does the option of \"none\", \"const\", \"trend\" and \"both\" matter?\n\nFor example, if setting \"trend\" leads to the conclusion of stationary while setting to \"const\" leads to the conclusion of non-stationary,\n\nshould this series be declared as \"stationary\" or \"non-stationary\" for trading purposes?\n\n4. I read that cointegration is more or less a long term concept. How \"long\" is long term here?\n\nSuppose I am doing these tests on 15minute bars, how many data points shall I use in my rolling-window tests along the time axis? I am thinking of 500 data points. But maybe that's too much, remember the markets are changing and we have to be a bit adaptive... Any thoughts on this?\n\n5. Johansen has the advantage of being symmetical in A and B. But Johansen is not stable at all if we look at the rolling-window cointegrated vectors(the eigenvectors).\n\nIt seems that to get the hedge ratio, still one needs to use linear regression since it's more stable.\n\nBut then would you regress A onto B and regress B onto A? They do make a difference, from my experiment...\n\nOr does that matter?\n\n6. Some literature also mentioned using returns to do all these.\n\nMy understanding is that returns are used to find the hedge-ratios approximately.\n\nUltimately we are still trading prices, those are the tradables. We arenot trading the returns.\n\nSo after we do all the tests and obtained hedge ratios using returns or other series, we still come back to prices to form a pair and pairs-trade the price levels...\n\nThe hedge-ratio obtained from regressing returns of A onto returns of B is an approximation to the hedge-ratio obtained from regressing prices of A onto prices of B.\n\nWhen the prices of A and B are I(1), regressing prices onto prices will lead to spurious regression, but the estimate of Beta (the hedge-ratio) itself shouldn't be a problem.\n\nIn today's EFFICIENT markets pairs/basket trading...\nIs more a way to keep a portfolio market neutral...\nWhile one scalps continuously and captures the spread...\nThen the profitable cash cow it was 10 years ago.\n\nIt's about 50 times harder to make money...\nThan when I started trading 15 years ago...\nSo you have to make it up in automated volume."}

{"text": "Trend Trading Blueprint Was The Best Investment I Ever Made!\n\nJohn Chen, the developer of the Trend Trading Blueprint that makes 600-900 pips per week: OK, I've been through this enough times to know what's going to happen...There are only six hours to go until I raise the price for Trend Trading Blueprint. Lots of people will rush in during the last hour and secure a spot. That part is just like clockwork.\n\nThat's fine. I often procrastinate myself. But the next part is just as inevitable - a lot of people will get shut out when the price jumps up -- a lot. They won't be happy. In fact, a bunch of them will be really upset and send me angry emails. But they won't be able to say I didn't warn them.\n\nAnd soon, hundreds of Trend Trading students will be masterfully placing their first profitable trades. And when the pips start pouring in, they'll be thinking one thing:\n\nThe rule about deciding on a trading float is simply that you shouldn't start a live account without enough money to decently manage that account. Just because your broker says you can start a mini-account with a $200 deposit, and trade with a 500:1 leverage, doesn't mean that you should.\n\nWith too little money you will be limited in the trading systems that you can use, and you won't be able to follow a decent money management system. Again it's about allowing yourself time to learn and grow. With too small of an amount to start out, your first few mistakes you make will erase your account and you'll be more likely to give up before you ever learn how to truly earn in the Forex markets.\n\nThere are really no hard-and-fast rules here. For a mini account with 200:1 leverage, $10,000 would be a decent minimum to start.\n\nFor a real Forex account, I wouldn't start with anything less than $50,000. Keep in mind that those are the smallest amounts that I would use. If you can afford to start out with more, you should!\n\nLet's discuss leverage for a moment to gain a better understanding in this area.\n\nBringing Leverage Into the Picture\n\nAlmost all Forex traders employ leveraging when they trade. Unless you're a big bank or a big business, with millions to put on the line, leverage is simply a fact of trading. Most new traders won't have millions they can afford to lose. So, they employ leveraging to allow them to trade at all.\n\nTo clarify what leverage is let's just talk about a trade with one lot in the Forex market.\n\nWe know that one lot of currency is worth $100,000. To trade that lot at 1:1 (with no) leverage you would need to put $100,000 on the line until you closed the trade.\n\nOn the other hand, if you were trading with a 100:1 leverage, it means that your Forex broker will trade that $100,000 of currency if you only put 1% of the money on the line.\n\nIn other words, with $1,000 you now have the power to trade that same $100,000 lot.\n\nLet's assume our 1 lot trade was a winning trade, and we earned 100 pips by the time we closed that trade. To keep things simple we will say that 1 pip is worth $10.\n\nOn the 1:1 trade we made $1000. On the 100:1 trade we also made $1000. The difference in this case is the amount of money we had to invest to earn that money.\n\n$1000 is 0.01 (or 1%) of $100,000. From an investment standpoint we could have earned more money with a low-interest savings account. With the leveraged trade though, $1000 is 100% of $1000. In that case we are actually earning some money.\n\nLeverage allows us to earn more money while only investing a smaller amount. It's simple right?\n\nThe power of leveraging is what makes Forex attractive to so many people. With a small amount to start out they are able to trade large amounts of currency and profit as though they had the full amount on the line. The problem is that, along with huge profits, leveraging can also equate to huge losses.\n\nIf the 1 lot trade we used in the example had been a losing trade (and we lost the same 100 pips) we would have erased our $1,000 in just one trade.\n\nIt's very important to keep potential losses in mind when chosing a broker and the leverage that they allow for. There are now Forex brokers offering 400:1 or even 500:1 leverage. This does allow for traders to move huge amount of currencies with very little money invested, but it also greatly increases the risk involved.\n\nThe biggest problem with huge leverages is that it often attracts newer traders with smaller amounts of money to start out. Just because you can start an account with $5,000 and use 500:1 leverage to trade full lots with only $200 invested for each lot doesn't mean that it's a good idea.\n\nIn the long run you will be much better off with a 100:1 or 50:1 leverage and a larger amount of money to work with.\n\nAt the very most, you should never trade with anything over 200:1 leverage.\n\nTo calculate how much money you can trade with any given leverage you can use this simple calculation.\n\nAs an example if I was using a 200:1 Leverage and wanted to trade 1 lot ($100,000 of the currency pair)\n\n1/200 = 0.005 or \u00bd%\n\n100,000 x .005 = $500\n\nI would need $500 on the line for each lot that I traded. By now you should have a clear understanding of what a trading float is, and also of how leverage works to affect the amount you can trade with that float."}

{"text": "Change From the CloseThe next field that we're going to look at is one of the most commonly used fields in stock trading. This is the change from the previous close. People often call it 'The change', 'the change for the day', or 'up for the day'. We call it, the up for the day filter.\n\nI'm sure you've seen a table like this. For each stock it shows you the change from the close in dollars, and also in percent. We also track this data a third way, which shows how big the change looks on a stock chart.\n\nThe first thing to notice is that some of these numbers are positive, and some are negative. Let me sort by the '% Change' field to group those together. All the positive numbers are stocks which are up for the day. FAZ is up just over 5% today. VGK is is down about 2%. A change of negative two means down by 2%.\n\nThe numbers in this table are exactly the same as the numbers you'd put into our filters.\n\nLet's start with a simple example. If I only want to see stocks which are up for the day, I'd set a minimum of 0%. If I only want to see stocks which are down, I'd set a maximum of 0%. Notice that the minimum field always points up, to more positive numbers. The maximum field always points down, to more negative numbers.\n\nLet's try something slightly more complicated. The market as a whole was down a little more than a percent today. Let's say that I want to see things that did better than average today. So I'll set my min to -1.15%. This is a min, so I'll see everything that's doing better than that value. In a separate window I'll set my max to -1.15%. Don't let the negative numbers trip you up. Min always points to the green end, and max always points to the red end.\n\nOf course, you can do even more. Let's look at stocks that did similar to the market as a whole. Let's look at stocks in the range of negative 1/2 to negative 1 and 1/2. Again, don't let the negative numbers trip you up. 'Min' always means 'this and higher'. 'Max' always means 'this and lower'.\n\nWhat happens if I set the max below the min? In this case I see everything which was below the max and also everything above the min. This is the opposite of the previous query. This shows everything that moved a lot differently than the market as a whole.\n\nI've shown you a few examples, but you can do more on your own. Click the link on the left to do this yourself. I'll get you started. Let's say that you want everything that's down by at least 3% today. Would that be a minimum of negative 3? Nope. That's exactly the opposite of what I wanted. Let me try again. I want everything worse than -3, so let me try the maximum. That's it! I got it.\n\nYou can try anything, just to see what the results will look like. This is a powerful tool, so don't be afraid to spend some time investigating it."}

{"text": "Dilemma Strategy\n\nMost of you have probably already thought of something like this before but I'll share it anyway because this method has an amazing success rate. The logic behind my \"Dilemma Strategy\" is that when the price reaches a strong support or a strong resistance level, it usually tries to break it and it doesn't matter whether or not it succeeds because it is the trying that I'm gonna take advantage of.\n\nI have only tried this strategy on USD/JPY, EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY so I can't speak for rest of the pairs.\n\nOK, now spot supports and resistances in the 4h chart.\n\nWhen the price reaches one of these levels, buy and sell your pair. That's right. You have to create two opposite orders at the same rate.\n\nFor each of those orders, TP = +20 pips, SL = -90 pips. You might get to extend the TP to 30-35 pips if you're monitoring your trade.\n\nThat's it.\n\nIn case you're a money management freak wondering, \"Hey, I'll lose the money I made in 5 successful trades in just one bad trade,\" well, yeah, you will but I found out the probability of success to be 7/8 and that is why I decided to post it here.\n\nbut wouldn't you be loosing money on one at the same time you are making money on the other? Wouldnt the two orders offset like a hedge?\n\nWhen the price is trying to break a support or a resistance level, it will usually oscillate above and below that level for some time before finally deciding its direction. The oscillation about this level, which is your entry level, will make you profit on both trades because the price is moving in both directions. The 90 pip SL ensures that none of your trades gets stopped out in the middle of one of these oscillations.\n\nI still don't get it. if you have two opposite trades and price is just bouncing back and forth between them, doesn't it just balance out to zero gain?\n\nHe has a large stop loss on both ends. Let's say you have two open. Price moves to hit on profit target, and he's then assuming it's going to bounce back and knock out the other profit target. All this done without hitting the stop loss.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't trade a method like this. However, that does not curb my interest in how it fared after 100 trades.\n\nI still don't get it. if you have two opposite trades and price is just bouncing back and forth between them, doesn't it just balance out to zero gain?\n\nTake a look at GBP/JPY 4h and 1h charts. It touched the 143.53 resistance a few hours ago, right? If you opened two positions at 143.53 - one long and one short - and used that 20 pip TP and 90 pip SL, you would have made 40 pips now because since the price touched that level, it's been oscillating. Get it?\n\nok, I get it, you've got a take profit. so if that gets hit youve got profit on that trade. But the other trade is still open. so now you only have one trade open so do you open another one so you still have two open ? so you can continue catching the oscilations back and forth?"}
