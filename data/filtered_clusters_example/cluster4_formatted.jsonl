This is your introduction to Matthew E. White; he's convincing you to stay the night. You give me joy like a fountain deep down in my soul. You can hear him breathe in. The first time around, White only hums the chorus. Hums it. Plants it in your head as it blooms in his. Strings enter like a siren. The guitar only talks when it has something to say. The choir lets you know you're not alone. Overdubbed woodwinds and muted brass like it on top, dancing around the embers of the bass line. Whether you're a woman or man, White's mournful, get-it-on voice may be all you can hear: I don't want to live a day longer than you, so let's meet the Lord together. You can call it soul music if you want. It's his soul and it's his music."}

I'm going to admit something slightly embarrassing now: I actually quite like that Gotye single she sang on. (Emphasis on \"quite\" here, let's not go overboard. I quite like it in exactly the same way as I quite like the occasional song by Sting or Peter Gabriel, because it sounds exactly the f***ing same as something by Sting or Peter Gabriel.) I'm coming in from a position of not-hate. Even so, I was unprepared for this.\n\nWhat is this?\n\nIt's a neon pink song. A bright bubblegum fizz of verve and sparkle. It's bold, and quite literally brassy. It's fun, exciting, and doesn't have the slightest intention of sending you to sleep. In other words, it's the polar opposite of the Gotye songs that aren't Somebody That I Used To Know.\n\nThis is what pop music ought to sound like. It has the plunking strings and rich denseness of old Motown but the delicious basslines of those modern pop songs that mistake hooks for actual melody.

This track caught my attention because on first listen I knew nothing about the band. The intro bass line sounded like The Breeders and then the drums kicked in like Shellac. Then, finally, the guitar and vocals kicked in exposing what the rest of the EP sounds like, which is basically 90s emo. This generation will liken them to Algernon Cadwallader, while older folks like myself would link them to Cap'n Jazz or American Football. In any case, I enjoy the energy of this song and the places it took me. Birdfeeder is out now and was self-released by the band."}

The answer for this million-selling L.A. quartet is, surprisingly, better (and louder) than ever. Despite an out-of-vogue sound and lead singer Scott Wei-land's drug-related prison term, the band sounds supremely confident on this reunion disc. Discarding the pretensions of earlier albums, which often mimicked the darkly melodic perspective of bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam, the Pilots land in refreshing new territory. \"Heaven and Hot Rods\" combines hard-driving guitars with a boogie beat, while \"Atlanta\" finds the band basking in a sunny, mid-'70s folk-rock groove.

The Boulder, Colorado, two-piece make tunes that mix the best (and some of the worst) elements of hip-hop, pop and punk with surprisingly pleasing results.

{"text": "12 April 2000\n\nNURSE WITH WOUND \u2013 \"Two Shaves And A Shine\" (from the LP An Awkward Pause)\nFollowing my trashing of Doves on grounds of length, you might reasonably ask whether I'd like any long rock song. Here's the answer. \"Two Shaves And A Shine\" is nine-and-a-half minutes, and electrifying.\n\nNurse aren't a rock band, which probably helps: what they do is put sounds together with more-or-less surrealist intent. To the listener for whom surrealism means replacing the punchline to a joke with the word \"fish\", or winkingly introducting 'weird' objects into ordinary pictures, a word of caution: Nurse With Wound records aren't like that. NWW go back to the roots of surrealism, to Breton and Lautreamont (who their first album swiped a title from). So what? you ask. So no two Nurse records sound the same, so they make music (\"Rock And Roll Station\") which sounds like trying to remember a dream feels, so they also make music (To The Quiet Men From A Tiny Girl) which feels like being trapped in shadow hospitals where all the doctors have pig heads.\n\nBut for these purposes, forget all that stuff. \"Two Shaves And A Shine\" is a long rock song. Except it's also ninety-three or so short rock songs, set on a six-second cycle, bouncing along on a spindly, bug-eyed bass riff. This radical fragmentation keeps the pace steady but also stops your attention slackening: compositionally: it's taking the common techno idea of minor variation over a steady beat and applying it to rock, with dynamic results. You get David Tibet's visionary ranting, then shrieking and scraping guitars and breakneck bouzouki. It's original and it grooves and it's got that air of deranged risk that you always imagined rock music should have: what more can one ask?"}

{"text": "I wrote up a whole thing and then lost it. So stealing from Wikipedia:\n\nMath rock is a rhythmically complex, often guitar-based, style of experimental rock and indie rock acts that emerged in the late 1990s, influenced by progressive rock bands like King Crimson and 20th century minimalist composers such as Steve Reich. It is characterized by complex, atypical rhythmic structures (including irregular stopping and starting), counterpoint, odd time signatures, angular melodies, and extended, often dissonant, chords.\n\nGiraffes? Giraffes! was a great example of it (and \"I am Shimer...\" in particular hits all the points). But there's kind of two forms of math rock, with the other being more rock-ish (from groups like Minus the Bear, Forward Russia!, or The Dismemberment Plan). Mutiny on the Bounty is more on that end of it, they sound almost like an emo group but with plenty of angular and prog elements."}

I listen to a lot of Die Antwoord. I'm kind of obsessed.\n\nAh, those crazy South Africans! What's your favorite song by them?\nI really like \"So What,\" off their new album.\n\nListen: Die Antwoord,\"So What\"\n\nBadass. What else?\nOh! You know what I actually really like? I just started listening to Fruit Bats.\n\nWho is that?\nI have no idea. But there's a video for their song \"You're Too Weird,\" which is my favorite off of their album Tripper. It's awesome. It's kind of campy, kind of retro, but the track is really dope.\n\nWhat's your go-to genre?\nTrip-hop. Massive Attack and Tricky.\n\nWhat's trip-hop, exactly?\nTrip-hop comes from a '90s Bristol music scene and it's kind of like electronic, jazz, and hip-hop. Some of Goldfrapp's stuff is considered trip-hop. There are a lot of bands that sort of halfway fall in to that genre, like Air. Portishead, Massive Attack, and Tricky are all \u2015 in my mind \u2015 the three groups that most closely associated with the genre, but the name trip-hop isn't exactly a favorable label.\n\nListen: Portishead, \"Machine Gun\"\n\nWhat's the most embarrassing thing on your iPod right now?\nMy iPod is full of embarrassing things. Mostly from my gym playlist. I have things like Lady GaGa and Beyonce. Contemporary pop, but I also have things like Aqua and Ace of Base.\n\nBut how good is \"The Sign,\" though?\nThe word \"embarrassing,\" though... I'm really not too embarrassed by those things, but they're things that may not be considered \"cultured\" or \"intelligent.\"\n\nSo, do you act? You're holding a script.\nI do a lot of auditioning, and I just got my first principle role today for a show on SyFy. I heard something about a non-disclosure form, so I don't know if I can tell you, but you need to be watching SyFy all the time just in case I come on it.\n\nAre there aliens or robots? Or robot-aliens?!\nI think there's going to be a floating... something. Nevermind.\n\nThat does sound promising!\nBut you can keep updated on my website, I'm also on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr... every goddamn thing you can think of.\n\nWhat's your theme song, Charlotte Pines?\nI've been trying to listen to a lot of new music lately. I've been making a point of it. Recently, all I listen to is Die Antwoord. That's it. So I guess maybe my theme song would be \"Hey Sexy.\" I listen to that before I go into an audition, so I feel like kind of gangster, on top of my shit. Like, fuck anyone who doesn't appreciate all of this. It's important to have those motivational songs. Especially when you're in a line of work that deals with rejection all the time.\n\nI wouldn't know \u2015 everyone likes me. Okay, pick any awesome song out of the air that you've always loved and hit me with it.\nLet's say Kylie Minogue, \"Two Hearts.\" No, I'm kidding. But that is an awesome song. And Kylie Minogue is like forty and just... the sexiest person. She's like Prince, who never ages a day and remains just... the sex. Can we call it \"Train in Vain?\"\n\nBy The Clash? Hell, yes.\nI feel like that's kind of a pansy Clash song, or so people would lead you to believe. But you can dance to it, and so it's awesome.\n\nCommentarium (14 Comments)\n\nWhat is this \"trip-hop\" of which you speak? Nevermind that it's two decades old now and Tricky/Massive Attack/Portishead have been canonized even by notoriously rockist magazines like Rolling Stone. But hey man whatever they make that weirdo artificial computer music stuff. Maybe if they played acoustic guitars or harmonicas they'd be more on your radar."}
{"text": "After initial industrial clanks that sound like they escaped from Portishead's Third, opener Bad Insect lays on the euphoric Underworld synths and sticks with them while Bettinson croons elliptical, occasionally abstract lyrics. The repeated refrain of \"Not gonna sing unless somebody's holding on\" is particularly enticing.\n\nGold Dayzz and Static Light are more challenging, but are both intriguing listens. They are full of overlapping snippets of vocals bleeding into one another, beats that misdirect and melodies that change direction. Talking Heads at their most esoteric are a key reference point worth noting, as are underrated New York duo Phantogram.\n\nLater, Easier is even better. Its wondrous descending chord riff and sublime vocal is resminiscent of Braids at their most seductive, or Chairlift gone funky.\n\nPre-album teaser release Smalltalk follows it and is the album's best moment. Bettinson's voice is assured but vulnerable, like Little Dragon's Yukimi Nagano at her devastating best, while Waronker's deceptively simple beat can do no wrong.\n\nFrom its start to the jazzy electro shuffle of You're Out that rounds it off, Ultra\u00edsta is consistently involving, even if it sags in the middle with Our Song. It's set to be a cult favourite rather than sell millions of copies, but this is because it contains fascinating ideas you won't hear on most pop records.\n\nSeveral visually striking band-made videos of their songs have surfaced online, too, so it's worth checking out what they've made for your eyes as well as your ears"}

Mostly though, I'm shocked at how awesome Bandcamp seems. I signed myself up, just in case I decide to release stuff. It seems like an amazing platform.\n\nConsidering how few people read this blog, I get ridiculous numbers of emails from PR people asking me to post their clients' tracks. Plantagenet 3 is an exception to this: the main guy sent me a really polite email, and being a history nerd I wondered if his band was named after the Planagenet family. A few emails later and yes, he named his band Plantagenet 3 because his dad claims he's named after Richard III.\n\nAnyway, their music is awesome. They describe it as \"a misguided combination of Spaghetti Western soundtracks, 1960s surf guitar and lo-fi post-rock\" and that's pretty accurate.

{"text": "I had this sent to me after I posted the Stoney review. Unfortunately I've lost the message so I can't remember who sent it - if you read this, please shoot me an ask so I can credit you properly!\n\nPianos are a seriously undervalued instrument in rock music. Sure, they're a common tool of the trade for plenty of comedy rockers (Tim Minchin, Axis of Awesome et al), and god knows how many hours of schlock have been filled with mopey white twenty-somethings hammering out ballads. But as a straight-up lead it's generally eschewed in favour of the guitar.\n\nAnd that's a shame, because I think the piano can lend a certain immediacy of tone to a song that most other instruments can't. There's a reason it's the instrument most often called upon for 'scare chords' and the like - a couple of discordant notes can be all that is needed to set the listener on edge for the entirety of a song (for more fantastic evidence of this, I highly recommend checking out The Paper Chase).\n\nThe piano used by The Great Imposter fulfills a similar purpose. It's upbeat, certainly, but at the same time there's a hint of menace to it that subtly turns the songs from straightforward swinging rock numbers into something more sinister. It's a delicate balancing act, which comes off best on songs like 'Tell Me. What? Tell Me Again', which adds in some slightly unhinged lyrics and crazed horns to make my favourite kind of song - a chaotic one. Very appropriate, given the EP name."}
{"text": "THE SEMINAL TEST\n\nRocket from the Tombs meets the strict requirements. Do you?\n\nTags:\n\nRocket from the Tombs circa 1974\n\n\"Seminal.\"\n\nThe word gets thrown around like fists between inmates. And you're bound to hear it this week, when Cleveland protopunks Rocket from the Tombs--among the first originators of classic Midwest punk back in 1974--hit the city on a reunion tour. But what does \"seminal\" really mean, and, more importantly, how does an artist like RFTT get fitted for the honorary title?\n\nAt its core, seminal means influential, the first of a series that notably affected subsequent generations. Chat up any trivia-thumping supergeek, however, and it becomes obvious that a band's obscurity is also crucial. Even if Nirvana rearranged the face of contemporary rock music, you're not bloody likely to hear Joe Record Collector admit it. But Rocket from the Tombs? Pure seminal mid-'70s punk, a thermometer-bursting stew of acidic guitar basheroo and boiling nihilism--made all the hotter by the fact that the original RFTT didn't even last a full year in existence.\n\nIf you extrapolate the concept that Seminality (X) = Influence + Obscurity, you can properly rate a band like RFTT by using this fun and quasi-scientific formula:\n\nHere M = Number of Members who went onto more famous pursuits. RFTT featured David Thomas and Peter Laughner (of Pere Ubu) plus Gene \"Cheetah Chrome\" O'Connor and John \"Johnny Blitz\" Madansky (of the Dead Boys). A grand slam of punk-rock royalty! Thus M = 4 points!\n\nR = Royalty-free cover versions. Although the Dead Boys and Ubu may have popularized them later, \"Sonic Reducer,\" \"Ain't It Fun\" and \"Final Solution\" are all RFTT originals--and who knows how many times they've helped expand nascent punkers' setlists ever since? R = 9 points!\n\nHRI = Horn Rim Index. Or, the number of times per week a band is \"casually\" mentioned by a record-store clerk, zine columnist, bartender, barista, vintage slacks retailer, etc., to prove his/her hipster IQ. Hell, RFTT's Pere Ubu connection alone gets mega-cred in the music-nerd demographic. And if exasperated eye-rolls result when you accidentally mention 1990s San Diego band Rocket from the Crypt instead, score a bonus point! HRI = 4 points!\n\nCMJ = College Music Journal. Count how many collegiate radio playlists the band makes; look for RFTT spins on those smug old-skool shows with names like \"The Roots of Cool\" or \"Back When It Mattered.\" CMJ = 6 points!\n\nE = Number of Entercom (or Clear Channel, etc.) radio stations who've actually aired songs by said artist. Everyone knows those corporate playlists are compiled by \"accountants instead of music fans\" (as Dead Kennedys once noted), so RFTT wouldn't even make a dent. E = Zilch!\n\nSo there it is. Now we simply do the math and see that, um, well...who really cares about stupid scenester points anyway? As a 1970s American punk progenitor, RFTT can be proud merely for its contributions to underground rock history: songs, musicians and a whispered cult reverence that have outlasted many lesser mortals. It's seminal. Just because."}

{"text": "Terror Pigeon Dance Revolt\n\nSo your band's name is Terror Pigeon Dance Revolt. What's that all about?\n\nNeil Fridd: \"The truth is that I named the band when I was in high school many, many years ago. It didn't really take form or become a band until five years after that -- but the name came in high school. At the time, I was in this romantic debacle and I was caught up in that and it ended poorly and I was writing all these songs in my basement on this organ. And I started thinking of myself as this kind of weird version of the Phantom of the Opera, because the Phantom of the Opera hung out in the sewers and played organ. I was caught up over this lady so I thought of myself as that, but a s----y version that can't write songs. The Phantom of the Opera would go out and, like, cut down chandeliers and s---, he'd like f--- stuff up, whereas I was just sad. So that kind of transformed into the idea of a terrifying pigeon; pigeons being this creature that's totally incapable of inflicting any kind of harm on anyone. So the idea of being like an angry tough guy pigeon, that was the Terror Pigeon. I made music super-sporadically like that, just acoustic-like stuff. Then there was this definitive shift where I went 'I just want to make really fun dance music.' And at that point I just added Dance Revolt and here we are today four years after that.\"\n\nWhat actually made you go, \"Terror pigeons, yeah, that's badass\"?\n\n\"I don't know. It certainly wasn't ever a belief that it was badass. It's funny because when I think of a mascot for a terror pigeon, I don't think of a pigeon. I don't have any connection to a pigeon. Whenever I've thought of a mascot or what a terror pigeon is I think of an eagle wearing lots of gold chains. It's like an eagle that's dressed like 50 Cent. It's like this crazy, obnoxious life-controlling creature.\"\n\nSo what does the terrifying sound of revolutionary dancing pigeons actually sound like?\n\n\"You know when you meet a girl or a boy you like and you're pretty into them, and you're very unsure -- maybe there's circumstances like distance or maybe they might be seeing somebody or something -- so you're like, 'I don't know if this is going to work out.' So you have reservations and then maybe a month or two goes by and you're like, 'I'm still into this person,' and you hang out more and more and you're like, 'Oh no, they're into me. What's going to happen?' And then you totally make out with them. That's the sound we're going for.\""}

It's full of the same quirky lyrics, infectious tunes and banging beats that'll keep you dancing along, but the more you listen, the more you'll find.\n\nThere's a lot of thought behind the words, and right from the get-go you're introduced to the message, that we need alternative news sources to be able to see through the information politics that M.I.A. asserts stops us seeing the full story behind everything that's going on in the world; and you know, she may well be right.\n\nPerhaps the most unexpected side to Maya is not the mesmerizing message, but how much M.I.A. actually sings; from heart-felt interludes like \"Tell Me Why\" and \"Space,\" and even in the sassy pop catchiness of \"XXXO.\" As with any surprise, it's the things you didn't know you were missing that make you open your eyes. And that's how these tracks are: fiercely juxtaposed with the hard-edged rap electronica and the incessant industrial backdrop that pervades the rest of the album; like poetry in a war zone.\n\nSo you're going to find a lot of what you expected and a lot of what you didn't. M.I.A. is as individual as ever in this brilliant and well-produced release, but don't go thinking it's an easy listen \u2013 it's clearly not intended to be.

{"text": "Soltero: You're No Dream\n\nIn the liner notes to his fifth Soltero album, You're No Dream, Tim Howard writes that he wanted the album \"to be slight and unsure, like a novice pickpocket.\" The album definitely has an air of uncertainty to it. With none of the rock trappings of his previous, equally excellent Hell Train, You're No Dream actually does carry some of the atmosphere associated with dreams: a strangeness both pretty and mysterious. The mood is richly defined and vague, crystal-clear and open. Ghosts of pop music past mingle with the musical perspective of one wandering would-be folk singer. The album sounds like we're inside one man's head. And the songs themselves fit that as well, with unsteady journeys of the heart a major theme. Even the most seemingly direct songs\u2014the marriage-pondering duo \"Wedding Song\" and \"Sinkhole\", the creepy maybe-stalker song \"Prick on the Prowl\"\u2014carry a lot of questions and confusion. At one point in the album, Howard sings, \"Everyone thinks that we're OK / because they don't hear what we don't say.\" You're No Dream seems filled with those things unsaid, and with the sounds and silence that echo around inside our heads."}

He's from Minneapolis and played in Deformo and Kelley Deal 6000. Michael Azerrad is the drummer. He's also a well respected rock critic who wrote Our Band Could Be Your Life [I highly recommend if you're into Husker Du, Minor Threat, Dinosaur Jr., etc.] and Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana [I haven't read this, but people on Amazon seem to like it]. What it sounds like: Jittery. Some critics compare them to Neutral Milk Hotel but that's not really true. They're similar in that Salad does have a warbly voice that goes all over the place and a whimsical style. However, Salad's lyrics are more mainstream (and make sense) and the music is less pyschedelic and more vaudevillian (in the same way as Jon Brion, Liam Hayes and Wings stuff - but filtered through indie rock). It mostly features piano, keyboards, guitars and drums. I recommend listening to the tracks on their website and/or seeing them for free at Sea Level before you purchase."}

There's some obvious evidence to the contrary, specifically that none of its members were famous before the band. And the term \"supergroup\" is so loaded that it shouldn't be applied liberally. But all of its members have robust solo careers\u2014since 2008's Dear Science,Kyp Malone and Dave Sitek each released solo albums. Even more illustrative, though, is how each member seems to refer to the band in interviews: Malone, Sitek, and Tunde Adebimpe seem continuously shocked that they are still together, as if TV on the Radio werea side project that kept growing.\n\nThis week's release of Nine Types of Light should make fans very happy that the band is still together. Despite the broad tastes and styles of the band's members, TVOTR hasdeveloped a coherent sound that is uniquely itsown, which its memberswould be unable to match without one another. Indeed, the band's different sounds have blended together so well that I often can't eventell who is singing on a particular song.\n\nOn past albums, the multitude of styles that TVOTR comprises has led to songs that tend to change on a dime\u2014like \"King Eternal\"\u2014or that tend tosound frenetic, like a lot of songs being played at once\u2014like \"Dancing Choose.\" Nine Types of Light, on the other hand, has a more relaxed, deliberate sound. The differences are clear from the very beginning. \"Second Song,\" the first song on the album,* begins slowly, with just Adebimpe's voice over a lone note, before adding a crisp, simple drumbeat. Of course, the song gets more complex than that, but it is essentially built around the vocal interplay between Adebimpe and Malone, creating a rather straightforward song. Continue reading \u00bb"}
{"text": "Kangding Ray\n\nAutomne Fold\n\nI can't explain how we slept on this one, except that maybe its beauty is so unobtrusive I'd mistaken the semi-epiphanies it provoked for something outside of my headphones. Like Burial's Untrue (2007), Automne Fold's urban, nocturnal loneliness can sound morose or blas\u00e9 intially, until you wake up one day and realize the music has become like a second skin. Kangding Ray might also end up doing for minimal/glitch techno what Burial did for dubstep: establishing warmth and intimacy in a genre not known for either.\n\nThe album might come across as a complete departure for Raster-Noton\u2014a label whose releases aren't all as austere and clinical as Ryoji Ikeda's Test Pattern, but who nevertheless have established themselves on the fringes of minimal techno. Still, when you take away the layers of warm distortion and (gasp!) vocals, all the elements that mark the label\u2014micro bits of static, CD skips, and other digital bi-products\u2014are still there. More song-oriented tracks like \"Idle\" and \"World Within Words\" might sound more suited to the more ambient-leaning side of Kompakt, but there's still something insular about them. The latter manages to build intensity by the even-metred bass which anchors the whispered speak-sing of the vocals, but the Oval-esque processed guitar backing turns the track into an investigation of space rather than the pop-linguistic philosophy that the lyrics seem to suggest.\n\nThese attempts at profundity do outweigh the music on \"Apn\u00e9e Part II,\" but it's all the rest of the tracks that use vocals as simply another sound in the mix that really stand out. On \"The Distance\" they're cut-up, flipped around, and subjected to glitchy intrusions, but they still sound remarkably organic. Like everything here, the deep bass hums that rattle your body don't get in the way of the details but merely provide smooth walls for the edgier sounds to brush up against. The title of this track is ironic; this music is right inside you."}

{"text": "Taylor Lonardo\n\nThe Low Road\n\nTwo things are clear about bassist (for multiple bands) Taylor Lonardo, after listening to The Low Road: the guy probably listens to everthing from 1930s country to house music, and he probably does nothing but play bass all day long. How else can The Low Road, which is more like the road less traveled, be so diverse and so good?\n\nAll sounds on the record were created with acoustic and electric bass, and Lonardo did all recording and mixing himself at his own Spring Street Studios in Murfreesboro.\n\nFunk sounds jump off the strings in the opener \"Gryphon's Fire\" as some distinct low notes hum in the background. What's so fantastic about this record is that the bass, often neglected in typical four-piece bands, can provide rhythm, melody or both. On the first track, lower pitched bass parts sound off like a saxophone taking a solo.\n\nIf the opener was jazzy, the following \"Henry County Swing\" sounds like a country swing trot with a clopping, sleepy rhythm like horseshoes.\n\nBut Lonardo doesn't stick to that, either. \"Red & Gold\" shapeshifts through watery Pinback-style bass, aimless noises and smooth Deadhead grooves. \"Midtown Blues\" starts with the same eardrum-blowing reverberation as the first five seconds of the Chili Peppers' \"Around the World,\" and then lets loose in a bluesy puddle.\n\nAlmost everything beautiful that the bass can do springs up on The Low Road. \"Electrospank\" shows a variety of voices; the song has a million pulses layered up and talking over each other. The bass goes sour, stretches thin, stutters, bounces and sounds off like a machine gun.\n\nThe record closes with a beautiful goodnight, \"Bella Notte.\" There are no lyrics to any of the tracks, and there doesn't need to be.

Charlotte Gainsbourg just so happens to fall into both categories. She's the daughter of (in)famous French songwriter-actor-director Serge Gainsbourg and British actress-singer Jane Birkin, and an accomplished actress on her own right (starring in The Science of Sleep, the Dylan-biopic I'm Not There and, more recently, Lars Von Trier's Melancholia). She also proves herself an exception to the rule by being a damn fine musician, a fact she further proves on her fourth full-length release. Cobbled together from studio leftovers from 2009's Beck-produced IRM and live material captured during that album's subsequent tour, Stage Whisper can have an unsubstantial feel despite its bulky two-disc format. The sparse, simple electro-pop tunes with unassuming melodies grow on you but don't quite reward the patience they require. The live disc is the real attraction, packing the energy and immediacy missing from the studio material. Though Stage Whisper likely won't make any of the 3,000 year-end \"best of\" lists, it's a fine, occasionally very interesting listen, and a verification that Gainsbourg is an artist worth keeping an ear on.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 1/2"}

All it needs is the Bishop of Rock dispensing wine to make it officially predictable .\n\nI bring this up because The Decemberists' appearance at the Greek Theater (with openers Wye Oak) -- featuring music from their latest, The King Is Dead and a smattering of older material -- was excellent. Despite the fact that they still went ahead with the stupid encore ritual.\n\nThat was Jenn Wasner's late-set crowd banter, and despite the fact that it went over like a lead balloon, I laughed anyway. Also, I'd just watched Wye Oak rock the hell out of my ears. Their set was mostly material from their latest album, Civilian, with a smattering of songs from previous records. I hadn't given them much of a listen prior to seeing them live, but what was initially mild skepticism turned into John Birch Society level fervor by the end of their set. Yes, I mean that I am now a total reactionary wingnut, but for a band.\n\nThere are plenty of groups consisting of nothing more than a guitarist/singer and a drummer, and they're often excellent. Somehow, however, I continue to be shocked. What stands out about Wye Oak is how minimalist they don't sound. Dummer Andy Stack banging on his drum kit one-handed, Rick Allen-style while fondling a keyboard, Jenn Wasner's guitar effects and gorgeous voice...There's not a lot going on but it feels like an army of musicians.\n\nMaybe it was frontloaded. The Greek Theater Hospitality Room (awesome, BTW), was piping an REM greatest hits album over the loudspeaker. That was probably due to REM's influence on the Decemberists' latest, but it was appropriate mood music for Wye Oak's droning, shoegazer sound, which is full of cascading minor chords straight out of 120 Minutes. And I mean the version hosted by Dave Kendall. Think My Bloody Valentine. Think Ride. Think The Spinanes or Dinosaur Jr. before they turned into a lame blues band.\n\nI don't mean to suggest that Wye Oak are a boring '90s retread - they're aren't - but that they've managed to capture the sweet spot between reliving the past and drawing from it. If you haven't seen them before, rectify that mistake as soon as you can.\n\nWe Recommend"}

You can virtually see the twilight setting, feeling as if you're fading away from the world, and just when you're about to fall off asleep\u2026the crass sound of a pNEUmatic drill suddenly blows that peacefulness into smithereens.\n\nIt doesn't take long to become familiar with the image of the duo laboriously recording their work, hidden from sight in a bunker while living in the remains of a commune in some secret, rural location.

I always wonder who people are, where they're going, if they're meeting someone or coming home. The possibilities.\n\nThis mix is called romanticized concepts, for short. Although it's named after a Woodpigeon song, it's actually based on Quadron's \"Tone\" and Elizabeth & the Catapult's \"Everybody Knows,\" two of the most sultry songs in existence. I originally wanted to make a playlist consisting of sparse pop songs, but it sounded too empty, so it evolved into a mix of wandering atmospheric (and often electronic) pop. Lots of sighs and strange instruments, repetitive beats and sprawling melodies. I think I was actually going on a winter flight at the time, so it's very fitting. Very good for watching landscapes change and drifting through clouds. It's maybe not the most traditional Valentine's Day mix, but there's a lot of love in it, in a lot of different ways, and I think that's enough."}

The same goes for his songwriting: The two-part title track of his 2009 album, Brother's Keeper, first makes its mark via little immediate parts like its classically slick bass hook, giving Denson and his bandmates melodic muscle memory to build on when it's time to trade solos and licks."}

{"text": "Review\n\nThe Magnetic Fields head honcho Stephin Merritt has commented that Distortion's peculiar aesthetic\u2014purposely feeding back every non-percussive instrument on the record, including pianos, strings, and accordions\u2014is an attempt to \"sound more like Jesus and Mary Chain than Jesus and Mary Chain.\" Why Merritt would choose to mimic the sound of a lesser band whose day in the sun was 20 years ago and who took most of its cues from earlier, greater artists (Phil Spector, Velvet Underground) may have something to do with the relatively lukewarm reception to his post-69 Love Songs output. The subdued i was wonderful but underappreciated, the Gothic Archies and Future Bible Heroes projects were often excellent but perhaps too jokey, and I don't think anyone actually bought Showtunes. So what's a mad genius\u2014or a grouchy genius, anyway\u2014to do except pull a Dylan at Newport and make some noise?\n\nThe problem is that Merritt's more of a Sondheim than a Dylan. Any arrangement of his songs that obscures rather than stresses the lyrics or melodies seems to be self-defeating. For that matter, the Magnetic Fields are no Jesus and Mary Chain (or My Bloody Valentine or Ride, for that matter), and rather than craft the feedback into elegant walls of noise the way great shoegaze bands did, the instruments on Distortion just clang together cacophonously. It's a strange and far from successful motif for a Magnetic Fields album, but it's also why the Fields sound livelier than any of Merritt's projects have for years. It really is like as if Sondheim tried to replicate the Jesus and Mary Chain; he wouldn't get it quite right, but he'd get something right.\n\nAnd Distortion gets a lot right. First, these are taut, concise pop songs of the '60s girl-group and surf-rock variety, and they're all well served by sticking to a strict three-minute limit. Second, Merritt's frequent collaborator Shirley Simms, whose reassuring alto handles Merritt's quirky lyrics better than anyone, sings about half of the record, and Simms's coo rises quite wonderfully above the din, illuminating Merritt's greatest strength: his compositions (I doubt anyone will write a more gorgeous melody than the refrain to \"Drive On, Driver\" for some time). Breakup duet \"Please Stop Dancing\" is similarly addictive and \"The Nun's Litany\" encapsulates just how incredibly dense Merritt's songs are: It's an erotic laundry list that's sexy, hilarious, sad, coy, cute, and probably a dozen other adjectives too. \"Litany\" is the highlight of a record that no one will mistake for the highlight of Merritt's discography (that's still 69 Love Songs), but which is nonetheless a welcome addition."}

I'm not talking about Lana Del Ray or some shit -- try Grace Jones, brothers and sisters! And Kurt Vile is essentially the male Grace Jones, just whiter, more hairy and slacker-y. Those two made the year's best records, each visionary in its own way: one made of slick post-trip-hop lines and angles, the other boasting blurry confidence.

{"text": "Olaf Rupp, Tony Buck, Joe Williamson, \"Weird Weapons 2\u2033\n\nAt first, I was worried that this was going to be the type of improv recording that would be too difficult for my tastes. There's only 2 tracks on this CD and they're both nearly a half hour long each, and the first one starts out with plenty of amelodic scraping, stretching and clanging. After about ten minutes of listening, however, I realized that I was completely enthralled by what I was hearing. Joe Williamson's double bass and Tony Buck's drums are played in such uncoventional ways that they don't make a whole lot of sense at first. But what really ties everything together is Olaf Rupp's acoustic guitar playing. He eventually settles into some sort of phasing pattern, which contrasts with the dark, dissonant bowing that Williamson is playing. Then Rupp begins picking very intricately, and then gets absolutely frenzied, almost sounding like he's about to break the guitar. He sounds furious! Buck's snare rolling perfectly compliments this. Once this recording clicks, it becomes easier to just sit back and enjoy. The album mostly continues the same frenzied, manic pace, with furious, intricate playing, but also a few slightly more recognizably \"jazzy\" drum fills and basslines. During the last 5 minutes it seems to cool down somewhat, although it still sounds a biy nervy. All told, a gripping session."}
{"text": "It's a clich\u00e9\u2014but a funny one\u2014that every singer who performed in a nineties rock band sounded roughly the same. Sure, there're more than a few songs Eddie Vedder, Kurt Cobain and Scott Weiland could trade off on and no one would know the difference. But one of those guys is dead, one plays the ukulele and the other is somehow just still alive. Weiland's Stone Temple Pilots might be the least versatile of those groups represented in the aforementioned triumvirate\u2014and no, Soundgarden hasn't been given short shrift, since they were always a cock-rock band. But STP's handful of hits still hold on to a bit of gut-level authenticity, obscenely absent from rock 'n' roll over the last decade. 1992's \"Core\" comprises more than a bit of filler, angling at moving beyond hard rock flailing into some sort of music that both tells a story and issues emotion. STP's \"Creep\" isn't even the best song with that name, but the slower pacing serves Weiland, as his voice takes on a softer, but still strained, approach to leading a song through the paces. Rhyming mouse with just about anything is a bummer, but the song's twenty-year-old charm pushes through a narco-haze. Following up its first success, the 1994 \"Purple\" finds the band using the same sort of template-jerky guitar, shaking off its most metallic inclinations as Weiland further pushes himself to, you know, actually sing. \"Vasoline\" was a hit\u2014and it may have been better if one of those other flannel-clad stalwarts sang it. STP kept working through the mid-decade decline of its mini-genre, making a final stand in 2001, before a nine-year hiatus. Returning with a self-titled work in 2010 that occasionally sounded like a broken Black Crowes\u2014\"Hickory Dichotomy\" taking twang to a place it wasn't meant to go\u2014didn't announce a renaissance. It just reminded folks with a radio that Weiland had somehow avoided an overdose and meant Velvet Revolver was taking a much-needed break. STP's trek through town might count as classic rock to an entire generation, and the show's affixed price tag insinuates that. (Dave Cantor)"}

Not bad for a bunch of former recreational drug-indulgers with loud riffs and a wah pedal.

{"text": "/\n\n/\n\nFreak Scene: That Overlooked Destroyer Album\n\nThe above headline is not exactly true, but Destroyer's 2008 album Trouble in Dreams, which came on the heels of the universally loved Rubies, didn't get so much attention. I couldn't tell you why, necessarily. It wasn't bad by any means, but it does sort of tread water. Destroyer's Dan Bejar is known for switching things up pretty much every record, and Trouble in Dreams felt like a more compact version of Rubies.\n\nThe first time I heard it, I was wandering alone through Vancouver, Canada, where Bejar lives, on one of the wettest days I can remember. I remember hearing the opening lines of \"Blue Flower/Blue Flame,\" Okay fine, even the sky looks like wine, and everywhere I turn there's a new face in time, stuck inside the well\u2026. The sky didn't look at all like wine just then. I was cold, and my socks were wet, but something about Bejar's lyrical concession\u2014like he had to just finally admit that looking up at the sky can be pretty beautiful despite whatever else might have been going on in his mind\u2014really hit home. Across the rest of the album there are all these weird, sticky lyrics that aren't actually very confessional, but through some combination of instrumental focus and vocal inflection, they come off as the realest Bejar ever got.\n\nSee the sun crawling over the sky, keep an eye on the surf and the sea and the sand, don't you know every night is a stand-off with the fucking horizon\u2026 from \"Rivers\"\n\nPretty much the entire album was Dan Bejar grappling with demons (personal or otherwise, it's hard to tell with him) through his relationship to the outside world. The sun and sky figure prominently\u2014as do city streets and plain statements about fucking up.\n\nIn an interview with Pitchfork around the release of Kaputt, which came out three years after Trouble in Dreams, Bejar spoke about his uneasiness about the songs on Trouble in Dreams:\n\n\"It was a feeling that started to creep into me\u2014that I was doomed if I was to persist. I know my last record, Trouble in Dreams, has my strongest lyric sheet. But I also know that, as a record, there's something off about it, which is fine. But I had trouble singing it in a lot of ways.\"\n\nWho even knows what that \"something off\" might be, but it's possible that it was Bejar at his most direct and honest, tapping into this idea of lost love and adult uncertainty in a way that was so obvious that it made him uncomfortable to revisit those songs. That's pure speculation on my part, but I think it's important to recognize that the album is his most unambitious\u2014less interested in playing with structure and genre tropes and more interested in crafting songs as just songs. It's the album equivalent of a short story. Unfussy and to the point."}

{"text": "On a note accompanying his Last Will & Testament, Eric Fiedor claims the mainstream radio stations don't want to play his work. I can only guess the station managers haven't heard it.\n\nIt can't be his sound. Fiedor plays fast-moving blues-rock, both hard-edged and accessible. A chorus of guitars fuse into one layered sound, supported with a confident bass and smoothed by some slick keyboarding. Maybe it's the lyrics. They could be obscene. Maybe they're not. I can't tell, since Fiedor's voice often growls into incoherence. For once, that doesn't matter. I can't understand the exact words coming out of the guitars, either, but that's not why they're worth hearing. Fiedor, along with backup vocalists Herndon and Edmonds, is using his voice as another instrument, and his low, hungover vocals are the perfect match for the band's gravel-laced rock sound. This is especially evident in the beat-driven \"White Man,\" where a single repeated chorus serves as the musical backbone for a song that lets the musicians go wild along its theme.\n\nWhere the lyrics are clear, they move as fast and loose as the music. \"Steak and Potatoes\" is love song celebrating the truly great romances of the world. \"Should Have Been Dead\" is an anthem for every foolhardy man and woman who somehow managed to survive their youth. Slower and groaning with frustration, \"Upside Down Rainbow\" is a conversation with an old man cursed with optimism. The lyrics to all Fiedor's songs are often funny, sometimes thoughtful, but never obscene that I can hear. So that can't be it, either.\n\nSo the only possible good reason that you're not hearing Eric Fiedor right now on local rock station is that they aren't well known. Help remedy that by picking up one of his CDs."}
{"text": "The xx - Coexist (Young Turks)\n\nIt's not the notes they're playing, it's the spaces between the sound\n\nThe Artist, a silent film, won the best picture Oscar last year. Similarly, The xx, an inherently minimalist, downplayed dream-pop duo, won the 2010 Mercury Prize (UK/Ireland) for best album. Now, for their follow-up, all ears are pricked up for band that's barely making a sound. Something that wasn't there on the London group's debut resonated; maybe like how what's not shown in a scary movie is always the worst, since it leaves it up to your fevered imagination. The spaces between sounds augment the beauty of the woozy and wispy duets of Oliver Sim and Romy Madley-Croft with aerodynamic trip-hop tropes, delicate synth mists, low rolling bass, celestially whirring guitars and bare beats. And it helps that their sighed serenades are the warmest, most prominent element in their pop's design. Take their new tracks for what they are: bittersweet, ultra-sleek post-apocalyptic torch songs striking a strange voyeuristic vibe with relentlessly intimate lyrics. Their hearts are heavy enough to weigh the tracks down, surely, but the listener grows anxious for a stretch after too much slow-dance swoon"}

Each and every week for a year he hunted high and low to find the 10 finest songs, until finally bowing out a spent husk of a man back in April 2010. Now he's resurrecting his blog \" Stop Me If You Think Youve Heard This One Before \" with a broader focus on popular culture.

Why not soundtrack that shit with new music? I agree.\n\nHere are two highly anticipated albums, which are getting the legitimate leak treatment.\n\nFirst up, The Eraser by Thom Yorke. The Yorke-man kicked this shit out \"while bored.\" Or so he told the Observer Music Monthly.\n\nRadiohead 'was getting boring and it just got a bit weird and self-perpetuating...

Before we judge ourselves, let's judge his music:\n\nThe little secret behind the Illinois record is that it was originally conceived as a double album, culminating in a musical collage of nearly 50 songs. But as the project began to develop into an unwieldy epic, common sense weighed in\u2014as did the opinions of others\u2014and the project was cut in half.\n\nWant part 2?

{"text": "Rogers Sisters \"The Invisible Deck\" (Too Pure/Hostess)\n\nRock musicians manifest the confrontational mode in many different ways, and New York's The Rogers Sisters utilize most of them. A classic power trio that has absorbed every trick the configuration has yielded over the years, the group works up from the kind of precision noise that sisters Jennifer and Laura practiced in math-rock band Ruby Falls, and merges it with the more prosaic priorities of bassist Miyuki Furtado, who grew up listening to Iron Maiden. The result is something like Sonic Youth without the pretensions to art, a controlled chaos with a darkly comic spirit and the gut appeal of pop metal.\n\nLess overtly political than their first two CDs, \"The Invisible Deck\" still gets in your face with its relentless instrumental and vocal attack. \"The Clock\" is little more than a countdown song, but with each hour that's struck the intensity increases tenfold. Even when they slow the tempo down and add a flute on the psychedelic \"The Littlest World,\" fuzz guitar rumbles out of the netherworld and eventually swallows everything. Here's a band who has mastered the art of melodic feedback, making confrontation fun."}
{"text": "Entertainment\n\nThey bake up hits: CAKE comes to Pipeline Cafe.\n\nImage: CAKE\n\nCAKE bakes a jam\n\nInterview by Adrienne LaFrance | Mar 31, 2010\n\nDated\n\nThrough Sat, Apr 6 Honolulu Weekly called original CAKE trumpeter, keyboardist and percussionist Vince DiFiore to chat about pop music, environmentalism and why he feels like a lobster.\n\nFirst things first: How sick are you of questions about the edible kind of cake?\n\n[Laughs] Well, we always ask specifically that if someone's making a poster for a show, no cake imagery may be used. We're pretty serious about that. The word cake is meant to be a non sequitur or maybe a verb. You know, like how mud gets caked on your shoe.\n\nWhat's the worst cake-related pun you've seen in a headline about the band?\n\nYes! [Laughs] Probably something like, 'They bake up hits,' or 'CAKE bakes a jam.' But it's all been nice! It's usually a compliment. They mean well.\n\nYou've been in CAKE since it started in 1991. How have you seen American music change in that time?\n\nIt seems like it's gotten bigger and bigger. The way that music is produced is different now, like the stakes keep getting raised. A lot of the popular music right now is very epic sounding. And since we've been around, the women have really come to the forefront. You know, the independent woman as a focal point of the music. That seems to be really popular. Even the way people listen to music is changing. But we still believe in the album. When we finish this record, we want it to be a good listening experience from beginning to end with that arc from start to middle to finish. For me, these changes, it's kind of like I feel like a lobster getting boiled in a pot. You don't notice the water getting hot around you.\n\nDo you often find you're listening to newer artists and that lack of narrative is sort of a shock to the ear?\n\nYeah, people are just making one pop single after another. It's like, just keep on firing until you get that one pop single. So, they're throwing everything at the one song to make the sparks fly.\n\nLet's talk about the trumpet, which you play, and is a major component of CAKE's sound.\n\nIt's something that has a lot of history in American music, so you're kind of harkening back to a lot of other expressions people have made. Basically, when John [McCrea] was starting the band, he knew he wanted some horns. He wanted his music not to be too overtly happy. There's a bittersweet element to everything, everything has a little bit of a tragic edge to it. The trumpet is a little more immutable to the band than a saxophone and it creates these checks and balances with the electric guitar.\n\nI understand you're the person behind CAKE's Twitter account.\n\nIt's true, it's true. But I don't do anything like, \"I'm making chocolate chip cookies right now,\" or \"I can't find any underwear!\"\n\nI clicked around on your Twitter page a bit in preparing for this conversation\u2013it's a nice little collection of fun facts.\n\n[Laughs] Well, I'm glad to hear that because that's the battle on our Web site! Half the people are telling us to shut up and finish the record, you know, enough with the politics and environmental issues.\n\nFrom what I understand, you guys are pretty devoted to the cause\u2013a solar-powered studio, a ride-sharing program to concerts, giving away trees at shows?\n\nWell, if we wanted to be so true to our environmental concerns, we'd just shut everything down and live in a fort in the countryside, or dig a hole in the ground and live in a burrow. But we still want to play music, and play for people in other cities. We're doing what we can, like using solar and carpool page on our Web site. We aren't going to have any plastic water bottles backstage\u2013we're really aware of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch\u2013so it's mandatory that everyone on tour brings their own canteen. We are a part of the community that's hoping to realign our relationship to the environment.\n\nAnything else you want to add before we hang up?\n\nJust that anyone interested in the band should definitely check out [cakemusic.com]. We have an advice column, a road journal and links to interesting things about the cities we've been in. Oh, and samples of our music, too some"}
{"text": "Thursday, October 23, 2008\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I had the distinct pleasure of chatting with the iconic Randy Newman, who will be performing this evening at the Aladdin Theater. Due to the bitter struggle to get a giant two-page spread in the physical magazine, my rundown of all things Newman was shrunk to 350 words. Not that I'm angry about it; them's the breaks. But I'd be remiss if I didn't post a transcription of the entire interview here for all you blogger looky-loos to drool over. Or, for you over-50 ex-hippie washouts who may actually know what the Internet is. Or for my mother. Fine, fine; I'm posting this for my mother. But you can read it too. Enjoy!\n\nHarps and Angels came out in August. How do you see your songwriting and lyric writing progressing since your last release of new material about nine years ago? I think they're the best two records I ever made. And if they're not, they're close to it, for which I'm gratified; that at the age I am I can still write. That's not the norm in this business. Most people do their best work at 20 or 30. I'm arranging better and I think I'm singing better \u2013 that I'm positive of. I'm happy with both of them. Funny mix on Bad Love; sounds like there's a lid on it.\n\nAre you happier with the new one? The engineer is tremendous on the new one. I'd have to listen to Bad Love again., It's really hard to judge yourself. I know there's people who are always gonna love Sail Away and Good Old Boys because that was the time, but I don't like them better. I like these two better.\n\nIn the meantime you've put out a couple anthologies and film score work. Have the film scores been as satisfying for you creatively as your personal albums? No, not all in all because there'll be moments in the movies where we make a sound in the orchestra that you hope would really work well and it does and supports the scene. But it's always subordinate; it isn't like it's your movie. You always try to make someone appear smarter, more beautiful, the action tighter, things like that. That's what music can do. A lot of directors think it's cheating to use music, but it's not like you're supposed to notice it. The famous story attributed to my uncle is [with] Lifeboat with Alfred Hitchkock. It's just two people in a boat and my uncle's on the soundstage with 60, 70 guys and each guy says, \"Alfred, where does the music come from?\" And he says, \"It comes from the same place the cameras came from.\" So, there you are.\n\nFor over a year or so, the song \"A Few Words\" has been getting considerable attention. Are you concerned at all when the public clings on to one song like that, when they could be missing songs you may have invested more time in? It's been that way forever. Someone will have a hit single and that's it, and they'll buy the album and won't pay too much attention to other songs. Now it's even easier to do. You can get Lil Wayne and get one thing and you got what you want. But no, I don't care how they like it. I work as hard on each track, so it's not like, \"Oh, this is the hit,\" 'cause I don't know if I have any hits\u2026whatever that may be now. It's weird. It's really changed. Stores are gone, bookstores are gone; it's incredible. There's good things about it, but things get lost\u2026you forget. Things got lost when we left vinyl. It's such a pain in the ass that it's almost not worth it to listen to vinyl. I don't. What do you think about that?\n\nI have very few records. I got 'em I just don't play 'em. I tend to listen to CDs, and I tend to not download things. That's too big a decline. They are working hard to fix that. I'm hoping they will.\n\nTake a song like \"Political Science\" that's been around for over 30 years and still remains relevant. When you're writing a song are you searching for that timeless or prophetic element? No. You don't wanna rule yourself out. Maybe \"A Few Words\" will have a life just because it's funny. But I wouldn't count on having another administration to which it will apply. We've never had one, and this one's gonna go away. What if McCain wins? He's more like Bush than I thought the more I see of him. He reminds me of a little Irish bantamweight sometimes; an ex-fighter. Have you been watching the debates? What's been your take? I think Obama won that [first] debate. Somehow he doesn't have the fire he had, maybe that's the advice\u2026 The other one, she's [Palin] an insult to the people and in particular to the Republican Party. There's guys who've been there 30 years, and she may be a very nice person but you keep jerking things back to\u2026ya know, I hear myself talking like this and I think about Warren Beatty and all the nice liberals \u2014 Dustin Hoffman and Streissand \u2014 who, even though I believe exactly the same thing, I didn't listen to them. I wouldn't believe them if they told me the sky was blue, and now I'm doing it. It's amazing what happens when you get older. Anyway, I don't think she's equipped to be President of the United States. In fact, I would make a better president. And\u2026I was gonna say I know less than she does, but I don't think I do. And I'd be shitty as vice president! I'd rank down there with Lincoln's vice president, Johnson. Agnew. I hope someone would give me some money.\n\nI watched a television interview where you were discussing what you estimated your total number of Randy Newman fans in the world to be. The number was somewhere around 200,000. I'd imagine you'd like to reach as many people as possible. How do you go about doing that in your career, or are you at the point where that doesn't matter as much to you? It doesn't matter as much, because it's not gonna happen. I reach hundreds of millions of people with the movies, and with \"You've Got A Friend\" or whatever songs were in those. But for myself, it's not gonna happen. What's there is there, or left. I wouldn't change my writing to try and do it. I couldn't. Maybe if I did an album of love songs and they were good, songs like \"Feels Like Home,\" which people like, I'd pick up another 12,000. I'm all right with it, but I always wanted to sell records from the beginning, as weird as that sounds considering the type of stuff I did. Van Dyke [Parks, producer] and I were working in some session and we were real happy about some strange thing, and this guy says, \"You know, it sounds like you guys have never heard The Rolling Stones.\" We said, \"Christ, you're right!\" That was in the air then, like there would be another species of rock 'n' roll, that it would go in a different direction, but it didn't.\n\nYou do write from a character's point of view, and rarely if ever your own. How closely guarded is that approach for you? Harps and Angels could be me, if I believed in anything. I think it's closest the last two records. I take songs where I find them. How I started might have been some kind of reticence, but I would use anything from my life or anything about myself if I could get a song out of it. I did find it more interesting to make up these characters and let the audience hear what they had to say, and let the audience realize that they know more about the person than the person knows themselves. That's a big deal with songs like that \u2014 most of these people don't know themselves very well.\n\nAre you not concerned whether or not any sort of messages you're trying to get across are lost in that immediate reaction to the song? If you do it right, most people get it. Well, I don't know about most people, because they never hear it. People get irony now. The Simpsons is out there, so it's a better time for it, but it's not the best way to use the medium. If my son wanted to go into it, I'd say make it first-person. But I'm very happy and lucky that I've done as well as I have, considering it's like falling in love with the wrong woman. Short stories is nothing but that. It's not like there's a school of that kind of writing. Sometimes Neil Young does it, sometimes Dylan does it.\n\nAre those two people that you drew influence from at all? No, not going in this direction. That wasn't the main thing about Dylan, and I hadn't heard the Neil Young \"Union Man,\" songs like that where he plays dumber than he is. Dylan is the best lyricist this kind of music has ever had. Apparently in some paper I gave a disparaging quote or something, which I regret. But I mean, ya know, his first 10 years were better than his next 30. But, kind of, so what? Almost everyone's are. Not mine. Or Neil Young. [James] Taylor, too. And the writers who write for other people, the old standard writers. I mean Irving Berlin wrote hits from 1908-1954. I think if you're writing for yourself it's somehow hard to keep it going. And you were writing for other people when you started out, right? Yeah, but I was competing with people like Barry Mann and Carole King, and Bacharach and they were winning! Which one of your albums, even a film score, might you say you're most proud of and why? Either this one, in terms of records, or Faust. I haven't listened to Faust in a little while, but there's some stuff I'm very proud of on there. For the movies, music it's hard to say. The one I think I helped most was Bug's Life. It needed it. Toy Story 2 was pretty good too. And Awakenings; it was a lot of slow music, but it helped the picture. The Moore Theatre, is that where I'm playing or is that gone?\n\nYou're playing at the Aladdin Theater. My audiences up there really vary. I mean I've gone up there and bombed and drawn 400 people. And then drawn like 13, 14 [thousand].\n\nYou've lived in LA most of your life. How big an impact has Southern California culture had on your music, if any at all? I think it's had a big one. It's hard to explain; there's not that sort of jazz edge to me like there is to a lot of the top New York people. Carole King knew the whole repertoire, ya know, the Broadway hits and all that stuff, and I sort of did. I think living sort of wide open, where you can see a long way\u2026 Fagan and Beck are great writers. They sound like New York writers somehow. It's interesting. In ways I liked the Beach Boys better than the Beatles for a little while. All in all, I think I sound like an LA writer. I don't know how to explain it; Jackson Browne certainly is one. I don't know whether Henley is. He sounds like Texas trying to get in. \"Hotel California,\" like, \"you can never leave\u2026\" There's that weird mystic aura around it. To me it's just \"here it is.\""}
{"text": "Sunday, April 22, 2007\n\nOK, I should probably start by being honest and admit that I managed to get slightly lost in Glasgow's one-way system driving over, so we only caught the last three songs of The Twang's set. Maybe it's being the other side of thirty now, but I have reached the stage where just because a band have made it onto the cover of the NME does not mean I assume any longer that they must be any good. However, the three songs I heard I liked. They seem to know how to work a crowd, who were into proceedings, and that's no mean feat for a crowd, many of whom could have been almost twice The Twnag's age. The soon to be Mrs. 17 seconds described them as being like a slowed down acid house, though they are definitely a rock band.\n\nWhen James come on, and kick straight into Come Home, it isn't that it's like they've never been away, but we're reminded why we fell for them all those years ago. All the memories come back: the James' t-shirts with flowers on them (note to younger readers; there was a time when bands like James and their contemporaries were known as T-shirt bands because they seemed to sell more T-shirts than records). Tim Booth has shaved his head but before I managed to have my view shut out by folk way taller than I, he has lost none of his charisma.\n\nThe band have a new greatest hits coming out shortly, but the sheer magic of the back catalogue was not forgotten last night in Glasgow. 'Sit Down' may have seemed almost like an albatross around their necks at one point - just as Radiohead found with 'Creep' a couple of years but they have so many other amazing songs. They never reached the commercial heights of U2 - though I seem to recall them playing a headline gig at Alton Towers amusement Park in England, circa the Seven album in 1992 - but their anthems certainly matched them. Some songs get gentle reworking, like the gentle lullaby version of 'She's A Star' which is stripped of it's swagger but not it's aching beautiful sadness. Even the non-single tracks that get aired, like Gold Mother can bring the mostly over thirties shuffling around the baking hot Academy.\n\nComeback tours can feel like shameless exercises in nostalgia to pay half a dozen people's mortgages. This was not one of those nights. The passion remains, the joy returns and the warmth lingers. And Tim Booth can still do the falsetto on 'Laid.' Come and sing your heart out. I just hope you're not overcome by the venue's heat like I was"}

Coelacanth is also the name of this collaboration of local artists Loren Chasse (Thuja, Id Battery, Jewelled Antler Collective) and Jim Haynes (solo recordings, visual artist, and writer). They use organic drones and textures to construct long abstract pieces of the quiet, slow-developing type. The larger concept here addresses decay, corrosion, extinction. This is expressed by combining micro-recordings of rocks, metals, air, chemicals, glass, and countless unknown things undergoing various physical transformations. Imagine super-time-lapse recordings of hundreds of millions of years passing on earth; each of the Eras, Ages, and Epochs producing its own assortment of sounds and dynamics.

{"text": "Meet Roysta: Dirtcore's Poster Boy\n\nImagine a punk rapping over beats ranging from hip-hop to ska to gabba techno. Now imagine subject matter that ranges from the joys of chain smoking to venereal disease to pimping out teenagers. OK, now add a thick Belfast accent and you've got the vaguest of ideas about what my buddy Lee James, or rather his alter ego Roysta, is all about.\n\nHis lyrics are simultaneously repulsive and hilarious, while his music artfully straddles \"extremely difficult to listen to\" and \"insanely catchy\". It's pointless for me to even try to describe his sound, just pause whatever shitty bro-step you're listening to and go here to be enlightened. This isn't just Motely Crue singing about coke and hookers though, this is an alcoholic rapping about going on four-day Bucky and mephedrone binges in Belfast shitholes. Really.\n\nSo I wanted to find out how much of Roysta was a character and what effect he'd had on Lee James's brain and body wellbeing\n\nNoisey: Hey! So...describe your music\n\nRoysta: Yeah it's punk hip-Hop with influences of electro, hardcore, gabba and everything else I like about music. I use the hip-hop aspect to get across what I want to say rather than scream it down a microphone, I rap. But all the topics for songs come from the punk side of things. It used to be all straight up hip-hop beats, but I got sick of doing gigs where people were just standing there nodding their heads. I like things a little more chaotic so I wanted to get people dancing.\n\nI've been to your gigs\u2026 I'd say you've definitely succeeded.\n\nThey're too chaotic now, everyone's jumping up on the stage and shit.\n\nDo you have rituals before you go on stage? How do you prepare?\n\nI'm usually out in the crowd drinking. When I'm doing a gig half the time I don't even know if there is a backstage. I used to drink a bottle of Bucky before going on, but I couldn't do that now. I've also given up fucking smoking so I can't even do that...\n\nYou've given up smoking?!\n\nYeah, fucking right. I did this video, \"Walking Heart Attack\". It's all about how much I love smoking and how I'm never going to stop, but now I'm wheezing and coughing like I need to be in an iron lung.\n\nI saw the video; it's pretty pro smoking.\n\nI fucking never wanted to smoke after that video again. I have the odd one but that video put me off them forever. They weren't even proper cigs; they were from abroad so they had fucking wood and shit in them. I had to walk around in my pants constantly smoking. Now I need an inhaler.\n\nA lot of your songs revolve around drink and drugs, specifically how they've ruined your life. Have you ever considered going clean?\n\nHa, fuck, as the older I get I'm definitely not drinking as much, but there's been a few periods of my life where I've been a functioning alcoholic. But I wrote my best lyrics in those times though so I'm not complaining. I've got a real love hate thing with drinking. It's such a part of the Roysta character, I can't get away from it.\n\nSo how much of Roysta is a character?\n\nI'd say about 80% is a character; just small bits of my personality creep in. I'm always quite worried when people meet me and they're shocked that I'm not like Roysta. I'm saying, \"well, you can't actually think I'm fucking like him; I'd be in prison for fuck sake.\"\n\nSo is it fair to say that the character of Roysta hates everything?\n\nHe's soaked in nihilism. He's offensive for the sake of being offensive. It doesn't really work anymore though. Everyone just thinks it's funny now.\n\nSo you actively set out to be offensive?\n\nYes. When I first started recording I just wanted to be pissing people off. At the very start it was really fucking pornographic as well. It used to be I'd make music for certain pockets of people who I knew would like it, and pockets of people who I knew would be offended by it. But I don't really do that anymore, now I'm just making music that I want to hear.\n\nAre there any topics you won't touch?\n\nI've actively cut out all the misogynistic shit, I didn't want people to think I actually hated women. I used to do really homophobic stuff as well, but then I realized I was a faggot so I can't do that anymore either hahaha!\n\nSo you've been doing the character of Roysta for nearly ten years, what's the worst thing to come out of \"being Roysta\"?\n\nThe worst thing is definitely my health. I've got asthma from smoking too much, stomach ulcer, gallstones and a fucking air bubble in my brain at one point.\n\nAn air bubble?!\n\nYeah, I'd been partying, doing loads of coke and stuff, then the next few days I couldn't sleep and my eyes were fixed. When I turned my head, my eyes would stay in the same place. So I had to go for a CAT-scan and they found a bubble. But it hasn't left me with any side effects really, my brains all right\u2026 at least I hope it is.\n\nShit. You actually quit Roysta for a while back in 2006, was that motivated by health concerns?\n\nI was trying to rein in the partying and all that in so I gave up Roysta. I ended up going to Glasgow for a gig as a favor to a friend. We all ended up taking acid and Es and running around naked with some girls, climbing over cars and pulling wipers off like fucking feral monkeys. It was a three-day cocktail of drugs and nakedness, something changed in me.\n\nAnd this inspired you to turn back to Roysta?\n\nIt wasn't so much it inspired me, it was more , I thought \"this needs documented\", there was enough material for the whole of the next Roysta album.\n\nIt's clear that a lot of your lyrics are inspired by your lifestyle. Like, your song \"Eat The Evidence\" was about mephedrone right?\n\nThat song dated faster than the drug. As soon as I released it, everyone realized how shit it was and stopped doing it. It's essentially become a historical comment on a drug.\n\nHa. OK, what's your favorite drug?\n\nLate 90s Es, back when you could take one and you'd be set for the night and you loved everyone.\n\nAnd the worst?\n\nHeroin. It was fucking horrible. I only did it the once. I was in Glasgow and I thought to myself \"when in Rome.\"\n\nSo what do you do when you're not making music or partying. Is it true you only watch Colombo?\n\nI don't have a TV anymore but when I did I fucking loved Colombo! Bargain Hunt too, Tim Wonnacaught is fucking legend."}

{"text": "08 January 2007\n\nHARDHITTING MUSIC CRITICISM IN 2007\n\nThis Canadian writer Robertson Davies, I just finished his 1985 novel called What's Bred In The Bone, which tells start-to-finish the life of one Francis Cornish, a rich guy who does low-level spywork for his dayjob but what he really loves is painting. Part of his comeup is mimicking the Old Master works stroke for stroke, figuring out their techniques and then applying them to his own paintings--so he's practically an Old Master painter, but living in a post-WWI art world sent into shock by cubism and friends. There's this one scene (and this is starting to sound like a Status Ain't Hood post I know but bear with me) when Cornish exposes what's purported to be Hubertus van Eyck's heretofore neverseen \"Harrowing of Hell\" as a forgery, and all the art critics who were previously praising \"Harrowing\" for its transporting beauty and its emotional depth suddenly changed horses, \"If it's modern, then whatever, fuck this painting, etc.\" Sort of like a reverse Mike Jones, or an upside-down Yung Joc.\n\nAnyway I finished this book the same day Dan Balis from Brooklyn disco band Escort sent me his latest release, \"A Bright New Life.\" My support for this band is well-documented, and \"Starlight\" was my favorite song of 2006, though I know I was living cognitively dissonant. I've struggled a bunch both publicly and privately with the point of semi-fascist throwback acts-- Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings, Metro Area, Earl Greyhound, Escort, Jamie Lidell, Nomo, Antibalas, that \"Spanky\" band Joe Tangari likes, the list goes on-- and normally I said something to the extent that \"we can enjoy this semi-fascist throwback stuff but we can't reward it critically, it's not of this age, it's riding the coat-tails of certain stylized nostalgia X [heavy funk, disco, Motown, Led Zeppelin, etc.] which has had decades to accrue meaning over time, etc\" which is super-silly and insider because really all it has to do with numerical ratings and topten rankings. My bit was normally met with arguments of \"I listen not for novelty but for craft, and reward well-made songs, so fuck off\" or that brand of \"I like what I like!\" anti-critical bullshit that has no business masquerading as definitive review. Rootless music is impossible, but at least try to do something new, was my understanding; I point to my LCD Soundsystem interview as a good starting point for moving talks of \"innovation\" from composition to production, or rather understanding music's vertical space as fertile, unbroken ground.\n\nBut Christ that's a lot of work just to say, yeah, I like what I like, isn't it. This new Escort 12\" is fantastic: \"Bright New Life\" thumps steady in octaves while the singer rambles moodily and uncertainly, strings drag then get cagey as the chorus nears, then BAM all that empty space in the verse is filled with this huge horn-heavy chorus and performative \"a briyut newww life.\" It's smart songwriting, the stylized diction is perfect, all the instrumental buildups are taut, not a note out of place, no smirk in sight.\n\nI remember hearing this song both times I saw the band live and thinking to myself that they really love playing disco out--love the acrobat-like thrill of playing such soulful music so note-for-note, so tightly wound. There's such an energy to that restraint, maybe the reason I'll always prefer James Brown, who micromanaged like a motherfucker, over George Clinton, who just let it all hang out. Beside the point. What I'm tasked with once again is making it OK for me to like this song. Without being all fuckitall about it, or just ridiculously pedantic, it's really tough.\n\nSo Davies. There's this part where the guy who forged \"Harrowing of Hell\" gives this whiny but basically hardhitting semi-extended monologue that calls, basically, for absolute criticism, criticism without heed to context--and from there, calling for absolute art, art that needs no context to be understood. Again, it's all impossible, but what my good friend The Internet has done is afford more opportunities for contextless artmaking and appraisal, which brings up the usual questions: Why do genres die? Was it who, or what, that killed disco? I mean to an extent I wonder how much of it is supply/demand, and from there how much of it is merely supply, access, presence. I'm sure one of those new books about disco has an answer too. But how much of this is a function of industry machinery? Out with the old, in with the new, etc.?\n\nIn other words, if we pretend criticism can help or hinder the newness of new music (it can't; for another time), the reason it's OK to reward semi-fascist throwbacks critically is because positive appraisals doesn't impede new music from coming along. I can see how it would have gotten pretty annoying if everybody kept drawing the same fucking Nativity scene over and over again, and there's limited space in museums and art galleries and so on, and the voraciousness of music consumers and art buyers in general all but demands the new, but all's to say I'm relieved not to be such a crank about this stuff all the time now.\n\nroughly, fascist anachronism re an aesthetic (here late 70s/early 80s highly stylized disco boogie, with no acknowledgement of the present day) but self-actualized, not topdown (i.e. this sort of fascism is a choice)\n\nthe semi- is misleading, you're right. i should left it as fascist-like or sorta-fascist. also i owe you a sonic youth email"}

Because on this album, Neige (the brain behind the band) pushes the black-metal elements to the background, making way for progrock and melodic metal elements.

Well, yeah, actually! For fans of: Ghost Brigade, Agalloch, Anathema, anything with Neige playing in it\n\nIn essence, Mark Van Hoen (an Englishman, not a Dutchie) is an ambient artist. But he always balanced on the line of ambient. And this album seems to cross it. Take 'Don't Look Back' for instance. It's more a dark eclectic avant-techno, than ambient, isn't it? It's pretty indescribable what music Van Hoen does make here, but what would you expect from a founding member of UK electro-shoegaze pioneers Seefeel and, later, Locust and Scala?\nOh, and the pretty awesome album-art is by Stephen O'Malley of Sunn0))).

{"text": "Wednesday, August 31, 2011\n\nIf I'm given a choice between punk and New Wave, I'll take New Wave every time. But how about bands like the Buzzcocks, and the Only Ones, and the Undertones, who straddle the divide and then throw in a bunch of addictive poppy hooks to rein in the alienation just a bit? Canada's Diodes were one of the best of these hybrid outfits. You can find their songs on both punk and power pop compilations. It might be that their split personality, which defied easy categorization, was the reason they remained so obscure. They remind me of another very good and somewhat obscure Canadian band, the Barracudas, who were one part punk, one part pop, at home in neither camp, and so a stranger in both. Music that's difficult to label might be more interesting than easily identifiable product, but it also makes the stuff much more difficult to mass market. Too bad for the Diodes. I like their sound a lot, even if it's punky 'tude takes things a bit outside my normal crotchety comfort zone.

{"text": "Dusted Reviews\n\nTimeless, in all senses\n\nMythology has a strange power to reinvent itself constantly. Its characters are broadly drawn archetypes and its dramatic action takes place in a sort of pre-anything non-time, and it's exactly this formlessness that allows stories older than written history to stay relevant each time humanity burns another temporal bridge. It's also very likely why M. Ward's music is enchanting in such an inexplicable way: his third (or fourth) full-length, Transfiguration of Vincent, doesn't seem to belong to any particular time. The lyrics teem with kittens and killer whales, lovelorn fools and dying heroes, the instrumentation sounds neither modern nor overly antiquated, and lord knows the songs themselves could have been around for generations.\n\nThe first thing you hear is crickets. To the extent that you can imagine M. Ward sitting at a campfire somewhere in the middle of the eternal summer night, staring down at his guitar and ignoring everything else, they offer the perfect introduction, as does the rest of \"Transfiguration #1.\" The first of a few thematic instrumentals, it acts as the album's exposition, previewing each native element one by one \u2013 the neatly picked guitar, a hint of organ, whispered drums, harmonica, barroom piano \u2013 but it's not until the first proper song, \"Vincent O'Brien,\" that the introduction concludes with Ward's inscription: \"He only sings when he's sad / And he's sad all the time / So he sings the whole night through / Yeah, he sings in the daytime too.\"\n\nAs Transfiguration continues, it settles into an innocent, soulful meander, trading shades of quiet now and then without ever rising much above a whisper. The difference between the slow melancholy of \"Undertaker\" and \"Involuntary\" and the restrained excitement on \"Helicopter\" is usually the instrumentation; at his simplest, Ward says enough with only the guitar and his throaty croon, but the well-placed bout of faint organ or rudimentary drumming helps to create the occasional moment of low-key frenzy. Now and then some of the sparser songs recall the earliest of Ward's fellow Portland native Elliott Smith (especially on interludes like \"Duet for Guitars #3\"), while the dry, windblown sound of California friends Giant Sand and Grandaddy appears in the fuzzy distortion of \"Outta My Head.\" Though the most specific reference to geography is \"I am somewhere in the city,\" the west coast influence is at least palpable.\n\nBut even if you can nearly tell where it's all from, Ward never lets on when. If anything, Transfiguration is more old than new; you might swear that \"Sad, Sad Song\" and \"Dead Man\" (just to name two) were word-of-mouth folk spirituals \u2013 considering ever-repeated couplets like \"Dead man, dead man, don't cry / When you die it ain't the end / It ain't the end when you die\". What you have here is the exact opposite of a period piece: it's new but it feels old, it's here but it's nowhere, it's now but it's forever. Whatever, wherever, and whenever it is, though, it's lovely."}

{"text": "Music Review: Loreena McKennitt - A Mediterranean Odyssey\n\nIt doesn't happens very often (and too bad for that!), but there are times when you hear a piece of music, a guitar, or a voice for the first time and the whole world seems to drop away for that moment. During the days of radio, this had the tendency to ruin the music obsessive's day: if the timing was just right, a wait of up to an hour or more in the car would be required. Before things like satellite radio, we had to rely on the DJ to back-announce the previous set.\n\nThis is exactly what happened to me the first time I heard Loreena McKennitt. During the last few minutes of my morning commute, a local college radio station played her version of \"She Moved Through The Fair\" from Elemental. Those slightly ominous bells and that angelic voice sent me off to another world, one where informative disc jockeys didn't wait too long to fill in the missing information.

{"text": "Dusted Reviews\n\nThe nine songs that comprise Parisian quartet Cyann & Ben's Spring, if translated into visual form, would probably look something like the swarm of insects on the album's cover: although they ultimately work together to create a unified mass, they seem to be swirling in all directions at once, never quite settling down into a comfortably identifiable form. Despite the fact that most tracks employ guitar, analog synth, and vocals, Cyann & Ben certainly aren't a \"rock\" band, nor are they comparable to other lo-fi synth-driven ensembles. If anything, they recall the slow-building post-rock of Mogwai and Godspeed! You Black Emperor, but in a more rustic and psychedelic form. Like many of their songs, they seem to be many things at once, but ultimately transcend any recognizable influences to create a sound that is genuinely novel and intriguing, and very hard to pin down at times.\n\nSpring's disorienting quality can probably be attributed to the fact that while most of the tracks suggest a traditional song structure (vocal melody line, a discernable pattern of repeated sections), they don't end up fulfilling it: instead of going from point A to B to Z, as we might expect, the music seems to spread out like a pool of oil on the ground. \"I Can't Pretend Anymore,\" despite commencing with a simple synth arpeggio and melody line, eventually melts into seemingly random bits of ambient sound, which in turn segue into the following track, \"Siren Song.\" Probably the most effective piece on the album, \"Siren Song\" combines an arpeggiated electric guitar figure that recalls The Bends-era Radiohead with synth bass and jazz-inflected drumming, and climaxes with a doubled guitar and synth melody that could have been lifted from a Morricone score. On the whole, however, particular song structures are less important to the album's success than a sustained mood or atmosphere. Spring is invariably downtempo, creating a sense of melancholy and meditation that finds a comfortable counterpart in the almost exclusively minor-key melodies.\n\nDespite their prominence, the vocals add little to the overall effect, given that they're rarely intelligible (due to strong French accents). When the words can be made out, they tend to seem incongruously unrestrained and fanciful in contrast to the music (\"the wind unicorn is waiting for you in the light of the moon!\"). This however, matters little, as the vocals serve more as instruments than as a means for verbal communication.\n\nSpring can be a frustrating listen. Its sprawling, structurally-convoluted songs can seem a bit arbitrary at first, and often times sound as though they could be pared down to a more conventional form. Repeated listens, however, reveal an underlying flow that has little regard for immediate accessibility and gratification. Prostrate headphone listening may be the best way to take in Cyann & Ben; Spring will ultimately reward those who can assume the same reflective and attentive mindset with which it was made."}
{"text": "Artists:\n\nFind it at:\n\nMusic from this release\n\nThe realization that a great band has made a terrible record marks the point of pivot where you stop thinking about what's happening as a listener and turn into something like a forensics expert asking, \"what happened?\" The best case scenario is that an outside pathogen is to blame, a failed genre experiment, an ill-fitting producer, drugs. These are the things cult classics and critical reclamation projects are made of. The inside jobs are far more painful to endure-- records such as Travis Morrison's Travistan, Weezer's Make Believe, the Smashing Pumpkins' MACHINA/The Machines of God and the Streets' The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living that clearly couldn't have been made by anyone but their creators, but where the same qualities responsible for such individual and affecting works of art have completely turned on their owners. Mumps, etc. is of the latter variety, an often unlistenable album from WHY?, a group whose music is often excellent.\n\nIt might sound counterintuitive to claim that restraint would've worked to WHY?'s benefit here. A large part of the appeal of records like Alopecia and Eskimo Snow was that they let Yoni Wolf run rampant lyrically and emotionally, all while his band exploded the boundaries that would have kept them in either indie rock, hip-hop, or even \"indie rap.\" No matter what Wolf was going on about-- masturbation, his bowel movements, any number of ex-girlfriends-- his extremism was tethered by relatable emotions and strong hooks. Whether it was the result of taking an unusually long time off between records or not, Wolf has sunk even further into himself, but not to discover some sort of deeper truth about the human condition. Instead, a sizable portion of Mumps, etc. turns out to be a longform rumination on what it means to be Yoni Wolf, Lead Singer of WHY?.\n\nDoesn't matter if it's The Wall or from the perspective of a guy who admits, \"I make decent cash, I'm a minor star,\" as Wolf does on \"Sod in the Seed\"; the \"lot of the touring musician\" album has a great track record of establishing the frightening point when an artist feels entitled to a listener's empathy despite having their most distorted sense of self. Yet it's not unthinkable for Wolf to find pathos in this scenario, since at WHY?'s level of success, \"how can I keep this up?\" is more a crisis of relatable age and economic concerns rather than that of a poor lil' rich boy in a gilded cage. But it's nearly impossible to find Wolf's situation interesting because I'm not sure he thinks it is either.\n\nHe repeatedly references the end of his \"rap career\" as something of a given and bemoans its terrible mundanity-- \"I can't sleep in rental cars or airlines/ Yo, and so I keep the deck of cards for downtime.\" Either that, or he gets lost in impenetrable metaphor as a means of distracting from that mundanity. During the sickly mariachi lurch of \"White English\", Wolf engages in impressive verbal gymnastics in order to avoid saying what he actually means, and it's summed up by its diffident hook: \"Lost in translation.\" Same for \"Thirst\", which introduces potentially loaded metaphors about black cowboys and discarded porn-stuffed G4 motherboards without delving far enough into their symbolism; when Wolf pleads, \"He will always thirst like that/ He will thirst like that always,\" it fails to register. He might thirst like that, but how the hell are we supposed to know what \"that\" means?\n\nBut when really getting to the bottom of why Mumps, etc. often sounds like it wasn't subject to outside QC, it isn't so much about Wolf's lyrical inscrutability but rather that long stretches of the record are just really fucking hard to listen to. Musically, it's perfectly fine and a logical dovetailing of Alopecia's sharp hybrid of hip-hop and indie rock with Eskimo Snow's forays into post-rock and folk, if maybe sidling a little too close to the sort of Danger Mouse-style pop-hop it knows it can't be.\n\nAnd that's because Wolf has completely lost a grip on judging his own vocals. They've always been an acquired taste for sure, and on Alopecia and Eskimo Snow, Wolf showed a canny command of his various modes of monotone, staggered rapping, heartsick crooning that packed unorthodox pop smarts. As Wolf attempts a more perfect union of those various modes, he ends up with a hybrid that somehow manages to bring all of his most grating qualities to the fore, to the point where the actual words of a line like \"when I got better from the mumps, yes-- my swollen nut and neck shrunk\" are the least objectionable thing about it.\n\nCombatively nasal, all jagged edges and botched notes, Wolf makes an irreversible, disheartening slide into Borscht Belt jokes about his advancing age (\"I'm in decline/ But women like be jockin' still/ 'Cause I rhyme with skill and talk so chill and youthful\"), retreating hairline (\"Girls used to fawn over my locks-to-kill/ Now the girls are gone and I'm on Minoxidil\") or inescapable whiteness (\"Rockin' soccer socks and sandals like, 'yeah, bro.'\") . Technically catchy but irritating all the same, \"Jonathan's Hope\" and \"Strawberries\" are the inexplicable singles, and as Wolf sings brutal rhymes such as, \"Slow pitching like a Vatican priest to be pope-- what? Dope,\" or, \"Your mom she sits while her hair is in curlers/ Smokes weed and listens to that Garrison Keillor/ That's how I'll live when I quit my rap career,\" there isn't so much of a melody as a curdling effect taking place in Wolf's mouth, like he's having an allergic reaction to his own lyrics. There too are remnants of Anticon.'s willfully arrhythmic approach to hip-hop on \"Jonathan's Hope\" and \"Paper Hearts\", the latter of which might be the most unpleasant song of 2012. A noxious merger of topic, content, and delivery, Wolf cruelly describes a failed romantic encounter in flagrante: \"She's cute with little titties and a sense of humor/ But to tell you the truth sir, I pity the poor fool-- her,\" and, \"During sex I might put us in some joke positions/ But it's scary always how we end up in mission...airy like the daring men who fight to submission,\" aren't even the half of it. While there's no such thing as TMI in WHY? songs, it's nigh inconceivable to imagine someone listening to this for enjoyment.\n\nAt the very least, Mumps, etc. creates a new wrinkle in discussing what \"career suicide\" can really mean. It's usually attributed to albums so off the grid that fans will inevitably refuse to follow, yet those always strike me as a cry for help, a need to trigger a reaction. But I don't think that's the case here. Mumps, etc. does have its moments that remind you how WHY? have always been a trial by fire that demands and often rewards intense loyalty that can't be shaken easily. On the contrary, Mumps, etc. sounds like WHY? reading their own eulogy. Sure, Wolf claims, \"I'll hold my own death as a card in the deck/ To be played when there are no other cards left,\" on the closing song, but \"Exegesis\" ended Alopecia making the same exact threats, so make your own \"cry Wolf\" joke if you must. It's just that so much of Mumps, etc. thinks of itself in the future tense, having already given up the fight. Even beyond Wolf's decidedly pessimistic take on his current occupation, most of the songs on Mumps, etc. just seem to opt out of delivering hooks when they could or should and meekly tap out before three minutes.\n\nBut to really get to the heart of Mumps, etc.'s despondence,you have to look at \"Distance\", paradoxically the most musically accomplished and lyrically affecting song here. The sighing strings are a bit manipulative when Wolf says, \"I gotta keep my distance to withstand the silence of you missing when you're not there to listen to this nonsense,\" yet it's a real moment of resonance, and you're just left to wonder why such a typically candid lyricist took so long to get to the point. The structure of \"Distance\" would lead you to believe \"men and women might yet quote his modicum of the truth/ But never will they get right close to Jonathan Avram Wolf\" is the money quote, but it already happened. Because while Mumps, etc. expresses that Wolf is too in touch with his emotions to not potentially have great art left in him, it's just that I'm not sure even he believes WHY? is the best place for him to work it out anymore."}

He's best when he fronts \"Red Dress,\" full of haunting banjo and repeating phrases that take on new meaning with each recitation. While Davis holds onto syllables for just that extra beat to warble a twang, Nye's husky and tired and pained.\n\nThey make quite a combo, these two. Bluegrassers are always murdering their cheating women and falling down wells of despair, and you wonder how much of it is a put-on. Perhaps it should be troubling that I never doubted the Coloradas for a second"}

Except of course, for the fact that there is also apparently a metal band under the same moniker.\n\nSeriously though, it's not exactly surprising that they're ridiculously cute and sound like they're smiling through their teeth while recording, but sometimes that's exactly the sort of thing you need. Perfect for when you need to cheer up a little."}

You could go on The Voice I suppose but let's be honest that's not really going to get you anywhere seeing as IT'S ALL ABOUT THE VOICE etc etc.\n\nDragonette are brilliant and this is their first single in a million moons, certainly since their hookup with Martin Solveig on 'Hello'. Yes THAT 'Hello'. 'Let It Go' is just an extremely ruddy good pop song that'll make you throw shapes. You won't even want to, it'll just happen anyway. That is how good this song is.

This band was Mental As Anything. They started off just for a fun side project, and since have developed into a strong band that has lasted for over 30 years now. They create some very interesting songs at times, and I am occasionally reminded of the sounds of Oingo Boingo (though still not quite as wacky) when listening to them. This song comes off of their 2005 album, \"Plucked\". They have a lot of releases, as you can imagine (almost 33 years worth of them). So I recommend doing what I did, and checking out their 2009 compilation album, \"Essential As Anything\"."}

There's a cute wierdness to Pamela's aesthetic -- and I like it."}
{"text": "Upon listening to Chet Faker's 'Thinking In Textures', I felt a mixture of love, loss and sexual frustation. I realise that's a strange combination but as one kind YouTube user put it, Chet Faker's music is \"baby making music\". Pure and simple, the fusion of electronica soul combined with personal tales of romance and tragedy just make you want to combat that bottle of tequila and do some seriously naughty things. But instead of regretting your actions in the morning, just press play on 'Thinking In Textures' and you've instantly got a reasonable explanation for the person in your bed and the scratch marks on their back.\n\nNormally, that situation would make you feel cheap and, if that person is particularly on the unattractive side, full of regret. However, 'No Diggity' is the perfect soundtrack to change that regret into ecstasy. Hey, you just got laid! 'No Diggity' reminds you of all the positives that can be found amongst the dirty residue of the morning after the night before. You'll be dancing around your bedroom in your pants in no time, I promise you.\n\n\"I'm Into You' and 'Cigarettes and Chocolate' are best listened to when the sun is shining and you're walking over London Bridge, overlooking the River Thames. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure you could listen to these songs elsewhere but for me; they worked best in that situation. There's something largely enjoyable about listening to these songs through headphones, strolling across such a beautiful setting. While everybody else was hurrying around me, desperate to reach their destination with their only soundtrack being London buses driving past, I took great pleasure in knowing that during the 5.24 minutes that 'Cigarettes and Chocolate' played for, I literally had no cares in the world, except for wanting to know just how great music like this is made.\n\n'Terms and Conditions' and 'Love and Feeling' caught my attention instantly. These songs sums up the E.P in a simple 8 minutes and captures Chet Faker's sound perfectly; they're possibly the songs that imprisons Chet Faker's personal tales the best. They're honest, the lyrics fit brilliantly with the music and while his beard disguises his identity, these songs expose Chet Faker's character immediately.\n\nThere couldn't be a more perfect end to the E.P than 'Solo Sunrise' and 'Everything I Wanted\" \u2013 they combine the night before, the morning after and the feelings that come with both situations. As the E.P finishes, you're left with a feeling that only the actions from the night before can encapsulates but at the same time, you're also left with the bittersweet memories that the morning after brings. That tiny feeling of regret you're feeling? Blame it on the E.P ending, that's exactly what I'm doing.\nThis E.P is perfect for those that like particularly awkward situations, sunshine and really fucking good music."}
{"text": "Captain Beefheart\n\nMy entry into the amazing, frightening world of Don Van Vilet came via The Fall, who covered \"Beatle Bones & Smokin' Stones\" on an early Peel session. I didn't understand Trout Mask Replica when I first heard it, in much the same way that I didn't understand 70s Miles Davis records or Public Image Limited's Metal Box. It didn't fit into anything I would have conceived as \"music\" back then. It was all weird angles and uncomfortable shapes.\n\nYears later, I bought a nice double-disc Beefheart comp, The Dust Blows Forward, and it all finally clicked. Not just the stuff from the titanically influential Trout Mask Replica, but the later less-well-known stuff as well. Cuts from Doc At The Radar Station and Ice Cream For Crow seemed, in retrospect, to cast a huge shadow along the post-punkers and underground music of my 80s youth.\n\nIn prose form, here's why Captain Beefheart was one of a kind - his 10 Commandments Of Guitar Playing:\n\n1. Listen to the birds\n\nThat's where all the music comes from. Birds know everything about how it should sound and where that sound should come from. And watch hummingbirds. They fly really fast, but a lot of times they aren't going anywhere.\n\n2. Your guitar is not really a guitar\n\nYour guitar is a divining rod. Use it to find spirits in the other world and bring them over. A guitar is also a fishing rod. If you're good, you'll land a big one.\n\n3. Practice in front of a bush\n\nWait until the moon is out, then go outside, eat a multi-grained bread and play your guitar to a bush. If the bush doesn't shake, eat another piece of bread.\n\n4. Walk with the devil\n\nOld Delta blues players referred to guitar amplifiers as the \"devil box.\" And they were right. You have to be an equal opportunity employer in terms of who you're brining over from the other side. Electricity attracts devils and demons. Other instruments attract other spirits. An acoustic guitar attracts Casper. A mandolin attracts Wendy. But an electric guitar attracts Beelzebub.\n\n5. If you're guilty of thinking, you're out\n\nIf your brain is part of the process, you're missing it. You should play like a drowning man, struggling to reach shore. If you can trap that feeling, then you have something that is fur bearing.\n\n6. Never point your guitar at anyone\n\nYour instrument has more clout than lightning. Just hit a big chord then run outside to hear it. But make sure you are not standing in an open field.\n\n7. Always carry a church key\n\nThat's your key-man clause. Like One String Sam. He's one. He was a Detroit street musician who played in the fifties on a homemade instrument. His song \"I Need a Hundred Dollars\" is warm pie. Another key to the church is Hubert Sumlin, Howlin' Wolf's guitar player. He just stands there like the Statue of Liberty \u2014 making you want to look up her dress the whole time to see how he's doing it.\n\n8. Don't wipe the sweat off your instrument\n\nYou need that stink on there. Then you have to get that stink onto your music.\n\n9. Keep your guitar in a dark place\n\nWhen you're not playing your guitar, cover it and keep it in a dark place. If you don't play your guitar for more than a day, be sure you put a saucer of water in with it.\n\n10. You gotta have a hood for your engine\n\nKeep that hat on. A hat is a pressure cooker. If you have a roof on your house, the hot air can't escape. Even a lima bean has to have a piece of wet paper around it to make it grow.\n\nRemember seeing him on SNL when I was a very small and impressionable child and my older brother home from college saying it was the coolest thing ever, and me wondering just what the hell was going on.\n\nFew artists have had a bigger impact on rock and roll as we know it today.

{"text": "Kindness: An Artistic Undertaking\n\nIt of his debut album, World, You Need A Change of Mind, under the moniker Kindness.\n\nIn the video for \"Gee Up,\" the first single off of World, Bainbridge sits on the set for the production of the video. Assistants make awkward sexual advances. A francophone Exec rants. Bainbridge himself even steps out of from behind his artistic fa\u00e7ade, holding up the record and announcing its release date. In doing so, he acknowledges the murky line between art and consumerism.\n\nBut that's not the strangest moment of the movie. As two men talk on the set, one states, \"I kind of like it. Lo-fi with hi-fi values.\" \"Would've been better two years ago though, wouldn't it have?\" the other responds.\n\nThis is notable because Kindness' music doesn't relate to a specific genre or sound\u2013-lo-fi or hi-fi-\u2013nor does it harken to any one time period. For an album that lasts only forty minutes, World, You Need A Change of Mind covers a lot of ground. There's the funky disco of \"Doigsong,\" akin to Toro y Moi. There's a cover of the Replacements (\"Swinging Party\") and the EastEnders theme, \"Anyone Can Fall in Love.\"\n\nDespite such concrete references, as a whole, World, You Need A Change of Mind works incredibly well as a singular piece of music. The album floats by like a hazy Spring day lost somewhere between coffee and joints. Bainbridge effortlessly transcends genres and eras with a wide range of sounds and ideas from the ironically gentle thwomp of the bass on \"House\" to the catchy female hook of \"That's Alright.\"\n\nIt can be frustrating when artists such as Brainbridge and Kindness lack an easily identified style or objective. Like a rock climbing wall devoid of any holds or a roadmap with no roads, a direction may be unclear. Sometimes though, it's better to step back and admire the piece as a whole, such as with World, You Need A Change of Mind, an album so lush and beautiful, yet so short, that it takes you on a ride and delivers you exactly where you want to be, whether you know it or not"}
{"text": "We built our own studio in between Boxer and making High Violet, so it was the first time we really had a creative workshop environment where we could try lots of different things out. In some ways, that meant really working on the arrangements a lot. There's a couple of them, \"England\" or \"Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks,\" that are probably the biggest orchestral arrangements on records that we've ever done. Then there's other elements where the opposite is true as well. From the minute we started working on the record, we recorded everything. There's a lot of sounds on there that are almost more improvised.\n\nBoxer has a really elegant, almost minimalist aesthetic to it, where it's very spare and kind of restrained - High Violet does have a lot more of these spontaneous moments or sounds that we kept, that we like so much. The beginning of the record -- some people complained about how fuzzy the guitar tone is on \"Terrible Love.\" To us, it was a sound we had envisioned but never had been able to achieve. In a way, it's like an accidental guitar tone that we were able to keep.\n\nDo you think [these complaints are] also a reflection [of how] after Boxer, people had a lot of expectations for you? It's definitely a very anticipated record.\nWhen Boxer came out, there was a huge Internet war that followed, where people were fighting about whether Alligator or Boxer, which one was better - specifically I think Alligator is more of a rock record, and Boxer is much more restrained. High Violet, how that fits with those two - I don't know. To me, they're a trilogy of records that are related that change, morph and develop the band's sound, it's not like it's a massive left turn. In our own way, we're trying to keep ourselves interested and push ourselves musically on each record - and define certain things that are different."}

'She Is The Wave' is nasty electronica, 'Egypt' has some soaring, looped vocals and 'Anomaly' is based around what sounds like a lost Pet Shop Boys hook. If you'd like your mind to stay where it is thanks, avoid the way-too-busy 'Live Forever' and 'Lost In Everyone', which sounds like a Thom Yorke leftover.

And it's called bells.\n\nArtrockers,\nBack in 1990 Orbital's single Chime did an amazing thing, it charted. And suddenly the radio-waves were home to a sublime piece of rave culture, a wonderfully light interpretation of church bells pealing.\n\nI don't know how much time you've spent listening to bell ringers, but the sound they produce makes Gamelan sound simple, and compared to traditional British bell ringing it is. It all starts out sensible enough, cascading notes and back to the top again, but at some point it goes completely nuts and everything seems to crash into everything else and the whole becomes a swirling cacophony - lovely but nuts.\n\nWhenever I hear it my first thought is: 'What are these guys on?'

So, if you're really into some weird shit I'd recommend popping down to St. Jude's this Sunday and tripping out to the weirdest shit ever.\n\nWhat we need is more bell ringing at the festivals, it would remove the need for mind bending substances completely, so we wouldn't be constantly harassed by people who think they're unicorns, it's such a bore.

{"text": "More About\n\nIMAGINE IF LIZ Phair couldn't write, sing, or play...if Kate Moss's \"brain-dead tadpole\" persona (as Greil Marcus once referred to it) were transmuted to the audio realm...if Cat Stevens were somehow even more dunced-out and felt even sorrier for himself than usual. Then say hello to the wonderful world of Chan Marshall, a.k.a. indie-pop sensation Cat Power.\n\nTo be fair, Marshall has given the world one hell of a catch phrase. The name \"Cat Power\" promises something: It's sharp, sexy, menacing. It's light on its feet and it keeps you on edge.\n\nUnfortunately, upon playing the records, listeners immune to Marshall's hype soon figure out that \"Cat\" is short for \"catatonic.\" The singer doesn't usually raise her voice above a whisper. Occasionally, when she's feeling feisty, she cultivates a hollowed-out bellow that seems meant to convince us how deeply she's hurting inside. (It mostly serves notice that she needs to get out of the house more often.)\n\n\"Power,\" meanwhile, would seem to evoke Marshall's stubborn refusal to cultivate a mood other than petulant crabbiness. Neither pissed off at the world nor brokenhearted--\"She plays the difficult parts and I play difficult,\" she once sang--Marshall's is the voice of the trust-fund brat who has forgotten to take today's Prozac and is making you, the innocent bystander, pay for her misery.\n\nBeing unable to leave well enough alone is the mark of a true passive-aggressive, and Marshall now moves on from her own bad compositions--dumped on 1996's What Would the Community Think and 1998's Moon Pix--to foist her shtick onto the works of others. In truth, The Covers Album (Matador) does find her sounding far less agitated than usual: There are even moments, such as her zither-accompanied take on Phil Phillips's golden oldie \"Sea of Love,\" where her tongue is far enough inside her cheek to make the joke hum. But the rest of the new album feels like a conceptual exercise hinging on Marshall's uncanny ability to make every song she sings sound exactly the same, from the folk number \"Kingsport Town\" to the Rolling Stones' \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.\" One and all, they sound like Mazzy Star arranged for bad folk guitar, like Low stripped of ideas, like a broken humidifier.\n\nThe tone is set by \"Satisfaction,\" a double-whammy of an opening number that's both emotionally and sonically stunted--Cat Power's trademark--by a vintage performance-art-style trick. See, Marshall's version--wink wink, nudge nudge--eliminates the song's signature riff and chorus! And given that the vocalist's entire style rests upon her sucking the air out of everything she sings until it's as flat as a crepe--boy, can't you just smell the sacrilege? Isn't the whole thing just clever as all hell?!\n\nNo, it's not. It's so obvious it's embarrassing. And Marshall's retooling reveals nothing about the song. Sure, she makes it sound callow and savagely mocking; so did Mick Jagger. But who needs \"Satisfaction\" when you're already as self-satisfied as Cat Power? On that song and elsewhere, The Covers Record amounts to a declaration of Chan Marshall's superiority to everything she touches. Why sully herself by actually attempting to do anything with these songs when she can just play the same two chords for all of them and moan distractedly?\n\nFor all the reverence Cat Power receives from disaffected art students, her posture as an artist whose soul is so fragile that it threatens to break in front of her audience may be the most purely showbiz conceit alt-rock has produced in years. Eat your heart out, Marilyn Manson."}
{"text": "Tools\n\nThe pedal steel guitar is music's accent mark: In country, it sighs and moans, matching a singer's despair with notes that hang in empty, desolate space. Or it can shoot up in quick little licks, dousing a bucolic beat in flammable spirits. In rock, it's a gilding texture, filling space with a tone that's less blunt than an organ and more nuanced than a six-string's predictable moves. The well-played pedal steel is often sterling, rarely the star.\n\nTyranny is more of a surefooted first step than an innovative introductory leap. Subtly arranged and exquisitely played, it proves that this quartet has both the skills and the smarts to push steel-led instrumentals beyond curio status. Elkins' lines are as memorable as they are elegant: \"Daylight Dies\" sits coolly in the distance, for instance, its lean melody as comfortable surrounded by a glow of electronics as it is gliding through Donohoe's late-arriving beat. Alternately, \"Crispy Hexagons\" is wiry and anxious, Elkins' steel canvassing Donohoe's manipulated drums and a keyboard's icy washes with mercurial variations.\n\nThough there's nothing wrong with these 47 minutes (perfectly enjoyable, without qualification), the presiding placidity makes for a listen that feels a tad circumscribed. You want Starmount to push the driving parts harder or to dive deeper into their drift (which they do on the pharmaceutical closer \"Bud\"). Perhaps those noise bursts on \"The Battle of Brentwood Creek\" could fight a bit more vigorously, or perhaps \"The Constable\" could capitalize a bit more selfishly on the climax that slips past its grasp. Or perhaps Starmount could just make another record, since, on their debut, muted and subtle wonders intrigue so often."}
{"text": "El-P\n\n(April 2007)\n\nInterview by Adam McKibbin\n\nHopefully, El-P will be a gateway drug for rap haters (hot topic on the Metacritic forum this week: \"Does rap suck or what?\"). The 32-year-old rapper has been distracted from his own music in recent years by his other gig: running Definitive Jux, one of the most-trusted names in underground hip-hop (Aesop Rock, Cannibal Ox, Murs). With I'll Sleep When You're Dead, he makes a triumphant return, sounding like he's been bottling up a lot of shit for the years since 2002's Fantastic Damage, and now he's ready to unload. He's a dominant personality, but also a team player\u2014the record is well-served by verses by Aesop Rock and Cage, as well as appearances by hip-hop staples like Cat Power, Trent Reznor, The Mars Volta, and Yo La Tengo's James McNew.\n\nAs El-P explains in this candid interview with The Red Alert, he set out to make an album documenting the human condition in modern times. The result is an inspired whirlwind of emotion and narrative, built on reliably premium beats and a Dennis Miller-like barrage of referenced pop culture and current events. There are some laughs, too, as when he asks for (and receives) The Dramatic Intro Machine on \"Smithereens (Stop Cryin).\" Mostly, though, I'll Sleep When You're Dead hits hard and lingers long, as on the brilliantly dense and bruising \"Tasmanian Pain Coaster,\" the fiery, anti-war declaration of \"Dear Sirs\" and the dystopian fiction of \"Habeas Corpus (Draconian Love).\"\n\nHow hard is it to strike the balance between artist and businessman? Is it unavoidable that the captain has to sacrifice personally, artistically speaking, for the good of the crew?\n\nYeah, I think it is. It's a different type of artistic existence. Somewhere along the line it stopped being all about me. Most artists exist in a world where it really is all about them all the time. That's just not the way it is for me\u2014but that's something I've grown to love. I like the selflessness of being involved with other people. But, yeah, I've had to push my career, to a degree, to the side in order to work with those other people. That's a choice. At the same time, you know, it's become part of my existence, and I can't imagine another way. I am incredibly excited to be doing my music again.\n\nDoes it affect your ability to be a fan, too? Even as a journalist, I find that it's pretty rare that I'm doing completely no-strings-attached listening anymore.\n\nYeah, you know, people always ask me \"What are you listening to right now? What's your Top Five of the month?\" It's like, \"Dude, I don't fucking know.\" (laughs) Once you've involved in the industry, it changes. You have an insider perspective\u2014you're a part of the machinery, to a degree, and it's much harder to see it from the outside. One of the things I look forward to is touring, because that's when I do my most hardcore music listening. That's when I get to zone out and be a fan again, because you've got hours and hours of driving and I'll just sit there and listen to my iPod for eight hours.\n\nDo you burn out on music altogether sometimes?\n\nUm\u2026sure, sure. No doubt. And I burn out on myself, definitely. But then I stop and I fucking splash some water on my face and I try to remember that this isn't that serious. This is something to enjoy and love, and it's a ridiculous gift to be involved in this.\n\nI think when you get to a point where you're involved in something that centers around the creative\u2014whether you're a professional journalist who covers it or a musician involved in it\u2014if you get to the point where you're not even open to being moved anymore, then maybe you should stop. You're not doing anyone any fucking good\u2014and you're just punishing yourself, because there's nothing more painful than being involved with something you used to love, but don't anymore. It's kind of like hanging out with your ex-girlfriend. (laughs) You know? Move on. That's kind of my attitude about it. There are a lot of journalists, even, who need to move the fuck on, and there damn sure are a lot of musicians. If I ever get to a point where I get that jaded or exhausted or am taking it all for granted, I just try to get inspired again, you know?\n\nI spend a lot of time bouncing between progressive political circles and indie/underground music circles\u2014and there's a lot of bitching in both of those worlds that nobody is writing any protest music anymore, nobody is plugged in to all the things that are going on, and so forth. Obviously they haven't heard a track like \"Dear Sirs.\" Do you think, though, that there aren't enough musicians stepping up to that plate, or is that misguided criticism?\n\nFirst of all, hip-hop is the only form of music that people are ever mad at for not being political. For some reason, rock music can completely exist outside of the pantheon of anything that's happening at any given time.\n\nBut I think punk rock falls into that category with hip-hop, too, though.\n\nWell, the criticism that gets leveled at hip-hop from all directions is that we're not supposed to take ourselves too seriously, but, at the same time, we're supposed to say serious things. We're not supposed to be violent, but we're not supposed to be soft\u2014because if you listen to emo hip-hop, then that means you're emo. We're not supposed to be political, because if we're political, then we're the \"political rapper.\" (laughs)\n\nTo me, my answer to the whole thing is \"Fuck all of you.\" I'm just one fucking man, trudging through the muck and mire of everyday existence. I have no intention of writing political records, but if my job is the eloquent translation of the human experience and I have half a brain about me and I'm taking in my surroundings, you're going to hear that in my music regardless of whether you consider me a political rapper\u2014you're going to hear it in a love story. My inspiration is these times, and that's the canvas I paint everything on.\n\nIn this record, what I wanted to do was if there were politics, they had to come from the personal, and not from some bullshit geopolitical perspective that I have. Who needs to hear about that from me? I really don't think that anybody needs to hear that El-P thinks that George Bush is an asshole. (laughs) I think it's pedantic and annoying when people stand on a pedestal. What I would rather do is eloquently document the psychological state of someone who is alive right now. If you can listen to that and take something from it without it being shoved into your face, then I'm doing my job. If we're not tuned into whatever it is\u2014love, pain, frustration, joy\u2014if we're not putting these things in our music, then we're not doing our job.\n\nBut I don't think that the burden is naturally put on any genre of music to be political. I think the burden should be to matter. If we're making music that doesn't even matter to us, then we may as well be put up against the wall when the revolution starts and shot in the back of the head because we're a fucking waste of resources, a bunch of assholes who walk around and don't have jobs, you know what I mean? Our only job, the only thing anyone is asking is to think a little bit more about your existence, think a little bit more about the experiences you're having, take a little bit more time to say something beautiful so you can translate it for us because we don't have the fucking time. You know? That's the only burden I feel.\n\nIt's interesting, too, because when these people talk about the good old days when people were making protest music or whatever, they often mention people who didn't even see themselves as political artists, like Bob Dylan. I've heard from a number of bands and rappers who essentially say \"Hey, I think you'll love my record because I hate George Bush.\" Well, great, but your songs suck!\n\nYeah, exactly! Any asshole can pick up a pencil and put it to music. We need to be connected to the human spirit, not the human politics. At our best, maybe we can affect the collective consciousness. I personally am too smart to try to waste everyone's time telling you things that you know more about.\n\nTo feel your album 100%, do you think the listener has to know New York, to have New York in their bones the way you do?\n\nI look at it like this: do you feel that way when you watch Taxi Driver?\n\nSure, a little bit.\n\nThen the answer is \"Yes.\" When I watch Taxi Driver, that shit reminds me of my childhood, so I have an extra perspective on a film that was so native to New York. When I watch Boyz N The Hood, I think it's a powerful movie, but I'm a little bit disconnected from the culture out there. I'm not making pop music, so my job is not to make everything for everyone. But that's the minutiae. The way I figured out how to make a record that connects to the most people possible is to make a record with complete disregard for trying to connect to anyone else but myself. (laughs) Because I don't think any of us are unique. We all understand pain, we all understand love, we all understand the human existence. The details may change, but the sentiment is the same.\n\nIn the early days of your career, what do you think paid off most for you? Because it isn't always a given that talent is going to rise to the surface, and nowadays the industry is even more oversaturated.\n\nIt's a combination of a complete, blind arrogance\u2014don't let anyone tell you that you suck, even if you suck\u2014and ridiculous amounts of energy and overstated ambition. That's it. If you have those things, just keep fucking going until you can't. If it changes or you don't like it anymore, move the fuck on. Until then, just write and be passionate and do the thing you believe in, period. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't."}

How cool would that be.\n\n'Since no one has ever heard of it, maybe a description would be more helpful than a grade?'\n\nWell, I could give you my review, but I haven't written it yet. It's Weeknd-esque music but more produced--almost like slow clips from My Beautiful, Dark, Twisted Fantasy--overdubbed with an Auto-tuned woman's voice. Drums build up (solo style), rim shots take over, bass kicks in, etc. I think the drumming could be the most interesting part of the act, but the vocal melodies can be inspired, too. If you like chill out music, or, like me, you want to hear everything 2012 has to offer, check it out on Spotify/YouTube.

It's better than anything The Weeknd brought out, IMO.\n\nYour post was blocked, because it appears similar to spam or automated messages.

He writes about a lot of things I don't care about (science fiction, comic books, his college pals, Drew Barrymore, how hurt he was when James Wood didn't like his novel) and I find I care even less about them after I've read him.

Coincidentally, I stumbled into some trivia on the web today explaining that Toki Wartooth is based on Opeth's Mikael Akerfeldt.\n\nThanks for the info on Motorpsycho. Twenty years ago I made a purchase in a local indie record store, and was given a promotional Motorpsycho cassingle (might it have been that first New Bomb Turks record that I bought that day?), but it didn't make much of an impression on me. I'd seen their name a few times since then, but had no idea that they had built such a legacy.\n\nJapandroids' 2012 album Celebration Rock is much better than Japandroids' 2009 album Post-Nothing insofar as shouting over loud guitar is much better than whining alongside loud guitar.

He sighed visibly several times during the show, and halfway through kicked over the music stand with notebook that he was using for occasional help with the lyrics - poor lighting on the notebook apparently brought out his frustration. Claudia then asked him if he was \"going off book\" - the music stand and notebook lay on the middle of the stage until the encore. I have to say though that Merritt's a professional regardless, which is what bugged him about not being able to read his cheat sheets. He gave his best, as did the rest of the band.\n\nPeter G - Merritt's definitely a professional. Second time I saw them (2002 or so) he was recovering from food poisoning and looked terrible but played, sang and joked brilliantly. He made a great joke the first time I saw them, early 2001, just after the prolonged vote count. Claudia was talking about Florida, and Stephin asked the audience, \"Do you even know where Florida is? Oh, now everyone knows where Florida is. It's in Chad.\"\n\nBob, I hear you. I'm also one side into rethinking whether Ingredients in a Recipe for Soul might be Ray Charles' best album. It's kind of all here like the title says, all the different musical pieces that make up the Ray Charles thing on one 30 minute record.\n\n\"Langford's more militant and cerebral, but he's not long on professions of hope either. For both these artists, hope is too squishy -- a by-product of soft-headedness that'll let you down in the end. Laughter makes you happy with fewer compromises and complications.

{"text": "ABOUT THIS ALBUM\n\nAlbum Notes\n\nFormed in 1997 by Canadian musicians Chad York and Mike Peacock, Odd-time signatures, thoughtful lyrics, dissonance, and improvisational solos, the constraints of traditional pop music are eagerly shrugged off as this tight little band attempts to break as many rules as they can while still creating a vibe that is as accessible as it is thought provoking. \"It's like a game you play with yourself. You stretch the boundaries as much as you possibly can and still try to maintain that accessibility, to have that 'catchy sound'. We've found our way of challenging ourselves to simplify! We aren't rebelling in the traditional sense, we don't bite the heads off bats, we are just two guys trying to write and produce music of substance\"."}
{"text": "Homogenic is some really sick\nshit, I tell ya. By sick, I mean this music sounds like it's dying,\nbut in a beautiful way, like if the image of rapidly generating\ncancerous cells could be magnified to create an awesome psychedelic\nlight show.\n\nNo, this isn't\na euphoric but cynical party album that will set the dance floors\nablaze much like Debut did four years ago.\nNor does it contain the eclecticism of Post, with its day-glo splashes, subtle hues\nand drab earth tones mixing in one schizophrenic package. If you\nare looking for a reference point, Homogenic is similar to her darker and more challenging\nTelegram remix album that\ncame out last year.\n\nIf this is\na \"commercial\" or \"pop\" album, I don't know\nwhat the hell those terms represent anymore unless you redefine\nthem to mean dissonant yet melodic, complex and minimalist and staccato\nwhile still maintaining rhythm. The album gets off to a menacing\nstart with \"Hunter,\" whose instrumentation and overall\ntone define Homogenic. The lyrics aren't\nnecessarily scary or foreboding (\"thought I could organize\nfreedom, how Scandinavian of me\"), but the pulsing drum machine\nsnares and the dramatic string arrangement courtesy of Deodato evoke\na feeling of dread.\n\n\"Hunter\"\nalso serves as a preliminary warning that this ain't no dance record,\nnor is it a chill out record. In fact, I have no convenient labels\nthat address the music's function, unless you want to call it \"dishwashing\nin hell music.\" If \"Joga\" (the album's first single)\nis a sure-shot hit record, then I have a great two-part 12\"\ndisco single called Metal\nMachine Music\nI want to sell you. Nevertheless, in today's confused and contradictory\npop- music marketplace nothing surprises me anymore. If you had\ntold me 10 years ago that Steve Albini would produce Robert Plant\nand Jimmy Page, and John Paul Jones would make a record with Diamanda\nGalas, I would have laughed you out of the universe.\n\nNow, I'd probably\nbarely bat an eye if I heard that John Bonham, Keith Moon and Dennis\nWilson were resurrected so they could put out a new age percussion\nalbum with Pete Best, as well as members of ABBA and Napalm Death.\n\nThere is a\nlot of ugliness and beauty in the world that Bjork wants to capture\nand bottle in her odd little ditties. \"Bachelorette,\"\nfor instance, is a quirky love song with a pretty string-laden melody\nand lyrics that only Bjork could write and sing with genuine urgency.\nIt begins with the lines, \"I'm a fountain of blood in the shape\nof a girl. You're a bird on the brim hypnotized by the whirl. Drink\nme, make me real, wet your beak in the stream. The game we're playing\nis life; love is a two-way dream.\"\n\nLove is a\nconstant theme that flows throughout the album, and the song \"5\nYears\" is no exception. Over a rhythmic pulse that sounds like\na Geiger counter gettin' off to the sounds of Nena's \"99 Red\nBalloons\" in the wake of a nuclear apocalypse, Bjork sings,\n\"I dare you to take me on. I dare you to show me your palms.\nI'm so bored of cowards who say what they want/ Then they can't\nhandle, can't handle love.\" No Bjork, they might be able to\nhandle love, but they just can't handle you... you freaky Icelandic\nchanteuse!\n\nI usually\ndon't pay any attention to lyrics (which, by the way, drives my\nfiancee nuts). Whether the artists are like Yoko Ono and Elizabeth\nFraser (in which vocal texture is more important than verbal text),\nor they are akin to Frank Sinatra or Chuck D (in which the opposite\nis true), I just couldn't give two shits about what they are saying\nmost of the time. I just treat vocals like any other instrument\nwhen I am evaluating a particular piece of music. For instance,\na White middle-aged pseudo-soul man howl is just as annoying to\nme as a cheesy-ass, mid-1980s Miami Sound Machine wannabe synth\nhorn line. The singer could be giving me step-by-step instructions\non how to successfully win the Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes\nand I'd still end up changing the channel.\n\nBut, as you've\nprobably noticed by the frequency in which I've quoted her, I can't\nhelp but obsess over some of Bjork's song- poems, primarily because\nthey are so damn peculiar. For instance, these are the complete\nlyrics to \"Unravel\": \"While you are away my heart\ncomes undone ... slowly unravels in a ball of yarn. The devil collects\nit with a grin ... our love a ball of yarn. He'll never return it.\nSo when you come back we'll have to make new love.\"\n\nSure, I've\nheard plenty of weird 'n' wacky couplets by professional acid casualties\nsuch as Robyn Hitchcock, but the way Bjork delivers her verses is\ncompletely without pretension and artifice.\n\nI have to\nsay that this album lives up to the promise that Bjork made to me\nwhen I first heard The Sugarcubes' \"Birthday.\" That bleak\nsingle with an odd time-signature, a wobbly bass line, a warbling\ntreated trumpet and lyrics about child molestation sent me running\nto the record store the second I heard it. I was disappointed that\nthe rest of Life's\nToo Good\nwasn't like \"Birthday,\" but fortunately I could hear her\ntelling me, \"Don't worry Kembrew. One day I'll make an album\nthat completely fulfills all of your neurotic fantasies.\""}

{"text": "Wednesday, February 22, 2012\n\nLeft of Center\n\nThe handful of lyricists involved in the '67 triumvirate we have been discussing were writing satires and critiques of the then-nascent counterculture, and these satires and critiques were aimed at the center of said counterculture. Elders in the West would've liked for the counterculture to remain marginal, but by '67 it was massive enough (backed by the Baby Boomers' demographics) that it was impossible to ignore. What was counterculture, taken to the nth? What types of characters dwelt in the margins of the counterculture? In New York, Pop-Art icon Andy Warhol was bypassing the countercultural center and making movies employing the junkies, speed freaks, transvestites, and deviant fetishists who were too left even for the left- marginal characters leading extreme lives. Warhol's protege Lou Reed produced a cache of songs in '67 which reflected similar concerns. The characters who populate The Velvet Underground and Nico have an inverse relationship to the Beatles' Everyman who dominates Sgt. Pepper- Reed's characters, like Jean Genet's, manifest extreme Otherness. To add \"Heroin\" as a centerpiece to the triumvirate of centerpieces I have already erected (\"A Day in the Life,\" \"2000 Light Years from Home,\" \"When the Music's Over\"), is to flip a bunch of positions at once. \"Heroin,\" lyrically, is a dramatic monologue in the first person- it is the closest rock has ever come to Hamlet's \"To be or not to be\" soliloquy. Rather than being crushed by banality because he is part of it, as in the Beatles, Reed's protagonist rebels against banality by crucifying himself on the cross of his drug.\n\nThe dynamic between \"Heroin\" and the Stones is even more intriguing- Reed's subject owns his own loneliness, is fully cognizant of the destructiveness of the society he lives in and is staging a conscious rebellion. He may be alienated, but in his self-possession he is certainly \"home.\" It's his marginal position which allows him to see his society so clearly- what's visible from the outside in isn't necessarily visible from the inside, and if you're seeing clearly there's no chance to fly off into space. The Doors and the Velvets back and forth set up a dynamic between a personal and a generalized apocalypse- Reed grants Morrison's digressions a concrete center. Reed's protagonist talks from inside \"What've they done to the Earth/ What've they done to our fair sister?\" The rebellion enacted in \"Heroin\" is against destruction with more destruction- the degradation of the protagonist's body is a manner of elevating his soul. It's the spiritual trumping the material, and the act of ingesting heroin (which is rendered dramatically in the rise and fall of the music) a manifestation of courage and heroism, just as the Beatles' Everyman cowers behind routinized behaviors and the Stones' space cadets pretend to be enjoying their trips. The irony is that we don't have to grant Reed's protagonist the premise he presents- we can interrogate whether or not we find him to be courageous for injecting heroin. What if we find him to be merely narcissistic? He wants us to believe it's more transcendental (and spiritual) not to care, to disengage or not even register \"the dead bodies piled up in mounds,\" to \"nullify (his) life.\"\n\nLiving on the margins is a double-edged sword- you get to see the massive and imposing center more clearly, but what (and who) sustains you? What's your community? There is no \"you\" to the \"I\" in \"Heroin\"; but the \"you\" is there in the background, and Reed's audience was (and is) encouraged to put together the clues as to how this particular Hamlet became this haunted. It would be difficult to read \"Heroin\" as a satire- the lyrics are presented in deadly earnest, and we are encouraged to sympathize with the protagonist. In many ways, it's the warmest of the four centerpieces, and the most human. That's a distinguishing characteristic of Lou Reed's writing, right up until the present day and against Jagger, Morrison, and Lennon-McCartney- his characters breathe, they have an emotional life. Other songs on The Velvet Underground and Nico, like \"I'll Be Your Mirror,\" represent the joy of simple (and complex) human connection in a way that eludes the Beatles, Stones, and Doors. It's an interesting conglomerate of sensibilities- marginal characters leading lives on-edge, but still able to relate, rather than alienated center-dwellers. The fact that male and female voices alternate on the album adds a sense of androgyny to the songs- it could be glossed as simple bisexuality (as if bisexuality were ever simple) or an enactment of the communal impulse that the Beatles, Stones, and Doors skewer.\n\nIt's another irony that's difficult to steer around- that margin-dwellers are capable of maintaining closer relationships than centrists. One reason that the deviant sex of \"Venus in Furs\" is so evocative is that the roles participants play in S & M scenarios are intimate. If \"Venus in Furs\" didn't sound so intimate (and distinctive, owing to John Cale's contribution), it would be merely imposing and eerie. As is, it's also touching. There's a whole history of this kind of literature- the intimacy of marginality and transgression. But before Lou Reed and the Velvets, there'd never been anything in popular music quite like this. In a sense, the Velvets rebelled against the timeliness of the Beatles, Stones, and Doors with timelessness- naked portraits of human essences rendered in such a way that they aren't limited by the confines of '67"}
{"text": "Rebore, Vol. 0\n\nAlbum Review\n\nBoredoms' ringleader Yamatsuka Eye has never been one to sit still for long, and given his immersion into DJ culture in the late '90s, it's not surprising that he should want to issue another version of his band's Vision Creation Newsun. Although some remix albums are pegged as inessential curios, Rebore, Vol. 0 is so different from its source album that it nearly achieves status as a legitimate follow-up release, rather than just a companion piece. Eye chooses to emphasize a futuristic, electronically enhanced aesthetic instead of Vision Creation Newsun's cathartic, psychedelic brawn. Sometimes the sound is reminiscent of Eye's DJ Pica Pica Pica project, wherein he compiles a hyper-speed DJ mix of world music, electro, obscure techno, and even classical music. Despite Eye's interest in techno, Rebore, Vol. 0 actually tends to shy away from outright \"beats.\" Most of the songs (all titled incorporating the number \"7\") start with a guitar or synthesizer line, and build upon that. \"77\" takes guitarist Seiichi Yamamoto's minimal arpeggio from the \"circle\" track on Vision Creation Newsun and adds space-age synth pings, what sounds like a deft xylophone line, and later brings in Hira's bassline, mostly buried in the original version. The mood is similar, but the execution is completely different, lending an intricate, graceful ambience to the piece. Likewise, \"77777\" takes Yamamoto's gentle, fingerpicked guitar figure and adds the sound of drummer Yoshimi's newborn child, later even soft vocals from Yoshimi herself. Some songs barely sound as if the same band could have produced them. \"777777\" takes a laid-back acoustic guitar figure and adds a tropical, bossa nova drum machine beat and in turn transforms the piece into a punchy Stereolab backing track. Rebore, Vol. 0 is different enough from Vision Creation Newsun that fans will have reason to listen, but more than that, it sits comfortably alongside Boredoms' best albums as a unique artistic experience."}

{"text": "Cousin Brian's First is a summer record, but don't let that deter you. With the advent of chillwave and the convergence of surf rock and dream pop, \"good for the summer\" is just as often a compliment as it is a critical euphemism for \"dull as dirt.\" First is far from dull as dirt. It's quite fun, actually, a rapid-heartbeat collection of jittery guitar jangles from the neighborhood geeks. There's a nervous energy on this record that becomes infectious; no song lasts much longer than two minutes, but they all have pop structures, which means a lot of information gets condensed into a small amount of space. The album is a frenetic whirlwind of ideas, and each one is given just enough time to lodge itself into your skull before the next one takes over. Yes, these songs are catchy. All the instruments are playing hooks all the time, and it's up to you to figure out which one you want to focus on, whether it be the grody bass popping constantly with the ever-bouncing drums, the dexterous guitar lines outlining high-pitched chords, or the vocals sneering over everything in a sarcastic whine. Currently, I'm focused on the oo-oohs that come so frantically and frequently you'd think Cousin Brian were meeting a quota. At any rate, First is an album begging for repeated listens in order to discover the myriad of layers that make it tick.\n\nAnd this thing ticks anxiously, like the last band practice before a big gig. That's what gives it charm. Cousin Brian have the songwriting chops and the talent, but they also have an earnestness about them. The brevity and geek-punk chic of First makes it sound like it was thrown together haphazardly, but Cousin Brian's tightness and the intricate musicianship of the record indicate that the record is well thought out. In short, it manages to be awesome without sounding like it's trying too hard. It's a bit left field - the surreal, grotesque barbecue depicted on the album cover is a good visual representation of the album's sound - and that only serves to help it stand out. First is an awesome rock record that wastes no time not being awesome"}
{"text": "Concert review: Beast Make Bomb\n\nStephen Bradley\n\nVIENNA, Va., March, 27, 2012\u2014There's something decidedly off and irreverent about Beast Make Bomb. It could be the odd of use grammar in their or that their mix of female and male members happen to askew the normally assigned roles in a band. The band just happens to strike a different chord purely by being something of an uncomplicated unit.\n\nIn fact there are several slightly off kilter bits that makes Beast Make Bomb an engaging and unique band. None of these things seem like they should be a big deal but in the larger context of the underground rock circuit, they're things that make anyone paying attention take notice and possibly exclaim \"oh cool!\" at the thought of the band.\n\nFunnily Beast Make Bomb isn't necessarily a unique band at any given point. They take several like minded influences like '80s post-punk and jangle-pop, and meld into an endearing indie pop/rock package. It seems simple enough for a band to put together the kind of tunes Beast Make Bomb, and on the surface there's nothing about them that immediately sticks out.\n\nWhat does make an impression though is how tightly held together their songs are. Each of their songs is a burst of concisely orchestrated pop. None of the songs overstay their welcome and the ideas rarely underdeveloped. They never attempt to overstep their reach, instead relying simple yet catchy melodies, which seem to be inherent within the band.\n\nIn fact there are a lot of things that are just catchy about them. Whether it's their basic make-up of two guys and two girls, with the girls taking over the roles usually associated with being male dominated. Glenn Van Dyke's guitar work fluctuates between post-punk distorted brashness and twee-pop airiness always keeping it in line with the song. Ceci Gomez's vocals are strong and hit the envious musty tone of girl-with-cold that goes along perfectly with her easy going and subdued lyrical content.\n\nIt would be easy to lump them in with a number of indie/garage rock bands but it would be doing them a bit of a disservice. There's too much craft applied to their songs give them the proper chaotic feel. That's not to say they play up tight, but they fine tuned their songs to great extent. Beast Make Bomb has a certain kind of loose and playful energy about their set, but a lot of that extends from elsewhere.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, Beast Make Bomb is just a fun band. It's hard to imagine any band up on stage that look to be enjoying themselves as much as this band does. This extends to play their songs with bouncing energy and results in them covering a fun, upbeat song like Harvey Danger's \"Flagpole Sita.\" That energy just becomes more infectious as they play and gives each of their songs more punch as their set progresses.\n\nThe most impressive about Beast Make Bomb's set and their general outlook as a band is their relative youth. Midway through their set Gomez related a story about the last time they played in DC and almost getting kicked out of their gig because bass player Sam Goldfine at the time being under 21 and trying to use a fake ID. So, it's no surprise they play with energy, but the precision they couple with that energy.\n\nRight now, places like DC9 are perfect places for them to headline but it's likely to assume they'll be playing bigger venues before too long. Beast Make Bombs is the kind of pop/rock band everyone should be keeping their eye in the"}
{"text": "Outside anything found on a Greatest Hits album, a definitive Smiths song. Musically, lyrically, attitudally. It's one of the first songs Morrissey and Marr wrote together, one of the first to be performed and recorded, and one of the first to become controversial for absolutely no good reason. Musically it's a perfect example of The Smiths' odd and instantly memorable sound, a combination of bouncy melody and distinctly unbouncy front person performance.\n\nThe tune is, according to Johnny Marr, \"a Mancunian anaemic Patti Smith Group,\" an homage to Ask the Angels. Not a connection I would have made, but if Johnny Marr says so. Either way, it's extremely boppy and can be danced to. At the same time, in typical early Smiths manner, Morrissey is singing from his own corner of the universe, seemingly unaware of what anyone around him is playing, sounding flat and completely off-beat. Morrissey is in fact one of the least musically inclined rock stars, never having mastered any instruments and possibly a bit tone deaf, and in the lifelong habit of composing his songs on the typewriter, as opposed to at the piano or on the guitar like most songwriters do. He's gotten immeasurably better over the years both at singing with the musical accompaniment instead of on top of it, and writing songs with some built in sense of rhythm, but his early songs were peculiarly unmusical and sung in a deliberately amateurish manner. All of which is precisely the charm that makes The Smiths still relevant and beloved. Because they didn't sound like anything else before or since.\n\nHandsome Devil contains a fistful of classic and oft-quoted lyrics, including \"let me get my hands on your mammary glands,\" and \"a boy in the bush is worth two in the hand.\" Even though the subject is addressed as a 'handsome devil' it sounds distinctly like the subject might be a female, not least in the reference to mammary glands. By the references to exams and things bookish and 'scholarly' it sounds like this handsome mammary-gland-haver is involved in higher education of some kind. Perfectly rational things to write songs about, all that. Why the English press flew to the conclusion that child molestation was the topic, I can't imagine. There are other Smiths songs that are definitely about child-related unwholesomeness, like Suffer Little Children, which is about a real-life kidnapping and killing spree. Or Reel Around the Fountain, which is more ambiguous, but decisively sleazy all the same. Handsome Devil seems pretty innocent by comparison \u2013 it's only about chasing after someone who, since she's old enough to have mammary glands 'eager to be held', is presumably not a child. How anyone could come to any other conclusion is beyond me, but it did lead to Morrissey having to take a public stance against child molesting \"and anything that vaguely resembles it.\" Pretty absurd."}
{"text": "Discovery of the Week: Doc Dailey and Magnolia Devil Doc Daily and Magnolia Devil, who you should really be listening to already. Now.\n\nAll the music I love the most has an indescribable element to it. It's not the notes or the lyrics or the groove: it's something deeper underneath. It's a quality of the soul and emotion in a song that can't be described in words, which is a beautiful thing, but also a real kick in the pants if it's your job to describe music with words.\n\nThere's a lot of Americana and indie folk out there these days, but Doc Daileyl sets himself apart with his ability to truly, emotionally connect the listener with the stories he's set to song\u2013 again, it's that indescribable thing. Doc sings with such an empathetic spirit that the specific people and stories he tells transcend to the universal.\n\nSad songs are hard to do right. Sure, plenty of people have made a career out of them, and scores upon scores have tried, but there is a fine art to telling a sad story that people actually give a shit about. There's a very small sweet spot between the vast polarities of the typical, petty, woe-is-me, overly affected list of unrelatable, personal f*ckups and music that's so depressing that it leaves you catatonic, balled up in the corner, shirtless and sobbing into a bucket of on sale ale and fear by the time you get to track three.\n\nDoc Dailey hits that sweet spot. Doc and company make sing along sad songs. It's a tradition as old as music itself, but not may people do it any more.\n\n\"Picture Frames\" could easily be the postmortem written by the now grown baby in George Jones' \"The Grand Tour.\" It's an absolute heart breaker, but the story is told with such a reflective, peace-making point of view that all you want to do is hug your family or even the random family standing next to you (proceed with caution if they have kids\u2013 or, you know what, just skip it if they have kids. Could get creepy. Hug an old person or something\u2013 they're always down for it).\n\nThe songs aren't all tear-jerkers. \"She Has Her Moments\" is a scorching tell-off that probably makes the most spiteful use of the lyric \"Buttercup\" that's ever been in a song. You can download that track right here:\n\nYou can stream and purchase all of Catch the Presidents in the widgetbelow, and you should.\n\nThe album's given the band a nice lift on their listening trend here on Last.fm since its release, but undoubtedly once word continues to get out about it, we'll see those numbers grow even more."}

The sunny brutalism of Rancid's East Bay ska-thrash has lost nary a step and their ethical-emotional rigor is as sweet as it is pure. They repo the melody from 1995's \"Ruby Soho\" to sing about feeling \"disconnected from the country I love\"; blaze through Iraq/media/Katrina gripes; and write with working-class empathy about a soldier, a stripper, and punk rock itself -- \"a place where everyone can belong.\" It's like the Clash, with hugs!"}
{"text": "13. What is a good memory you have involving 33 (The Books)? The fact that my friend got me into them by telling me that I had gotten him into them through bands that I recommended to him. In terms of discovering music I'd love, he did all the heavy lifting and I got all the credit.\n\n14. What is your favorite song by 37 (Low)? Holy God, asking someone's favorite Low song is like asking which child they would sacrifice. I guess if I had to choose one it would be Dinosaur Act from Things We Lost In the Fire, mostly because it was the first song I heard by them and to this day I adore it ever bit as much as I did the first time I heard it, if not more.\n\n15. Is there a song by 19 (Mogwai) that makes you happy? Mogwai wrote happy songs? I don't know man, that's a tough sell. I guess if I had to choose one that made ME happy it would be Cody, Acid Food or Travel Is Dangerous, their songs with vocals tend to relax me and make me happy to an extent I guess.\n\n16. How many times have you seen 21 (Efterklang) live? Never, I have no idea how I would. It doesn't even seem like they're from this planet.\n\n18. What is your favorite album by 11 (A Northern Chorus)? It's hard to gage preference with ANC albums because they're all different from one another. If anything I would say Bitter Hands Resign because it plays more to my tastes. Longer, more spacey songs.\n\n19. Who is a favorite member of 1 (Epic45)? Well there's only two members of Epic45 and I don't know either of them personally, so this question is kind of unanswerable.\n\n20. Have you ever seen 14 (Stars of the Lid) live? No, but I would love to. I've always been curious as to how SoTL play live. You would think people would need to bring pillows and blankets because by the end of the show everyone would be asleep. I don't really know that ambient music is meant to be seen live.\n\n21. What is a good memory involving 45 (Belle and Sebastian)? I remember one day years back listening to Tigermilk while taking apart and cleaning my stove. I don't know why that would necessarily be a good memory, but there ya go.\n\n23. What is the first song you ever heard by 47 (Cat Power)? Definitely Good Woman. Still one of my favorites, though it kind of got overshadowed as I heard the rest of the You Are Free album.\n\n24. What is your favorite album by 36 (the squarewaves)? Jeez couldn't you ask about 35 instead? Squarewaves don't really release traditional albums, they release their music online in batches. So I don't really think there's an answer to that.\n\n27. What is your favorite lyric by 3 (Little Wings)? Who could choose a favorite Little Wings lyric? Everything Kyle Field writes is amazing,\n\n28. What is your favorite song by 2 (Do Make Say Think)? I don't know that it's easy to have a favorite Do Make Say Think song. Their albums kind of flow together perfectly. Though I've listened to Auberge Le Mouton Noir more than anything else.\n\n29. What was the first song you ever heard by 32 (m\u00fam)? Definitely We Have a Map of the Piano from Finally We Are No One. A friend of mine sent it to me years ago and I was like \"What in God's name am I listening to?\". Now it's my favorite song of theirs.\n\n30. What is your favorite song by 8 (Sigur R\u00f3s)? Again, that's like asking favorite children. Though I could probably get away with Svefn-g-englar.\n\n31. How many times have you seen 17 live (Rachel's)? Never. I don't get out much. I would love to see them though, live shows with classical string arrangements are always interesting.\n\n33. What is your favorite album by 12 (Earlimart)? Very easy question to answer. Treble & Tremble, far and above everything else they had done and have done since.\n\n34. What is the worst song by 34 (Elliott Smith)? I don't really know that Elliott Smith has a bad song. He's kind of hit and miss, though. Mostly his albums get you into his head space and you don't really think about the individual songs so much as the dude being good."}

Bladerunner android vocals, stainless steel-sounding synthesizers, organic, thudding drums, and glistening, serrated, barbed-wire-of-the-future guitars crash and crunch together.

{"text": "BBC Review\n\nSingles charts Suede's rise from mesmerising indie newcomers to guitar-pop veterans - and demonstrates that the band have always been one step ahead of the competition.\n\nIn 1992, Melody Maker proclaimed Suede \"The Best New Band in Britain\". At that point the band hadn't even released an album. Heck, they hadn't even released a single! Now, it wasn't the first time the music press had got a little bit over-excited about a band, and it certainly won't be the last - but how many of those bands are still going strong 11 years down the line? Not many, that's for sure. Suede aren't your average band, as this Singles anthology testifies.\n\nThere are some quite brilliant tunes here; \"Beautiful Ones\", \"Animal Nitrate\", \"Trash\", \"The Wild Ones\". The list goes on, in fact this album sounds like an authoritative lesson in how to release singles. From the very first, \"The Drowners\" (released in 1992) to current single \"Attitude\", Suede's chart offerings have always oozed a kind of sexy suburban charm.\n\nLyrically, there's not a lot to get excited about; mainly sex, fashion, and suburbia, but this does create a cohesion that's often lacking in compilations such as these. That's not to say that Suede's music hasn't evolved over the years. On the contrary. New tracks \"Love The Way You Love\" and the aforementioned \"Attitude\" sound like a band in full creative flight, exploring new ideas, and looking to the future.\n\nToo often bands release compilations that don't really reflect the quality of the material they're picked from (Manic Street Preachers, take note). By releasing Singles Suede have done exactly the opposite. Reminding us how great they were, how great they still are, and promising greatness yet to come. What more could you possibly ask for"}
{"text": "Brooklyn-based Indie-rock band Candidate has labeled their music Dreamrock, a genre that they say, \"is a combination of post-punk and shoegaze with late '80's/early '90's American indie and grunge and Britpop.\" Such a genre encompasses a lot, but, their music is even more expansive than their genre suggests. If Candidate fits the description of Dreamrock, then the genre is going to need a bit of work.\n\nIn many ways Candidate reflects the city that spawned them. Their music is a diverse mixture of echoed harmonies, distorted instrumentation, grungy guitar riffs, and synthesizer. They pick the portions of each genre they want to take from, and leave genre restrictions behind. For example, the music does have some noticeable grunge influences, but it has sweet melodies. While it takes on pop/punk form with choppy and fast-paced rhythms, the synthesizer levels the music out. The concoction makes for enjoyable tracks that keep the listener on their toes.\n\n\"April Again\" provides the best example of the band's genre manipulation. They combine early Beatles psychedelia stuffed with 60s psychedelia painted neatly over an anachronistic guitar riff that comes into form after the verse. The chorus transforms the song into early 90\u2032s indie/rock. It then hits back with psychedelia that this time is overshadowed by some repetitive electronic beats. But even with all of this going on the song is easy to listen to and equally enjoyable. It is a skillful track."}

{"text": "Blog\n\nElectronic rock has never felt so much like cyborg rock as on Lower Dens' new record, Nootropics. It's an aesthetic as much as a concept, a delicate and subtle mingling of synthesized or processed or programmed sounds with a rock scheme nodding heavily to krautrock, the original cyborg rock music. And, like Michael Rother's \"Fuerland,\" the result is a strange, seductive dream, delivering more and more on every listen. Nootropics also happens to be about our post-human future, where humans live within the terror of a perpetual identity crisis: \"open fire or evolve, mutate\" goes \"Nova Anthem\". I recently talked to Jana Hunter, front-human of Lower Dens, about the growing fear of a future that's already crept up on us.\n\nCan you talking about \"brains without names\"? I think as a lyric that's about the most reduced snapshot of the ideas behind Nootropics.\nIt started as something as a lyrical placeholder. I knew I wanted the song [\"Brains\"] to be about anxiety over technology, like the very modern kind of anxiety over artificial intelligence. I'd be listening to some NPR stories and reading elsewhere about Cleverbot and other AIs that were starting to defeat the Turing test, or approaching that line.\n\nTo me, it's kind of a goofy lyric and it was much more goofy when it was the only lyric in the song. It is the simplest reduction of that idea, that around the corner there are entities that are nameless and unknown and that's what makes them terrifying. They're not us; they're something else. Maybe something better and more capable than us, and maybe less human. Obviously less human, not having the characteristics we associate with humanity. Just more unknown. Those uncertaintities are what are frightening about them. I did know that I wanted to start with that idea, but the lyrics needed to go a bit farther than that kind of silly catchphrase.\n\nHow different do you think these new beings will actually be?\nI think that that very much remains to be seen. I think that human beings have a tendency to create things to suit their environment as much as possible. I imagine that if we maintain control of artificial intelligence, it will be as much in our likeness as possible.\n\nThere's some talk about escape and sort of re-primitivization in the record's lyrics. There's a lot of dread of what's coming. Is this how you feel?\nIt wasn't so much my dread as an observation of dread in others. I tend to be more on the enthusiast side of technology. I hate that my phone and my computer sometimes seem to control my life, seem to have more of a leash on me than I do on them. But I believe in my ability to find ways to manage that. I think humans are generally capable of finding ways to incorporate new technologies into our lives that are only beneficial. Obviously, a lot of people don't feel that way and that is kind of what I am more fascinated by \u2013 that tension, a kind of very primal tension between the fear of the unknown and the future.\n\nIt's ultimately about not wanting to let go of animal nature. Wanting to strike a balance between that and endless possibilities."}
{"text": "The Duke Listens To The Cure's Self-Titled New Album - Page 3\n\nIf there's anything here to surprise the listener, it's the fact that it all hangs together so convincingly. As for the actual A to B of how it sounds, well, that's not much of a surprise at all, to be honest. Of course it was going to sound like this. Throw Robert Smith and Ross Robinson into a studio and this is the kind of nonsense you would assume they would create.\n\nIt's an album that grows somewhat upon repeated listening, like the new record by Jesse Malin what The Duke waxed so eloquently regarding a few days ago. The difference is that Malin's record eventually appears much more straight-forward than the production would initially suggest. Here, it's the opposite sort of shindig, with what at first appears to be all stripped-back, raw and so on, actually being something of a fa\u00e7ade, masking the wealth of intricacies that eventually pop up in the mix.\n\nIt's like one of those magic eye pictures, except instead of getting a headache and seeing a donkey after forty hours, you get some brilliant tunes revealed to you. You might still end up with the headache, though. I mean shit, this gets pretty loud at times.\n\nThere are nods to the indulgences of old, most notably in the ten minute finale, The Promise. Sure, maybe it's all the musically ingenious in the world, but I'm fucked if I could remember much of a damn thing about it after it was finished, other than that it was very long, and sounded like something from Wish, one of the tracks you skip past in order to get to Friday I'm In Love, but what you still put down as one of your Favourite Cure Recordings Ever if anyone asks.\n\nFriday I'm In Love? Fuck off, man, you wanna hear some of those ambient b-sides what stretch out for twenty-two minutes, is what. I mean, really, man, what kind of sheep are you anyhow?\n\nThe Cure isn't really a return to form, since the band have never really been especially far from The Form in the first place. It certainly sounds more passionate than the last few releases, up to and including liberal spatterings of fuck-words here and there. It's less indulgent, some of the stuff even hinting at a kind of brevity. It also makes those claims about how Goth The Cure are sound even more ridiculous. The songwriting wonderments on display here and throughout their back catalogue are beyond anything ever attempted by, I dunno, The Merciful Sisters or whoever. All those other folks what sing about the despair, medieval England and so on."}

Murder Me? had a big influence on the no-wave and white-noise movements. A close encounter with Von Lmo is always perplexing -- is he a savvy Devo-like myth-maker or an acid casualty? You be the judge.\n\nQ: Is this tour part of a comeback scheme?\nA: Actually, I'm making a forward line drive into the future, and making a comeback from the future into the present. According to human theory, that is a comeback, but I've been hovering in this reality since 1991. Before that, I was in suspended animation for 10 years.\n\nQ: What is the concept behind your new record, Red Resistor?\nA: Physics is the theme, and Albert Einstein is the concept. I juggled around with some formulas and created a new theory of electric guitar, a very evolutionary -- I should say revolutionary theory -- about playing in 10 dimensions: being able to play in 10 different directions and do 10 different things at once. You have to smash the atoms not visible to the human eye as they get in your way. It's about blowing out all the circuit breakers in the house, and in the house next door -- that's how you know you succeeded. You must interact with these forces in a black hole, and exist inside it subconsciously, which I am doing as we speak.\n\nQ: The cover says it's an \"original motion picture soundtrack.\"\nA: I'm doing a film called Red Resistor/Mass Destruction about the end of the world. One survivor is left who creates a new civilization of half aliens and half humans. It's an invisible movie, whatever you \"see\" when you hear the CD.\n\nQ: Explain your slogan \"Advance Yourself!\"\nA: It's very important. It means you have to get in touch with the universe, and realize that what I'm in touch with -- lights, the quantum particles, plants, the human race -- all comes together from vibrations of sound. Once you think of yourself as something actually floating around, you can get rid of the negative and concentrate on the positive. I've created an entire formula for a person to take a step into advancement with each one of my songs. You could actually say my CDs come with instructions. The other thing is to stop licking postage stamps. This is very bad, a government plot to destroy brain cells. And I will say no more on that one.\n\nVon Lmo plays with the Oats Fri, March 1, at Boomerang; Sun, March 3, at the Chameleon; and Tues, March 5, at Nightbreak, all in S.F."}
{"text": "Norwegian quartet Wibutee's third album for Bugge Wesseltoft's Jazzland label is a (micro)chip off the new block, as the group continues its exploration of electronica, jazz, and backbeat-driven rhythm.\n\nIn the main, we're dealing with grooves here\u2014some of them chilled, some of them urgent\u2014and what improvisation there is, most of it coming from Haron Kornstad's Stax-meets-free improv tenor sax, is concerned with maintaining an electronically defined ambience or soundscape rather than developing linear or harmonic ideas.\n\nPlayed in the background while you're cooking or whatever, that's what Playmachine sounds like: background music. But there is substance here, and the more closely you listen, the more you discover.\n\nThe album kicks off with an arrestingly urgent funk groove, Kornstad playing the theme on what sounds like a conch shell (but is more likely a synthesised effect) before he introduces his acerbic, ruff 'n' tuff tenor. The overall vibe is one of restrained ferocity, and it's repeated on \"We Are In Space, So Are You\" and \"Rodeo Activity\"\u2014both featuring more of Kornstad's tenor, with \"We Are In Space, So Are You\" also fronting some tongue-in-cheek theremin-like effects.\n\nBut the most rewarding tracks are the lazier, neo-balladic \"Country Practice,\" \"Gerewol\" and \"Figment.\" These have an off-centre, late night, at times downright eerie feel to them, and showcase the group's electronic and programming skills\u2014which are at least as important as their instrumental ones\u2014to more singular effect. These skills are notably combined, by the way, on \"1.800.SKAUEN,\" in Kornstad's flutonet, which sounds, as the name suggests, like a cross between a flute and a clarinet.\n\nLikely to appeal equally to electronica buffs and the more \"out\" end of the jazz audience (anyone who likes the altogether wilder Critters Buggin', for instance, will probably get off on Playmachine ), Wibutee offers a welcome and refreshing sound from the Oslo underground."}
{"text": "Robbie Robertson Presents: How to Score an Audio Movie\n\nMany Clairvoyant songs talk about you being in motion: You're on a train, you're transitioning through different phases, you're reconciling certain things in your life. And since you've always been a visually oriented songwriter, I feel like I'm \"watching\" these songs unfold as I listen to them.\n\nI'm glad they came across that way, because I'm also drawn to that in other people's work. It has a lot to do with my connection to films over all these years. I'm painting pictures here. Sometimes the treatment of certain songs has to do more with scoring them, as opposed to just accompanying them.\n\nDid you think of your specific guest collaborators as you were writing the songs? For example, were you thinking that the title track would be right for pedal-steel guitarist Robert Randolph or that \"Axman\" would be good for a raging Tom Morello guitar solo? Or did those ideas evolve organically?\n\nThey did evolve organically. In the same way a scene in a movie tells you what it needs more than you can predict what it needs, these songs were revealing themselves as I was writing and discovering them. That helped lead me in the right direction and to the players.\n\nThis album is an audio movie, for sure.\n\nYes. This is a real Sound + Vision record! [both laugh]\n\nA good example of your \"scoring\" concept has to be \"Madame X,\" a track where Trent Reznor provides what you describe in the credits as \"additional textures.\" But first, I have to ask: Is the song title a callback to the character in \"Somewhere Down the crazy River\" [from 1987's RobbieRobertson]?\n\nYou're the first person who's mentioned this to me. It was just an accident that it ended up with that title. It was something between Eric Clapton [who wrote the song] and myself that we ended up calling this \"Madame X,\" and it wasn't until after the fact that I realized I had used a character called Madam X in \"Somewhere Down the Crazy River.\" [She's cited in the lines, \"You know, I think I'm gonna go down to Madam X / And let her read my mind.\"] So it just goes to show you: You can't escape your past.\n\nAs to the \"additional textures,\" I think it was about getting the thematic part of this song right \u2014 balancing its traditional, acoustic sense with the counterpoint of that very dusky sound. And I couldn't imagine anybody doing it better than Trent, because he has a strong cinematic connection. It was a beautiful collaboration, so I guess it was good casting on my part.\n\nI'd love to hear \"Madame X\" in surround sound, because there are so many layers to the recording.\n\nThat's a very interesting idea. \"Madame X\" seems like the kind of song that will find itself in a movie at some point, and when it does, I'm going to recommend that it be done that way"}

{"text": "-Are you a bespeckled, socially maladroit, ambitious young guitar wielder out to inspire the world into peaceful protest?\n\n-Jealous of all the airplay given to that Pump Up the Fostered Kicks song?\n\n-Want to be name-dropped by clueless hipsters everywhere?\n\nThen stop staring at your shoegaze pedals on the floor, because this is the guide for you! With their sophomore album Nootropics, inconspicuous indie pop group Lower Dens has provided you a perfect model for an Individual Artistic Statement. You and all your friends can be unique in your quest to win the hearts of fashionable Spin critics everywhere!\n\nIf at any point you become sidetracked in your journey to release your own free-spirited piece of indie art, do not fear. Consult these tips and soon you will have every reviewer inventing contrived genre names for your record:\n\nPick an obscure album title and cover. This is the first and certainly the most important step to creating your indie pop album, as it will provide fodder for lots of trendy post-modern talk about its themes. In their example, Lower Dens chose the term given to pharmaceuticals that enhance cognitive function for a name, and for their image, a black-and-white collage of a city street, a living room and some kind of dog. Hmm...the malaise of the times as seen by the common man! Five stars.\n\nFollow the instrumental recipe. The second, somewhat important point of decision is how to structure your songs. Nifty things have been done with the tried-and-true guitar, bass, drums and keyboards format, but innovation is not the goal here. The indie pop formula baked to perfection in Nootropics involves an army of spacey synthesizers, layered under droning female vocalizing. Let the bass and drums do whatever they want (see \"Lamb\" for reference.)\n\nIf you insist on a variation, try starting with repetitive drums and one-note bass, followed by a synth loop and a guitar that plays one chord every couple of measures. Keep the singing drone-like (\"Alphabet Song\"). Rinse, lather, repeat.\n\nBe sure to throw in a couple of exceptions to disguise the pattern. Lower Dens did this by including a more forceful upbeat song (\"Candy\") and a song with a recognizable vocal melody (\"Nova Anthem\").\n\nDon't worry about lyrics. More than likely, your keyboard player's ego will cover up the vocals, so feel free to improvise words at will.\n\nDon't worry about hooks. Melodies are for sellouts. You, on the other hand, are an auteur with a creative mind. Just let the vibe of your artistic presence grace the whole album, individual songs don't need to be distinct from one another. You're bound to come up with a creative blend of notes and keyboard tones by accident at some point, like Lower Dens did on \"In the End is the Beginning.\" Then, feel free to use it to fill time for 12 minutes like they did.\n\nDon't sleep the night before recording. That way, everyone will have that much sought-after lethargic feel to their performances. This is especially vital for your singer. A general aura of apathy is key to proving your alt-rock credibility.\n\nDon't tell your guitar player you're making an album. Write all the songs without his knowledge, then inform him as soon as you're in the mixing process. That way, his input can be limited to overdubs and small solos here and there instead of getting in the way of the dreamy feel of a good indie pop album.\n\nThrow in bits of random conceptualization. This goes hand in hand with the purpose of the album title and cover. Some kind of esoteric song linking is needed to display the adequate amounts of pretension. For example, Lower Dens named the second song on Nootropics \"Brains,\" followed by a direct segue into a short instrumental entitled \"Stem.\" \"Brains\" + \"Stem\" = \"Brainstem!\" Brilliant! Not sure what this has to do with anything, but brilliant anyway!\n\nOr for a less subtle example, see \"Lion in Winter, Pt. 1\" and \"Lion in Winter, Pt. 2.\" Part one is an atmospheric synth instrumental with lots of spacey wobbling. Part two is a bouncy new-wave dance song. Do these deserve to have the same name? What is their connection with each other? What does this all have to do with a lion in winter? All questions to be interpreted by your admiring critics.\n\nWith these tricks, you should be well on your way to becoming the hippest, freshest addition to the indie pop scene. Just be sure to change your keyboard sounds with every new album so Pitchfork can praise you for artistic growth."}

(Caveat: if I post something you submit try not to submit again for a lil while, thanks.)\n\nList-Review of Born Gold's 'Little Sleepwalker'\n\n4. hip-hop influence, larger emphasis on deeper, heavier beats and bass; less emphasis on treble and high pitched sounds.\n\n5. something to listen to after the rave of \"Bodysongs,\" late at night while driving around, coming down from the highs both natural and self-induced, and reflecting on one's life decisions, critically.\n\n6. the effects made to his vocals add to the album's mood, tone; for, like the night, the vocals are mysterious and frightening in ways\u2026and alien. the vocalizations descend upon the listener like an extraterrestrial spaceship descending from the sky to amaze and temporarily abduct the aforementioned late-night post-ravers.\n\n7. part of the reason that supports the reflective aspect of the album is the spaciousness of the music. whereas \"Bodysongs\" was a celebratory, hyperactive, high octane achievement, \"Little Sleepwalker\" is the comedown from all that dancing, all that physicality. \"Little Sleepwalker\" is the questioning of the hyperactivity of \"Bodysongs;\" \"Little Sleepwalker\" is more mental and curious of the intellectual implications of that which proceeded it. the realm of \"Bodysongs\" occurred so quickly that one did not have time to question what was happening\u2014all one could do was allow him/herself to be swept up in the album's excitement; the realm of \"Little Sleepwalker\" takes its time to slowly open, allowing the listener a chance to question what is happening, to analyze the goings-on of the sounds of the sophomore album.\n\n8. \"Bodysongs\" is a high energy celebration, a molly-fueled rave. \"Little Sleepwalker\" is reflective contemplation; it is the late-night drive home during which one smokes pot to come down from the previous excitement and, also, during which an alien abduction takes place. the albums are complimentary.\n\nhey.

{"text": "Attendees\n\nIn Brixton's uncomfortable and dimly lit Windmill (though everyone always says how much they love it, I can't see it), the worn d\u00e9cor and fuzzy regular clientele seems somewhat disparate to the excess of twee on display this evening. And don't start getting all upset because I used the word twee. It's not derogatory.\n\nPocketbooks are just about the most disorganised and under-rehearsed band one might pay money to see. And not in the charming 'actually our songs are really good so it doesn't matter we can't play them' sort of way. They're just silly, really. There's nothing offensive about their Gorky's meets Tallulah Gosh whimsy-pop, it's just close to impossible to make a fair judgement when they don't know their own songs. They might be amazing, I just can't tell. Ah well, maybe I'm a stick-in-the-mud\u2026\n\nStars Of Aviation, however, are comparative professionals (not that that's an issue for the assembled twee folk). Their vaguely Canadian (and not just because the guitarist looks every single member of the Arcade Fire mixed with a geography teacher) sound is as tuneful as it is texturally bracing and adventurous, delicately wandering between the twinkling melancholy of Adem and something much more likely to make you actually feel an emotion. Every song they play this evening sparkles with a wit reminiscent of a much more agreeable Luke Haines, whilst retaining some wonderful timbral shifts as the accordion and keyboard merge to form a counterpoint to the punching trumpet melodies. Beautiful.\n\nBut then, cripes, things get a bit fraught. Everyone seems to be hell-bent on getting to the front for Butcher Boy. There's been the odd sprinkling of hype around London about this band thanks to favourable inclusion on the How Does It Feel To Be Loved? label compilation, but their single isn't out until two days after this show. How have so many people heard good things about this band? Is it just word of mouth and the sheer power of genial PR? No matter. The point is that people are genuinely excited about the songs written by John Blain Hunt of Butcher Boy and their humorously depressing overtones.\n\nDespite this, things do start somewhat shakily. Songs struggle to find their own choruses, they finish before they get started and leave the ears confused. But then, thank Christ, they play 'Girls Make Me Sick', that single that no-one's supposed to have heard yet. And it's ace, beautifully sad and vibrant with string swells aplenty and the good sense not to hang around any longer than necessary. That's pop know-how. After that, every song they play suddenly becomes wonderfully dour and weirdly loveable, fizzing anthems to sobbing sadness and pity shot through with Motown panache and the homespun charm of Belle & Sebastian. One wonders why this couldn't have been the case from the beginning. But then again, it's early days for Butcher Boy. We will be watching closely."}

The bands themselves are only too happy to give credit where it's due and explain why the Raveonettes have been such a prominent reference point. \"They taught me a thing or two about pop music,\" admits Jonathan Pierce of New York indie-pop trio the Drums. \".\" It's a sentiment that's also echoed by Dee Dee of Sub Pop starlets The Dum Dum Girls who has also been loyally following our Danish heroes from day one. \".\"\n\nBut \"They were touring their 'Chain Gang Of Love' (2003) album- a modern day dream-pop masterpiece in my opinion,\" he remembers. \"I left the venue so inspired.

Like finding an old friend on Myspace (and not seeing That Jerk in any of her pictures) or getting an extra bean burrito in your Taco Bell sack. Or when a local band completely overwhelms you with how great it is. Admittedly, Kelpie's name sounds a bit prepubescent, but once you get past that, you'll find a band that fuses playful pop harmonies around grandiose, glistening melodies. Its newest LP, Hey Friends, It's Kelpie, finds the band pushing the boundaries of the pop song into glowing mini-epics. If you can imagine a more aggressive Brian Wilson collaborating with Ben Folds and Sam Prekop, you have a decent idea what to expect from one of Lawrence's best-kept secrets."}
{"text": "Archive for February 6th, 2011\n\nThere are thousands of free albums on Bandcamp, so how does a person decide to actually download and listen to one of the many? For me, it was easy. At least in this case. I saw the name Hasan Salaam and hit the link as fast as possible. Salaam's \"Children of God\" was one of the top 10 albums of 2008, and he's earned my ears in a major way. True, he's only one one of the cuts of One Eyed Kings' 5-song EP, but that alone is worth the price (free) and time it takes to cop a listen. How does it rate?\n\nOverall, Colorado's One Eyed Kings are a little clunky, but their spirit and lyrics have to be appreciated. Any rapper who can spit about the war in Iraq and the Tea Party Movement making him \"ashamed to be American\" warrants a shout-out. This kind of hip hop is never easy to write\u2013it's intensely political and conscious, lacking street-machismo or humor, so it's playing against the strengths of the genre\u2013but they do it pretty damn well. At least enough so I'm curious to hear what else these guys can do."}
{"text": "Thursday, 21 June 2012\n\nCassette Culture in the 80s\n\nYou know what it's like now: a lot of exciting bands are getting their first release on tape. Things were a little different in the late 80s.\nThe photo shows some of the tapes I bought (and, in one instance, was sent free) between 86 and 89. In the indiepop scene then, there was a format war. This centred on 7\" singles being idealised both aesthetically and economically, with a concomitant hatred of 12\" singles.\nThis skirmish manifested itself most playfully in the Sha-la-la label, who released six-and-a-half-inch flexidiscs so the listener couldn't use a record player's auto-return and had to physically interact with the record for each play.\nThe cheap and disposable ethic of flexidiscs was an extension of the tape scene,\nwhich was an incredibly important part of the post-punk DIY movement. Tape culture embodied punk's ethos of being cheap and easy, only more so: they were even cheaper and easier to record and release than vinyl.\nThat episode in cassette history was strongest in the early 80s. From about 1986 onwards, compilation tapes became really useful in hearing those bands you'd read about in fanzines or kindred spirits to bands you already liked.\nIt was incredibly difficult back then to hear unreleased bands or even bands who had a record out. Unless John Peel played a demo tape or you stumbled across a new band at a gig, or you lived near a cool record shop that stocked the pop underground releases, you just couldn't hear a lot of new music.\nCompilation tapes were vital in the indiepop scene back then. Look at that photo. There's Like Flies In The Face Of, an essential round-up of the Australian pop underground; there's Akko-Chan's Anorak Party, compiling the Japanese scene; and there's Something's Burning In Paradise, which had hit after unheard hit.\nThen, like now, there were new bands with cassette-only releases. Keen I found out about from a compilation tape and bought their own tape. They later released two records. Similarly, Emil I discovered through a compilation tape. They released one tape ep and that was the end of that.\nThere's a collection of St Christopher demos there. I bought that on mail order from the band. All money went their way. At that point they'd released three (self-funded) singles and a flexi in four years. Maybe that's something for downloaders to think about next time they grab music they could otherwise buy.\nPrimal Scream? There was a stall in Camden Market that could meet most of your bootleg needs. It was the only place to find Tomorrow Ends Today. Of course, if then were now and it had been uploaded, then I'd have rather bought a download from the band than line the pockets of a market stallholder.\nThe Cannanes had a catalogue of records and tapes. An album-length tape could be had for less money than an import 7\". It made sense to the 13-year-old me.\nThe Shop Assistants? It was in the sale. The last tape I bought when there was a vinyl alternative. Again, this was economic.\nThe Telescopes? Their first demo and some live recordings. I used to correspond with one of the band members because she wrote a fanzine. She sent me that free, along with some pointers to music new to me.\nWhy am I describing each of these tapes? Because tapes tell stories; MP3s don't.\nNaturally, I'm delighted that in 2012 there are so many great new bands getting their music out on a physical format. I'm not calling out any of these bands or their labels as hipsters; though I don't doubt that's the motive for some, I don't believe it's the inspiration for any of the music I buy.\nRecords are expensive to buy. In the past decade, the price of 7\"s has rocketed, not least due to the unfortunate ebay culture and some labels marketing them as fetishistic objects with inflated collectors' prices.\nI know some people who run record labels are losing money hand over fist by releasing records to a dwindling record-buying public. The audience is there, but the money from that audience isn't.\nI don't expect that a tape release will ever sell as many as a record would, but a tape sure as hell won't lose the label or band money like a record would. Economies of scale dictate that the smaller the pressing run, the more expensive the record. The more expensive the record, the fewer potential buyers and the more money the label loses.\nI don't love tapes. But if it's the only way for bands to get a physical release without them or their label going bankrupt, then I'm onside"}
{"text": "Django Django\n\nEdinburgh's Django Django is a fun, oddball band that makes strange and happy synth-driven pop for music geeks. It sounds like space meets surf meets tribal meets robots. I think that's called \"art rock,\" but I'll have to double-check with my artist friends just to be sure about that.\n\nMost of the Django Django attention has happened over there in the U.K., and that buzz was based on the strength of their crazy live shows. On stage, they like to use lots of wacky props (unfortunately, as of this writing, they've never used a huge novelty lemon), they get all trippy with the lights (so bright and colorful!), and they slam together coconut shells (for percussive purposes... duh).\n\nDjango Django gets a lot of comparisons to The Beta Band (main Django David Maclean's older bro was in Beta Band, actually) meets the Beach Boys. I never got into The Beta Band, but that's ok, because The Beta Band never got into me. And I'm into Django Django. I don't know why, exactly. But I am."}

{"text": "Bellhaunts' Cutting Edge\n\nWhen it comes to their lyrics, Bellhaunts aren't holding back: \"Are you a boy or a girl, what's between your thighs/I'll drag it out, I'll cut it out as far as I can away from you.\" Ouch. One listen to the endearingly awkward Santa Ana post-punk combo's music, and you'll feel like you stumbled onto an unholy amalgam of the Misfits and Sleater-Kinney. With the help of manager DJ Oldboy, the band\u2014 fronted by the imposing voice of Adrienne Santellan and backed by her brother, Joshua Santellan (guitar); Vivian Anica (bass); and Robert Ramirez (drums)\u2014released thesix-song EP Bleed Into My Mouth, defining their kinetic style of slashing guitar, pumping bass and bold melodies. In addition to exploring squirmy subject matter in their lyrics, Bellhaunts can just plain blow your ears off, as with the achingly sweet track \"Herd of Fake Spiders.\" What's next? A new four-song EP and some gigs at Tropics Lounge and Alex's Bar.\n\nAdrienne: I would sing Dion's \"The Wanderer\" around the house as a kid. He was my official vocal coach.\n\nWhat's it like working together as siblings in the same band?\n\nAdrienne: I bug him a lot. It will be after midnight, and I'll say, \"Hey, do you want to play this for me right now?\"\n\nJoshua Santellan: It's different when we argue because we're related. If we fight, she'll just tie me up to a fence with her bicycle chain.\n\nAdrienne: Are you still mad about that?\n\nJoshua: It was a rolling fence! There is no other band where you can be like, \"Yeah, we just ran our lead singer over with a bike, and she was totally cool with it.\"\n\nYour lyrics are so personal; is it difficult to sing about such emotionally charged material?\n\nAdrienne: No, but I do cry a lot. I'm really sensitive.\n\nJoshua: Anyone can bitch about his or her girlfriend onstage for 30 minutes or some bullshit like that. She's able to explore her feelings through her songs and lyrics that have a deeper meaning.\n\nRobert Ramirez: Our song \"Party Time Genocide\" is really disturbing, but it's a satire.\n\nAdrienne: It bothers him because it's about mutilating genitalia.\n\nRamirez: I'm a dude, and it hurts.\n\nAdrienne, where do you get inspiration to write your songs?\n\nAdrienne: Jesus [laughs]. A lot of my music is pretty dark. My mom worked at a mortuary, so as a 5-year-old, I'd be there with dead people, watching my mom comb their hair. She would show me where they pulled out the blood and put in the formaldehyde.\n\nSongs like \"Abortions for All\" seem more political. You sound pretty pissed-off.\n\nAdrienne: I was watching this Morrissey documentary. The first thing I heard was \"Morrissey thinks the human race is disgusting.\" I get angry at things I can't change. I can't destroy what's going on in the world, but I can sing a song about it."}
{"text": "The Tough Question: How Do You Name Instrumental Songs, Joe Satriani?\n\nReally, how do you name any song? There are conventions in pop music (commercially driven, of course) where acts parrot the hook, the chorus, in the title. \"Umbrella, -ella, -ella\u2026\" Makes sense from a branding perspective, if not because the chorus is the most meaningful part of the narrative.\n\nOr you can follow experimental freaks (and, for some reason, emo bands) and conjure up something creepy or witty that isn't compact enough to fit into a couplet.\n\nThis sort of thing is good enough for instrumental post-rock bands too, but faux-profundity usually trumps self-satisfied quips. Enough classical music, evolving over hundreds of years, referred to the style and key of the music or the mythic literature that inspired it. So does much hifalutin vocal-free jazz. But it's fascinating to listen to a lyric-less song differently under the title 'Yinxianghechengqi' (by Chicago post-rockers Tortoise) or 'Wall Street' (by New York math-prog trio Battles).\n\nMelbourne instrumental post-rock band International Karate titled an album Weapons Of Mass Protection, which made them unlikely in that they were a band with no words but a political agenda, drummer Aaron Pepper shrugging to me during an interview \"apparently we're doing it through an album title.\"\n\nAnother mostly-instrumental Melbourne act Love Of Diagrams told me that titles tend to originate from wordplay and visual art. Guitarist Luke Horton said, \"They used to be called 'The Fast One' and 'The Slow One' until we'd write another fast one or slow one so we had to settle on something.\"\n\nTheir song 'Tiger Pancakes' was based on the pre-PC children's story Little Black Sambo about tigers chasing the protagonist around a palm tree faster and faster until they're whipped into butter. Then the mother turns it into pancakes. Luke explained, \"It was really relevant to that song in particular because it's really fast and goes round and around in a pattern.\"\n\nAmerican guitar virtuoso and idol to spotty manchildren for over three decades, Joe Satriani, has written thirteen instrumental albums and earned fifteen Grammy nominations (but, amazingly, no wins). His album titles range from 1995's bemusing Joe Satriani featuring the tune 'Luminous Flesh Giant', all the way up to 2008's loopy Professor Satchafunkilus and the Musterion of Rock, home to 'Diddle-Y-A-Doo-Dat'.\n\nSo, while talking to him about his 3D concert film Satchurated: Live In Montreal, I took the opportunity to ask the man who has written hundreds of songs and no lyrics, how do you title your songs?\n\n\"Most of the songs are written about experiences with people and places,\" the fleet-fingered, softly-spoken guitar hero muses, \"They have titles as I start to write. It's something that I'm hooked into right from the beginning.\"\n\nHe talks about a landmark title track 'Flying In A Blue Dream' from his 1989 Billboard Top 25 album. \"It just came into my head, the memory of having flying dreams as a child,\" he explains, so he focused on the feeling and wrote the song in a few minutes.\n\n\"It's not that important to me that people know the experience, because it is instrumental music and I want people to be able to own it in their own way. If someone hears 'Flying In A Blue Dream' and it feels like a happy song or a sad song or a spiritual song or something they like to listen to when they're snowboarding, that's up to them, that's the freedom that I give them to associate to the song in any way. But for me, it's very important to stay true to the original inspiration so that I can play specifically to that song.\"\n\nHere's a picture of Canadian instrumental post-rock band Godspeed You! Black Emperor, because they titled four songs 'motherfucker=redeemer'.\n\n\"I think to be a good instrumentalist you can't be general,\" he declares. \"You can't be yourself playing the same old thing over every song. That only works when you're in a rock band, where the singer is singing different lyrics to every song and when it comes to your guitar break you can do your little 'identity' thing. It doesn't really matter very much because the song's got lyrics which are telling people what the song is about.\"\n\n\"The instrumental is different because it suffers from not having lyrics,\" he offers, \"so you have to be very descriptive with the way that you play. Every song you treat with kid gloves, so to speak. What helps me do that is to lock into that story right at the very beginning and focus on that title.\"\n\nDo lyrics stymie people's appreciation of the music because the lyrics dictate a story in people's head? Can lyrics actually distract from the mood of the music?\n\n\"For thousands of years there's been instrumental music in all genres,\" he says, \"We could take the big block of four or five hundred years of classical music as an example. Even with people who don't understand Italian, with opera, they're free to associate with what the music is about. You're just letting the music wash over you and projecting your own meaning to it. That is the strength of instrumental music.\"\n\n\"I can tell you as a songwriter over the years, you can really ruin a good musical idea with bad lyrics,\" he chuckles.\n\nHe talks about the song 'Bigfoot' by his Chickenfoot project with Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony from Van Halen and Red Hot Chili Pepper drummer Chad Smith. He titled it because the song sounded as imposing as the fabled woodland giant, but Hagar's lyrics turned it around to describing a driver's 'big foot' on the gas pedal, racing to his girlfriend's house.\n\nYou can hear a wry tone in Satriani's voice as he notes, \"It takes a lyricist's frame of mind to really come up with a story like that.\""}
{"text": "The record is Hitchcock's first since since 2011's Tromso, Kaptein and 2010's more widely distributed Propellor Time, which he recorded with The Venus 3 (composed of R.E.M.'s Peter \"Mr. Stingy Broom\" Buck, Scott McCaughey and Bill Rieflin). Hitchcock didn't want to talk about any of the songs from the album, though. He says there are \"no back stories or front stories\" to them.\n\n\"I don't usually write songs with anything intentional in mind,\" Hitchcock told Spinner. \"It's like a Ouija board and I see what comes through. If you try and make a song be about something, it can be a bit contrived. I can make points in interviews or if I'm on stage, but I don't think they particularly work in songs.\"\n\nFrom there Hitchcock went on a long spiel about genetic composition, animals and religion by concluding:\n\n\"We need a kind of evolutionary upgrade. Otherwise we're just plunging more people into misery, which is enhanced by technology, but is misery nonetheless. But I can't really get all of this into songs. So that's why I'm giving you my world view.\"\n\nHitchcock did, however, provide this succinct overview of Love From London:\n\n\"The songs came from London and a lot of them are love songs. It's a very literal description of the way the songs are. It's a fairly good-hearted record. I'm not wishing too much ill will on anybody. There's a rant about the decline of capitalism ('Fix You'), but otherwise I'm generally being pretty friendly. For me, it's a pretty upbeat record.\"\n\nEnvironmental concerns are also touched on, which isn't surprising since Hitchcock took part in the 2008 Cape Farewell expedition to the west coast of Greenland to help raise awareness of the effects of climate change, and he's noted rainfall and temperature patterns changing in London over the past 15 years. But he offered no easy solutions to the problem.\n\n\"There's a projected sea level rise of several meters by the end of the century because of a rise in temperature of several centigrade because nobody wants to give up their cars, and people like me don't want to stop flying because that's how we make a living,\" he says. \"I could fly around the world telling people not to fly. The problem is that the mechanisms we've set up to live by are destructive, but it's very difficult to change them.\n\n\"It's as if we've taken off in a plane and someone said halfway, 'We have to stop burning aviation fuel and we're going to have to do this on electricity.' What are we going to do, change the engines while we're flying? We can't just put life on hold while we rewire and restructure our energy systems.\"\n\nHitchcock turned 60 on March 3 and played a special concert in London where he was joined by some of his favorite British musicians to perform one song from each of his albums, starting with Love From London and working back through his solo efforts to his work with The Egyptians and finally to his '70s material with neo-psychedelic, post-punk act the Soft Boys.\n\n\"You'll get your fill of men over 50 with electric guitars,\" said Hitchcock, who claims he has offers to play in Canada in early September but hasn't confirmed anything. He'd prefer if they were solo acoustic shows.\n\n\"The electric guitar is alright, but it has a lot more baggage. You have to have an amplifier and pedals and someone to set the stuff up and carry all the shit around. I'm too old to haul around amplifiers. I have back problems. I have hernia problems. I'm lazy and I can't be hauling gear. And then you plug it in and turn it on and you can't hear yourself sing. I just think, 'Screw it. I'm too old for this.'\""}
{"text": "Stranger Personals\n\nCan! What? Named after a verb meaning \"know how to\" or \"be able to\" and/or a noun meaning \"a usually cylindrical receptacle,\"* Can are what is known as \"krautrock,\" a sort-of genre that's just a name for late-'60s German rock. The first important thing about Can, if you are a music dummy, is that people think they're important. For instance, at least half the bands I've written about for this column famously love Can (Siouxsie and the Banshees, Suicide, PiL, Brian Eno).\n\nAlso, let's talk about this album cover. IT IS SO GREAT! The typeface, the curlicue brains, the speech bubble, the big orange head... amazing.\n\nThe album begins with little wormy guitar tickles, then a psychedelic waowmp intro. I can't tell if/when they are speaking English. But I do think that drums are the centerpiece of krautrock. In fact, there is an 18-minute song on this album that is basically just drums. There's some rock piano, of which I heartily approve. Also, at some point, they sing about a snowman. I swear.\n\nThe drum song, \"Halleluhwah,\" goes on forever. It's amazing. Over the drums, they torture a crow, then make fun of a violin, then a tiger arrives for just a second. The song feels like a prank\u2014there have to be jokes you could play with it. \"Here, I made you this mix CD!\" (Entire track list: \"1. Halleluhwah \u2013 Can.\")\n\nThe early part of the next track, \"Aumgn,\" seems to have been created by dissecting a clock and then playing a banjo with clock guts. It would make a good accompaniment to a trippy time-travel sequence. Also, they might be chanting.\n\nHoo-boy, so much chanting! But more like creepy back-of-your-throat noises, like you'd make if you were doing a monster impression to scare your little brother. This should be used as a haunted-house soundtrack! Inconveniently for me, but excellent for haunted houses, this song is also a hundred minutes long (17:33).\n\nGARBAGE NOISE!!! Aaaand barking dog break! And then they do Stomp, that percussion-based theater piece from the '90s where they play garbage cans.\n\nI wondered how much of their music was planned or practiced (\"Okay, hit that bucket with your drumstick, great, now jingle bells! Go!\"), because it sounds totally improvised. Turns out: Can are famous for \"spontaneous composition.\" Called it!\n\nI give this a \"spontaneous music criticism\" out of 10.\n\n*Side note/hot tip: Usually, when a writer opens with a dictionary definition, it is code for \"I am fucked for ideas and this was due yesterday.\" But really, what kind of name is this, you awesome weirdos? It is just impossibly simplistic and silly. I am so amused. Also, this was due yesterday.\n\nPlease, Aphrodite's Child: 666, please. Would love to hear someone else's thoughts/interpretation as I only became familiar with it in the last year (due to a comment somewhere on Lineout) and it has really grown on me. My daughter and I like to have a woo woo (the crystally new-age kind) dance party, especially to \"The Four Horsemen\""}
{"text": "One of my recurring jobs over the years has been to meet and interview famous people from various fields - music, art, architecture, you name it. Most of what I record and transcribe is, of course, surplus to requirements and is accordingly left on the cutting room floor. This blog is the cutting room floor with, of course, the 'golden quotes' that I took out for my articles left in, with, as an added bonus, all the ticks, hums, sneezes, dumb questions, fluffy answers, and 'y'knows' as well.\n\nArcher: Yeh, so that should be quite exciting. We're in Belgium for the England game. So, there you go. You can't complain.\n\nCBL: Well, wish them luck. Anyway, I'd like to say I was really impressed by the album and I consider myself a fan now.\n\nArcher: Thank you. Thank you very much.\n\nCBL: Right, so, it stood out a lot from a lot of the other records I've been listening to and it sounded quite different at first.\n\nArcher: There are some great British bands out at the moment but there isn't much of a sound. It's like a guitar band. Sometimes you can hear a real comparison to Libertines to Arctic Monkeys, there is a common thing. Whereas we were always more dance music, reggae, so we would never try to be part of a scene or anything like that. So we sort of stuck out because of the music and that's been the continuing of the result.\n\nCBL: I get the impression that a lot of the other bands are very historically aware of the music, like Franz Ferdinand, there seem very. clear references to 1980s bands like Magazine and so on. You're music when I heard it - at first - it was very hard to pin down, then, of course, I started to figure out the reggae, dub, ska thing, but its not so obvious.\n\nArcher: We sort of sat there - thanks very much - we sort of sat there and didn't want to kind of like this, \"Let's do a ska number.\" It was more like the spirit that influenced it rather than... Why try to recreate something like that because you're never going to be able to better it. It's kind of like a moment in time....so we kind of listened to a track and said, \"Woah, that'll work...but just because we might use a reggae-type bass line, it doesn't mean that we have to have a reggae drumbeat. Why can't we play it over a drum and bass feel or something like this. At the time our plan was to release a record on our own very small label - Necessary Records and we weren't really thinking\u2026\n\n[untranscribed segment]\n\nWe weren't sat there thinking \"What's hot at the moment there in London, and what's going on?\" Rather we were doing what we liked, trying things out. We try out a lot of things. A lot of them are rubbish. A lot of things don't work. But occasionally you come up with something that sounds really cool.\n\nCBL: I also got the impression that a lot of the quality of the music comes from the lyrics I mean\u2026you alright there?\n\nArcher: I think we were just then writing songs about what our own lives, and what we saw around us, what we saw in our friends lives. What we saw on the TV. \"Middle Eastern Holiday\" was written back in the day when the Iraqi war had officially finished and six military policemen were murdered by a mob in Basra. People say, \"You know that could be me. That could be my mate.\" And it starts making you think in a different way. You stop seeing it in black and white, and start thinking, \"What if I was out there? I would be scared shitless.\" Both sides should be at home doing what you are doing going out, washing your car.\n\nCBL: Especially the circumstances in that particular case. I remember reading about that. It was a real cock up by the British army as usual.\n\nArcher: Yeh, yeh. That was where we were at. We were trying to take it from thinking about people just like us. We've never seen ourselves like\u2026 You do get certain people, especially in the music industry thinking like they've got a superiority thing, where they think they're better than other people, to say \"You don't read the right books, you don't wear the right clothes, you don't hang out at the right places, you don't know the right people, you ain't got the right haircut.\" We've never been like that. My thing is you're cool because you follow your own path and you do what you want to do and you don't let other people influence you in doing what they think you should do. We've always tried to reach out for the ordinary people, the people who are just like us. Most people are just ignored. They are just sort of force fed what people want them to have, and they have to take it, and that's wrong. If people are not like the front page of the latest style mag or whatever, they're still the same to us....We've sold a million records and we've done five nights at the Brixton Academy, which no other band has done except for The Clash, Bob Dylan, Massive Attack and the Prodigy, and we've done all those things and yet we've never had an NME front cover, and like the NME's always cool with us but we were never one of those charming [around] with the press, so it always surprised people that we have been as successful as we are. We've bypassed those people and reached the real people out there.\n\nCBL: I think the way it works is because you don't follow the crowd\u2026and so you're different. If you're different, you stand out and people notice you more. That seems to be working in your favour. Most bands are a bit arty farty aren't they?\n\nArcher: Yeh, yeh. Always amazes me. What's so arty, what's so cutting edge? All these sort of art school bands that ever appear, they're so cutting edge: \"Check this out - we've got drums, guitar, a bass, and a singer and we're going to play music that sounds like it was written 25 years ago.\" Why is that so much more new and groundbreaking and cool, because you know it isn't. It's just like rehashing something.\n\nCBL: I kind of see that in class terms, because that kind of attitude that you're describing there is a kind of a middle class thing and your music's much more of a working class thing. It's gritty and natural and saying what it means.\n\nArcher: Yeh, I think so. It's always a kind of weird one when you start talking about class. We want to appeal to everyone. We don't want to appeal to just the working class. But a lot of people can identify us with that. But at the end of the day that's where we come from. We've never sat there ... That's the way it is. [to waitress] OK, thank you.\n\nCBL: So, anyway, have you been to Japan before?\n\nArcher: Yes, we have actually. We were there in November for a flying visit. We were there for a week. Had a great time, actually. One of those things where - we did a show in Tokyo and we did a show in Osaka, and. amazing, it was like another world, but similar in many ways. But a lot of people were saying that the crowds would be very polite, y'know, and they'll clap between the songs, and be aware of that. When we played Tokyo, the moment we hit the first chord the place erupted, it went crazy - quite like [gatrbled]\n\nCBL: Yeh, it's quite different from the UK, anyway. For one thing there's not so many CCTVs hanging around spying on people.\n\nArcher: Yeh, that's one of the things we've kind of found as we've been around lately is that people don't actually know what we're talking about in that respect. It has become a massive part of their lives. I'm sure it will at some stage. [garbled] That's our guitarist jamming in my ear.\n\nCBL: In the wider social content. what do you think the advent of the CCTV camera symbolizes? ...Did you get that?\n\nArcher: I think for me, it's always been about saving money. It's cheaper to get someone to look at 20 screens in a room than it is to actually say, \"We're going to get enough policemen. We're going get them out of their fast car, and we're going to get them to actually reintegrate with the community to be\u2026to go out there are talk to people and have a relationship with them. Rather than be like this kind of distant authoritarian force. Maybe you can stop things before they happen, rather than look at things on tape afterwards. But that costs money and takes time and it's easier to put up new cameras and then deal with it later. The UKs always been about saving money, kind of a cheap fix.\n\nCBL: Yeh, cutting corners. Yeh, one of the reasons they don't need to do that in Japan\u2026 Japan has much less crime and a lot less violence for sure. One reason they don't have to do that is because a lot of people share the same values. It's all soft power. In the UK, everybody's a bit different, right, and that creates a lot of aggro, and everybody's got their own agenda, and so society can't use that kind of soft power to keep everybody gently in line like what they do in Japan... did you hear that?\n\nArcher: Sorry, I lost you on that last bit.\n\nCBL: Yeh, I'm just saying that the main difference that I've detected is that in Japan they use a kind of soft social power. People usually share more or less the same values and so on, and in the UK it's much more diverse, and so that creates all these\u2026 Nobody really knows what's right and what's wrong anymore. You know what I mean?\n\nArcher: I can see that. We kind of noticed that when we were there. Everyone has a lot more respect for each other, and so a lot of the situations don't arise. It's funny how one of the most technologically advanced nations on the planet doesn't need to rely on technology for keeping the streets safe or whatever.\n\nCBL: So far you've been writing your songs very directly from your experience from where you've lived, and now with the success, you're lifestyle's changed a lot...\n\nArcher: I'm still living in the house I've been living in for a lot of my life actually through various circumstances.\n\nCBL: Yeh?\n\nArcher: The thing is to try and remain in touch with the people who are your audience, your fans. A lot of what we done has always been out and about [garbled] People are so made up. It sort of gives them hope. It shows that it can be done. A lot of the songs were written while we were still trying to get this record out. It took so long to come out We did it ourselves but it was a lot of hard work.\n\nCBL: Yeh.\n\nArcher: I was writing all that time.\n\nCBL: So, you're going to stay in Staines? You're not going to do a Billy Bragg and move out to some mansion in the country, are you?\n\nArcher: Well right now, I'm still Staines. It's handy for the airport.\n\nCBL: Yeh \u2013 aha!\n\nArcher: It just takes 10 minutes. You're home in 10 minutes. No plans to move yet.\n\nCBL: It fits in quite well, then.\n\nArcher: Yeh - all my life I'm trying to get out of it. Now, when I'm away, I miss it and realize that it's quite convenient.\n\nCBL: I was reading a piece in the Guardian about you opening pubs with the mayor and giving beer to a horse. Is this a kind of anti-rock star kind of thing?\n\nArcher: Pub near the producer [garbled]\u2026 I had to jump on a plane and go and do a TV show in France, but all my mates could get drunk. There you go. Those are the breaks.\n\nCBL: OK right, It's been very nice speaking to you Richard, thank you very much. That should be plenty to work with. Thanks.\n\nArcher: yes thanks mate, I'm sorry it's been a little bit noisy cafe.\n\nCBL: Yeh, hopefully I'll remember most of it if the tapes a bit dodgy. OK cheers.\n\nArcher: I'll hopefully see you. I think we're in Japan in September.\n\nCBL: I'll be here. I'll be back from my Summer holidays. It's so bloody hot here.\n\nArcher: Wow, I bet.\n\nCBL: It's the wrong kind of hot. It's humid. You're coming at a good season. September , it's a good time to come here."}
{"text": "Early in his career, Norwegian singer-songwriter Sondre Lerch says he always tried to find ways not to sound like himself. However, now that he's released six studio LPs, including his latest self-titled effort, Lerche finally seems comfortable with who he is.\n\n\"I don't think it's a big departure, but it does feel like an extension,\" Lerch tells Spinner of his new album.\n\n\"I've come more to terms with the fact that I sound like myself. No matter what I do, I sound like myself.\"\n\n\"It's a bit more candid and lyrically more intimate,\" he continues. \"Serious sounds so boring, but lyrically it's the most concerned with what is actually going on, much more concerned with reality and not reverie in a way.\"\n\nOver the course of his musical career, which kicked off with recording his debut, 'Faces Down,' in 2000, Lerche has stuck to material that's autobiographical. Although, at times he's delved into topical subject matter, albeit subtly, writing about personal experiences and composing melodic sounds to match continues to be his forte.\n\n\"Everything I do is very melodic, harmonically pretty juicy, so that's always a redeeming factor even when the subject matter becomes a little uncomfortable or unpleasant,\" he says. \"One of the things I'm really thankful for is that you can write about stuff that is occasionally negative and not necessarily a pleasant experience, but when you turn it into a song and share it with an audience, it's usually always a positive experience or gets to be uplifting.\n\n\"I have songs that I touch upon things that go on outside of my own world, but I write a lot of songs so I always have more song than I need -- I don't know if it's a coincidence or it's maybe my instinct, but I've often ended up getting rid of those songs. There's a process of elimination there, and I guess there are a couple songs that didn't make this album that are a bit less on the introspective side.\"\n\nBecoming comfortable with how he sounds isn't the only difference between the Lerche of old and now, he's also become accustomed to keeping mum about the details regarding the subject matter of his songs and, in the process, encouraging the listener to develop their own meaning.\n\n\"The most important thing to me is that people find their own stories and their own truths,\" he says. \"That's the fun part and why I never really tell people much about the specifics of the songs, because I did that in the beginning and they'd be disappointed when they heard from my perspective what the song was about. You can ruin people's whole memory or experiences with a song, because it means something to them and it takes on completely different meaning.\n\n\"History shows us that the songs -- the myth, the experience and the emotion -- live longer the less you explain"}

{"text": "There are quite a few sides to the fuzz-loving, lo-fi, garage-raging, stuck-in-an-echo-chamber Ty Segall, who hails from California and packs enough surfy reverb to sound like it too. He's released several solo records and seemingly countless splits and EPs with as many bands, several of which are unabashedly thrashy, with influences like Television,the Stooges and the Standells. Most recently, he played with psychedelia and George Harrison-inspired plucks on his mini-album, Hair, a collaboration with the '60s-loving Los Angeles outfit White Fence. Don't worry, this doesn't mean he's gone soft: I've previewed his upcoming June release as Ty Segall Band (the gentleman is prolific) and it's full-force, blow-your-windows-out loud and so crunchy you'll break your teeth and your ears. Segall is touring with White Fence but performing separately \u2014 the night will begin with the latter's trippy reverb head-trips and end with Segall's trippy reverb head-bangs.

Their original songs are as smooth as water, their remixes are on point, and their mixtapes always feature an unbelievable list of tracks--seamlessly blending genres into one ambient melting pot.

To top it all off, they sell all their music through their own website allowing listeners to \"name their own price.\""}
{"text": "Hey, dummy! Why aren't you listening to more soul music? Granted, if you're reading this review you were either at the Mayer Hawthorne show Tuesday night at the 9:30 Club, or you're my editor. Either way, you're probably already hip to what should be obvious, especially this coming summer: soul is back, and I cannot figure out where it went in the first place.\n\nThe show itself, was as always, whip smart. My last experience watching Hawthorne play was at the Black Cat. That show was grimier, with the band crammed on a stage half as large, in a room three times smaller. In the 9:30 Club, with his backing band clad in three piece suits and spread evenly across the stage, last night's show had the polish and refinement of a James Brown set\u2026 if Brown had been a goofy white guy in a crushed velvet jacket and bowtie. At one point, Mayer stopped the show so that his drummer could take a picture of him sitting in front of the audience, and then spent a full minute posing so that the audience could take pictures of him. There was a sort of carefree joy to everything that happened up on stage. No need to grind through the hits. Even the funkier moments, the Eddie Hazel-worthy guitar runs were light and playful, and the organ and drum work was suitably intense without weighing down the overall sound.\n\nIt's not like soul doesn't appeal to everyone. Walking around the room you could see middle aged couples slow dancing not 10 feet from kids grinding against one another. Everyone was getting down; even my rhythm-less ass can dance to the sweet, mellow-tempo'd music. If you don't get soul, it's likely you don't have a soul.\n\nI've always found myself partitioning soul music by which emotion is best expressed. Sexier soul borders on funk. Danceable soul approaches disco. The more electronic-tinged soul could very easily be a more complicated form of Chicago house. Reverent soul is often confused with gospel, which feels obvious considering the latter spawned the former. Mayer's flavor of neo-soul is practically effervescent, with its doo-wop harmonies and songs about love, he actually had to make a point to indicate when a song was ONLY about having sex.\n\nBut etymology aside, I'm not going to bore anyone (or further prove myself a fool) by trying to define soul music for anyone. I do know despite the overpowering influence on nearly every variation of popular music in the past 50 years, soul music is sadly underrated and overlooked, even after seeing Hawthorne play to a capacity crowd. This was a solid show, let no one say otherwise. And yet, I worry, even with the resurgence of soul in pop music, these shows are going to get fewer and farther between, no matter how popular Hawthorne's music becomes.\n\nSoul deserves better than to be permanently relegated to underground status. All I can do is beg and plead: buy a friend a Prince album. Listen to Janelle Monae. Get Bobby Womack's new album when it comes out in June (I can't begin to tell you how excited I am about this one). Demand to hear JC Brooks on the radio. Hell, even D'Angelo is touring again. You're doing something wrong f soul isn't the foundation of your jams this summer. Oh, and go see Mayer Hawthorne as soon as you can. Bring a dance partner."}
{"text": "RIFF MARKET\n\n18 May 2006\n\nI SLIP ON IT EVERY TIME\n\nI'm sure the Perceptionists or 7L or the Blanks or whoever had at least eight or nine concept records in them about the Big Dig, Boston's euphemism for the blackhole of dirt and money rackets that eventually rerouted Interstate 93 underneath the downtown. It is, says wiki, \"the single most expensive highway project in American history.\" Good for you, Boston. But I wonder about the Indians who helped you dump all that tea in the harbor, what they'd have to say.\n\nWhile surely some sweet undergraduate or feathers-not-dots type is writing five theses on the Big Dig's psychological effects on Boston pop, I'd just like to note that DC's the Walkmen have written what could be the New York Yankees of fly-by Boston sucks rock tunes--their own \"big\" \"dig.\" If \"a 100,000 blinking lights are making me exhausted\" isn't about that miserable stretch of Big Dig shitdirt near the top of Hanover in Little Italy, the one with the accordian player hobo I used to give money to my way in off the T, then on the way back I'd wave to him and he'd say something like \"I don't want your wave, I want your money!\", I don't know what it is--maybe something about the Scientology building? Don't get me started on the bums over there.\n\nBut the psychological effects. What the weather and blue laws and curse of Babe didn't already do to the place... I mean beyond nothing downtown open after 2am (or 11:30pm if you didn't have a car or the cash for the city's notoriously pricey cabbies--sidenote, if you ask me, that's why Brian's \"I'll pay for your taxicab... if you suck etc etc\" seemed so reasonable at first), there was the navigation difficulty. That line \"we're clearing our stuff and we're packing the car and heading on uptown...\" is ten retards brilliant because Leithauser delivers it so cheery, so optimistic--maybe uptown's awesome. Then comes the disappointment: \"...and nothing's gone on.... you can hear a shout for miles around.\"\n\nThat said, this song could have been better if it was about being lost in Boston.\n\n17 May 2006\n\nTHE NATION\n\nInspired by Tom Morello and others complaining to MTVnews that music isn't as political as it should be given the unrest, here are a few things rockstars can write on their guitars to get the message out. If everybody writes at least one of the following slogans on his guitar, we might be able to show the government how much we distrust them. Here are the slogans:\n\n16 May 2006\n\nROCK SHOCK\n\nSorry to break from my positivity streak but goddamn this new Kitsune comp--what the shit? I read something like this piece and really want to believe \"Maison 2 seems poised to take the ruins left in the wake of Daft Punk and pulverize whatever chunks were inadvertently left behind,\" which the author says is a good thing. But please please please tell me the future of 1997 isn't MSTRKRFT79 remixing Wolfmother or yet another terrible remix of \"Banquet\" that's so bad I think I might actually like the original now. Haven't we learned our lesson?\n\nPrevious riffs have come to the defense of indierock dance parties--not because people were dancing to rock music, and in fact especially not that. We all have been to a Barenaked Ladies show and know exactly what high school girls will do if they had a million dollars. Thing was, you get the right indierockdance DJ and she can move you pretty much effortlessly from rock to actual house to actual disco and maybe you find out you \"don't need six strings to get down\" (actual quote). I say \"actual\" merely to mean house qua house, not some sort of housified rock or discofied rock, because the best of these parties were working frontline to dismantle rock-as-normative music, and I thought that project had merit.\n\nFitting then that the first time I heard a Kitsune Maison 2 track was at one of Erol Alkan's NYC gigs last week. Alkan didn't spin it; I think it might have been before-Alkan DJ Dave P who pulled out Digitalism's \"Jupiter Room (Martian Assault Edit)\" which plays (gloriously) like a Homework track with the mids alternately clipped or blown out. It's one of the best tracks Kitsune's ever put out, and definitely a top10er 2006 for me so far. The rest of Alkan's night though was predominantly that really forced, rest of KM2 sound--hookless rock put on the rack of a steady fourbeat, a bunch of records wearing stick-on moustaches and thinking that we won't know the difference or worse--that dancified rock is all we really wanted in the first place. It's not philosophical opposition to one-pass \"make me something I'm not\" rock remixes--but maybe that's exactly what it is. Mostly I feel icky listening to the bad ones, and pretty bored, and confused as to what the motivations are for, say, Wolfmother to want a clubgoing audience when I've seen the tail that guy pulls without.\n\n15 May 2006\n\nCHA CHA CHA\n\nWherein the snake-, titties-, fart-, and now poop-obsessed Riff Market becomes self-parodic. Granted \"I.B.S.\" doesn't have many snakes or titties in it, but it has lots of small intestines, which are a something of a snake/titty hybrid. Take this from somebody who thought \"Popozao\" was single of the year: \"I.B.S.\" is single of the year.\n\nThis is personal. I've been following the I.B.S. game for a while now. My dad was in permanent asshole mode my first sixteen because he had a particularly badass form of I.B.S. called Crohn's Disease. No offense to Cam'Ron's son but if \"I.B.S.\" is \"a true story right here\" well then my dad's intestines are way more fucked up than his dad's. The way Crohn's works, something (nobody knows what for sure) tricks the immune system into rehabbing a patch of digestive tissue, in my dad's case the small intestines. The repairs don't stop is the thing, so what is usually the SI's quarter-size diameter fissures into a small, almost impassable hole the size of a bed bug. Food gets stuck there and hurts like a mother, and that's when my dad would yell at my sisters to turn on Martin just so he could scream \"what did I tell you?! NO MARTIN AT DINNER\" or punch a hole through his fishtank or whatever. You don't know what sadness is until you've seen a discus fish flapping on your kitchen floor and heard your mom say to flush it down the toilet--\"before it's too late.\"\n\nEventually dad got A+R work--Anastomosis and Resection--which is when a doc cuts out the diseased tissue and sews the good guts back together, and he's since moved on from freshwater to saltwater tanks. But goddamn could Cam's opener \"ulcers hurt my salary, alter my personality\" been the away message of his lifetime. Exactly how people with a real case of the shits think about the condition--it's so bad it affects your salary. \"Ripping off my undershirts\" was also something dad did, but I think that was less stomach-related, more a \"I'm gonna do the Hulk Hogan thing in front of my entire family\" thing.\n\nThe hustler/stay on your hustle/can't stay on my hustle when I gotta poop stuff rings true too. When not playing drums in Philly's hottest bar mitzvah bands, my dad drives one of those lunch trucks that go to construction sites and bring food/happiness/bowel trouble to all the workers. It's pretty much exactly like dealing drugs or prostituting women--so much so that my friend Danny has been known to refer to his favorite prostitutes as \"sex lunch trucks.\"\n\nHey drug users: Do you shit a lot? I'm wondering why Cam so anxiously asserts \"true story\" as much as he says \"please don't relate me to drugs,\" and why of all the tracks on the new album, this song, about shitting and throwing up, is the true story. The condition totally runs you, dictates what you can and can't do and most times that means needing a bathroom within a few yards of you at all times. But unless Cam's actually eating gourmet quaalude burgers or whatever I don't know why he thinks people think he has I.B.S. over drug use. That or my dad has a lot of explaining to do."}

{"text": "Related articles\n\nIn February of 2004, Thursday frontman Geoff Rickly appeared on the cover of Spin alongside his counterparts in The Distillers, The Darkness, and Interpol. The theme of the accompanying article was \"Next Big Things\"\u2014and Thursday was painted, for neither the first nor last time, as \"emo saviors.\" At the time, emo was just breaking through to a larger audience, which only compounds the irony of Thursday's uneasy career arc; when the band formed in New Jersey in 1997, emo was still an underground, nebulously defined offshoot of hardcore that encompassed everything from gentle, melodic songcraft to screaming, atonal chaos. Thursday synthesized all those elements. And its sophomore album, 2001's anthemic Full Collapse, thrust Rickly and crew into the spotlight just as emo was seeping into the mainstream, thanks to bubbly contemporaries like Jimmy Eat World and Saves The Day.\n\nAfter leaving indie Victory Records and signing to Island Records for 2003's scathing War All The Time, it became clear that Rickly wasn't interested in becoming anyone's savior. Nor was his band desirous of being the next big thing. As the decade progressed and emo became even more of a punchline, Thursday seemed to retreat into itself, choosing to record a string of challenging albums that incorporated everything from prog complexity and post-rock texture to lit-major Easter eggs and Situationist sloganeering. 2008, though, saw the band reach a crossroads; after leaving Island, Thursday began recording its most elaborate, accomplished album to date, Common Existence, with famed indie-rock producer Dave Fridmann. Before the album was completed, Thursday signed to stalwart punk label Epitaph. At that point, with the waning trend of commercial emo about as vital as the music industry at large, it would have made as much sense for Thursday to dissolve and fade away as it would have for it to continue.\n\nBut Rickly, keyboardist Andrew Everding, bassist Tim Payne, drummer Tucker Rule, and guitarists Tom Keeley and Steve Pedulla weren't ready to be the next casualties from the class of '04. With Fridmann again at the dials, they wrote and recorded the entirety of No Devoluci\u00f3n\u2014the group's sixth full-length\u2014in a spontaneous session unlike any Thursday had tried before. The album shows it: Cracked, caustic, and somehow ethereal amid all the corrosion, No Devoluci\u00f3n is an about-face from the note-perfect intricacy of Common Existence. It's also one of the most brutally emotional pieces of music from a band once pegged as the most of emo of them all. And yet, No Devoluci\u00f3n falls far outside the mall-punk paradigm, drawing from a broad sonic palette even as it sinks into a withered, world-weary heartache. But, as Rickly tells The A.V. Club, there's a lot more to No Devoluci\u00f3n than meets the ear.\n\nThe A.V. Club: No Devoluci\u00f3n is the first album Thursday has completely written and recorded since returning to an independent label. Did that have any effect on the whole process?\n\nGeoff Rickly: Yeah, I think that having Epitaph support us so strongly, especially relative to how many records we sell compared to some of their other acts, really helped. They stand by us so firmly. When we were on Victory and then on Island, there was a lot of talk like, \"We stand behind these guys. They sell a lot of records.\" But it was also sort of implicit that [if] we don't sell a lot of records, they don't stand behind us anymore. Having the support of a label that really cares and really loves the records and is going to provide a home regardless of how many records we sell, that made a huge difference. It's a very stable environment for us, emotionally speaking. Which is good. We're a six-piece band, and we're from the New York/New Jersey area, so we're pretty neurotic. [Laughs.]\n\nAVC: What about on an identity level? Even though the divide between major-label bands and independent bands isn't as sharp as it used to be, Thursday came up in a DIY climate. Did you feel more like yourselves again after leaving Island?\n\nGR: I think that nails it. With all the labels we've been on\u2014especially the major label, which is weird\u2014I never felt like we weren't free. If anything, we weren't really encouraged to do what we wanted to do. It was kind of like, \"Yeah, you guys can do that, we guess. We were kind of hoping you'd be this band, but you want to be that band.\" [Laughs.] Being with Epitaph has made a lot of our choices, which we'd second-guess on a major label, easier. Now we don't have to worry so much about the ramifications. Like, we'll be shooting around the idea of giving away a record for free, and Epitaph will say, \"Yeah, that would be fucking awesome. Cool, let's do it.\" It's really weird for a label to say, \"We'll pay for you to give something away.\" It makes me feel a lot more like when we started the band. We didn't have any expectations or a career to think about. It's very freeing. Epitaph is excited about music instead of just crunching numbers all the time.\n\nAVC: Speaking of expectations, Thursday fans have a lot of them when it comes to your music. And yet, the band always seems happy, even driven, to undermine those expectations.\n\nGR: You say \"undermine,\" but we always used to say \"subvert.\" That was sort of our catch-all word. We've always been like, \"We can give people what they ask, but at the same time give them the opposite of what they ask.\" Or at least that's what we've tried to do. But we kind of got ourselves in a position where we became adversarial toward everybody. That was sort of our natural inclination. For a while there\u2014for years, actually, through Island and even past that\u2014if anybody got the least bit heavy into giving us a suggestion, we'd become reactionary and just go the opposite way, I think at times to the detriment of the band.\n\nAVC: How so?\n\nGR: Well, for example, War All The Time is such a pissed-off-sounding record. It's so dark and claustrophobic. The album before that, Full Collapse, wasn't like that at all. It was a big, hopeful, young-sounding record. But that was all gone by the time we put out our first major-label record. We knew Island was expecting something more like Full Collapse, something the kids would love. We were like, \"Fuck them, and fuck the kids.\" We were just on a \"fuck this, fuck that\" rampage, I guess. [Laughs.]\n\nAVC: What about now? No Devoluci\u00f3n doesn't feel that way at all.\n\nGR: The new record is the first one we've made where I feel we didn't try to play off of expectations too much. Which is weird. While we were trying to be subversive, we thought we were doing our own thing. Like, \"This is us. We're out making our own identity. We're not following anybody's rules.\" Then you start to realize that once you've gotten yourself into an opposition stance, they're still dictating the terms of what you're doing. You're not making any real decisions for yourself. You're just going against the grain for its own sake. That's sort of fatiguing for a band to do for a bunch of years in a row. Luckily we got ourselves into a better situation now. Without the expectations, all of a sudden we have to make positive choices and directions for ourselves. There's no negative pushing back at us. We're not defining ourselves in terms of the other. I guess that would be the postmodern theory of it all.\n\nAVC: There are also the scenes and trends Thursday has been associated with over the past decade. You've influenced a huge number of bands\u2014some of them good, a lot of them terrible.\n\nGR: [Laughs.] That's almost exactly how I would say it. There are some good bands out there that love us, and that is awesome. But there are a lot of bad bands out there that love us, too.\n\nAVC: That said, the whole mall-punk thing seems kind of pass\u00e9 in 2011, a relic of the last decade. It's not a relevant way of looking at things anymore.\n\nGR: No, not at all. It's really weird. I think a lot of those bands got really careerist for a while. I remember hearing this popular phrase at one point in the punk or whatever you want to call it community. You'd be at a basement show, and there would be some loudmouth saying, \"I don't even care. I think it's more punk to just want to sell a million records.\" When I'd hear people say shit like that, I'd find it totally annoying. All these bands followed the guidelines about how to make it big by dumbing things down and making them more immediate and being more pop, but that's not how you sell records, at least not in the long run. That little formula that they had going just isn't relevant anymore. So now you have bands left that are still playing in that sphere\u2014something that grew out of punk that isn't punk anymore, but not post-punk\u2014and they actually love it, and they try to find something to do with it that's worthwhile. It's not a way to get famous or have girls after you or whatever anymore. It's kind of interesting that way. The bands left now are the ones that actually care about the music. A lot of the bands that came in and had hit records and took all the money out of it have disappeared, and it's become a little obvious what they were up to the whole time.\n\nAVC: Between this shift in the scene and your signing to Epitaph, it seems you had a blank slate to work with going into No Devoluci\u00f3n. Did that have anything to do with how much of a departure the album is?\n\nGR: It's really hard to say if it was as premeditated as you might think. The truth is, we didn't really have songs ready to record when we were supposed to. We tried to cancel the session with Dave Fridmann, and he kind of called our bluff. He was like, \"Fuck you guys. You usually spend a year writing a record, and you over-think every little thing. And by the time I'm recording it, you guys are already moving on past it. No, you don't get to reschedule. You're coming up here. I don't care if you have one song written. You're going to come and make this record. Just trust me on this. If you blow it, we can try again later. But just come and do it.\" Basically we were seven days into writing, and we had a record. I'd finish writing lyrics literally right before walking into the control room and singing the whole song. From the beginning of writing lyrics to having a finished song would take four hours.\n\nAVC: How did that work out?\n\nGR: I think that kind of spontaneity made a lot of difference. In the past we've had some similar ideas to what we did on this record, but I would usually say, \"Let's think about it. Is it going to be fun live? Is it going to have enough energy? Does the chorus hit? Let's make it more angular. Let's make it more juicy-sounding.\" I would manipulate the song until I thought it was a good extension of what Thursday was doing. I think that was a little heavy-handed. So this time, I backed off. I didn't write any guitar parts. I didn't go in and try to dictate to the rest of the band what things should sound like. I let them be a band, and I just wrote lyrics for them. I think that was a huge leap forward. There was no musical director. The strengths in every player were just allowed to come out in different ways. I wasn't in there trying to say, \"Oh, that doesn't sound like Thursday.\" Those guys are all really capable players. They're so good. I just love to watch them in a room and not sing over it, just to see them do what they do. A lot of the album was just letting go of what we thought we should be. It's funny, because I hear people say, \"I knew they would make a change, like Muse or something.\" We've toured with Muse, but we don't sit around and listen to them. We've been listening to Kate Bush and old 4AD stuff. I guess it's not what a lot of people might picture the guys in Thursday listening to. When we remove a little of the identity of what Thursday is supposed to sound like, and we go with the music that actually does influence our lives on a day-to-day basis, this is what comes out.\n\nAVC: The influence of early 4AD bands is definitely all over No Devoluci\u00f3n. It's very atmospheric, and your vocals wander around and get buried in the mix a lot.\n\nGR: That's funny, because half the kids who listen to Thursday will probably think, \"These songs are great. Why did Dave Fridmann ruin the mixes?\" That's so crazy. They might not realize that Dave is a total genius. None of this stuff is a mistake. We know how much we're compressing the drums. If you have great headphones or a great stereo, and you're listening to it from the real CD, the drums sound unreal. And they're not sample-replaced. They're not fake. They're real. Every mix, we would even watch it on the oscilloscope. Everything would be interplaying so much. It was like, \"If you turn up that keyboard and this snare drum and then put the vocals here, and all three of them hit the same note on this chord, they all kind of blend together. You can't tell what's a voice and what's a drum and what's a keyboard.\" We started getting into these complex arrangements of chord-stacking between the instruments. We were using the overall compression of the mix as harmonic distortion, using the studio basically as another instrument to play new chords and new voicings. If anyone says these songs would sound better if someone else had recorded them, I'll say, \"These songs wouldn't even be these songs without Dave's recording.\" He was a part of the band making this record. Someone might think that, compared to a Muse record, No Devoluci\u00f3n sounds shitty. But Dave could have made us sound like Muse if that's what we'd wanted. We'd do mixes that were super clean, and we'd be like, \"This sucks. This just doesn't move me.\"\n\nAVC: There's also a lot of friction there, too, between that ethereal feel and how raw the album sounds. Just because something is atmospheric doesn't mean it can't be\u2014\n\nGR: Abrasive.\n\nAVC: Right. Was that contrast something you were going for?\n\nGR: I never really thought about it that way. If we'd had more of a premeditated idea of what this record was going to sound like, then yeah. Maybe Dave did. I know he had a bunch of ideas about how this record was going to be, how it was going to be different. He usually records, like, the Flaming Lips and Mercury Rev and MGMT, and those bands all work within the same area, just different sides of it. We're pretty much the only band like us that he does, so he likes to experiment each time. Once we got into the studio, he said, \"Oh, I see what you guys are doing this time. You're not trying to push it into the post-hardcore-whatever territory.\" We were just going with a certain flow, with a certain feeling we were trying to get. I think he just saw what we were doing on that first day, saw where we were going, and he got it. So maybe he was clear about that atmospheric-yet-raw sound more than anything we were consciously going for.\n\nAVC: You mentioned a certain flow or feeling you went with while recording. Is that how you normally work?\n\nGR: No, it's the opposite of how we usually work. I used to put up slogans and ideas for lyrics all over the studio. Wherever you went, there were these little notes stating the theme of the record, so that everyone was confronted with that all the time. This time, I just waited until the mood was there and kind of picked it out of the air.\n\nAVC: Did that have a bearing on the lyrics?\n\nGR: Yeah. I mean, I knew what I was going to be writing about, no matter what. I just had a few major life changes happening at the time, and I knew it was unavoidable that I'd be talking about those things. I just didn't know how I'd be talking about them. And then the record sort of decided that it was going to be more subtle, that I wasn't going to go full, exploratory confessional, where I'm painting every little detail of every little picture. I realized I was going to be doing a lot more subverting story formats. Like, \"A Darker Forest\" has the clich\u00e9 about taking two different paths, but then it turns it upside down and says basically, \"No matter which path you take, you're still wandering around the fucking forest. Whatever moral you want to get from that story is a false moral. You're going to be lost forever.\" What does that make you think of? [Laughs.]\n\nAVC: It made me think of The Cure.\n\nGR: Yeah. [Laughs.] After I wrote that song, a friend of mine was like, \"Oh, 'A Darker Forest,' like 'A Forest' by The Cure. Only darker, right?\" And I was like, \"Shit, that's funny.\" I was born a Cure fan, always will be.\n\nAVC: Back to the lyrics, what were some of the life changes you were going through while working on No Devoluci\u00f3n?\n\nGR: Well, I think there are a lot of pretty obvious allusions on the record to a marriage on the rocks. That was a pretty huge source of inspiration. While this was all going on, I really didn't want to write, like, part two of Cursive's Domestica. I didn't want this to be this heart-wrenching record about breaking up. I mean, I love Cursive, but I knew I didn't want to do that. It's just such a thing, you know? The breakup record. I hardly ever hear a breakup song and think, \"Yeah, I know what you mean.\" Most of the time I just think, \"You sound like a self-absorbed douchebag.\" Domestica is one of the few records that gets it. But this isn't Domestica. This record is about devotion. It's like being in a desert and writing about water. Even if it's make-believe water, I'd rather have some of that around than just write about sand. A lot of the songs are about how incredible devotion is, how incredible all the things we care about are. It just became this huge theme for the record. It's a huge love letter. It became so much easier to write once I realized that. I think I was about four songs in before I realized what the album was about.\n\nAVC: But it isn't all about the positive side of devotion.\n\nGR: No. It's like a prism, and we're dropping devotion into it. We're going to get all different colors from it. There's a bar in Fredonia, New York, that one of Dave's friends owns, a little rock 'n' roll bar called BJ's. We were there, and I started telling Tom [Keeley] about what the record was about, and he was like, \"Yes, that's perfect. Now I don't feel scared about making this album.\"\n\nAVC: It's interesting that you just made a thirsty-in-the-desert analogy, seeing as how one of the album's standout tracks is \"Empty Glass.\"\n\nGR: Yeah, I hadn't thought of that.\n\nAVC: Of all the songs on No Devoluci\u00f3n, it's the one most blatantly about the breakup of a marriage. But even then, you're subverting what's expected of a song like that.\n\nGR: Right, the two different ways of losing a wedding ring. I like that. Somebody who heard the song asked me, \"Did all those things actually happen to you?\" And I wanted to be like, \"Well, obviously not.\" You either lose your wedding ring or you sell it. I wanted the listener to be off-guard. Is this real? Or is this just a song about what it feels like to go through this? I didn't want people to know whether or not they could take it literally. Like you said, it's subversion. I wanted to subvert the form of the narrative. You can't trust the narrator. Those things excite me as a writer. I love it when you're listening, and you're right in the palm of someone's hand, and then all of a sudden you're given a reason not to trust them anymore.\n\nAVC: It's also the quietest, sparsest song on the album, so most of the attention is on your vocals.\n\nGR: It's like you were saying about how the vocals get buried sometimes. But other times, like in \"Empty Glass,\" they're so loud, it's insane. To me, it's all part of the story. I said that this was a record about devotion more than a breakup record, and it needs to have all the parts of devotion in it. Going through those rough spots, that's all part of devotion. I couldn't just leave that out because I wanted to tell a different story.\n\nAVC: You've written a lot of songs in the past about religion. Is that one facet of the devotion you're picking apart?\n\nGR: Not really.Devotion really is such a weighted word that way, though. But I also think real love\u2014the kind that's far beyond infatuation\u2014is religious in every way. Whether or not I'd say I was a humanist, I've always agreed that every person is about as sacred as it gets. I've always loved Kurt Vonnegut and Mark Twain and that whole viewpoint of humanity being a church unto itself. That's something that probably comes across most on this record, at least as far as a religious aspect. I was raised Catholic, so a lot of our other records have issues with faith and guilt and all kinds of stuff you grow up with when you're Catholic, all tangled up with sex and death and whatever else. This album is a little less concerned with that. I'm not really thinking about that right now.\n\nAVC: You've never been shy about dropping literary references in your songs. In fact, each new Thursday album seems like a chance to see what Geoff Rickly has been reading the past couple of years.\n\nGR: [Laughs.] That's why I like Twitter now. I know a lot of the time bands use Twitter for, like, \"Here's a good review. Here's a link to a song.\" It's used as a promotional tool. I love Twitter because whenever I finish a book, I can be like, \"Go read this. It's great.\" To me, that's cool. For so long, I think I was unsure about my voice, so I just dove straight into the literary and lyrical side of things. The written-word part of it was more important to me. If you could read the lyrics and get it, that was always a big thing for me. I didn't want it to be like, \"He's just singing about some shit.\" I wanted people to be able to sit down the lyrics and read and listen.\n\nAVC: Has that changed as you've grown as a singer?\n\nGR: I don't know. I still love the written word just as much.\n\nAVC: Are you cutting back on the overt literary references?\n\nGR: Yeah, definitely. There are more nods than actual references. I think \"A Darker Forest\" uses details the way Cormac McCarthy might. The lyrics focus on little things that change the movement of what's happening. The plot or whatever. That's my favorite part about McCarthy's prose, especially something like All The Pretty Horses, where there's seemingly nothing going on. But everything's happening right under the surface. And \"A Gun In The First Act\" is obviously a Chekhov reference. I was also reading Richard Powers' The Echo Maker. I really love how it talks about symbols, how they have the tendency to break down the true value of what they represent. Everything becomes a symbol for something else. A leaf falling from a tree means mortality instead of it just being this beautiful leaf. There were a lot of things like that that went into the writing of this record. It's weird, though. I think I've gotten to this place in my life where I'm not pushing that stuff in our music anymore. I don't think about it so much. It just naturally comes out in what I'm doing, whereas I used to see something that got me excited, and I'd want to write a song just so I could put some of those ideas into it.\n\nAVC: As for musical nods on No Devoluci\u00f3n, the end of \"Turnpike Divides\" sounds like a tribute to \"X-French Tee Shirt\" by Shudder To Think. Was that intentional?\n\nGR: Yes! You totally got it. That's what I was going for with the vocals. I wanted to do this really long, really complex repeating melody, this kind of up-and-down arc. Just like the end of \"X-French Tee Shirt.\" That's always been one of my favorite vocal lines. The crazy thing is, I was in the studio, and I started singing it, and Dave goes, \"You're kind of doing like a Shudder To Think thing, aren't you?\" And I was like, \"Yeah, man!\" And he said, \"That's really weird. I was just recording OK Go, and he was doing that, too. He was trying to rip off the end of 'X-French Tee Shirt.' But the ways you guys went about doing it is completely different. You'd never hear your song next to their song and think there was anything in common. It's just funny that these two records I've worked on in a row reference the same 15-year-old song, this song that nobody knows.\" [Laughs.] I love Shudder To Think. They were so on their own kick. They had this way of being so apart from even the cult of Dischord Records. They were the weird band on Dischord. Even if you liked Dischord in the early '90s, you probably didn't like Shudder To Think because they were too weird for you. [Laughs.] But once you tap into that wavelength, you're like, \"How did these guys comes up with this shit?\"\n\nAVC: In contrast to all the atmosphere and allusions and experimentation on No Devoluci\u00f3n, the next-to-last song, \"Stay True,\" is pretty straightforward. It even feels a little like a pep talk. Is the album less dark and heavy at heart than it might seem at first?\n\nGR: Definitely, yeah. To me, there's a lot of joy on this record, especially in comparison to what we've done before. Some of our old stuff is dark, and there are songs on No Devoluci\u00f3n that are just as dark. But I think this one is more representative of the whole range of emotions. There's longing and joy and determination and all kinds of things. Puppy love. Whatever. There are so many weird things we're trying to fit together on the record. I love the cover art being all white. To me, the idea of white as the combination of all colors is what we were going for. While they were working on the cover, they reversed it so that it was all black, and I was like, \"Wow, that looks like a Depeche Mode record. But no. That's not what we're going with. That's not this record.\" We've been talking about it, and we don't want to write another record anytime soon. I don't know what happened while we were making this, but something went right. Usually by the time a new record of ours is ready to come out, I'm already thinking, \"What's the next one going to be like?\" [Laughs.] But I just want to keep playing this record for a long time."}

{"text": "Altar Eagle: Mechanical Gardens\n\nAltar Eagle\n\nMechanical Gardens\n\nType\n\nGiven Mechanical Gardens' early fall 2010 release, we are admittedly batting cleanup on this. But given how perfectly the record fits into the indieground's current affection for coldwave-ish pop tunes, and that Altar Eagle has gone mostly unnoticed outside of the electronic music hive and the solid base of listeners that are way into Type Records, it is fair to unearth it here. Such a sublime marriage of industrial dread and pretty, defiantly hopeful crystalline pop leaves an indelible mark on the ears, a weird but extremely familiar fabric of postgenre scraps. Consider Mechanical Gardens another sort of postnoise, one that knows how to reintroduce humans to the bleak machine and does so with deft, delicate care.\n\nAltar Eagle is the project of Brad Rose and his wife Eden Hemming Rose, with the former most often heard as a purveyor of end-times power-drone/noise as the North Sea (and the indispensable online music zine Foxy Digitalis, and its Digitalis label parent). And if the North Sea is about the end-times, then Altar Eagle is about the what's-left, turning that hopelessness of industrial drone into gauzy melody and repurposed techno scraps. Imagine a super-liberated Cold Cave\u2014or even the xx\u2014coldwave that can be lush and even betray some warmness or at least hope\u2014which, here, leaves coldwave's resilient icy feeling as theatrical as it is.\n\nWhile Gardens is a weird sort of post-noise record, it does so by way of being a post-everything record at the same time. In all that fuzz and feedback, Gardens is deep in shoegaze/Jesus and Mary Chain debt; and the way tracks build and loop/layer, it's also leaning on techno. A song like \"You Lost Your Neon Haze\" is, meanwhile, one of the record's moments of perfection and where it isn't like much at all, a foggy lullaby chasing after an air raid's sense of doom delivered so precisely via a buzz deeply embedded in the mix that keeps gaining in pitch like those first chest twinges of a grand panic attack. So pretty, but it feels like standing on top of a very, very high precipice with its mix of grandeur and vertigo. Or \"Pour Your Dark Heart Out,\" which is even more overt about that tense dualism, shimmering and skittering voice and electronics over what sounds like some angry spirit shackled in the mix. It all becomes exhausting, but the sort of exhaustion to which you can't help returning"}

You probably won't appreciate it that much, seeing as we could have different tastes. But believe when I say that it's worth a listen or 2, or 3, or 4\u2026 or 5; you'll get the hang of it."}
{"text": "The Fray: 'Heartbeat' - Single review\n\nThe Fray divide the world in two. There's those who lose themselves completely in the band's worthy middle America rock and frontman Isaac Slade's deep'n'meaningfuls. Then there's the rest of us, who find it incredibly easy to ignore the band's earnest, po-faced records. To non-believers, The Fray come off as an ungodly mix of Creed and early Keane. Their acolytes might describe hits 'How To Save A Life' and 'Over My Head (Cable Car)' as \"inspiring\", but they're mistaking vague universality and well-meant bluster for something deeper.\n\nNaming their third album Scars & Stories doesn't inspire much hope that the band have made a radical departure, but 'Heartbeat' is actually their best single to date. Maybe it's the shift from wimpy pianos to chugging guitars, or perhaps it's Slade's previously pained warble being recast as a more throaty, Counting Crows-esque Americana growl. It's so chirpy that, for a change, we don't even mind the clumsy love-as-fire metaphors and other lyrics seemingly focus-group constructed to launch a million tumblrs; \"I wanna kiss your scars tonight\" indeed."}

I have some family you know, My family spread out around the world. All over the places.\n\nS:It's really complicated right now, since My father passed away this summer. I really don't know the details. But he founded Benihana, he was in this family bussiness for a long time.\n\nA: So you're not interested in the cooking departement?\n\nS:Naah, I can't cook. When I'm 15 till about 28 I was totally vegetarian, so I don't even eat there cause Benihana is a steakhouse, it's not my kind of food I don't eat any meat at all. But now I ate any kinds of food, I'll eat anything, except dogs..\n\nA: I don't eat dogs too, but some people in Indonesia eat dogs.\n\nS:[laugh] I had a dog, he was my bestfriend, I can't eat my bestfriend.\n\nA: Umm.. So How's your Dim Mak records..\n\nS:Well I've been doing the label since 1996, it's been 12 years, we put out over 130 records. we've been through a lot of changes. I started putting out hardcore bands, emo, indie bands. And some rock and roll bands. Now we're putting a lot of electronic dance music, MSTRKRFT and Armin Van Helden, etc..\n\nA: So You're just basically sign the bands that You liked.S:Yeah. Pretty much my interest changed too, so I'm trying to do something different everytime. Now we sign many great bands.\n\nA: So the genre is pretty wide-ranged too, from punk to instrumental electronics?\n\nS:Yeah, from Mistery Jets to whitey, SHitdisco to The Icarus Line. We put out many bands from different genres..\n\nA: How's you're the kids reception to your album (Pillowface and His Airplane Chronicles, 2008)? Any good reactions?\n\nS:That's a fun process, it took a long time to do (the album \u2013ed). It's very upbeat music. It's kinda like a hybrid between American hiphop and European dance music. I'm hoping to do a new record next year.\n\nA: I hear that blackmetal has new fans, and kids in the states are into blackmetal now.. S:I don't know about that, but yeah, metal is so constant, it's a crazy thing. it'll never go away. Trends come and go but metal never go away, certain things is a trend, like electro you know? But metal is not a trend.\n\nA: I read an article in Adbusters that say that Hipster is a dead culture. What are your opinions about the hipster culture?\n\nS:The whole idea about the hipster culture, is a trend, a cycle. It such a vague terms, that the hipster to me are adbusters, the people who read the adbusters are the real hipsters. I mean I don't know what really is a hipster to me hipster nowadays are defined by the fashion, the first thing to do is wanting to dress different, fashion-forward, unique and fashionable. And hype. Some sort of.. relevant to current trendy music. They know what MSTRKRFT and Justice are. They have Ksubi jeans, and the coolest sunglasses, the new pair of shoes.. maybe the terms will change. The actual idea of a hipster will actually change.\n\nA: So that \"Hipster\" culture nowadays are pushed more into consumerism?\n\nS:It can be called whatever. People will always want to looked like the part of 2009 era. They wanna wear the coolest trends, and know all the new songs. No one wants to look dated. A part of a culture is consumerism. In order to have a culture you have to consume, I guess there's always this anti-consumerism aspect in every culture. It's tougher for them to thrive and exist. Yeah man, that's a pretty clever way of putting it. But I just don't thing the hipster thing will go away. Even if it goes, then something else will pop up and replace that hipster thing. So the American apparel that someday no one will cares about isn't gonna be the case, because they are a business that concern about the next fashion statement so it always a good thing. So if people are buying things and consuming, they will always be the next hipsters, no matter what, cause there are no such terms as dated-hipsters. This hipster conversation is a really good one. The demise of a hipster. Let's just say.. let's kill all the hipsters. The idea of a hipster and the theory of a hipster and let start over. Let's kill the idea of a consumeristic fashion trends. I rather be friends with someone wearing a bad brains t-shirt like you than some million dollar fashion guy. That fashion guy is not a hipster, that guy also hates adbusters. He supports McCain too, maybe (laughs). Now Obama is the hipster type.\n\nA: Ok, so what stuff are you gonna play tonight?\n\nS:A lot of my own music production of course. I like your bad brains shirt, I love bad brains. I have a gorrila biscuits tattoo actually, you wanna see it? (Steve show his GB tattoo on his back)"}
{"text": "You are browsing the Blog for rock.\n\nSome bands find a niche they are good at and just to earn more money, they keep doing that same thing over and over again until they run into obscurity. Muse is nothing like those bands. After listening to their newest album, I now understand why being dynamic could be a musician's biggest friend or enemy. In the case of Muse's new album, being dynamic is their best friend. The album took everything I loved about Muse (the Queen-esque power stadium rock, the soul-driven guitar solos, Dominic's and Chris's basic yet moving beats and rhythms, and Matthew Bellamy's haunting lyrics and guitar) and added a new flair to it that made me realize why I listened to them in the first place. The album starts off with a bang. \"Supremacy\" sounds like what would happen if you took Led Zeppelin's \"Kashmir\" and changed it to be a James Bond theme song. With haunting melodies and dark chords, this incipient portion of this album takes you to a dark place deep in the recesses of your mind full of chaos yearning to be free. The second song \"Madness\" feels like a funk jam, with deeper lyrics and deeper bass. It's like a techno song with soul. When the guitar eventually comes in, it feels just right, as if it had been there the whole time. Once the distorted guitar comes in for the simple yet incredible solo, you can just tell that Matt Bellamy took extra special care in orchestrating this. With particular notes lasting just long enough to leave you wanting more. This song feels like an epic multi-person band's attempt and success at a powerful song with a message, but instead it is only three supreme musicians. When \"Panic Station\" first came on, I thought Chris Bellamy had completely read more\u2026"}
{"text": "Howl Howl Gaff Gaff\n\nBud Fox; 2003\n\nArtists:\n\nFind it at:\n\nThanks to \"Very Loud\", the weepy hit single whose moaning guitar captured them byline status in Rolling Stone, Stockholm's Shout Out Louds leapt from humble European club roots to minor international exposure late last year. Though it's harsh and reductive to label them \"the emo Strokes\", it's also true: These romantics may bring a much-needed, heart-on-sleeve honesty to the too-serious underground, but they're riding a pale horse.\n\nTwee ebullience generally indicates a Pacific Northwestern pedigree; Love as Laughter, for example, ran pretty much the same sound up the flagpole in 2001, which we at Pitchfork saluted, rallying around its perfect opener \"Coast to Coast\". The inspired proposition of Cars keyboards and Built to Spill guitars on Howl Howl Gaff Gaff's \"The Comeback\" made me eager, and defenseless against the heart-swelling chorus of \"Very Loud\". Wiping the mist from my eyes after the umpteenth full-volume blast of its chorus (\"Little by little/ You're gonna hear me cry\"), I nervously let the album play through, not wanting to leave the springtime embrace it welcomed me with.\n\nNo music, no event I can imagine, even now-- a Dear John email, Japanese noisecore-- could have stifled the boundless opening daydreams of Howl Howl Gaff Gaff as dramatically as \"Shut Your Eyes\", a loathsome, sped-up perjury of The Strokes' \"The Modern Age\" that drives home the downside of the band's shameless romanticism. It's only rock 'n' roll to them.\n\n\"Screw continuity,\" I thought, and frantically scanned the record for that first feeling. Where did it go? How can you have it and lose it in 30 seconds? Sadly, the band seem to be asking the same question, as their only other moment of transcendence, the closing \"My Friend and the Ink on His Fingers\" is a decelerated reworking of \"Very Loud\". Dejected and emotionless, I resigned myself to plowing through the rest of Howl Howl Gaff Gaff, knowing I'd been somewhere I could never revisit.\n\nThankfully, it doesn't get worse than \"Shut Your Eyes\"; the opening Travis chords of their new single \"Please Please Please\" don't lead into any Britpop bleating. A subdued romp, the track's hard-panned, clean Stratocasters nonetheless reek of their shambling NYC predecessors, and I'm hard-pressed to think of anyone else they could have been inspired by. Their bio broadcasts Grandaddy and Elf Power, which, given the occasional use of vibes, makes some sense, but they go on to invoke The Stone Roses and The Cure, betraying that whatever The Shout Out Louds have in mind is a bit beyond their reach right now.\n\n\"100\u00b0\", their first single, dates from 2002, and cops the only Cure move you'll hear on the album-- a lead keyboard-- but you're as likely to think you're listening to old Modest Mouse (and by that I mean Sad Sappy Sucker) during its chorus. The stumbling, fragmentary plods \"There's Nothing\" and \"Wish I Was Dead\", both dressed up in xylophone and Elf Power guitar tones, are in huge contrast to the rest of the album, solid evidence that after just over a year together, the band are still figuring things out.\n\nEnergetic, perhaps to a fault, The Shout Out Louds seem destined to fade into memory once their romance with pop music ends, and there's no fire extinguisher for that spark like a jaded American or British audience sighing through the next big thing. Recent dates in NYC weren't disasters, but like any band, The Shout Out Louds' existence is dependent on their ability to suspend disbelief, and I don't know how long they can keep that up. As a better man with two first names once said, you gotta have faith."}
{"text": "Farewell to 1995, a year in music we'd rather forget\n\nIn the post-Nirvana world, the most popular of pop music exists contrary to Kurt Cobain: Where Cobain gave us revelations without confessions (especially on In Utero), the current crop of post-grunge rockers foist upon us imitations without hesitation. Rancid offers nothing but a pale Clash-Specials copy right down to their leather clown outfits; Green Day, whose Insomniac was a better record than Dookie and sold less to prove it, is the Who on a Buzzcocks kick; and Bush and Silverchair emasculate music until it's no less a formula than 2+2.\n\nThere's so little honesty in rock anymore, so few musicians from whom you get the sense that they need to make music. Sure, PJ Harvey does (her demons could kill Sin\u017dad O'Connor's); Dave Grohl does (like a shotgun blast); Geraldine Fibbers frontwoman Carla Bozulich does (the ex-junkie's lament); Brian Wilson does (he might go...crazy). But what does Live have to say? Or Darius Rucker? Or Natalie Merchant? They just offer up the same trite aphorisms set to lullaby melodies: \"I alone love you;\" \"I only wanna be with you;\" songs about River Phoenix (\"This star fell down on Hollywood Boulevard\"). Shut the fuck up.\n\nTop 10 of 1995, give or take\n1. Foo Fighters, Foo Fighters (Capitol/Roswell). \"I don't owe you anything,\" Dave Grohl growls during \"I'll Stick Around,\" declaring his independence from the myth and legacy of Nirvana. There's no dismissing this album (for which the former Nirvana drummer wrote every song and played every instrument) as a glorified solo project by a drummer-turned-frontman; it's a mission statement, palpable in its emotion--from Grohl's frenzied guitar playing to the constant threat in his voice to the songs that somehow balance '70s pop-rock melody with punk-rock fury. When \"Weenie Beenie\" erupts, the guitar building to a climax over which Grohl's distorted voice can be heard saying \"One shot, nothing,\" it's rock's finest moment of 1995.\n\n2. To Bring You My Love, PJ Harvey (Island). She's a blueswoman to the core, Howling Wolf born in the fragile, pale body of a 26-year-old British woman who sings about her \"Long Snake Moan.\" There's nothing easy about Polly Jean Harvey--not her harshly gorgeous voice, not the distorted guitars atop the string sections atop the haunting background organ, not the subject matter that finds the Devil wanting to have the Lord's baby. Unlike Rid of Me, on which every song began as a whisper then exploded into a roar, To Bring sustains one note throughout; it seethes, it growls, it drones, it mutters, but it never yells--it never exorcises its demons, suckling them instead.\n\n3. Lost Somewhere Between The Earth and My Home, The Geraldine Fibbers (Virgin). The Fibbers' full-length debut opens with the sound of a fiddle whining in the dark as a bass guitar drones in the distance. Then, from nowhere, electric guitars and drums kick in, transforming the caress into a punch. This is an epic record, a collection of literate short stories narrated by Carla Bozulich--a former junkie whose tales of sin and salvation are undercut by a constant hopelessness--and set to a dissonantly beautiful punk-rock beat with a country hitch. Singing in a voice that's almost androgynous, Bozulich crafts tales of losers who are almost beyond redemption; they're lost, self-hating, haunted by their pasts even when they do kick their habits. \"I never knew nothing 'cept hunger and fear,\" she sings from the \"Outside of Town,\" waiting for the bus that will take her to heaven--or hell. \"I'll never be nothing--I'm ready to go.\"\n\n(Tie) 4. A.M., Wilco (Reprise); Tomorrow the Green Grass, The Jayhawks (American Recordings); Trace, Son Volt (Warner Bros.). Standing in the Sons of Hermann Hall bar hours before Wilco's May show, frontman Jeff Tweedy came up with a catchy catch-all nickname for his--and the Jayhawks', and Son Volt's--brand of music: \"rural contemporary,\" he called it, hinting at the country and rock and roll contained within. If nothing else, 1995 was the year \"roots-rock\" meant something: These three bands, Dwight Yoakam (whose Gone approached country as though it were Top 40 from 1964), and Geraldine Fibbers (\"grievous angels who looked down from the heavens and spit\"), prove country no longer belongs to the clones Nashville keeps dropping off the assembly line.\n\nWilco and Son Volt are the two sides of Uncle Tupelo revealed independently of each other for the first time--Tweedy's giddy pop songs set to a hillbilly backbeat; Jay Farrar's moody scene-setting country played like he was fronting Crazy Horse. If Tweedy's music seems lightweight in spots, it is only because it is hopeful and open: \"If you'll come back again, I'll still be your friend\" is his idea of a breakup; and \"Passenger Side\" is the best ode to drunk-driving written by a guy who's been clean and sober for years. Farrar, though, leaves little room in his claustrophobic travelogue through America's black heartland; his is a desolate, wind-swept, abstract ghost town for which he provides the equally stark sound track, no matter how elaborate the instrumentation. The Jayhawks, who have since broken up, split the difference between the lush and heartbreaking (\"Blue,\" \"Two Hearts,\" \"Nothing Left to Borrow\") and dense and moody rockers (\"Real Light,\" \"Pray for Me\"). Like Uncle Tupelo's Anodyne, Tomorrow plays out like a bittersweet farewell, at the very least."}
{"text": "PEER REVIEW: BEACH HOUSE @ WILBUR 10.15.12\n\nMy friend, Sara, recently moved to Argentina. Before she left, I asked her what led to this spur-of-the-moment decision. She told me that it was always something she had thought about doing, and one rainy day she listened to too much Beach House and decided to just buy the damn plane ticket.\n\nIn my mind, that is the precursor to any discussion about this band.\n\nThis is a cliche but I swear it's true: if Victoria Legrand and Co. didn't invent the \"dream pop\" genre, they certainly perfected it.\n\nTheir latest, Bloom, is nearly flawless: mellow synthesizers and ethereal guitars over Legrand's deep wail create less of a sound and more of a texture. This is not an album for active listening, but for daydreaming. The lyrics don't really matter (although they're often pretty interesting and/or poetic), and even the individual instruments aren't something you can pay attention to when you put the record on.\n\nRather, Beach House has recorded a series of profound feelings; the perfect backing track to daydreams, the sounds you hear when you're having an epiphany, what it sounds like to find yourself in a new and strange place.\n\nThat all probably sounds a bit too profound, so let me also add that the live Beach House experience, caught at the Wilbur this week, is not exactly like the recorded one. Live, the show is hypnotic (yeah, I said it, and yeah, it probably goes without saying), but it provides tried and true Beach House fans an opportunity to dissect where those conjured emotions come from and to really understand how they got that perdy sound.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't know that behind tracks like \"Irene\" and \"Myth\" there were actual people playing real instruments, I just never really thought about it until it was right in front of me.\n\nFor example, I realized that Alex Scally was actually a pretty good guitar player (he pulled off that really fast, steady one-note thing that Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner does pretty much always). Also, Legrand's voice is actually kind of insane. I'm fairly certain she couldn't miss a note if she tried. Rather than a separate piece of a musical whole, she uses her voice very instrumentally. The breathy heaves she implements in the beginning of songs like \"Lazuli\" are almost like a bizarre drum machine. Plus her tone is so deep and rich that it evokes strings across a cello more than it evokes a person. All things I learned from their live show!\n\nBottom line: if you're not already a fan of the band, I'm not really sure what you will get out of their live show other than a dreamy (sometimes potentially sleepy) experience.\n\nBut if you're already into Beach House, you'll get new insights into this awesome three-piece, and also maybe you'll buy a plane ticket to Argentina.

It opens with broken piano chords (arpeggios), until a sustained chord is played, followed by fuzzy guitar which leads into the main part of the song. The song moves at a fairly fast tempo, with the intro playing at 147 bpm, before increasing to 153 bpm. Interestingly, the intro is played a lot faster live, while the rest of the song is generally played slower. Even more interestingly, both parts of the song have decreased in speed over time.\n\nBellamy's vocal range spans from F\u266f3 to E5. The outro features sampled vocals.\n\nAdditional information\n\nNew Born began life as a piece played in sound check on the 1999 tour, while supporting the Foo Fighters, and the piano intro was written afterwards.[2] During the recording of the album in the David Bottrill sessions, the band experimented with using Bellamy's voice for the intro in place of a piano, but decided that this was too abstract and removed it post-recording.[2] Bellamy attributed this to things sounding better when experiencing the effect of magic mushrooms, which Muse were using during said recording sessions.[2]\n\nOn the single the ending (using sampled vocals) fades out gently, unlike the version found on the album Origin of Symmetry.\n\nLyricsHopeless time to roam\nThe distance to your home\nFades away to nowhere\nHow much are you worth?\nYou can't come down to earth\nYou're swelling up\nYou're unstoppable\n'Cause you've seen, seen\nToo much\nToo young, young\nSoulless is everywhere\nDestroy the spineless\nShow me it's real\nWasting our last chance to come away\nJust break the silence\n'cause I'm drifting away\nAway from you\nLink it to the world\nLink it to yourself\nStretch it like it's a birth squeeze\nAnd the love for what you hide\nAnd the bitterness inside\nIs growing like the new born\nWhen you've seen, seen\nToo much,\nToo young, young\nSoulless is everywhere\nDestroy the spineless\nShow me it's real\nWasting our last chance\nTo come away\nJust break the silence\n'Cause I'm drifting away\nAway from you\n\nOakenfold Perfect RemixLink it to the world\nLink it to yourself\nStretch it like a birth squeeze\nThe love for what you hide\nThe bitterness inside\nIs growing like the new born\nWhen you've seen, seen\nToo much,\nWhen you've seen, seen\nToo much,\nToo young, young\nSoulless is everywhere"}

{"text": "Review\n\nReview Summary: Ladies and gentlemen, do you leave the house with only one shoe tied? Are you content with your catfish for dinner being mostly raw? Do you pride yourself on only making the right side of the bed? If so, then Loop's for you!\n\nBenjamin Sharp stands out in the do-it-yourself music scene as a chameleon, an ever-changing musician basking in the versatility of his discography. One look at \"Let Yourself Be Huge\" after studying his much more calculated, riff-sporting earlier releases indicates that he's most comfortable creating something monumental and then leaving it in the dust, perhaps resurrecting it in nondescript ways in the future but never more. Yes, his past widely alters his musical future, but Cloudkicker is one musician with a wide array of influences, and a songwriter that aspires to be more universal than that of his peers.\n\nOne quality of Cloudkicker that certainly sets him apart from others in the instrumental genre is the steady influx of his music over only the past four years. Ever since the inception of \"The Map Is the Territory\" in 2008 he's since released so many full-lengths and EPs that his aspirations have propelled him to the forefront of the independent music scene. Unlike other obscenely proficient musicians probably named Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, Sharp never feels the need to release albums that he doesn't truly find himself satisfied with at the end of the day. Well, until Loop.\n\nLoop is quite the mystery, and why exactly it was released is the one question that eludes me. Sure, it's kind of alright in some places, but mostly it's an irritating listen just because it lacks the persistent polish that Sharp has always made sure to apply to his releases. The restraint is coated much too thin on Loop, every idea lodged in Sharp's mind surfaced unquestionably. This would be more acceptable if the ideas went somewhere, instead of tending to drone on for the song's length, but the intricate system of layering that makes Cloudkicker's music so enjoyable is entirely absent here. Instead Loop is a collection of sixteen riffs, lukewarm concepts that aren't really too capable of standing by themselves, and they're left twisting in the wind.\n\nIt's also tragic how little time each track is given to flourish, because it feels as if once they truly start to get going the track ends. This leads to an immense lack of fulfillment all throughout Loop, a longing for at least an inkling of something more profound that's never sated. It's almost as if Sharp has lost the confidence he's always possessed, that self-assurance that's always granted him the ability to turn just that one sick groove into something truly special. He lacks the drive to take Loop further and is content with leaving the album in a state of only slight hints towards what could have been.\n\nLoop exists as a half-baked amalgamation of ideas that could have been very successful as actual songs, but remain as incomplete shimmers at what could have been. After all of the intensive labor Cloudkicker's placed into his other releases, the existence of this strange blip in Sharp's discography is a little mystifying. However, it's very assuring that this was released at the same time as Let Yourself Be Huge, indeed a huge step into a most rejuvenating style. This is perhaps to be disregarded more than anything, because although this was deemed important enough to be released, it's not at all indicative of the prowess of Cloudkicker lately. So while Loop isn't very good, let's keep in mind that at least these ideas are now disposed of, and Ben Sharp can let himself dive into a new project headfirst, and be even huger.\n\nI feel like the majority of this review is about Cloudkick's other releases, then you go onto saying why you don't like this without saying what it sounds like or giving any reasons besides the general.\n\nit doesnt really seem fair to judge this. it isn't supposed to be a proper album/release, it's just something he put on the internet for the sake of giving people some stuff for free. i think he said himself somewhere that he gave away these loops to be used and manipulated by people who care to use them, for a bit of fun for themselves, rather than to be listened to by any critical audience. he said the \"album\" sounds better when listened-to with crossfade, so the fact that he didn't put it in crossfade when he uploaded it goes to show that it wasn't supposed to be listened to in the conventional sense.\n\ni dunno, just thought that was worth saying, in case people were judging this and worrying that he was losing his touch as a musician or something.\n\nMinty901, that's one thing I discussed in the review. It does need to be known that this release isn't necessarily a proper one of his, but I feel like he may want to put just a little more thought into what he does and doesn't release absolutely everything he makes. And I did make sure to talk in the review about how this isn't a reason for worry, that it wasn't his main focus at the time.\n\nAnd judging music isn't always to dissuade or persuade people to check it out - one always has to keep in mind what their personal tastes are. This release will be enjoyed by those that like messing around with loops on their guitars, and maybe adding onto the palette that Cloudkicker created here, but for a person like me that doesn't play too much guitar it's quite bare.\n\nyeah dont get me wrong it was a great review and you made all the right points. just something worth reiterating i guess. say if it was the 90s and he put all his music out in physical media, this wouldn't have seen the light of day because he knows it isn't worthwhile listening material. its only because he can so easily put stuff on the internet that hes put this out there for people to have if they want it.\n\neither way, good review, and ur right you did make the point about not to worry etc.\n\nThank you :] I guess that's one interesting topic, how much an artist should release when they're technically allowed to actually release. It tends to mean less when an artist releases a shit-ton of music. However, clearly Cloudkicker hasn't been bad about it, and he does maintain this air of intrigue about him, which I love. I feel like that's one thing missing from musicians' lives these days, because we can learn so much about their lives now. It's cool, but also worth being cautious about I guess."}
{"text": "No related\n\nOne would think a band called Tapes 'N Tapes would get a lot of questions about, well, tapes, but apparently that's not the case. Instead, these local blog darlings do most of their talking about their music, including answering various questions about Outside, their latest record. The A.V. Club couldn't let that lack of tape-related questioning stand, so we cornered guitarist Josh Grier before the band's show Sunday at Turf Club with blog fodder Howler, to talk about cassettes, duct tape, and Pee-wee Herman.\n\nThe A.V. Club: Why are you called Tapes 'N Tapes?\n\nJosh Grier: Basically, before the band started, a buddy and I had a few late night recording sessions where we'd improvise songs. We'd have some beers, set a kitchen timer, and record. When that timer went off, the song was over. It was just a boundary so we wouldn't jam for hours and hours on end.\n\nSo, we did that for a couple of evenings and we made tapes and tapes of demos. I thought Tapes 'N Tapes would be a funny band name, so I bought a URL, made a fake band website, and told my buddy that now that we had a website, we were a band.\n\nAVC: You did put out a cassette of Outside, right?\n\nJG: We did 250 handmade tapes. Each one of us made custom artwork for about 75 of the tapes, and then we signed them.\n\nJG: I think it's good. I grew up listening to tapes. I had a Walkman, and I'd walk to school listening to my favorite tape. It's a nice portable format, and there's something endearing about a tape that's so worn out that it gets corroded.\n\nI also think there's something about getting a mix tape that's way different than getting a mix CD. They're just great.\n\nAVC: What was on your favorite tape?\n\nJG: When I was really little, like grade school, my favorite tapes were The Beatles' White Album and Beatles '65. I had some old Bob Dylan stuff, too. Those were my go-to jams.\n\nAVC: Have you ever gotten or given a mix tape that you've been especially into?\n\nJG: I've gotten a few really good mix tapes. I haven't gotten one in a long time, but when I was in high school, me and my friends would make each other tapes. It was something to do and they were always great. One day, someone would just be like, \"Hey I made you and five other people this tape of songs I've been listening to. Check it out.\" It was a wonderful middle-of-April surprise.\n\nAVC: Do you still have your tapes? I have mine in a drawer, but I don't have a tape player to listen to them on.\n\nJG: I totally have mine in a drawer, too. I know exactly where they are. I have a couple of drawers filled with tapes, actually. There are mixtapes and bootleg concert tapes, stuff like that. I just couldn't bring myself to part with them.\n\nI do have a cassette player, though. I don't use it very much.\n\nAVC: Did you own a lot of VHS tapes when you were little? What was your favorite?\n\nJG: When I was a kid, one of my favorites was UHF, the \"Weird Al\" movie. I would watch it over and over again. It's a pretty classic movie, and it's definitely one of those where the longer you watch it, you get those white lines on the screen, and it enhances the B movie aesthetic of the whole thing. It's better on a worn out VHS tape. That's the highest form of that movie.\n\nAVC: Do you ever think it's ironic that you're a band that's named for a sort of outdated format, but you guys really broke on the Internet?\n\nJG: I guess that's the dichotomy of analog and digital. When we started out, it was right around when people really started using the Internet to get music, so that's kind of funny. I guess I never really put too much thought into it, though.\n\nAVC: You're on tour right now. Do you have duct tape in the van?\n\nJG: Yes, we have duct tape, scotch tape, gaffer's tape, colored gaffer's tape. That stuff's the most fun to play with, by the way, the colored tape. It's about a quarter of an inch thick and it comes in 10 different colors. You can tape on things if you get bored on the road and it comes off easily. It's good for artwork.\n\nAVC: Have you guys ever used duct tape to fix one of your instruments on tour?\n\nJG: I've used duct tape and gaffer's tape for a lot of things, totally. Recently, I made the poor decision of using duct tape to hang posters on the wall in my basement and, surprisingly, it doesn't hold very well to paint. I have all these sticky marks all over my wall because they all fell down. So it's all grimy now and my wife is like, \"Really, you thought this was a good idea?\" I mean, it seemed like a better idea than holes in the wall, but now we have both. Tape can be really tantalizing to use, though. It's right there and it's so easy.\n\nAVC: Do you remember when Pee-wee Herman would use scotch tape on his face to make his nose like a pig's and other crazy things? Did you ever do that?\n\nJG: Yeah! I remember that! He would tape his eyes in certain ways. I definitely did that when I was a kid. Boredom will lead to a lot of things, and tape can do all sorts of things. Luckily, I never rolled with a crew of people that would duct tape people to doors or poles or anything, but I knew people who did that kind of stuff.\n\nAVC: Thanks for talking to us and have a safe trip. If you get bored, use that scotch tape on your face. You'll be the most popular guy in the van.\n\nJG: Hopefully we won't have to tape up any tires. There are lots of blown-out tires where we are right now. I guess we could also rip our arm hair off with tape. That would be a good way to stay awake. I'm going to spend the rest of the ride thinking about all the things I can do with tape."}

{"text": "For about a decade, brothers Jake and Jamin Orrall have been playing fuzzy, guitar-centric garage rock as JEFF the Brotherhood, releasing raw-sounding albums, usually recorded in three to four days, on their own Infinity Cat label. Later this month, they're releasing their major-label debut, Hypnotic Nights, which was produced by no less than the Black Keys' Dan Auerbach. It contains a few more keyboard tracks than usual and overall presents a more polished \u2014 but still unpredictable \u2014 take on the duo's signature sound. Part of that might have something to do with the fact they recorded this one in the space of a week.\n\nDespite such luxuries, the pair still enjoys the simple things in life. When we reached drummer Jamin, he said his biggest goals for the summer were swimming and canoeing with his friends \u2014 something he and vocalist-multi-instrumentalist Jake captured in their wild and NSFW video for the album's lead single, \"Sixpack.\" In it, they drink beer (duh), pass flasks, go skinny dipping and pass, uh, hand-rolled cigarettes to one another. It looks like a nice respite, but before long they'll be back on the road, touring in support of their record in their short bus, which Jamin says below is becoming more like home than ever before.\n\nOn your new album Hypnotic Nights, the Black Keys' Dan Auerbach produced. What did he bring most to the album?\n\nThe main thing was the sounds that we got for the record. He helped us a lot with song structure, changing things. He was almost like this living advice column or something. He brought another point of view, which we've never had. When it's just the two of us, we get really super deep and into it and don't come out of our own heads. There's never any perspective, so you never know what could have been different or what could have been better. Dan helped us with that.\n\nYour video for the song \"Sixpack\" just came out. It looks like it was fun to make.\n\nIt's pretty funny. We got a bunch of our friends to come with us to the river, which is what we normally do in the summer. We just filmed it this time. The song is about going to the river and canoeing.\n\nHas having a song called \"Sixpack\" encouraged people to buy you more beers?\n\n[Laughs] People always try to buy us beers. At a show recently, some kid brought a six-pack of homemade beer in this case that just said \"Sixpack\" on it, and that was kind of strange. But that was kind of cool. People try to get us to shotgun beers pretty often, but I hate doing it. [Laughs]\n\nHow was the homemade beer?\n\nI didn't try it. People bring you stuff and you never know what's really in it. Actually, this woman brought some weed caramel popcorn to one of our shows and I tried that. That was really good.\n\nWhat inspired the song \"Staring at the Wall\"?\n\nA lot of the songs, I can't talk about what they're about, because it's personal with Jake. And he won't talk about it either. But you can ask me more questions about that song and I'll just try to answer them.\n\nWhy is it about staring at the wall in the first place?\n\nWell, that's just something everybody does. Everybody can relate to that. It's just a good thing to write a song about. There are definitely dark events that inspired that, but I can't talk about them. Jake won't either.\n\nWatch the video for \"Sixpack\" here:\n\nWhy did a very synth-heavy cover of Black Sabbath's \"Changes\" make the album?\n\nWell, it sounds kind of cheesy but there are a lot of changes going on with us. We wanted to do that song because it kind of sums up where we're at with our musical path. We signed with Warner Bros., and our music style is changing a little. We're playing in new places and stuff in our lives is changing around. It's all good stuff, but we really like that song.\n\nIt was Jake's idea. He kind of did the whole thing when me, Dan and Colin, the engineer, went out to lunch. When we got back he had pretty much done the whole thing. I knew he was going to do it with loops and the vocals. There are probably going to be a lot of synths on the next record, so this was kind of a segue.\n\nYou approached it pretty differently from the original.\n\nWe wouldn't dare ever cover a normal Black Sabbath song. They're all too perfect. I would only be disappointed hearing a cover of a Black Sabbath song. There's no way to make it better. I think we tried to do a good job on \"Changes,\" because it's not their normal sound. There was more to play around with.\n\nDid you record any other covers?\n\nWe didn't do any other covers in that session, but we're about to put out a seven-inch on our label, Infinity Cat, of a Hole cover that we did. We picked \"Turpentine.\" That's the song to do. And we also have a cover song coming out on a Nick Lowe tribute album, \"Marie Provost,\" off his Jesus of Cool album. It's a really hard song to cover, because it's so well done already.\n\nLastly, you've recently been touring in a short school bus. Why is that?\n\nWe've been touring in it for the last three tours, so about four months. We had a van and we wanted something bigger, because we had more gear, because Jake keeps getting more amps. It's really annoying, but it's his thing, I guess.\n\nWe had a school bus a long time ago that Jake converted to run on vegetable oil, but the transmission went out and we didn't have any money so we just got rid of it. This one we bought from a daycare and ripped all the seats out. Jake and I built a loft bed and a couch in it to make it more like an RV. It gets really bad gas mileage but it's nice. It's like a house. You can sleep in it most of the time if the weather's right. There's no AC, but you can get a good cross breeze if you open the windows and the hatch in the top.\n\nHypnotic Nights is out July 17 on Warner Bros.Stream a four-song sampler EP here:"}

{"text": "Daytrotter Studio (Rock Island, IL)\n\nDec 1, 2011\n\nThere's always that attraction going round. There's never any end to it, hence there's never any end to what becomes of it. When attraction is partially due to other needs that have little to do with it - loneliness and boredom - those are the skid marks that you see crookedly swerving into the ditch, turning the guardrail into a twisted snarl, or leading to sad, lonely fire where everyone's just moving around and rubbing their hands together. It's this kind of attraction that is also wildly rampant. It's what leads to poor decisions and usually isn't lamented all that much. It just is. It leads people into the arms that they find to be the closest, not the safest or most loving. If it's just for a night or two, the long-term effects are minimal and there can be an abundance of stories to be had. One is able to draw out of every situation a lesson that can seem larger than it should be. The clarity can smack with a bark and an immediate, red welt.\n\nNashville singer and songwriter Caitlin Rose lets herself feel the things that get her caught in all kinds of traps, slings and sticky webs. She knows she's doing it and doesn't even dislike that it happens - smacking her mouth to the bitter taste left over on the other side of it. When you're courting heartbreak and actually, sorta need it to feel alive, you're not going to avoid it all that actively. You might not run out to find it, but you'll give it a big bear hug and a kiss on the lips when you do. Rose needs these ill-advised, chance encounters and these failed loves to feed her need to write about such things. They've got to come from somewhere and better to feel them herself than to have them shown or recited secondhand. It's the country way to do it yourself, to get your hands dirtied in the thickets of bad decisions and silly men. The way a shitty relationship behaves and detonates is always a thousand times better to hear about than one that's going well and has the icing still on the cake, replenished with every feeding. Rose sings enthusiastically about the thrills and chills that come with seeking out the companionship of a boy toy on the old Coasters song \"Youngblood,\" maybe because she identifies with feeling like she'll always be wearing the pants. She will be able to say where, when and how and determine its longevity, not the other way around. The pressure is diminished, but then again, there's no reason to believe that she doesn't thoroughly enjoy being completely out of control either.\n\nShe's best here, and elsewhere, when she is. When's she's the one taking the knocks and getting hurt, she's a brilliant chronicler of it all. She makes it sound as if it's all gonna be okay. She'll think about it all, mull on it, spin it into a chorus and a handful of classic and catchy Nashvillian verses and then she'll smoke a cigarette or two and catch a Budweiser. She'll set herself up for a do-over - for the rewind and the reenactment. She'll sing, \"And fall back into my absent arms/Fall back into routine disaster/Habit's the only place that you call home/Fall back into my desperate arms/Fall back into this old disaster/Cause it's better than spending all your nights alone,\" as she does on \"For The Rabbits,\" and then alter the sentiment a little to stick up for it, singing, \"Looking back at myself/It's wrong how much I changed for you.\" It's always a little of both - the shame and reality."}

{"text": "Dusted Features\n\nLife In Mono\n\nJapan's Mono are a rock quartet, but their take on rock grows from the drama, from the epic journeys of sound that music can trigger in the listener. Without a vocalist, their communication comes straight from the heart, through the instruments, and into the audience. Natural points of reference include Mogwai, SubArachnoid Space, Tarentel, and even Sigur Ros at points, but their feeling for emotional journeys through sound is very much their own.\n\nGuitarist Taka is the group's leader. The others number three: second guitarist Yoda, bassist Tamaki, and drummer Takada. I spoke to Taka before a show at San Francisco's Bottom of the Hill, where they flattened the audience with high peaks and low valleys of emotion. The waves of sound clearly demonstrated that this band have mastered dynamics at an instinctive level; best of all, the playing felt organic, and not overly calculated.\n\nMany thanks to Izumi Evers for translation assistance.\n\nDusted: How did you all meet?\n\nTaka: Around '97-'98, a certain genre of music was popular in Japan: electronica, big beat, abstract hip-hop. I could make music using sampling, but originally I'm a guitarist, so I naturally felt that I wanted to do something focusing on the guitar sound. At the time, with one of the bands I used to be in, it felt like something new was about to happen, but it wasn't clear. My feeling was that I wanted to do something new with guitar, and at the end of the '90s I was wondering. That was the time when My Bloody Valentine, Nirvana, all that music with guitar had already been exported, so it seemed like there was no way to create a new kind of music using guitar.\n\nSo that was the atmosphere of the Japanese music industry at the end of the '90s. It was 1999 when I met the drummer, Takada, and at that time I was using the computer to try to create a new style of music. That's when we established the basis of what we're doing now. But most of the places to play in Japan didn't know how to handle our kind of music, so we didn't play live. And because we were using computer sounds, the atmosphere, and the essence of human emotion sounded like it had been removed. So then I searched hard for some other members. It only took about a month, and then we were the band that we are right now.\n\nD: So was the change away from using computers because of a combination of the clubs not being prepared, and that it wasn't the sound you wanted?\n\nT: The computer used a click track to control the timing of the playing of the music. As the leader of the band I actually controlled and composed the music, but on the other hand the computer does the job too exactly. So to me it sometimes was just boring.\n\nD: How are the songs created now? What's the process?\n\nT: Before, I basically wrote the notes... There's a reason why I have to make this music. The fundamental reason, or the cause of creating the music, starts from my gut, from something within myself that I want to explore. That's the beginning, the basic cause...\n\nD: Do you write all of the songs fully composed?\n\nT: Well, when I explained about writing the music, I didn't mean that I actually write a script for the music. I use the computer as a tool, but that doesn't mean I'm depending on the computer. I'm the kind of guy who cannot go to sleep peacefully without creating something. So to prevent myself from not being able to create, I force myself to be exposed to external things, like movies and so on. I sort of force myself to become creative. I won't literally write songs down on a piece of paper, but I put pieces of creations into the computer.\n\nD: You record pieces into the computer so you won't forget them?\n\nT: Yes, I wouldn't be able to repeat that state of mind for the music, so I do that.\n\nD: Do all of the songs come from you?\n\nT: First I come up with the original sound, and then I introduce it to the other members, share it with them first. If that piece of sound doesn't click with any of the other members, that means that my creation won't be able to communicate with other people, so we won't use it. But if that music somehow stimulates the other members' brains and creativity, somehow we all unite together and start creating, and then we establish a song. So that's the process.\n\nAlso, we're touring right now, and every time we tour we present music. If that music fails to reach the audience's heart then it's not creative, and that's not what I want to do. Every day I feel like I'm creating music by touring.\n\nWe're not making music only to impress people, like in one direction. What we're doing is... If the music won't reach the closest people, the band's members, then that music won't connect to other people either. Music that will connect is what I'm pursuing, not like other musicians who are just doing it to show off.\n\nD: How do you feel about communicating with music that doesn't have words?\n\nT: Words are there for us to live, or to live together. I don't want to say that all words are just communication, but there is a lot of lying within words. You can lie...words don't contain 100% truth. But sound is at a more deeply subconscious level that directly reaches to the other person's subconscious level. I feel that I'm able right now to perform this music, it's coming from my truth, and that will enable the audience to sense it. That's the communication that I'm doing.\n\nD: Are there other bands that do actually lie with their music? Sometimes you can tell that they don't really feel what they're playing.\n\nT: (laughs) Mostly! I feel mostly that with other bands, the words are lying, but I can totally sympathize with the sounds. I can imagine an atmosphere, why I want to create the music, what kind of motivation I had to come up with the music. That must be a very very private part of oneself, but even though that's very private, it's really related to the music, and everybody is sharing that.\n\nD: Is it more difficult to lie with instrumental music?\n\nT: No, it's easy. It's possible, maybe it's easy too. Even back in the time of Beethoven, those people are artists, they're very poor, and in order to live, they created those pieces of art to please the royal families. So there's the idea of capitalism, creating music as business, established even back then. Especially right now, the music industry is nothing but business. Everybody has the intention to create some music to please the market. But I really think that music is supposed to be more beautiful, and I'd like to express that truth.\n\nD: Have you ever made some music that you felt very strongly about, but that you decided would not be understood by the audience?\n\nT: Fortunately I've never had that happen. Three years ago when I first started playing outside Japan, I was curious if maybe because of the cultural differences, people might interpret it differently. But I never really felt that way, so that's good.\n\nD: I wondered about that, if the audience reacts differently in the U.S. and in Japan.\n\nT: How they listen is different. Over here they're wild. In Japan it's very subtle, because maybe Japanese people aren't able to really express how they're feeling. But then when I'm watching, I really feel something, and I sometimes see that the audience are receiving, but they don't express it.\n\nD: I've noticed that also. Audiences in Japan will sit and watch very closely, but there's no reaction until maybe afterwards.\n\nT: Yes. Today is the time of the Internet, and right after the shows I receive an amazing amount of response by email, so then I try to respond back. Without that kid of response people seem kind of dead, and I just wouldn't know. Sometimes I've wondered, did I make a mistake? (laughs)\n\nD: Since the songs are instrumental, the titles of the songs and albums become very important, because it's what people will first see to get an idea about the song. How do you think about that?\n\nT: Actually I suppose the opposite. I don't really pay too much attention to the titles. Usually I don't even title the songs -- other people make the titles. I understand that they could be a hook for the reader to listen to the music, so they will provide the door to enter the world of the music. But if it's something I wanted to explain in words, I wouldn't make it into music anyway. So it's the same as lyrics: to me, I'm just making something that's undescribable, therefore I'm making music. So the titles are just not a main concern.\n\nQ: I wondered about titles like \"Mopish Morning, Halation Wiper\" -- does it have any meaning?\n\nT: What I can remember is that one or two years ago when we were touring, we played in Washington DC. Because our music was too loud, we were kicked out. I was so pissed that I turned up full volume and wrecked the equipment. Then on the way back, in the car, there was a long tunnel, very dark. It was raining. We drove through the tunnel and then we saw the shining sky. One of the others said that the music was something like that, and that's how we made the title. To me, the song is pretty dark, but it also has the potential to continue and move on, so it's not really all dark.\n\nD: I have to ask about the album title, One Step More and You Die -- it's very dark.\n\nT: I think the music industry in Japan is very closed, compared to the musicians from US or Europe, because the market is small in Japan. So we have to work outside our area, into the U.S. and Europe, although I could make a living just focusing on performing in Japan, because there is a market. Outside Japan, I didn't personally know other bands, and I didn't even know how to approach outside Japan's market, so I struggled to find a deal. So there was a time, still today really, when every time I would step forward, there was some kind of force against me. So there's always the struggle to expand my music into the worldwide market. There's some kind of a feeling there that's in the title. At the time when I made that title, it was the worst moment of struggling. The next album could be more positive.\n\nD: The first album here was from the Tzadik label -- how did you meet them, through John Zorn? And then how did you find Arena Rock?\n\nT: I wanted to perform in New York because I felt that New York was more suitable to the music than Tokyo. So I searched, and found that label, and I sent some things to introduce myself to John Zorn, and that's how we made the connection. Right after we made the Tzadik album, I was looking for other labels in the U.S. to do more. I didn't really like the underground scene or the indie scene, but we weren't really hardcore either. Arena Rock seemed to be very suitable for the direction that we want to go, so I sent something to them.\n\nQ: Is there a scene in Japan for Mono now?\n\nT: Compared to 3 years ago, the audience is definitely more established in Japan. And also I set up a label by myself to release the music, like our first 4-track EP. I've also established an import label, because the music industry is, like I said, very closed. There are labels like Sub Pop, Matador -- they're there, but it's really hard for Japanese audiences to encounter that kind of music unless the music magazine does reviews and talks about it. Then finally the audience will recognize them. I'm the kind of guy who researches to discover music from another country. I wanted to introduce the music in Japan, so I established my own label. It covers from Okinawa all the way to Hokkaido, all over Japan, so I've put myself in a responsible position. Now I can coordinate a tour if they want to do one, because those people of course want to tour in Japan. But before, they didn't know how to do it. Like for me, if I wanted to tour in the U.S., through knowing bands from outside of Japan who share the same struggle, we can cooperate. So I can do what I want to do outside Japan, and they can do what they want to do in Japan. It's very fair.\n\nD: What's the name of the label?\n\nT: Human Highway Records. My dream is not anything special. I'm Japanese, so of course I want to perform in Japan. But there are many bands who, because they're not popular in Japan, they just go overseas. Then when they become well-known outside Japan, they tend to stay outside Japan. On the other hand, if the band is already popular and well-established in Japan, they always want to remain in Japan, they don't want to get out. What I want to do is simply to perform, nothing special.\n\nI hate the major labels because they just care about success. If the band doesn't do well, they don't care, they'll just get rid of the band. If the band does well, okay, they'll extend the contract to 2 years, and they expect the band to make more money. This kind of major label behavior gives me a big motivation to show them that I can do it without the money. If I can perform in Japan as well as in the U.S. and other countries, to the same kind of audience, I might be able to get their attention and show them that it can be done."}
{"text": "For Once in My Life, I'll Be Spontaneous: an EHS record review\n\nSo here's the thing that bugs me about Tucson, Arizona's \u2026music video?: as a grammatical perfectionist, I hate the way the band's name makes my sentences look. No, I'm not asking a question there. No, I'm not trailing into a thought. That's just how the dude formats it. And as an iTunes perfectionist, I hate the way the band's name is sorted in my library. The program knows enough to alphabetize it starting with the 'm,' so it falls correctly between Mull Historical Society and My Bloody Valentine. But it doesn't know enough to jump directly to it when I type 'mus.' And it won't let me find it quickly by typing in an ellipsis, either.\n\nTurns out those are about the only two things that bug me about \u2026music video?. Turns out, in fact, that I'm totally addicted to the new album from Paul Jenkins's one-man pop/indie/electronica/rock band.\n\nSee, the album does this thing where it starts out all mysterious, with the hiss and whine of an off-the-air TV station (on the intro track \"Ellipsis\"; the album's ethereal outro track is called \"Question Mark.\" Get it?). Suddenly kicks in this big, heavy Amusement Parks on Fire-esque guitar riff and liberal stabs at a simulated crash cymbal, like some looming dark night-time anthem. When it cuts down to the album's first verse, though, you hear a better example of the trademark \u2026mv? sound: glitchy programmed drums, Jenkins's low, warm, voice, free from any audible effect, and a sparkling plucked electric guitar line. When the chorus falls back down\u2013that warm dark guitar riff that started everything\u2013it sounds like some strange Smashing Pumpkins-turn-shoegaze movement, sans Billy Corgan's occasionally-tolerable whine.\n\n\"Another Random Tragedy\" sounds a bit like The Flaming Lips\u2013mostly in Jenkins's voice\u2013but holds onto that distinct \u2026mv? sound that you'll get to know if you listen to even a few tracks; there's another glitchy beat underneath, a post-rock-style single-string guitar line in the background, and a little breakdown that sounds exactly like your laptop, your cellphone, and your microwave are all flirting with each other in some kind of electronic bizarre love triangle. \"The Little Boy on Fire\" is equally Flaming Lips-inspired, and possibly one of the most straightforward tracks on the record, featuring mostly piano and synth sounds, with a super catchy syncopated beat that helps buoy the mournful piano chords and woeful chorus.\n\nThe album also stalks through a couple darkly playful tracks with Gotham-like musical landscapes. \"For the Sake of Argument I Disagree\" rides a grinding fuzzy bassline through its choruses with Jenkins weaving a tale of jealousy and regret through Elliott Smith-like whispers and bent blue notes. Its chorus is unexpectedly pretty, with a glittery harpish Nintendo-style synth line. \"Seasick\"\u2013devious- and clever-sounding, pulsing with a distorted drum beat and a theremin-like synth line\u2013could pass as a song in an imaginary Tim Burton film.\n\n\"Sugar Ghost\" comes off like some lost post-rock tune rocketed into the future, with its chiming falling guitar line and heady, stuttering drums. Jenkins's vocals gently push and then tear into the middle of the tune, carrying a romantically desperate wail-turned-impressive-falsetto (Glen Hansard-style) into a crushing tide made up of a mighty rising guitar riff and smashing drums. \"Sparklemilk Warning\" is equally emotive and equally fragile-yet-powerful, with crashing cymbals, a ghostly falsetto, and twirling organ lines that anyone who ever dug Volcano I'm Still Excited!! will admire. Both songs are impossible to imagine as anything but stunning at a live \u2026mv? performance.\n\nThe album's central tracks, though, happen to be my favorite. \"House of Cards\" is from the movie from the future, somehow blending an old-school-drum 'n' bass beat with a cool wave of electronic noise, an ocean of digital breath washing through the song's chorus, with little electronic twitters and blip-buoys. Jenkins manages to create some extremely interesting sounds on this record; I find myself drawn back to the record just as much by these weird little noises as by its tight hooks and big soaring choruses. \"Shipwrec\" somehow makes musical the sound of futuristic vacuum cleaners or your computer's hard drive spinning, and it's strangely addictive and peaceful to let those sounds swirl around on either side of your head. It's one of those beautiful night-time songs that can make you feel wistful and hopeful and melancholy and content all at the same time.\n\nAnd then there's \"The Day I Exploded,\" the album's brightest candidate for ambassador to indie radio. The song begins with the sound of blowing wind and a rich layer of twittering glitch-cricket clicks and then gallops quickly into a shiny busy verse and explodes into a triumphant, confident chorus. There also appears in the middle of the song a little lush glitchpop garden that would sound at home on a Seal Beach EP-era Album Leaf recording. But suddenly there's that triumphant guitar riff again!\n\nJenkins's vocal delivery is strong throughout the album, and the lyrics sound generally sincere, if not very poetic. There is the occasional awkward line (as on \"The Little Boy on Fire,\" where can be found a line about \"reindeer games\"; I understand it's a reference to the old Christmas standard and all, but I can't help thinking about that terrible Ben Affleck movie). But it's Jenkins's sincerity that sells you. Or that sold me. When, on the just-mentioned \"The Day I Exploded,\" Jenkins sing-shouts about how he'll \"keep it in a safe place,\" I believe him, and then when I'm further assured that \"you'll be able to find it whenever you need it,\" I wish the \"you\" referred to me because I would love to have that kind of peace of mind.\n\nSo is this a lyrical album? It is. You can hear what he's saying. There's nothing cringe-worthy. The stories are human, sympathetic, sometimes a little quirky and weird, and interesting (my favorite of them being \"House of Cards,\" about a vaguely romantic companion who happens to be small enough to fit in a pocket). But ultimately this is a sound album, and I find myself listening (on repeat) for all those strange little engineered noises swimming around under or above the clever and well-made pop tunes.\n\nSadly, you're not likely to catch a \u2026music video? show in Denver anytime soon. Jenkins seems to be in that stage in a musician's career where he makes music simply for the joy of making music and letting people hear it. Not much chance of a cross-country tour. He's without a record label, a manager, or a booking agent (although he wouldn't mind having any of those on board, according to the \u2026mv? MySpace page). But if you find yourself in Tucson in time for one of his shows, you're likely in for a smashing (and beautifully weird) performance. Would I be a total asshole if I added \"And if you make it to a \u2026music video? show, tell 'im EHS sent ya!\"?"}

{"text": "On the Newfound Subtlety of the Arcade Fire\n\nSo let's get a couple things out of the way up front: No, Regine Chassagne was not used nearly as much as she should have been. And yes, it's really long. Too long by a quarter, probably. This is either its fatal flaw or not a flaw at all. It's hard to say. We'll get there, though.\n\nWith the very obvious exception of Radiohead, there's not a band in the world that inspires more impassioned fandom than the Arcade Fire, and it's not terribly difficult to understand why: they've long operated under the principle that the weight of the world hangs in the balance of every note they play, every word they sing. They're good enough songwriters and bombastic enough performers that we buy into their plight and adopt it as our own, either because it was always ours, or because there's beauty in those struggles, we're sure of it. Then we thank them for offering us glorious, if also temporary, relief from them, through cathartic, explosive choruses and celebratory crescendos. It's a curious and exceedingly rare type of relationship that's been at the core of successful alt-associated bands from Nirvana to Bright Eyes. The Replacements, even.\n\nWin Butler and the rest of the Arcade Fire struggled through family issues and death on their royalty-affirming 2004 debut, Funeral, and through bouts with organized religion and other institutions on 2007's slightly disappointing Neon Bible. With The Suburbs, the struggle is between young and old, between long-haired kids and short-haired kids, between lost kids and kids who never knew enough to be lost in the first place. In a nutshell, it's an album about the quiet virtues of small town life versus the lofty ambition of city-life, and about how neither of them are ever quite what we think they'll be. But for the first time, they've released an album that's almost all struggle and very little release. It's an interesting approach, but it poses a few problems.\n\nFor one, it can make getting through it from start to finish feel like something of a chore. There's not enough variation from song to song, let alone within songs, in terms of dynamic shifts or the theatricality that's characterized their best work. The band sounds restrained and borderline uninspired on mid-tempo tracks like \"Modern Man,\" \"Deep Blue,\" \"Half Light I\" and \"Wasted Hours,\" none of which feature much in the way of their carefully honed specialities. Even \"City With No Children,\" admittedly one of the album's potential centerpieces, is essentially a single musical thought that comes to a sudden and surprisingly unceremonious end after a tidy but uneventful three minutes. The excellent but confounding \"Suburban War\" does the same thing\u2014it builds slowly and intently, then never exactly exhales.\"Ready to Start\" almost does, and \"Rococo\" definitely does, but it still feels minor in comparison to what we know they're capable of. Regine's \"Empty Room\" is non-stop, perfectly executed catharsis from the word go. It's the exception, though.\n\nThe lack of musical resolution\u2014or at least an obvious one--extends to the album's themes, too. Even though The Suburbs goes on longer than it needs to be (maybe, unless it doesn't\u2014more on that later still), the album still somehow manages to feel incomplete. Whatever it is you're waiting for all along\u2014for one side or the other to come out of those struggles victorious\u2014it never quite happens. Much of the album exists in what is, I guess necessarily, a gray area. It turns out the art school kids in \"Ready to Start\" were right to warn against blood-sucking businessmen, but the narrator of \"City With No Children\" wonders if he's any better off than the bloodsuckers (\"I used to think I was not like them, but I'm beginning to have my doubts\") and even warms to their Real World pragmatism (\"When you're hiding underground, the rain can't get you wet/But do you think your righteousness can pay the interest on your debt?/I have my doubts about it\"). In \"Suburban War,\" one character loses touch with a friend who cuts his hair short, signaling a change in priorities, the pursuit of a straight life that stands in opposition to the one they'd agreed to, the one they'd dreamt of. Years later, though, the still-long-haired narrator finds himself back at home, peering into car windows looking for his friend. These situations pop up all over the record, and it's frustrating. Butler recognizes the conflicts, understands both sides, then seems almost to throw his hands in the air and walk away. It's disappointing, but it's understandable. This shit is complicated.\n\nFor much of the record, Butler speaks in general terms. These aren't Springsteen songs, and they don't try to be. Characters don't have names, and they don't have particularly detailed back-stories. For the most part, we don't know how old these people are or what really makes them tick. There's a lot of talk about \"the kids\" and \"the suburbs\" as universally understood entities, and while it never quite comes off as condescending or disrespectful, it can at times seem lazy. But then there's something else to consider.\n\nThe Suburbs could have been a record that told 16 distinct stories about 16 distinct people who learn 16 distinct lessons in 16 distinct neighborhoods, and it would have been an admirable, time-honored approach that could have paid great dividends. Instead, we get a record where the stories sort of bleed into one another, where a series of talking points are repeated, quietly, over and over again, with only slight variation from scenario to near identical scenario. We got a record that simply refuses to end, a record that sometimes seems like it will never actually reveal anything to us. And it feels right. The album works the way real suburbs work: affecting change not through flashy, story-book epiphanies, but by gently tapping you on the shoulder and saying the same things day in and day out, forever, to the point where most people don't even pay attention. The Suburbs is a record about, and for, the people who do."}
{"text": "We Are The City's New Identity\n\nby Kirsty Chan \u2013 Riverside Secondary, Coquitlam BC May 16, 2011\n\nWe Are the City talks to Youthink about their new album and how far they've come since forming in 2008.\n\nNot many bands could go from high-school outcasts to the inaugural winners of The Peak Performance Project within just a few short years \u2013 and even fewer could have done it while retaining the integrity of Kelowna's We Are The City.\n\nSince forming in 2008, the prog-rock trio has been steadily gaining fans and stunning critics. But 2010 was a year of change for the band as they lost original guitarist, David Menzel, and found a replacement in Blake Enemark.\n\nWith the new lineup in place, in March of 2011, We Are The City released High School, an experimental concept EP that explores the band's high-school memories with the clarity of a few years' worth of hindsight. I recently got a chance to talk to drummer Andy Huculiak about the trio's latest project and what high school was like for the boys of We Are The City.\n\nYT: High School is a concept album. Can you tell us the story of how that concept was developed?\nAH: Cayne [keyboards] and I had a bit of downtime when our [ex]-guitarist, David, was not as much involved in the music. We started a band called High School and it was just us messing around and going lyrically into some places that we wouldn't have gone with We Are The City, like, some darker memories from our past. We didn't really want to associate ourselves with We Are The City so we tied T-shirts over our faces. After that we thought, \"Well, we're recording, we have this material, why not record it?\" So, that's where, I guess, the imagery and the concept came from.\n\nYT: Why write an EP about high school? What is it that you guys found so inspirational about the high-school experience?\nAH: Well, there are a lot of experiences there, positive and negative. High school is a hilarious time because you're just trying to figure out what you want to do with your life, and you've got all these people that are in this one building that are forced to coexist even though everybody is so different, you know? So that for us was just different experiences, parties that we went to, relationships that we had, be it good or bad things. It was just really easy for us to go, \"Oh, remember that time?\" and draw out lyrics from it.\n\nYT: To all those kids in high school right now, what advice do you have?\nAH: Even though there's a lot of expectations and a lot of social pressure and all that, don't let it define who you are as a person. Do what you want to do\u2026 and I would hope that's good things... I feel like a lot of times in high school being a nice person is almost what makes you uncool or something. So, maybe my advice would be to make your own path and not try and follow in the footsteps of someone who's good-looking or a football star or something like that. I guess just be yourself and be a nice person. Things get really cool after you graduate. Just continue to be a nice person and you're set.\n\nYT: How would you describe yourselves in high school?\nAH: Well, in middle school, I was very much the person that was bullied. In high school, I kind of separated myself. I didn't really fit into any groups like the popular kids or the unpopular kids. I just kind of stayed away from all that. That was Cayne and myself; we went to high school together. We were both very\u2026 kind of isolated. We still went to class and everything, but we just didn't really buy into the whole social structure.\n\nYT: How has having a new member affected your band?\nAH: In a lot of ways it's been like a breath of fresh air to have someone come in that's got new ideas and you're experiencing everything new again with them. In other ways, there are definitely some growing pains. As far as the sound goes, it will definitely affect our sound, but I feel really confident that we'll be able to write stuff we're excited about.\n\nYT: What's up next for We Are The City?\nAH: We're going to be writing for the full-length and then recording, then maybe a little bit of touring... It's kind of funny because the EP got released just not too long ago, but it's already been finished for four months\u2026 maybe a bit longer. I feel like I'm just ready to do the next thing. We're really ready, really excited.\n\nYT: Why did you decide to release an EP rather than a full-length album?\nAH: I think there was a lot of pressure on us. We felt a lot of pressure to release \"the next big thing\" like, the next full-length album. Not \"big thing\" like people were expecting big things from us, but \"big thing\" as in a full-length album. People were expecting something from us and I think we just kind of came to the conclusion that that pressure was unnecessary. We didn't need to put that much pressure on ourselves. So we decided to take these songs that we'd written without any intention of them being We Are The City songs and just thought, \"Why not put them on an EP and release that?\" So now we're going to go work on a full-length\u2026 Well, right now, actually, we're writing it. We'll be recording in the summer. It feels a little bit like the pressure's off, which is nice because we've got something out there.\n\nYT: What does the songwriting process look like for you?\nAH: I guess, it's different every time. For the first album it was all three of us: Cayne, myself, and our old guitarist, David. We'd write together and it would be a very tedious process that would take a lot of thought and a lot of working out to get to the final product. For High School, Cayne and I just went with whatever ideas came through our head. It was a very fast process and a very productive one, so that was cool. I'm not entirely sure what the next one will look like, it might be entirely different\u2026 I have no idea.\n\nYT: High School was produced by Tom Dobrzanski from The Zolas. What was it like working with him?\nAH: Oh, awesome. He's just a great guy. They're [The Zolas] great musicians. Actually, we worked with Tom on our last album so we were feeling comfortable with him. He's just great, just a great guy. We have the same goals; we both really want to make something we're proud of, and for Tom it's not just another job. He's really putting himself into it just like us. I guess he could be considered like, a fourth member, which is cool.\n\nYT: You seem to have a good relationship with a lot of local bands and artists. How have those friendships impacted you?\nAH: I'm so humbled to be even friends with some, acquaintances with others. Even, you know, friends of ours, Said The Whale, just won a Juno and I just never imagined myself to be in a position where one of my friends won a Juno. It's so awesome. It's something that, dare I say, the rest of Canada doesn't have, is like, a really tight-knit musical community. On the West Coast and Vancouver in particular, the bands are so supportive of each other, which is really awesome. In certain fields, there's a tendency to be competitive or to one up the other person, to do bigger shows or sell more CDs. [Vancouver] is a total community.\n\nYT: Speaking of the local music community, it's been just over a year since you won the Peak Performance Project. How has that cash prize of $150,000 changed your band?\nAH: Well, I mean, it definitely opened up a lot of doors for us. Things that we couldn't do before, like, say if a tour came up, we'd really have to look at things and say, \"How many seats are we going to sell? How much is the guarantee for this show? How much is it going to cost us in gas to get up there?\" So, now we don't have to do that. Now, when opportunities come up, we can just kind of do it. You know, for the next album we don't have to necessarily sign to any particular label in hopes that they'll pay for it. In that sense, it's been so awesome to have enough money to be able to do what the band wants. Which is so cool because the band, for me, is what I want to do, so, yeah it's great.\n\nYT: Beyond the money, how else has the Peak Performance Project affected the band?\nAH: Well, positively. I would say it's given us a lot of exposure and then I'd say with everything, money or otherwise, once a band gets to a certain level, there's got to be some decisions made morally about where you want to go. So, I'd say the more exposure a band gets, or the more politics and business becomes involved, the more you have to reevaluate things. In that way it's also affected the band in that we're kind of reevaluating where we want to go with things and how much\u2026 it's kind of hard to explain\u2026 it's kind of like, how much we want to let the money affect us. Sometimes when you get a lot of money, you have to get to a point where it's like, \"OK, how do I not let this get to my head?\" So, it's like a reevaluation as well.\n\nYT: You made a video for each song on the EP with your company, Amazing Factory. As both a musician and a filmmaker how important is the music video aspect to you?\nAH: Well, I think it's really great. That's awesome that you know I'm in Amazing Factory! It's something that's really cool, especially it's something kind of different about us than other bands, that we have that mind for film. I feel like us and Amazing Factory, at the same time are kind of helping each other out. So, that's really cool that we can provide a platform for Amazing Factory and at the same time Amazing Factory really helps us out by making these awesome pieces of art for us. I just think it's so cool to have that experience, you know, where you listen to music and then you watch a video and it's not just something where you paid another company to do it. You don't just have their interpretation of it; it's very much a very cohesive, tight-knit kind of thing, which is really cool.\n\nYT: For High School, was there a conscious effort to have the videos tell a story?\nAH: Well, we just had a screening in Kelowna, so after watching those all again, it's weird. When Amazing Factory started working on them, they didn't literally interpret the songs, they did their own interpretation of it, which is great that they did that. When you watch the videos, it's a progression. The music videos aren't necessarily all connected but there are things that tie them all together. I think when you watch it, it's very much like a short film or an art piece there's very much a beginning, middle and an end. It doesn't necessarily tell a story, but it does portray some emotions and themes of the work.\n\nYT: You guys interact and share a lot with your fans through social media. How important do you think that has been in your success as a band?\nAH: I think it's so awesome. I don't know how much I owe how far we've come to the social media networks, but I will say that it's just so cool. It's something that gives everybody a fair chance, instead of before where you had to sign to a label and play a few shows before people knew about you then people could connect with you. It's kind of like everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is able to talk. Now, it's more even about answering questions and talking to people rather than just playing a show or just making good music. Which is cool, because now I think you're seeing a lot more just nice people becoming successful. If you actually have a rock star attitude or a mean way about you, then the chances of you becoming successful are actually lower which I think is actually more fair that way. I just like being able to connect with people. That's what the band is about for me, just being able to connect with people.\n\nYT: Who handles the social media accounts?\nAH: That's me. Yeah, well, actually Cayne doesn't really go near the Internet. He does on his own time, but not at the band's expense. He's not the most computer literate. There's this thing where you advance shows, so what you do is you book a show and you later send an email to find out when you're loading in, the set time and all that. He was advancing a bunch of shows\u2026 that was the duty that was given to him. He must have sent out like, five to 10 different emails to people that were wrong. They had the wrong dates on them and the wrong names and everything. One guy just emailed back and said, \"Oh, you mean this show on this date?\" Then he answered all the questions and then he said \"Who or what is a Cayne?\" That was like, the end of the line. So, after that we were like \"Cayne, look, you're a great guy but maybe this isn't your thing.\"\n\nYT: You are a young band. Do you ever feel that that has been a disadvantage?\nAH: No, if anything I feel like it might be an advantage, just because we're getting started early. The older I get the more I realize that, \"Oh, one more year and we haven't done this or that.\" Then, at the same time, that kind of falls to the wayside and I start to remember what this band and what I want my life to be about. It's not how far I make it in the music industry, it's not about how many CDs we sell, or how big of a show it is, it's more about, I guess, portraying a message or trying to live out an earnest life doing this. So, I guess at any age you can do that and I don't really feel like it's a disadvantage or an advantage. It just is.\n\nYT: If you had to describe We Are The City in three words, what words would you use?\nAH: I would say, \"progressive, alternative rock.\" That's kind of a generic way to explain it. If I could use three words to describe us as people, I would say we're, \"well-intentioned men.\" That's what I'd say"}
{"text": "Word of the Day: Spoonerism. The definition? What Com Truise is to Tom Cruise, verbally.\n\nBefore I started listening to this brand spankin' new album from Com Truise, I looked at the ever-instrumental itunes genius recommendations, and I thought, oh, I like most of those people. Among them: Justice, Digitalism, Holy Ghost!, Chromatics, YACHT, blah blah, music that you probably like too, because it's good.\n\nAll of his summer tour dates are in Europe, with the exception of his stop in Chicago, where he will be playing North Coast Festival. If you've been to Europe recently, and you went to a festival or a dimly lit underground club/dance floor with a cover, then that might give you an inkling of what this music is about before actually clicking that play button. And if you haven't done that rather obscure activity (this is more likely) then the music will give you an idea of what the European dimly lit underground dance floor is all about\u2026it works both ways.\n\nMy mom or yours might say, \"that just sounds like noise to me.\"\n\nSeth Haley hails from the electronic music hotbed of upstate New York, where he has been, as he says on his website, \"De-thawing in the Jersey sunshine, I compute mid-fi synth-wave, slower-motion funk.\" Is that not the most unnecessarily specific-sounding description of one's own creation that ever happened? Well, to put it simply, no, it's not. It is not only not overly specific, but it's right on.\n\nSide note: he is the second person I have ever heard (or read) use the phrase \"de-thaw.\"\n\nAs his description might indicate, Haley knows exactly what he is doing, or making. Only seconds after thinking how the aptly named opening track, \"Open\" is perfect videogame music, he there came a sample straight out of a video game. This music is the golden age of video game music, where you still got to pick in the settings page whether you wanted mono sound or stereo. Megaman would jam. And I, like Megaman, jammed.\n\nCom Truise brings disparate parts of the sound spectrum and jams them (like Megaman and I) together to make something where the synth waves and the percussion is spotty but there when it needs to be. Each segment of his production feels like a reaction to the last, and the amalgam is so harmoniously chaotic that those actions and reactions kind of make sense.\n\n\"Alfa Beach\" could have come from an 80s movie, with that electronic drum kit sound and the funky Jim Belushi-on-a-mission high synth high-synthing away, but then it breaks down into something jazzier, with a splashy cymbal. Then, like a reaction to the breakdown, Belushi is running again.\n\nYxes: It's \"sexy\" backwards. It confused me for a while, I kept trying to pronounce it in French, like Yves. The sample that goes SEXYYYY in the song pretty much gave it away.\n\nHaley is an artist for a very specific ilk, and if you are within than ilk, you will appreciate this music immensely. On the other hand, this is not pop. Com Truise is not a people pleaser, at least not in this day and age. It is playful but serious in a way that walks the line of nostalgic and envelope-pushing. Keep on de-thawing, Truise. I have some Megaman to play."}
{"text": "Ones To Watch: Peace\n\n\"I remember thinking, 'Why aren't I in a band called Peace?'\" Harrison Koisser snorts. \"It sounded an awesome idea.\"\nBored in the suburban Birmingham office he worked in (he's now a \"full-time scrounger\"), a photograph celebrating the end of World War Two inspired Harrison to daydream about setting peace signs to music.\nAlongside his brother Samuel, Harrison recruited Douglas Castle and Dominic Boyce (\"proper hippies, with cloaks, bare feet and headscarves\") to create the rush of guitars and happy-pills melodies that characterise Peace's songs.\n\nDip-dyed t-shirts, their huge peace symbol logo, and sentences suffixed with \"cool, man\" illustrate Peace's \"love of mother earth\", yet their songs betray some altogether different influences.\nAfter months of partying with techno-heads Joe And Will Ask, Harrison began exploring the idea of replicating the heavy electronics that soundtracked his weekends, with guitars. \"We're technically a guitar band, but it doesn't always sound that way; I like guitars that don't sound like guitars,\" he explains.\nEarly release 'Bblood' prompted comparisons to Foals, yet it's the ecstatic crescendo rather than its hi-octane guitar lines, that best illustrate Peace's sound.\n\"That comparison isn't relevant,\" Samuel says. \"'Bblood' was the first thing we wrote, it's a small part of us.\"\nIndeed, Peace are carving a covetable aesthetic in the vein of Harrison's beloved Creation Records. Landing somewhere between acid house and Aztec Camera, their whirlpool of syrupy melodies, muscular rhythms and miasmic guitars is tied together by a desire to bend their instruments' capacity, to surprise people.\n\"We want to make people feel awesome when they hear us and say, 'What the fuck just happened to me?'\"\nThey're leaving an increasing number of people asking themselves that very question. Via 3,000 capacity shows with The Twang (better than it sounds, honest), Peace are beginning to realise their vision."}
{"text": "If there was ever a reason to start up a musical side project, pioneering a far-out sub-genre like \"doom-wop\" would be it.\n\n\"I guess I coined the term sort of facetiously. I'm not sure how much doom metal will actually shine through,\" Islands frontman Nick Thorburn tells Spinner of his new outfit, which falls sonically somewhere between low-frequency drone and classic doo-wop.\n\nStill in its early stages, the currently-untitled project is a collaboration between Thorburn and Ryan Kattner -- otherwise known as Honus Honus, frontman for Philadelphia's Man Man. The new partnership isn't intended to eclipse the pair's respective day jobs. \"We're just trying to make each other laugh and enjoy each other's company creatively,\" Thorburn explains.\n\nThe group's repertoire may still be limited -- two or three songs in Thorburn's estimation -- but it's quite an achievement when you consider the cross-state commute Kattner has to make every time the duo feels like working on what the the New York-based Thorburn calls their \"old-timey beats.\"\n\nWith news of doom-wop's debut sparking interest throughout the blogosphere, you'd assume that Thorburn and Kattner would do their best to capitalize on the hype with a quick bout of releases. According to the ex-Montrealer though, that's not how they're going to play it. \"We won't release a proper record necessarily,\" Thorburn says. \"We're probably going to release all the tracks on the Internet at the same time, do something forward-thinking.\"\n\nThat's frustrating news for those dying to get a sense of what doom-wop is all about, but by the time we actually get the chance to hear the duo's tracks firsthand, they might be dealing with an entirely different genre, if Thorburn's free-flowing attitude is any indication. \"One of the completed songs has more of a 'doom-reggae' feel than doom-wop,\" he says, \"but we'll see.\""}

{"text": "BBC Review\n\nFresh out of school and into the glass-filled sandpit of the real world, Those Dancing Days arrive proffering a much-anticipated debut. A parping fanfare announces the invasion of chirrupy Swedish girl pop - and the weight of frenzied expectation. Their Myspace tracks generated oodles of plays, singles Run Run and Hitten tickled the hype machine - so was the rest worth waiting for?\n\nImmediately spirited away on the swift drum rolls of Falling In Fall, and carrying more than a few of Nina's 99 Red Balloons, it's clear we're headed to a far-off kingdom. It's a land where it's possible to be happy and sad at once, and where early promise doesn't fizzle into disappointment. Run Run is its national anthem - a homage to freedom that feels like pelting down a really, really steep hill before bouncing off into the unknown on a giant drum skin.\n\nThroughout the album, prancing, synth staccato leads the way as Linnea J\u00f6nsson's vocals flutter around - in turns tremulous and forceful but never shrill. Hitten is her sugary flirtation with therapy, a journey to ''make things easier for everyone including me''. Elsewhere, their naivety is played to knowing advantage and Actionman is a delightful, deliberately childlike goodbye to a relationship.\n\nThe tomorrow-never-knows sentiment of Shuffle typifies an art for tender contemplation amidst the hand-claps, but also marks a boundary to their range. While each track is a perfectly-tuned bittersweet blast of youthful exuberance, songs on the latter half - like Kids - suffer from a touch of 'OK, we get it'.\n\nHowever, no sooner does doubt set in than Those Dancing Days takes a hammond organ to the disco and unleashes a glittering track that's a fitting tribute to the quintet. As Space Hero Suits prepares for departure from the kingdom, you're by their side donning the astro helmet. Leaping aboard and rocketing into the orbit of clever pop it's clear that wherever they're going next, it's worth going along for the ride"}
{"text": "Given that Sigur Ros seem to be going to increasing lengths with each record to seem less abstract and more human, a collection that unbinds itself from those constraints is, it turns out, a justifiable and often awe-inspiring exercise.\n\nA very interesting ambience collaboration between the Sigure Ros man and his boyfriend Alex Somers. Unlike Jonsi's solo record, this bears little resemblance to the Sigure Ros sound. It's the kind of music you can immerse yourself in if you were meditating or relaxing somewhere. It really takes you away. It doesn't really have any traditional songs but is made up of a series of sprawling tracks. I'd recommend for pre sleep listening or listening to while in the bath - that's not saying it's boring, its saying its a chillax album.\u2026Collapse"}
{"text": "Have you ever gone camping and sat around a fire with a guitar in a non-hippie sort of way? And don't start with the creepy boy-scout-molestation ideas, either. But you know, just been out under the million stars you can't see in the city, singing songs for people you're close with, and trying to stay warm by a small fire? Well, neither have I, but after hearing the Static Films debut album on BlueSanct, I think I've got an idea what it might be like.\n\nThere's a certain intimacy involved with the above situation that you can't really fake, and on \"Force Over Distance,\" Static Films does that very well. At least, on some songs. This album is frustrating because there are moments of brilliance and then moments of over-indulgence that make you want to just shake whoever is responsible and say \"What the hell are you doing?! Just stop it! Christ!\" Well, maybe not that extreme. It?s like when your mom makes that amazing chocolate cake that she's made for you most of your life. You love this cake; it's the most delicious and moist cake you've ever tasted. Then, just because she can, she tries some other recipe that's not that great. It frustrates you because you think \"Mom! We all know what you?re capable of - we've tasted your cake! Why did you go and do this silly experiment?\" That's how I feel about certain songs on this album.\n\nThe CD opens with the lovely, albeit lengthy, title track. It's with this song that I'm most reminded of the aforementioned campfire scenario. There's something haunting and beautiful about this song, even though it's just a guy and his acoustic guitar. The vocals remind me of Simon Joyner, in a way. Lyrics like \"God is an open hand on her chest\" and \"Hope will await us there\" are sung with the most sincere honesty and longing. It is wonderful, and I feel like I shouldn't be hearing this, it's so intimate. There's one big problem with this song: it's 12 minutes long. Now, I have no problem with long songs, but honestly after 12 minutes of a guy doing solo acoustic guitar music, I want to punch him. This really is a wonderful song, but as the saying goes, you can have too much of a good thing. This is way too much.\n\nTrack two, \"Panthalassa,\" sort of suffers the same fate. The opening 2 minutes is this catchy kind of Smiths (in a very vague way) song. Then it goes into 5 minutes of droning and moaning that would be good for the a final minute and a half, but sheesh. It's especially annoying because it makes you wait even longer for the best song on the album, \"Cave Point Park.\" This song was what originally made me buy this CD. It's so delightful! It opens with some sort of instrument (I can't place it. I think it may be some sort of keyed instrument) and then an organ and/or horns fade in with the vocals. It's really Victorian sounding, and I love it. There's also kettle drums (or toms mixed really deep) that accentuate the doubled vocals. Really, this song has this Tom Waits feeling to it that is fantastic. Harmonies, muted trumpet, sparse clanging cymbal work... this is the angle Static Films should focus on.\n\nThe rest of the album is really good, too. \"Optimism Rising\" is played slow on an electric guitar with minimal percussion and some nice harmonica playing. The vocals are sleepy in a good way, and the overall mood of the song is of someone who is at absolute bottom and realizes there're good things to come. I'm reminded of someone exorcising their demons through song just so they can move forward. \"Phosphorescent Aquatic Life\" is my second favorite song on the album and is mostly acoustic guitar and vocals, but there are some nice atmospheric sounds in the latter half and some subtle (but excellent) strings. Again, think intimacy times ten. I imagine watching someone through the window of their apartment getting awful news of some sort. There's something about this song that makes me picture someone pacing. \"Just Above Sea Level, Just Below Sea Level\" is a nice mix of \"Cave Pt. Park\" and the first part of \"Panthalassa.\" The bongos and other percussion make it even more catchy. He's beside the campfire again, but this time he brought friends to play along, too. The strings are a very welcome addition and contribute to the song's warmth. I want to hear this when I'm sipping a glass of red wine on my new balcony. \"Song for Emily\" starts off strong with the quiet guitar and sad vocals, but then it just becomes a doubled vocal track saying \"Na na na\" and other crap over and over again. This song is a good microcosm for the whole album. It's so close to being a remarkable record, but holds itself back.\n\nI learned three things from this album: 1. Static Films have a lot of promise and real songwriting talent. I look forward to his next album and have no idea what to expect (this is good). 2. I want to go camping and bring my guitar and my wife. I think it'd be wonderful and fun to record. 3. If I ever am at a show where someone plays a 12 minute song that's just guitar and vocals, I'm punching them in the fucking face. 7"}
{"text": "When scientists want to look at the effect of a variable in a given scenario, they remove or replace it, then see what happens. It's impossible to be rigorously scientific about human nature, but the empirical approach still has some clues to offer when it comes to group dynamics.\n\nTake for example the group led by Polish trumpeter Tomasz Stanko. Since recruiting his backing trio as teenagers in 1993, he's spent a good deal of time working with them in performance and on record, including the remarkable Soul of Things and Suspended Night from 2002 and 2004, respectively. These recordings have rolled out like light shimmering on mist, exploring focused lyricism through nuance and subtlety.\n\nWhat happens when Stanko is removed from this group? We have the evidence in the form of Trio, which documents the so-called Simple Acoustic Trio that has been headlining bandstands in Poland. To be frank, it's like the mist without the light. There's something about this music that envelops you and seeps into your skin, drawing you in and not letting go. But when you free yourself from its wet embrace, you feel like maybe you missed the message. Or maybe there really wasn't any. Or maybe Stanko's like a beacon that can't be replaced. It's hard to know in any exact sense.\n\nThese guys weren't even thirty when they laid down these tracks a year ago, and to their credit they're still the intuitive, free-thinking core unit they've been all along. Marcin Wasilewski's piano playing is lyrical at heart, building from simple melodies and incorporating indirect shades of gospel. Bassist Slawomir Kurkiewicz has a way of getting in and around the center of the music without crowding it or being obvious; Michael Miskiewicz's brushwork is the very definition of lush, probably contributing as much to the misty feel of the music as Wasilewski's predilection for pedaling. When he picks up sticks, he's more Motian than DeJohnette, in any case.\n\nThe music on the record is generally low-key and pensive; it includes eight composed pieces, one each by Wayne Shorter and Bj\u00f6rk, and five completely improvised tracks. The pure improv has an involving, mysterious aspect that tends to be more interesting because of its abstraction and unpredictability. The second track, Bj\u00f6rk's \"Hyperballad,\" is surreally beautiful, creeping up gradually but grabbing you in full embrace once its anthemic theme kicks in. (Speaking of kicking in, the first track takes five seconds to actually start, an incredibly annoying and self-indulgent ECM \"quirk\" that serves neither artist nor audience.)\n\nIn the end, this record just never breaks out of that seeping foggy feeling. I spent three days listening to it almost in isolation, and returning weeks later, it's surprising how little that experience has changed. This Trio sucks you in for sure, but it doesn't really satisfy in any visceral way. I miss Tomasz Stanko."}

{"text": "Share\n\nImagine a mix of electronic and organic drums laying in a bed of vintage synthesizers and rotating male vocals making love to a microphone and you'll get a sense of Divine Fits' debut album, A Thing Called Divine Fits, released this August on Merge records. The songs fit together so well, each piece snapping into place with the piece before and after, that it can be tough to comprehend how this is only their first album. This isn't music built on ego, there's no challenging each other in a toughest riff contest, dazzling with blazing speed or other feats of technical ability. It's just good music. Much like the unstoppable force of Voltron, the pieces become magnificent when put together. Comprised of Spoon singer and guitarist Britt Daniel, Wolf Parade guitarist Dan Boeckner, and New Bomb Turks drummer Sam Brown, this is a supergroup finally worthy of the name. NICOLAS GRIZZLE"}
{"text": "Wednesday, January 25, 2006\n\nI just heard these guys today for the first time (courtesy of Underpants Records;I knew that site would yield gold) and I'm loving them.\n\nHailing from Burlington, VT, The Jazz Guys are four guys who don't play jazz. Since their site is short on bio info, I don't know much else about them. However, they seem to have a damn good sense of humor.\n\nMusically, they bang out infectious guitar-driven rocking numbers. The hook to them is that all of the band members sing at once. They aren't necessarily harmonizing but it still lends a very layered sound to the vocals. I'm also loving the drummer. The guy seems to be all over the kit at once.\n\nFrom what I can tell, they aren't signed to a label. However, they recorded an EP last fall that they aren't selling yet. The two tracks below are from that recording session. Hopefully, they'll be selling it soon though because I'd love to hear the other three songs."}
{"text": "Feed Me\n\nI always imagined what he would be like, though, because that's what the normal cool kids do. He would have been kind of dorky, smart, totally hilarious, have bad vision, a beard and be really into music. He and his friends would hang out in his room for days on end, writing music and talking about boy things like dragons and girls and Pink Floyd's Animals, just geeking out playing bass riffs.\n\nEssentially, my imaginary big brother and his friends would probably have been Akron/Family, so S/T II: The Cosmic Birth and Journey of Shinju TNT would probably have been their fifth (and coincidentally also their best) album.\n\nS/T II is heavily influenced by \"Bent Acid Punk Diamond fuzz\" (honestly, who knows), underground Japanese noise, and the 70's drums Akron/Family rebuilt themselves and play with their own sticks. The band is currently pushing and shoving at the frontiers of music as we know it, breathing fresh life into what at times seems like just another karmic cycle of life's suffering: the music industry. Sometimes, new music is good only due to the fact that it is refreshing and a change\u2014but whatever was attempted is so weird it doesn't have the potential to last. Akron/Family's latest album is new, refreshing, and, exceptionally, please, please, please can we have it last, because we could all use so much more like S/T II.\n\nThey wrote it in a cabin built into the side of an active volcano in Japan. They recorded it in an abandoned train station in Detroit. They sent a fragmented, stream-of-consciousness letter to their record label explaining everything about it\u2014here's an excerpt: \"Catching the Big Fish. An Eastern European blue van dream up. Follow the 12-foot yellow paper roll from SE Portland. A dream roll of visions and bulldozers organized by Future Librarians unemployed, Intoxicated, Artistic-bent, Roving Aimlessly Free of expectation 100 years later.\" (By explaining \"everything\" I guess I meant \"nothing at all.\")\n\nSo, after all that, what does S/T II even sound like? \"Psych folk\" is what people are calling it these days, I just call it a happy-maker. The album is all honey and chirpy and tribal drums and happy harmonies and fuzzy guitars (fans of Edward Sharpe and Animal Collective's potential love-child, listen UP). Some highlights: \"Light Emerges\" is a rolling, building stomp-stomp-clap with layers and layers of wide harmonies, \"So It Goes\" is a happy, gritty jam, \"A AAA O A WAY\" is just way too good and way too clever for regular folks. I can't find a song on this album I don't like. My big brother is so, so cool."}
{"text": "AOW Sept. 12-18 Steve Lacy THE RENT\n\nAmong recordings by Steve Lacy, this is the trio with Jean-Jacques Avenel on bass and John Betsch on drums, recorded at The Old Church, both sets performed that night (11/30/97) on a double-CD. (I didn't get to hear the trio live until a year and a half later, also in a church, in Berkeley).\n\nI was curious what would be present in the pared-down trio. For one thing, Lacy being the only horn, there was more immediate evidence of the interplay betwen Lacy and the rhythm section, starting with Monk's \"Shuffle Boil\" and burning through Lacy originals like \"The Bath,\" \"The Rent,\" \"Prayer,\" and \"Blinks,\" all performed with a spirit of playfulness.\n\nThis version of \"The Door\" (like the aforementioned \"Prayer\") far outstrips the RCA recording.\n\nIt's probably the loneliest album of the week ever. I heard it a couple of times in the last few days. Nothing to say but the obvious - this is a very good album. Still didn't grasp the whole album so it will take a few more times to listen (probably it should sink for a few months before I'll be able to express something less general than: \"very good, great, wonderful\" etc)."}
{"text": "Thursday, September 30, 2010\n\nSo, as Steve mentioned, I put together a piece on Brooklyn's The National for this week's print edish. (And yes, we've selected our caption contest winner, though we're still waiting for him/her to claim the tickets.)\n\nYou can read my story here, and you can peep after the jump to read my interview with The National's Scott Devendorf. He's the mostly-bass-playin' dude. The one who's, according to The New York Times, \"strikingly spare of pate.\" Devendorf and I discussed the dynamics of being in a band with two sets of brothers, what it was like making High Violet, whether or not he and the rest of the band have any idea what frontman Matt Berninger's lyrics are about, Berninger's collaborative relationship with his wife, making music in a hip-ass city and more.\n\nNashville Cream: First off, I know you guys swap instruments quite a bit, but you primarily play bass and some guitar, right?\n\nScott Devendorf: That's right.\n\nNC: OK, cool. Well, I think it's safe to say you guys are kind of a grower band. Not only have you gained more critical acclaim with each release, but your audience also seems to have kind of grown exponentially over the last decade as well. Was there ever a point when you guys said to yourselves, \"Wow, this thing might be sustainable. We might continue to grow and be able to quit our day jobs?\"\n\nSD: [Laughs.] Good question. I don't know if there was ever a day that we said that, but you know, all this stuff has happened in the past 10 years, and I think there were several instances over the course of that time where we did a lot of work and a lot of touring and got to a point where we'd play a big show, or when a record gets picked up by a big label like Beggars Banquet, the label that we were on \u2014 now we're on 4AD. These kinds of moments, or milestones if you will [laughs]. For us it was the little things, where we'd play a big show in Paris and it's sold out. I don't think we're ever felt like, \"Hey, we've made it!\" but I think there were these little things that happened just along the way that are significant to us and sort of made a bit of the hard work pay off, you know? And lately the band has gotten a lot more notoriety and press, and the record charted for the first time and that was a big deal to us. Just like small things along the way. It's never been this overnight situation.\n\nNC: Never been like a moment when it was like, \"Whoa.\"\n\nSD: Yeah, but you know, we played at Radio City this year and that was a huge deal for us. A big famous place in New York, you know, that was kind of wild. With things like that I think we kind of step back once in a while and are like, \"Oh this is really cool.\"\n\nNC: I read that you guys would go into the studio and record sort of instrumental demos more or less that you'll pitch to Matt. Correct me if I'm wrong, but is that still sort of the way you guys do it? Do you build these songs for him to lay lyrics on top of? Is that the process that's best for you guys?\n\nSD: Yeah, it seems like the process that works for us. It's not really the most efficient process. It sometimes can be really frustrating because mainly Aaron or Bryce will write things and Bryan and I will put some ideas in there, too. Usually it's kind of like this little collage in that way, where it's sending out a bunch of stuff to him that he checks out and sees what he can work in with the stuff that he has \u2014 either a melody that he's working on or sometimes not even a song, just kind of like parts or ideas or whatever rhythmic qualities or something they have that sort of fits well with stuff that he's working on. He's not like a musician musician. He has a good ear, and he's a big fan of music, so I think he has a strong idea about what he wants to do with things. Actually, it's frustrating sometimes, because we'll have like 50 or 60 ideas, and maybe only 20 of them were the favorite ones. So it's just kind of like this back and forth process. It's a pretty accurate way to describe it.\n\nNC: Will there ever be a time where he'll just sort of veto an idea, or you guys veto one of his ideas?\n\nSD: [Laughs.] Definitely. It's harder for us to veto his ideas because he's the one writing the lyrics. Sometimes he'll \u2014 not necessarily by nature is he trying to do this, but on the past two records, it'll be \u2026 late in the game before we actually hear a song. We'll work a lot on the music or the idea or there'll be a scratch vocal or something, but we don't know what the final lyrics are, what the song's about until maybe really late in the game. That can be exciting-slash-terrifying.\n\nNC: So you may have a song for months before it even has a title?\n\nSD: Oh yeah. The titles are always the last to come. Usually the titles are the titles of whatever you randomly give the sketches. For a while they were all Civil War battles. [Laughs.] \"Fredericksburg,\" you know. Matt usually names the songs in the end, they're not usually super tricky names.\n\nNC: Some sort of reference to the lyrics, right?\n\nSD: Yeah, or sometimes ... \"Conversation 16\" was totally not related to the lyrics. I think that was almost like a goofy dialogue. Like, if you were readying a movie script and there'd be \"Scene Four,\" or something like that.\n\nNC: That song in particular feels like a slice out of a relationship.\n\nSD: Yeah, exactly.\n\nNC: Past Matt's vocal melodies, does he really contribute much in the way of instrumentation or arrangements, or conversely, do you guys really weigh in on lyrical content?\n\nSD: [Laughs.] Again, it's funny because I'm just thinking about past records. He usually has a lot of strong opinions about the music without any sort of direct musical way to contribute. So he'll kind of describe something as a color or a sound that's, like, some visual reference for it basically. He'll never say, like, \"Play an F-sharp.\" He doesn't know what an F-sharp is. It's more like the feel of something that he's going for, either with the trajectory of the lyrics or music. And we'll try a lot of different sounds and ways of playing. I think with the past records there's a little bit of frustration at some point because he didn't want any finger-picking or something on guitar playing. If we have any sort of signatures aside from the low baritone voice [laughs], you know, it's the sort of interlocking guitar parts and stuff that is played because [Aaron and Bryce] are really good at it, and it's something we like. Having him say, \"Oh, we don't want that at all,\" is kind of like, \"Oh. [Pauses.] OK.\" [Laughs.] Which is fine. I think we're always trying to make different records, and I think by the nature of trying to make different records, you kind of have to build up and tear down a bunch of ideas. It's sort of our way of working. It's frustrating. The process of it gets us to something at least we think is interesting.\n\nNC: We touched on the lyrics a bit. I know they can be a bit cryptic sometimes. Are there ever songs where you guys really don't know what it is he's referencing or talking about?\n\nSD: For sure, yeah. I mean, we like the fact that the lyrics are a bit cryptic, and I think that they are kind of open to interpretation. They're not exactly like, \"Here's the song. I love you, blah blah blah.\" They'd probably be a lot more accessible in the pop music world if they were a little more direct. We sort of like other bands and other music that is not exactly clear. Yeah, but sometimes we are a bit biased to what he's talking about. It can be too cryptic at times, but I think he knows that too. He's sort of always going for something in between clarity and interpretation, so I think in doing that he can go sort of too far in one direction or the other. I think he's always fighting that battle within himself, too. He writes a lot of lyrics with his wife as well. She's a writer, and she helps sort some ideas out, and I think it spices up the lyrics.\n\nNC: Really?\n\nSD: Yeah. I mean, not every song but like on the, I can't remember right off the top of my head, but there's two or three songs on this record that she kind of wrote a big part of or helped write stuff and sort some ideas. So they have a little collaboration thing going on, which is kind of fun for us to watch, because when we're not fighting with him, we get to watch her fight with him. It's kind of fun. It's not really that bad either. I'm being a little dramatic.\n\nNC: Understandable. Just that kind of give and take.\n\nSD: Yeah.\n\nNC: How long did it take you guys to make High Violet? It was probably a year, right?\n\nSD: It was about a year on and off. I mean, we kind of slowed down at the end of touring Boxer, worked on building the studio and then took a break and did this charity record called Dark Was the Night. Well, we just did one song on it, but [Aaron and Bryce] did a lot of curating, working with different artists on that. That was sort of in the downtime when Matt was working on lyrics. We sort of started recording, we did a concert for the Dark Was the Night thing, we did a couple of shows here and there, they did another project of theirs called The Long Count. So yeah, it took a year, but it wasn't like a straight year of recording. It was kind of like, we worked on some stuff then we took a break, and then we went into the studio. We kind of really started focusing on it \u2026 probably, I'd say, late summer of '09 to about when we finished. And then we spent about eight or 10 weeks once we got done recording everything, we went up to the studio to mix, but or mixing process is kind of like recording still. We're still tracking guitars and vocals, everything basically. So that was about eight or 10 weeks, mid- to late-November, and then January and February we mixed it in parts.\n\nNC: So you said you guys built a new studio in this time since the last record?\n\nSD: Yeah, we built the studio, and that's where we did a lot of the recording for High Violet. Like, actually that's where most of the instruments are recorded and some vocals, but we're kind of still trying to figure it out. It's a great space, but it's kind of ... [long pause] Sorry, I tried to pick the quietest street, but it turned out to be the loudest one. [Laughs.] Yeah, we were kind of just wanting to use the studio and then writing, so it was fun. It was fun for us because our process ... excuse me, this is taking a long time to describe [laughs]. It takes a lot longer for us to write than to record, so it's not like we go into the studio for two weeks and track everything and we're done. So having the studio was sort of freedom for us because it wasn't by the hour or whatever. We were able to kind of work on drums for, like, two weeks ... just kind of like tracking a bunch of ideas.\n\nNC: So do you guys sort of start with a wealth of material and ideas and whittle that down, or do you really just build one by one?\n\nSD: We're kind of working on a bunch of stuff at once usually. It's like, we have all these 50 or 60 sort of sketched demo things that some of them were just a piano part, or a guitar part only or whatever, or drums and guitar; just some sort of simple ideas. From there, Matt figures out which ones he can kind of hone in on and start doing stuff for them, and then we kind of add things throughout the way. I mean, obviously we flesh them out a lot more and re-record them and cut them apart. But then for us it's a little archeological. We just kind of throw a bunch of stuff on there and take it away, throw more stuff on, take stuff away. Some of the stuff that's left is, like, the original guitar part might stay or a scratch vocal might stay in and then we'll fill everything else around that or something. It kind of depends on the song.\n\nNC: So with two sets of brothers in the band, does that influence the dynamic a lot? Do you find that there's a lot of Dessner vs. Devendorf spats, or maybe like internal sibling rivalry going on?\n\nSD: Yeah, it's never usually Dessner vs. Devendorf. It's more like Dessner vs. Berninger with, like, Devendorf as U.N. or something. There's a lot of, like, Aaron and Matt kind of like debating and arguing and fighting with each other, because Aaron writes a lot of the music. We'll have to sort of intervene either with ideas or peacemaking process or whatever. It gets heated but it's never downright mean [laughs]. It's usually just everyone really wants one thing or another from a song. It's kind of a democracy, albeit a messed up one.\n\nNC: Well I mean, some of you guys are stuck with each other no matter what.\n\nSD: Yeah, it's sort of great and terrifying [laughs].\n\nNC: Well, I know you guys are from Cincinnati originally, but you're based in Brooklyn now right?\n\nSD: Yeah, well, we've all lived here about anywhere between 12 and 14 years, so the band actually started here, but we're all from there. But we played music really casually before we started this. I mean, Aaron, Bryce, and Bryan had a band together in Ohio, and I had a really, really, really low-key band in college for fun with friends. Everything we've done with The National is all in New York basically.\n\nNC: I'm sure you're well aware there's been quite a surge in indie rock, post-punk and experimental music from Brooklyn. Do you find that kind of inspires you guys to be more prolific, or is it really just kind of like a nuisance that everybody you come across wants you to hear their demo or something like that?\n\nSD: [Laughs.] No, I think it's great, and I think that there's so much different kinds of music. And for a lot of cities, it's not just here, but obviously it's a lot here. I don't know, it definitely inspires us to, you know ... it inspired us to start the band in the first place, to know that all that stuff was happening around us and us being big music fans wanting to do something ourselves. And it probably has the same sort of effect on bands that are just starting now. You see bands from New York, and they're usually really good or at least interesting and I think it's a good thing, I mean there's all kinds of, I mean we're not the most experimental avant-garde unit in town for sure but I think we all like different music ourselves. I think it can only be good having all that stuff happening. All these people being productive makes other people want to be productive.\n\nNC: You guys are obviously in the middle of a record cycle right now, but do you guys have any plans for after this tour, future recording?\n\nSD: Yeah, I mean we're definitely gonna work on another record. We feel like we just kind of finished this one. We're kind of like the band that it's kind of hard for us to write on the road but we kind of try to do it anyways but it's almost like we have to at least the way operated on the last two or three records make a record and then tour for about a year-and-a-half to two years and then kind of disappear for a time and then do something again. We've done enough and now we have the studio if we want to kind of not take three or four years to make a record. We're not the most, like I said, fast-working bunch."}
{"text": "1. Dangermouse\n\nDangermouse was admitted to the Top 10 Bands Named After Cute Animals list BEFORE he lost his head.Unless you're an elephant, and unless they're scurrying across your kitchen floor and pooping and peeing in your cupboard, mice are pretty cute, right? So let's start with them.\n\nBrian Burton, AKA Dangermouse, has produced some of the most exciting music of the past decade. He's known for mixing the Beatles and Jay-Z in the most famous mash-up album of all time, \"The Grey Album\", and he's worked with plenty of talented artists, including Cee-Lo Green (in Gnarls Barkley) and most recently James Mercer from the Shins (in Broken Bells):\n\n2. Eek-A-Mouse\n\nEek-A-Mouse's \"Wa-Do-Dem\" album. A good place to start your Eeksperience.I saw Eek-A-Mouse perform live some years ago at the Bluebird in Bloomington, IN. He puts on a good show, and though the Eek-A-Mouse \"Eeksperience\" website is slightly on the ugly side, the name inspires a cute enough mental image to deserve a spot on the list.\n\n3. Modest Mouse\n\nAn indie-rock-gone-major fave, Modest Mouse have been cranking out some great tunes for awhile now. One of their older albums, \"The Moon and Antarctica\", is highly recommended, especially if you've never heard of Modest Mouse before or if you're only familiar with the newer stuff.\n\n4. Mouse on Mars\n\nMouse on Mars \"Live 04\" album: as the cover's lips and cop car suggest, it's a mix of pulsing live music with a hard edge. Or something.Mouse on Mars often make electronic that's complex, noisy, or just plain unlistenable - like hearing machines torture each other. But Mouse on Mars also make electronic instruments sound vibrant and alive, as they do on the often-funky and sometimes danceable \"Live 04\" album:\n\n5. Korgis\n\nOkay, so the first and nearly last time I was exposed to the Korgis was when I bought \"Best of Techno Vol. 3\" nearly two decades ago, which led off with NRG's \"I Need Your Love\" (below), a song centered ona sample of the Korgis' \"Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime.\"\n\nBritish version of the German Dachshund?At any rate, I still don't know much about the Korgis other than the fact that they're British and they share their name (well, except for the first letter) with the super-cute, super-short-legged Corgi dog and deserve to be on this list for that alone.\n\n6. Bunny Rabbit\n\nBunny Rabbit: more like 2 Live Crew, less like Peter Cottontail.Don't buy a Bunny Rabbit album with the intention of giving it to your kids. Bunny Rabbit may seem like a given for this list, but she has a deceptively cute name: the music is seductively ominous, not sweetly twee. It's generally simple with lots of funky electronic beats and some NSFW lyrics, so beware. Put your headphones on and check out \"Saddle Up\":\n\n7. The Bird and the Bee\n\nKinda like Bunny Rabbit's childishly sweet name and her more adult-oriented music, when you hear the term \"the birds and the bees\" you'll first think of cute, then realize the fact that it's a simple, cliched way of referring to human mating when talking to people who aren't old enough to understand what you're talking about. So, just as Bunny Rabbit slipped onto this list for her name alone, the Bird and the Bee get a spot because of the childish connotation to their name.\n\nThe Bird and the Bee have some amazingly addictive songs (\"Do It Again\", \"F*cking Boyfriend\"), powered by the honeyed vocals of Inara George and the sweet pop production of Greg Kurstin, who's worked with everyone from the Flaming Lips to the Red Hot Chili Peppers to Beck to Lily Allen.\n\nAnd what's even cooler about them than their cute name is their tribute album to Hall & Oates (who, unfortunately for this series, are not named after animals but a piece of architecture and a common edible grain), which I just found out about and can't wait to hear all the way through:\n\n8. Miss Kittin\n\nMiss Kittin is a French electronic music DJ. With a name like that, how could she not make this list?\n\nHer Radio Caroline mix has a chill, understated flow that doesn't build to much, but some of her other albums, like \"Batbox\", have a distinctively harder edge. Not quite the juxtaposition that Bunny Rabbit has with her name and music, but close.\n\n9. Britny Fox\n\nOkay, another cute name/mature music juxtaposition. I don't know much about Britny Fox, other than they were an 80's rock band who liked big hair and big makeup - on themselves. The only other thing I know about them is that somehow their song \"Girlschool\" found its way into my iTunes collection. Only because foxes are cute, Britny Fox manages to squeak by onto this list.\n\n10. Super Furry Animals\n\nKittens, puppies, baby sasquatch(es) - how much cuter can you get than super furry animals? The rock band Super Furry Animals goes through an ugly transformation in their \"Golden Retriever\" video, which also happens to feature a Golden Retriever... and a golden shower.\n\nHonorable Mention: Possum Dixon\n\nAt the risk of destroying any credibility Thursday Friday Saturday has left, Possum Dixon makes their way onto this list in spite of a fairly crappy band name, and the fact that 99% of people don't think possums are cute. But just think of their babies - precious! And we've seen a pet possum curled politely around its owners neck at Seattle's Pike Place Market - precious!\n\nAnd their song \"Watch the Girl Destroy Me\" is one of the power-pop masterpieces of the 90's:"}
{"text": "10. Fleet Foxes, 'A Shrine/An Argument'\n\nFleet Foxes don't let the woodwinds loose until the climax of this two-part epic from their second album, Helplessness Blues, but it's worth the wait. The band may be famous for their mellow folk-pop, but the finale of this number is surprisingly atonal and intentionally ugly."}
{"text": "AAJ: Before I mention a single piece from the new album, I want to say that this is one of the albumy-est albums I've heard in a long time; I really hear it as one continuous musical experience\u2014a journey of sorts into some deep area and maybe a reemergence back out. Did you conceive this as a single body of work?\n\nCT: Yeah, that's the way we really thought about it\u2014like a collage. It's this single piece of all these different elements. Originally we were actually going to have one track, and that was going to be forty minutes long. We decided it'd be better to break it up a little bit and have the different tracks. It really is a record that we would like people just to listen to from the beginning to the end rather than listen to individual tracks, because that's the way we sort of put it together.\n\nRM: Actually, I think almost all our records\u2014for me, almost all the Duo records\u2014have been conceived as a whole, as parts of a whole. I don't know who these people are, but it seems like critics criticize us for the fact that perhaps on a given track, there isn't enough development in something, whether it's a minimalist piece or some kind of improvisation or even written pieces. For me, the development is the entire record.\n\nSo yeah, I think it's consciously thought of on all four of the records. Certainly on this one; maybe this one even more. When we started the recording of this record, we had quite a few songs that we had played for two years live that we had intentions of recording. It turns out we didn't use any of that material at all. We ended up improvising and coming up with brand-new ideas and that's how the record came to be. But it was certainly meant to be one continuous flow.\n\nAAJ: This record really feels live to me. I don't hear a lot of overdubbing and suspect a lot of it was done in real time, just the two of you playing. Is this true?\n\nRM: Yes. I think almost all the tunes were not overdubbed\u2014I think on one of the songs I added one pretty subtle cornet thing with ring modulator. But everything else, yeah, like the second cut, the long title track, is actually one continuous improvisation. And most of them were first takes. Chad plays vibes and drum set together; even on \"In Praise of Shadows, there were no overdubs. I was playing keyboard stuff\u2014harpsichord, celeste and piano at the same time, and I had my trumpet there too, so that's why you don't hear those instruments when I'm playing the cornet. I think 90% of it was no overdubs and over half must be one-takes.\n\nI mean, to me that means nothing. People seem to enjoy knowing those things. \"Oh, it's one take. That's amazing. I was listening to that trumpet player, Arve Henriksen. He did a solo trumpet record based on Japanese flower gardens. But it seemed like they kind of went out of their way to say that there were no overdubs on it. And I think Chad is pretty proud of that too. Maybe it's a matter of information because a lot of people think he overdubs stuff\u2014the vibes lines\u2014but he doesn't.\n\nBut it doesn't matter to me if it's one take or fifty takes or if it's completely chopped up. To me, it's the end result. The reason why it gets archived on some kind of thing you can hear back is because it sounds the way we want it to sound.\n\nAAJ: I don't think this is the jazziest record, whatever that means these days, but I like how it gives this feeling that the two of you are just making music without worrying about what kind of music it is. I hear African and so-called world music influences, but I never get the impression you're thinking about that beforehand.\n\nCT: Yeah, well, that's correct. I think what we were thinking about was just the sound of the different elements of the record. It's a lot of different-sounding things. We were thinking about that more than, say, \"we're going to go from this style to this style. We just wanted a lot of different sounds\u2014and for it to feel organic too. The one thing that was sort of challenging with this record is that the compositions were not dealing with harmony or melody. The last several records we did had some really strong melodies, but with this record, it's just these little pieces and they're mostly dealing with sound, rhythm, color and texture. Just the bare elements, so it was challenging to put that together.\n\nRM: The only thing that happens is, of course, that when we step into the studio we bring our own experiences in there. I think Chad happened to be checking out quite a bit of mbira music of, I think, northwest Africa, before we went in, but it wasn't like, \"oh, let's do a northwest African mbira piece. It was more like, \"let's try this thing I've been working on.\n\nSo he was interested; he put the mbira on his floor tom, which gave this eerie kind of reverb and stuff to it, and then we did quite a bit of post-production, although the post-production is very subtle. It still sounds exactly like an mbira. But the point is we never do say, \"oh, let's do a jazz tune, let's do something with an African rhythm.\n\nFor some reason, ever since the first record, 12 Degrees of Freedom, we've been able to just exist in a space musically\u2014and not musically, at times\u2014with the real freedom of just being able to make sounds. I don't even know if it's music sometimes; I use the word \"sound a lot, because sometimes what people consider music, whether it's melody or rhythm or harmony or whatever\u2014sometimes this music doesn't have any of that."}
{"text": "As pretentious as it seems for Akron/Family to title their latest album Self-Titled II: The Cosmic Birth and Journey of Shinju TNT, it begins to make sense once the enormous peaks and valleys of their music unfold widescreen in front of your eyes. The band has spent nearly a decade experimenting in folk, psych and sampled soundscapes, but Cosmic Birth explodes like the landmark record every band strives to make. It's a sprawling epic that finds the trio creating from one unified and concentrated mind. During their amorphous live shows, it's not uncommon for Seth Olinsky, Dana Janssen and Miles Seaton to constantly switch roles between the myriad instruments littering the stage. In speaking with Seaton, it's apparent that Cosmic Birth was recorded with much of the same communal execution.\nWhile Akron/Family was once thought of as merely understudies to Michael Gira (Swans), or maybe a poor man's Animal Collective, the new album should debunk any preconceived notions regarding the group's mission. There's plenty of evidence that Cosmic Birth was a clean slate for the trio or a reset freeing them to be overly loud, increasingly complex with their arrangements, and wildly ambitious. Unfortunately, in this day and age, ambition is often seen as indulgence. But while Cosmic Birth's ingredients reflect the prog pomp of King Crimson, the mellifluous intricacies of British folk and the boho-mysticism of the Grateful Dead, not a decibel or note seems wasted on the record. If more bands were to adopt the exercise Seaton and the band refer to as \"groupthink,\" the world would be a much better place and ambition wouldn't be such a dirty word.\n\nSo why have you chosen to title this album Self-Titled II? Is this a continuation of your very first record or of the same spirit?\n\nMiles Seaton: It was more a desire for us to get back to the intimacy and the recording principles that we established with the very first record. It felt like we were starting fresh and having this new experience with one another and our music. There was a level where it felt magical and like the first time we ever recorded. Plus we actually sampled a lot of stuff from our first record.\n\nHave you recorded with Chris Koltay before? What did he bring to the table? The sound on this record is louder and more intense than anything you've done in the past.\n\nMS: We did the last record with him, so we knew what to expect and what we wanted to do. There was a conscious choice on our part to use a lot less layering. There's a lot more space that's been pushed a lot harder as far as volume is concerned. There's a whole lot of distortion that comes with everything being smashed. It created a lot of color and harmonics in the overtones of the record. We knew that Chris was the guy who could get that sound for us.\n\nDid being in Detroit provide any kind of inspiration in recording the record?\n\nMS: Oh yeah, it's an incredible place. There's a lot of fantastic history there. The feeling of that city is almost Mad Max. It's got a post-apocalyptic atmosphere with nature reclaiming the landscape through the bones of the crumbling architecture. It's a very poetic place in my opinion. It was summer then and very beautiful, and we were riding bicycles on the interstate.\n\nIn the press release it claims these songs are \"relics of a new tomorrow\" and that \"these are new beginnings.\" Can you elaborate any more on the meaning of that?\n\nMS: All of us are in a place where we're starting to discover a new stride in the future of our music. This record\u2014the process of envisioning it and the feeling around it\u2014we discovered a lot about ourselves and how exciting music can be. That wording is part of the whole mythic, poetic language of how we are describing our music and how we engage with it. All of us have made a conscious effort to not drain the magic out of the process of creating music together. We are honoring that, not worrying about being cheesy, and realizing how precious this musical process is to us. We don't want to be the guys who just say, \"Yeah, play in a band.\" That's fine if you want to write your story like that as a musician, but that's not the story I want to live in.\n\nSo then is there an overarching concept to Cosmic Birth? Is there a story that aligns it all that needs explanation?\n\nMS: Not particularly, but it is the story of us becoming super inspired and envisioning a truly wild and boundless way of creating music, which all of us strove to accomplish. When we were planning the record there was a lot of writing, sending pictures, recording strange sounds and sending those things back and forth between us. We were making huge dream boards where we were trying to tie all of those things together as a \"groupthink,\" as Seth likes to call it. Some of it comes out abstract and poetic and then some of it is more just imagery and the idea of rebirth. The character of Shinju TNT, he kind of represents that idea and he just sort of appeared to us out of the ether one hyper-caffeinated afternoon.\n\nThe record is certainly an ambitious undertaking. I'm curious to know how you will take Cosmic Birth out on the road. You are well known as a particularly enthralling live band, so how will these songs affect the shows?\n\nMS: We've always tried to keep the music moving in the concept of a tour. The top-half of the show has been the rock stuff from this album, and it has been pretty rocking, pretty heavy. We're trying to be more high energy and trying to be more concise. We're also trying to incorporate some of the really early stuff into that mix. But I feel like this time around, with all of the rock stuff we've been doing, it's almost punk because there's a very excitable quality to what we are doing currently."}
{"text": "While they haven't quite turned into Rubberbandits, there have been distinct signs of a thaw from Sigur R\u00f3s over recent years. For their last LP they even consented to interviews (earlier media appearances had been sulky and monosyllabic, tooth-pulling exercises for all involved). Then, 18 months ago, singer Jonsi Birgisson released a solo project that was almost a pop album (or at least, a pop album as recorded by someone with a working knowledge of Olde Elvish). Hopes that he might bring this freshly-cultivated exuberance back to the day job are, alas, dashed by Sigur R\u00f3s' sixth record, a meditative affair full of moments of grace but without any of the drama that has attended their best music. Guitars are almost entirely absent, the foreground occupied by Jonsi's wispy voice, tinkling piano and mossy backwashes. There's a liveliness to 'Varuo' that suggests it might lead somewhere but the song ultimately folds inwards; on 'Rembihnutur' ethereal bleepery feels like an end in itself, the tune lost in reams of aural shagginess.

{"text": "At one time, Columbus Ohio's Brainbow was the city's premiere post-rock, instrumental band. The group delivered slow-moving, acid-damaged guitar jams and wordless psychedelia that split the difference between Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd, Earth, and Explosions In The Sky.\n\nThough they've been basically non-functioning for two years, the band is finally unveiling a gargantuan second ablum. II will be out on double vinyl as of Jan. 19\u2032s must-see release show at Ace of Cups, also featuring Columbus supergroups EYE and Connections. Ghettoblaster recently caught up with guitarist Chris Worth to talk about another album that is worth mentioning, Low's Secret Name.\n\nWhat is your favorite album?\nEverybody knows it's impossible to answer this, but there are a few that I always come back to and fall in love with again. Maybe Low's Secret Name?\n\nDo you remember when you received or purchased the album?\nWhen I was in college, we used to drive down to Columbus for band practice, and I must have gotten it then. I probably got it at Mag's or Used Kids, but I don't remember exactly when. I'd been falling asleep to The Curtain Hits the Cast a lot, and Secret Name was a very, very different record.\n\nWhat is your favorite song on the album?\n\"Starfire\", I think, although \"Will the Night\" is a close second.\n\nWhat is it about the song that resonates with you?\nEverything. It's a beautiful song. The sound of it is immense, but the arrangement is simple and economical. It just moves perfectly \u2014 it goes exactly where it should, and somehow Alan and Mimi manage to make the trick of having a male voice sing the high harmony to the lower female voice sound surprising every time. Chilling.\n\nHave you ever covered a song from the album?\nNot specifically, but like anything you get obsessed with, it creeps into whatever music you make.\n\nWhat is it about the album that makes it stand out against the band's other output?\nIt barely does, honestly. They're so consistently excellent. Probably just the pacing and sequencing. It feels like a tragedy to listen to the record piecemeal.\n\nHave you ever given a copy of this record to anyone? What were the circumstances?\nI think I make everybody I know listen to it at some point. Often very late at night. I don't think you can really listen to it passively. That's really important to me, actually. It doesn't force you to pay attention to it, but it doesn't reveal itself unless you do.\n\nWhich of the records that you've performed on is your favorite?\nBrainbow II. It's the closest thing to the record I've always wanted to make.\n\nWhat is your favorite song on the album and why?\nThis changes all the time. Right now it's \"Canyon for a Cradle,\" because I think we managed to get it to sound the most like how it sounds in my head."}
{"text": "Dusted Features\n\nDestined: Deerhunter\n\n\"I think awkwardness is our one and only engaging quality.\" This comes from Bradford Cox, the front man of Atlanta five-piece Deerhunter.\n\nCryptograms, the band's second LP, will be released by Kranky on January 29. Something about it feels anomalous in the context of both the mellow, mildly academic label's back catalog and indie music generally, and this is exciting. While there are few unprocessed sounds on the album's 12 tracks, it's thoroughly rooted in pop \u2013 more importantly, it engages with pop in a broad way rarely heard since we began to create a genre definition for indie. It's pop that lives in symbiosis with feedback and structures songs around mistakes.\n\nIt might be easier to suggest an influence from Brian Eno's pop records and The Jesus & Mary Chain \u2013 both of which are pretty surface-level and avowed by the band \u2013 but it would also be absurdly incomplete. Getting at what Cryptograms actually feels like calls up a haunted house version of high school (this is how Cox describes the novel Closer by his favorite writer, Dennis Cooper) and swimming in strangers' pools at night. You know, teenage suburban boy things.\n\nCox's diet-of-Butterfingers and holey Chucks vibe belies the intensity with which he pursues songwriting. \"Lockett [Pundt, guitar] and I have been playing together since whenever,\" he says. \"I started doing 4-track stuff on my own in high school, and it's still how I write music. It's random. I don't usually work on just one song, but instead I record eight songs in like 20 minutes, and then sort out what's worth keeping later. All of my energy goes into recording songs, so I have like 12 new songs to bring to the band each week.\"\n\nIt's incredible, then, that the band's untitled debut record was released in 2004. Cox describes it as a \"premature statement,\" and it took the band a year to get back into the studio to begin recording Cryptograms. The initial sessions yielded nothing, and Cox remembers himself \"freaking out. I was completely emotionally and physically wasted. I'd sit down in front of the piano and roll the tape and just play a really sparse plinky thing and then everyone would just be like 'what the fuck are we supposed to play over that?' It was terrible. I had not learned to detach and keep big pictures in mind.\"\n\nUpon returning to the same studio in rural Georgia that had been the site of the initial meltdown, the band recorded Cryptograms in two days. Cox explains his approach to recording in a way that partially explains why the band's 'mature' statement took two attempts: \"What I basically do is set everything up, like create tension or push things in a certain direction and then bitch everyone out when it doesn't turn out that way. I'm kind of like a pretentious middle-school Eno wannabe in that sense.\"\n\nDespite this, using \"front man\" to describe Cox is an uncomfortable fit. Cryptograms oscillates between pop patterns and drones on something like a song-to-song basis. The transition from \"Red Ink\" (a slowly eddying drone drawing on Cox's voice and accordion and bell playing, with treatments by drummer Moses Archuleta) to a four-song stretch of the album's poppiest songs feels like a serious negotiation between sensibilities.\n\nDespite the give-and-take that marks the album's flow, the weirdly archaic title of \"front man\" may be the only designation that works. Cox's appearance is the focus of their polarizing performances (see the \"actual testimony\" from Deerhunter show attendees posted on their MySpace page for anecdotes about Cox's pink slip-clad antics), while his voice, and multi-instrumental interventions are the focus of their recordings.\n\n\"I don't write all of the music,\" Cox explains, \"but I control the final output.\" Archuleta, Josh Fauver, Colin Mee, and Pundt play everything from synth pads to Hammond organ on the album, but are primarily responsible for drums, bass, and guitars, respectively.\n\nCox seems amused rather than put out by what people tend to read into Deerhunter. A lot of people, he says, \"think we're like hipster vegans, which is really funny to me. That, or they assume I'm a heroin addict just from how I look. People I know that are junkies never get that.\"\n\nSimilarly, attempts at parsing them musically through the influences we ascribe them fall short. Deerhunter's a band that has its Loveless moments but mostly has this long-limbed musical intelligence that draws things together in an uncomfortably satisfying way. Kind of like a big skateboarding bruise on your hip that turns a new color each day and whose throbbing is a pleasant distraction from Geography class or whatever.\n\n\"I'm really into people who invented their own languages, people who had nothing they were mimicking aesthetically,\" says Cox. The artists he admires most are those who, \"like Wu-Tang or The Velvet Underground or Dead C or Suicide\u2026might be used in a class on 'How Not To Be Successful.'\"\n\nThough the band's sounds are mostly mediated by effects pedals and treatments, even the disorienting, untraceable sounds of an ambient track like \"White Ink\" are collaged carefully and spontaneously enough to prepare the space needed for the kraut-footed stomp of \"Lake Somerset.\" \"There are times when our music takes on this clarity,\" Cox says, \"and there are even times when it becomes something totally pop and not at all clouded, but that's what you get when you are in a group of people collaborating on a sound. I, personally, am much more moved by the crackle and hiss and the lulling nature of like heavy fuzz. Like The Jesus and Mary Chain, it's just white noise layered over Shangri-La's songs.\"\n\nThere's a certain kind of classicism at work throughout Cryptograms. While they're not copying the masters, Deerhunter is far from trying to be the vanguard. It's indicative of the openness of the musical climate in 2007 that we can talk about \"folk\" without the qualifier \"freak\" and that rock bands no longer need token no-wave gestures to avoid irony. While those in the criticism camps might be more and more receptive to Deerhunter's approach as the year progresses, the band still feel like outcasts in their hometown (though they have a close relationship to The Black Lips) and seem to frequently bum out audiences, not least on a recent tour with Yeah Yeah Yeahs.\n\n\"Somebody said to me recently that we were like the Todd Solondz of garage rock,\" Cox says. \"We're always controversial, whether we intend to be or not. I've always noticed how polarized kids are with us: they either freak out and come up to me and talk about taking ecstasy in a Ford Taurus with their best friend and want to know all this stuff about the effects pedals we use or they write us death threats.\"\n\nThis is perfectly fine with Cox, and it's a reaction he seems to court. He says indie culture is nothing more than \"a bunch of attractive straight people patting themselves on the back about how 'open-minded' they are\" but digs equally into the alienating machismo of CD-R noise dude culture. \"I just don't relate to that shit at all,\" Cox says, \"I just don't think it's productive energy. A thousand bands that sound exactly alike. I feel like I'm constantly trying to posture myself against this image of indie liberal socialist queer-friendly environmental yadda yadda.\"\n\nCox's beef is with eliteism rather than any specific subculture. And, as endearing and refreshing as their awkwardness is in the face of clinical, effective indie bands that communicate not affect but rather the idea of having feelings, Cox recognizes the limitations of the approach: \"The thing about that awkwardness is it prevents us from achieving what we're really aiming for sonically and aesthetically from even enjoying the kind of social side of it.\"\n\nDeerhunter have given themselves a lot of room to flesh out their lanky frames on Cryptograms. If the dosage of panic-driven, propulsive ambient jams on the album is any indication, outgrowing their awkwardness will be a pretty great thing. The band's plans for 2007 include trying to play more shows to spread out the songs from Cryptograms and upcoming releases a little more. Cox also wants \"to teach the band a bunch of new songs I've got. I have like 12 albums written; I have literally hundreds of tapes lying around. I want to do a new record very soon after this one.\""}

Really good. It's exciting. This album took longer than the last few to make, it's been a long gestation period. It's very exciting that people get to hear it, which will be the ultimate test.\n\nTom: Yeah, exactly!\n\nILM: How did the album begin to take shape, what were your initial ideas?\n\n\n\nILM: How would you describe your relationship with the lyrics on this album?\n\n.\n\nILM: How would you describe the key themes on Last Night On Earth?\n\nTom: It's an album of discovery; it's about being young and kind of unleashed on the world.

{"text": "Interviews\n\nPoolside\n\nAccidental Splash\n\nIt seems appropriate that Poolside has sunshine on the brain. The Southern California-based duo (DJ Jeffrey Paradise and Filip Nikolic, formally of Junior Senior and Ima Robot) created their debut album Pacific Standard Time in the most regionally appropriate of settings: over drinks in their poolside studio, before literally stepping out the door to air cuts for a few friends. The result? A lackadaisical, lush blend of Balearic beats, shiny synths, and UV-baked posturing that they call \"daytime disco.\"\n\nUnder the Radar joined the duo at their Los Angeles studio space to discuss the art of defining one's musical identity, the joys and pains of releasing an album without a label, and the possibility of producing music in some very Shining-like conditions.\n\nLaura Studarus (Under the Radar): Has music always been an obsession for you?\n\nJeffrey Paradise: I had always been doing music since I was a kid. The idea of going to college, I was scared to do music, because you have to take it really seriously. I'm not very good with people telling me what to do. So I thought being ordered to play an instrument would just be unfun. I didn't know if I wanted my talent to be that I'm good at a particular instrument...I went to school for clothing design and textiles. Pretty much my last semester, I was like, \"I hate this. I'm never doing this as a job!\" Well, I didn't despise it, but the idea of it. It didn't translate, the actual craft, into a profession very easily. You either have to sell really generic stuff to the mainstream, or sell to rich people-both of which seemed not exciting.\n\nI guess that's how music is different. You can market to anyone.\n\nFilip Nikolic: I watched a cool documentary last night called PressPausePlay. It's about how the digital revolution has changed the whole music/film/art industry. Just pros and cons. It's super awesome. It proves that everything we did with this album is the right thing.\n\nHow did you handle releasing your album?\n\nJeffrey: Well we didn't give it away for free, but we had a lot of labels wanting to put it out. But it was going to be like nine months. \"You're going to have to owe us three records.\" Stuff like that.\n\nFilip: We just don't have the patience. We have so many friends who make music, and they have their album, and it takes them a year and a half to two years to put out. It's so slow nowadays! It's crazy because it should be a million times faster. But the record industry still goes in cycles of when you're allowed to put things out.\n\nJeffrey: There was one label where we said, \"OK, we'll take all your rules.\" Then at the last minute they changed their mind. We said, \"We need it out in three weeks.\" That was our thing. It has to come out in three weeks. It has to come out digitally.\n\nFilip: It came out a little late because we almost reconsidered and went with a label.\n\nJeffrey: We pushed back our deadline by two weeks for them. Then they were still pressing for more time. We were like, \"Forget it.\" Then, two days prior, they were like, \"OK, OK! Let's make the deal!\"\n\nFilip: By then we were stoked to not be working with them. It's so awesome to have full control.\n\nJeffrey: Complete autonomy. It's so cool.\n\nFilip: You can buy the album as a digital download on our web page for five bucks. But people still buy it on iTunes for $10! As soon as it came out it was widely available as an illegal download. But people are still buying it. I think if you approach all your stuff as being for the fans and create some kind of connection with people, people will want to support you. They don't want to support a big label.\n\nI think the industry is going to have to evolve to a more artist to fan transaction.\n\nJeffrey: We're happy to give people who like our music the album for five dollars. We're stoked to not have to add extra costs.\n\nFilip: I remember a couple years ago Radiohead let fans pay whatever the wanted. Everybody thought that was really cool and stuff. But if you're a new band, you're dependent on more stuff. We're lucky that we didn't consider this band our living. It was just a hobby. Every time we made money we just put it in an account. We had some cash to spend on this release. If you're a new band and you want to put out a record, it costs money. We were lucky to be able to do it that way. If we didn't have some cash up front, we would have had to go with a label.\n\nJeffrey: If we were 21 doing this, our first band, we would be locked down.\n\nFilip: Essentially a label is a really shitty bank. I've been thinking about it a lot. Even if you are a broke band, if you have somebody in your family who is eligible for a bank loan, the interest rate is way better and you keep control.\n\nJeffrey: It's like a bank loan, and then the band decides, \"You need to spend this much money on your house! And you have no real say on the matter, and you owe us that money back.\" When record labels controlled the whole distribution of everything, they could make all the rules they wanted. Now that they don't, none of those rules make any sense. It's an exciting time to do music.\n\nFilip: One thing that you get out of a good label is a strong brand attached to your name. That's important. A lot of people, if a label that they like puts out a new record, they're going to check it out. So it's not all bad when it comes to labels. But I think in our situation it's good because we're not ready to have pressure from a label either.\n\nBut how many people, like, say the average music fan, says, \"Oh I have to go pick up the new 4AD release?\"\n\nFilip: I know a lot of people who do that. Depending on the brands. I don't think people say, \"Oh, there's a new album out on Capital!\" [Laughs] But I think there's a bunch of brands nowadays that have a lifestyle connected to them. I think that attracts a lot of people as well.\n\nJeffrey: Like Kompakt. Awhile back I would buy anything on Kompakt, because I knew it would be good. And if it wasn't good, I would find a way to find something good about it.\n\nFilip: When you're young and scared to trust your own instincts in music, you want to listen to what the cool dude listens to in high school. Creating your own style is scary as fuck! You can't say, \"Oh I like Ace of Base, and I don't care what people think!\" That doesn't exist. But a lot of people secretly liked Ace of Base in high school.\n\nJeffrey: I did.\n\nI kind of feel like with the younger generation\u2014oh wow, I aged 10 years saying that\u2014but I feel like they can now. So much is available to them that high school kids 10 years ago didn't have.\n\nJeffrey: Kids these days when you ask what kind of music they like, their answer: \"Everything.\" That's the stock answer. Before, you defined your whole personality based on the kind of music that you like. And the kind of music that you hated.\n\nFilip: But when you're high school age, you don't do it based on your own instincts.\n\nJeffrey: No! Of course. Your mentors or whatever.\n\nFilip: You always had the guys that were a little older who you looked up to. They'll fucking tell you what to listen to and you'll get into it.\n\nJeffrey: I DJ at parties for kids who are like, 18. You ask them what they like, and they're all just like, \"Everything.\" Come on! Tell me who stands out, and they're like, \"Everything dude!\"\n\nIsn't that also code for nothing?\n\nFilip: Yeah, it's also bad. All of a sudden it's not music for the individual or something that you put time into. Music is something that's just present.\n\nJeffrey: Yeah, it's become functional.\n\nDo you both come from producing/DJ backgrounds?\n\nJeffrey: I've made music with others in the studio. But Filip is the producer.\n\nSo you're more on the DJ side of it.\n\nJeffrey: I had been in a bunch of bands. I found DJing, and I was like, \"OK, I like this a lot.\" I want to spend time getting good at this. It felt like it employed the way I think about music. It was really cool to be able to make these sound collages. These tapestries. Or whatever. That's how I thought of music, so I took to it really fast.\n\nGoing into Poolside, did you come into it with a musician's mindset? Or did you approach it like a DJ?\n\nFilip: None of those!\n\nJeffrey: That's a good question. We started anti-DJ and evolved. We were like, \"Fuck DJs! We don't want this to be for the club.\"\n\nFilip: But we didn't want to play live either.\n\nJeffrey: We were just trying to make music we wanted to hear while chilling out.\n\nFilip: Not even. That came way later. It started out with us just getting drunk.\n\nJeffrey: Well yeah, that's how it started!\n\nFilip: It took awhile. Even when we got signed with our first song, we weren't taking it seriously. It wasn't supposed to be our serious project. We were just trying to hang out and swim. The first idea was, when there was interest and people wanted to put it out, that we could create this thing where we'd DJ and only play daytime pool parties.\n\nJeffrey: Never nightclubs.\n\nFilip: There was even an idea\u2014just to show how loose it was in the beginning\u2014our idea was to go to a DJ gig, and have pool chairs. Then we'd hire my roommate Dave to be the actual DJ, and we'd write down lists of songs. That would be our performance.\n\nDid you ever pull that off?\n\nJeffrey: No. All our early ideas we threw away. We started getting more serious offers and thought, \"Maybe we should rethink this!\" Originally we had no ambition to do anything with the project. But it kind of took on its own life.\n\nFilip: I think that's the best thing about music in this situation. We're not worried about what other people think. I've been doing music since I was a kid. In the beginning you always want to be cool. You want people to think that you're cool. People think it's good, of course. And then that tends to take over your mind, and you're worried about if people don't like it. At some point, after doing it for so many years, all of a sudden it's like, \"I don't really care.\" The process of making this music is a way shorter version than when you're doing something that has to become something.\n\nJeffrey: Yeah. Like, if you want this played on the radio, you've got to think this way.\n\nFilip: I think the most fun part of making a song is coming up with ideas and putting it together and making it into something. With the digital revolution, it makes it a million times worse. You can edit everything, you can get into details. You can overthink it. You can recall every mix; you can keep mixing the same song. And then you go crazy because you lost perspective. All my friends do that all the time!\n\nIt sounds like you're speaking from experience.\n\nFilip: I've never been because I get so annoyed. That's why this project is cool. It's like, \"This sounds like music!\" Boom! Out.\n\nSo you were drinking, you were mixing, you played it outside, it sounded good, and so you called it a day.\n\nJeffrey: Pretty much!\n\nFilip: We made the album incredibly fast. It's a problem these days. When you do music by recording into a computer, back in the days you were limited to a tape machine and a mixer. If your mix is not good, you have to start from scratch. All the settings are going to be different. You don't have the option of, \"I'm going to rest on this for a week, and then I'll come back.\" The thing that is really interesting to me is that you have to decide. It's done now. That takes courage. It's scary. You can always change something. The whole magical part of making a song happens pretty fast. And then you have this stage where you keep working, and you have to say, \"This is done.\" We got lucky. Our first song that got us signed, I wasn't supposed to sing on it. It was a demo. When this demo got picked up and this label wanted to sign us, first of all I was like, \"I'm not a singer. I've never sung in my life.\" It was a weird thing. Then we were also thinking, \"Do we need to finish this thing?\" It's called a demo. What does that even mean? If these people like it, why isn't it finished? So we've been following that principal since then. We want to skip the frustrating parts of making music.\n\nJeffrey: I feel like that's the part that people like about it. It isn't perfect; there is looseness to the songs. It's refreshing to a lot of people. It's not overproduced. That's rad.\n\nFilip: We've been talking about this for a long time. The flaw with computers is that you can make perfect songs, and perfect songs don't have personality. We need mistakes in music because humans make mistakes. We're not perfect. When music is perfect, there's nothing human about it. Stay away from overediting!\n\nYou're touring behind this. Are you playing it live or is it a DJ set?\n\nJeffrey: It's evolved. It started as DJs only. Then we were a two-piece band. Then we got a four-piece band with a percussionist and a keyboardist. Now it's a live band.\n\nOver time you're going to start looking like Edward Sharpe on stage.\n\nJeffrey: [Laughs] That's funny.\n\nFilip: We're not really against it. The thing is, we're considered electronic music, but it's not really. It's maybe 20 percent electronic, the rest is instruments. We're awkward about the fact that we don't have a guitar player. We have guitar on the backing track. It already feels weird. But if it were a purely electronic band it wouldn't feel weird. We have the urge to have that these real instruments in the backing track should be played, but we're also really cautious about not becoming a 10-piece right away. Touring is really expensive and we don't have tour support by default.\n\nJeffrey: Yeah, that's one of the problems of putting out your own record. If touring was cheap, we'd have a six-piece band with percussionists and guitarists and all that stuff. We can't put it into reality just yet.\n\nFilip: The weird thing is that it's not as weird anymore to have a small amount of people in one band. In some people's minds, us as a four-piece is like, whoa! It's a full-on band. It's cool, but I wish we were in the 1970s.\n\nJeffrey: Totally, three semi-trucks carrying gear.\n\nWith the rush to put out this album, are you two constantly producing new material?\n\nJeffrey: Not really. We wanted it to come out this summer. We've been planning on it coming out earlier, or even at the beginning of summer. Filip got majorly busy with other production projects. We were like, \"Fuck it, it has to come out this summer.\"\n\nFilip: Also if this were our big chance, we probably would have been a lot more careful. But this was like, \"Hey, we think it's done.\" Why would we wait? The normal thing is to wait, but this doesn't have to be like that anymore. When most of the sales are digital anyway, it takes a couple of days to set up a situation where you can sell digitally.\n\nJeffrey: For us, a lot of people liked us already, so who cares what's smart? These people want this album for the summer, and it's basically done. So let's give it to them.\n\nWell if your mission statement is about creating soundtracks to pool parties, what better time, right?\n\nFilip: That's the other thing. It was the fear of it coming out in the winter.\n\nJeffrey: Yeah, it had to come out this summer or next. Waiting a full year seemed ridiculous. It could have come out this October, which was the soonest it could come out, people were saying.\n\nThe only place people are still having pool parties in October is here in Los Angeles.\n\nFilip: [Laughs] Totally.\n\nGrowing up, did Los Angeles or Southern California carry with it a certain mystique?\n\nJeffrey: I think L.A. for both of us.\n\nFilip: Oh definitely! Coming from Denmark? The whole rap scene, the whole beach scene, all these things. Even Hollywood. It doesn't mean anything to me now, but it was this place, that you have ideas of how it is. It's a lot different, but still awesome. I hated L.A. when I finally got here the first five times I was here. I couldn't stand it! I was only on the Sunset Strip. That was the only place I knew about. We didn't know any people, so we had our management tell us, \"It would be good for you if you went to this party.\" It was all crazy networking situations!\n\nAt that point, did you decide to move here?\n\nFilip: Basically what happened was we toured with Ima Robot. I became really good friends with him.\n\nJeffrey: We met during Junior Senior.\n\nFilip: Yeah, about nine years ago.\n\nI imagine coming from San Francisco to L.A. wasn't quite as much of a culture shock.\n\nJeffrey: I have a lot of connections to L.A. But I love San Francisco, so I never thought that I would leave. But it's a very small city. You don't realize that. At a certain point you've done everything there is to do. So I moved to New York for a little bit and came here.\n\nSo given that you met years ago, when did you realize that you should work together?\n\nFilip: I guess we've always been doing it for fun when he's in town. We made some really stupid songs together.\n\nJeffrey: Yeah, some silly songs.\n\nFilip: It's never really been about the music, but somehow the music always happened.\n\nJeffrey: Yeah, there was never much planned, but we had always been jibbing around somehow.\n\nFilip: He just wanted to make music, so he came over. Him, me and Timmy [Anderson] from Ima Robot worked for a couple of days. It was just all these small tiny weird projects. Mostly as a basis to just hang out.\n\nIs Poolside your main project at this point?\n\nFilip: I guess it is, which is insane!\n\nJeffrey: It's kind of become that. We still both do other stuff. This is taking up a lot of time. It's almost like it has to be. We just finished a month tour. We've got a bunch more. But it's going so much better than I would have thought, and it's a lot more fun than I thought it would be.\n\nDo you have any idea how you're going to approach your next album?\n\nFilip: I was camping a couple of months ago in Big Sur. We thought about renting a house for two months and bringing all this stuff [gestures around the studio] and take it to the house. Big Sur is so beautiful but so useless. You can hike for days, but it's too cold to swim. It's this vast nature that's just present. It's an awesome feeling. Rent a house, and go on hikes in the daytime, and make an album from scratch in those two months. It has to be done by the time we drive home. We've even considered not having Internet and phones, which would be really weird.\n\nJeffrey: I'm pretty much for that. I think it would be really disorienting in an awesome way.\n\nI have a vision of the two of you reenacting The Shining.\n\nJeffrey: [Laughs] It could happen! I think it will be awesome though. Just be up there cooking, making music, hiking, just all things that we like doing without distractions.\n\nFilip: What if after day two we just hate each other?\n\nJeffrey: Hopefully we have enough life skills to not do that. You never know, I guess.\n\nFilip: One thing that's interesting with that project is that it's not summery out there. We'll probably be there in the winter. That could make the next album the complete opposite. I don't think we really care. It would be interesting for it to be the winter album.\n\nJeffrey: I'm into the idea. It would be so easy with the Poolside concept to regurgitate Pacific Standard Time Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4. It's rad to think that each album could be totally different from the last."}
{"text": "Review\n\nReview Summary: While it might be far too inaccessible for many, for those who pay attention to Torture Garden will be rewarded with a thrilling, arty experience - a classic.\n\n8 of 10 thought this review was well written\n\nTorture Garden is one of those albums of incomprehensible beauty, complete with a creative brilliance that very few men have been capable of reaching for several eons. Perhaps this ethos (the constant will, no, the requirement for John Zorn and Company to innovate to completely irrational degrees) is the sole origin for the original scope which this album covers: it's not an expansive look at beauty itself, but rather a diverse array of the darker sides of human nature. Its ability to build something so wondrous off something so inane is beyond transcendent; it begs one to ask how the application of so many emotions and thought processes, which have been untouched by the world of music in such a way as this (beauty achieved by unreasonable, dysfunctional, and hostile terms), can be translated into an auditory vision. It also begs the question, \"how can it be so good?\"\n\nIt's not a question we can answer yet, but Naked City's approach to this sound, and the emotions which come from it, bring their listeners closer to a complete understanding of its answer. As previously stated, the outfit's beauty is not achieved by any conventional standards, but, if this is so, then how exactly is this beauty achieved? On a musical level, Zorn's latest project, and perhaps his zaniest, is one that atomizes all sorts of conventions for all sorts of genres. When they traffic in rock scenes, they don't focus on riffs, they practice \"dronology,\" and they use ethereal notes. They're world-conscious, slipping (for a short time) into various forms of tribal music and reggae. But the focus of their sound is the intellectual combination of grindcore and jazz, each component just as irrational as the other. They infuse the rapid hostility of the former genre with the saxophone tactics, syncopation, and techniques of the latter; it's all done in such a way that, to the casual listener, it seems completely disconnected. The dissonant musicianship, Yamatsuka Eye's visceral and inane vocal tactics, and the genre-fusion seems unsettling. No, it's off-putting. The way that Naked City defy what were thought to be boundaries is magnificent and challenging, but this is one of Torture Garden's most glorious achievements: it's so enigmatic.\n\nAt first, Naked City's masterpiece seems almost disconnected, but his transitions are there, albeit minuscule and obscure. Tracks like \"Punk China Doll\" use sneaky pieces of jazz to connect one idea to the next, which, subsequently, shows all the layers of these tracks. And trust me when I say there are many. In the hands of this Zorn-project, fugues of noise aren't heaps of nothing, or even heaps of everything; they're intricate compositions, just as important as, let's say, his growling tremolo sax exercises. Under planes of oscillating buzz, the band sneaks in a quiet guitar riff, portentous of what's to come. On \"Osaka Bondage,\" that intricacy seems to have transferred over to the vocal department. Eye's technique strikes unfamiliar territory, specializing in unadulterated shrieks, grunts, howls, moans, and the like, but on this track, he weaves in and out of intriguing instrumentation - more specifically, an arrangement of saxophone, cymbal, and guitar notes. His dynamics, his innovation, and his ability to work with the music, rather than overpowering it, makes his performance one of the most memorable, but to rank one member of Naked City as more important than the other is immoral beyond all comprehension; that's because Torture Garden, though fronted by one of experimental music's most prominent figures, is a collaborative effort.\n\nJoey Baron's performance is noteworthy, consisting of frenetic, jazzy drum work, precise cymbal tapping, and quaint fills; Bill Frisell alternates between a slew of hardcore riffs and that of jazz, proving to be a master of both styles. Similarly, Fred Frith's contributions on bass guitar keep in touch with the band's experimental, arty nature, and Wayne Horvitz's work on the synthesizer gives the band a more diverse sound. Indeed, all the members of the band show their talent at various points throughout the album, but it's not done with solos and other solitary movements, rather, the compositions as a whole require these performances at all times.\n\nTake for example, \"Bonehead\" where Eye's strident grunts, hollers, and moans combat a single, high-pitched saxophone squall. The best parts here aren't from musical proficiency; they're from the band's talent at demolishing any conventions they come across. This carries over to \"N.Y. Flat Top Box,\" a highly comical track that also allows for some technicality, as well as large heaps of inane eclecticism, to shine through. \"Speedfreaks\" is a more adept and serious cut, blasting through different genres every other few bars as \"N.Y. Flat Top Box\" does, but it's not kitschy or humorous. It's like the rest of Torture Garden: bestial, challenging, and highly entertaining. It's not just music (fret not, it's very fun to listen to), but it's an experience as well. It's one that deals with extremes, maneuvering around genres left and right, meshing talent and intelligence together into an enthralling masterpiece. If nothing else, you'll wonder how this band could go from the most vigorous onslaughts to tranquil beauty.\n\nlike \"the band's talent at bending the physical limits of sound\". i mean srsly\n\nlike too pretentious? like the noise and the squeals and such.\n\nand the last line is pretty ugh\n\nI couldn't think of a better way to close. Is it better without anything at the end, just with: If nothing else, you'll wonder how this band could go from the most vigorous onslaughts to tranquil beauty?\n\nbut it's well-written and whatever. you have cut down on being so unnecessarily wordy, too, so that's a good thing. also first naked city album is so much better but opinions and shit"}

After seeing the short films of Chel White, Yorke sought him out to direct his next music video.\n\nWhite, who is co-founder of Bent Image Lab in Portland, OR, chose to incorporate an innovative technique that he and the rest of the Bent artists had been researching previous to this project. Dubbed Smallgantics, the technique takes footage of large objects (rivers, factories, city skylines) and makes them appear as though they are actually miniatures. In \"Harrowdown Hill,\" Chel used aerial footage from the pacific north west to be miniaturized using Smallgantics.\n\nThe process involves splitting the footage up into several vertical planes that move back over the perceived z-axis, or into the image along its perceived depth. These planes are then affected with varying degrees of blur to simulate a shallow depth of field. If done right, the amount of blur increases smoothly as it moves along the planes of the image. Next, these levels of blur are animated to simulate a change in focus or to compensate for the forward movement of the camera"}
{"text": "Party Heard Around the World\n\nAlbum Review\n\nParty Heard Around the World is a bit of an odd title for a Lonestar album, given that the band has never been known for kicking out the jams. That's still the case here on their eighth full-length, the first to not be released on BNA and first to feature new vocalist Cody Collins. His presence doesn't alter the identity of the band much; he slides into his allocated space easily, selling the songs without inhabiting them, letting the overall sound wash over. Although Lonestar have shifted away from a major label, they're still gunning for a wide audience because commercialism simply is in their bones. The Lonestar name means nothing if the band isn't big, slick, and crowd-pleasing, which Party Heard Around the World is, even if it seems somewhat stuck in a time warp, fitting within the confines of country radio circa 2000 instead of 2010. That might cut down on their chances of actually being played on radio, but it does result in a satisfying album for fans, one that plays to expectations without quite pandering to them."}

{"text": "Hot Categories\n\nAndy Kim has lived a life steeped in songwriting. The expat Montrealer began his career in New York in the 1960s, penning hits like 'Sugar, Sugar' and 'Rock Me Gently.' Since then, he's sustained a career that led him to Toronto, where hometown artists like Ed Robertson of Barenaked Ladies, Broken Social Scene and Ron Sexsmith have embraced his songwriting skills. His newest record, 'I Forgot To Mention,' features a band that includes Iggy Pop bassist and producer Hal Kagan and Lou Reed's longtime drummer Bob Medici. The record succeeds at both sustaining and updating Kim's melodic, melancholic sound. Spinner caught up with Kim as he was set to rehearse for an upcoming NXNE spot.\n\nHow did you approach the making of 'I Forgot To Mention?'\n\nI'm really a fan of music. I've always been interested in what's going out there. I went out to the studio with the purpose of just having a band and cutting it live, doing the vocals as live as possible. I'm really excited that we kind of captured something, and I'm hoping whatever it is we captured, people can relate to.\n\nCan you tell me a little bit about your beginnings?\n\nI never really thought about it. All I knew was that for the environment I lived in, the family I grew up with, the music that was played came from a faraway land, the US. I'm sure the Beatles felt the same way, whether it was listening to Chuck Berry, the Everly Brothers or Elvis or any of their influences. I think my environment was shaped by what my older brothers played and what I was able to hear on WKBW and WABC in New York, late at night.\n\nJust all the great sounds and all the great music. Early on I became excited about the sounds of all the majestic productions of Phil Spector and the songwriters of the Brill Building, who I am very honoured to have learned so much from. I was influenced not so much by my immediate surroundings, but by the dream from another planet, which was rock and roll of the late '60s and '70s. It's always been a wonderful feeling to eventually meet people like Roy Orbison, and to meet John Lennon -- who gave me my first gold record -- and being part of the Brill Building heritage.\n\nTo me that really kind of signifies what is important to me, and that is songwriting, and songs and songwriters. That's basically who I am in a nutshell.\n\nHow did you get the courage to leave Montreal as a teen and go it alone in New York?\n\nWhen you're a teenager, the world is yours and nobody knows what you're going through, basically. You don't listen to advice. I just had this burning desire ever since I was 12 years-old to do this, and I just found a way to do this. As an adult, one looks back and says, \"Oh my god, we were so young.\" Well the truth is when you're a teenager, you're immortal. You can do what you want to do and nothing is going to go wrong. There's a certain bravado that a teenager has, and it's not based on experience, so basically ignorance is bliss at that point.\n\nI was fortunate enough that I was taller than most teenagers in the neighbourhood, I was really so strong in my belief. The belief was only in my head, but it was real to me. I had relatives that lived an hour and a half away from New York, so if I got into any problems [I could call them]. My mom and dad made me call them collect every 15 minutes.\n\nWhat is your particular songwriting method?\n\nI come from the belief that you can't teach songwriting. You can teach a craft, and you can hear the craft if it's only craft, but if I can paraphrase Sir Paul McCartney when he was asked how he and John wrote all those great songs, he said \"I don't know, it was just magic.\" The truth is that's how it starts. You're inspired to write something or sing something or come up with a lyric, but the craft doesn't start yet -- the ability and the feeling that you've heard something that you hold onto and say \"I think I've got something, I don't know what it is but I think I got something.\" That to me is the important part of knowing what you have. Songs represent your take on life, your take on something you've been inspired by.\n\nYou don't like the word 'bubblegum', do you?\n\nWell, y'know, first of all, that's a derogatory term, especially in 1969. ['Sugar, Sugar'] turned out to be the song of the year and the record of the year. It turned out to be a song that Ike and Tina [Turner] recorded and Bob Marley recorded. So if you're looking at the song, the song was written for a Saturday morning television show. I thought I was writing 'She Loves You Yeah Yeah Yeah,' because if you look at 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' and 'She Loves You Yeah Yeah Yeah' and 'Teddy Bear' and 'All Shook Up,' those songs [line up] with 'Sugar, Sugar.' Those are songs that make you feel a certain way. They weren't written for any other purpose than how the songwriter was feeling. I think with 'Sugar, Sugar' -- who knew it would become this iconic song? In 1969, the year of Woodstock and the Vietnam war, to have a song that hearkened back to the early 1960s in spirit was maybe not expected.\n\nMaybe it was healthy.\n\nYes. It's an interesting thing when you sell millions and millions and millions of records around the world -- that means that these people have actually gone and purchased something that they want to be a part of and take home and play as many times as they can play. And then someone decided, \"Well, it's uncool\" -- that's a little bit of an absurd thought to me.\n\nWhat music inspires you at the moment?\n\nAnyone who wants to be inspired, who loves what music can do to you, go out and get the new Broken Social Scene. It's just brilliant. I do this charity Christmas show every year at the Mod Club in Toronto, and the guys were there this year and kinda previewed one of their songs. I just stood there with my mouth open. You can hear the inspiration. You marvel at the craft, but it's the inspiration that gets me in awe.\n\nAndy Kim plays"}
{"text": "BAND CRUSH: PHONY PPL\n\nSomewhere in the Bed-Stuy there's a house called Casa de la Phony where the Brooklyn-based nine-piece band that is Phony Ppl reside and are starting their own mini music revolution. Not all nine members technically live at the casa--it belongs to DJ Jazzy Jay whose son Maff Yuu, is a founding member of Phony PPL--but \"it's where it all goes down and they've all got clothes there,\" Maff Yuu explained. Remember these faces (well, the ones that aren't covered by a gasmask) because this band is on the verge of taking off. They've already opened for and performed with an array of major artists spanning across multiple genres including Erykah Badu, Roots, Theophilus London, Miguel, and The Internet, which is pretty impressive for a group of 19-21 year-olds that met in high school. They joke that they met on the Internet. \"E-harmony?\" I asked. \"No, Blackpeoplemeet.com.\"\n\nHow does a band go from high school performances to opening for The Roots? In the case of Pony Ppl, it's how much they play, but more so how much they care about making music. Their music is a soulful mix of part hip-hop, part R&B, that's influenced by jazz, and heavily influenced by the '70s, '80s, and '90s (Jazzy Jay made sure of that). Since that classification is too long and somewhat broad, the group took to giving their brand of music a name of its own--that name being Brooklyn Soul. One of the band's leads, Elbee Thrie, explained how all nine members respectively invented their own genre. \"Brooklyn Soul is actually a genre that we came up with ourselves. We were playing music for awhile. We turned off the instruments and started talking about where the music came from. The word soul is very important. Soul is the most influential word of our genre. We've been doing this for so long that it's natural to us. I would hate to keep going through the rest of our lives and not knowing what to say when people ask what kind of music we make. This is our experience, who we are--our music is our souls,\" Elbie Thrie says, \"It's influenced by the people that we know, the people that we are, the accents we have, the people that live across the street, the architecture, the color schemes of the city, the slang, and how we dress. As you travel throughout Brooklyn, you'll find different cultures. Our Brooklyn culture is nine very different individuals. Phony PPL is like a new culture.\"\n\nPhony Ppl may have created their own genre and their own culture, but their music pays homage to the generations of artists that came before them. \"Don't only be influenced 100% by what is happening now because you need to understand the past before you can understand the future,\" Maff Yuu explained. \"Before you can create the future,\" Sheriff PJ corrected. \"Excuse me, create the future,\" says Maff Yuu, \"We take from everyone: Europe, Africa--you can be from anywhere and we'll listen to it and have it relate to what we do.\"\n\nWhat sets them apart isn't only the band's unique sound--they're smart enough to distance themselves from everything that's wrong about the way new artists emerge today. \"The magnifying glass is in the wrong area. And that's what people are gravitating towards,\" says Sheriff PJ. Aja adds, \"Being a musician is more accessible now due to technology. And now it's all about the visuals. I think that Phony Ppl brings back that music element that's not just about the way things look. If it was my choice, no one would even have to see us. I want the music to speak for itself.\"\n\n\"We bring a different outlook to music. It's that old-school instrumental sound in a world that's very digital. It's Brooklyn soul.\" If you're still not exactly sure what Brooklyn Soul is, watch their new video for \"I Wish I Was a Chair\"or since the band's would say, \"it's not all about the visuals\" you can listen to all of their music right here.\n\nBut if you really want to get a good visual, just use your imagination like the band does to make music everyday. Picture them sitting in their Bed-Stuy basement making beats, being fly, and looking fly. \"It's about the music, but you gotta be fly. We're from Brooklyn and people from Brooklyn is not, not fly.\" Or better yet, watch them live at Brooklyn Bowl on February 21st."}

But something lets it down. That something tends to be the lyrics. They have none of the punch of great pop lyrics and though they strive to be clever, they're never quite clever enough. The Bixsexual is a case in point. It's a story about Arabia being angry with another man who he thinks is trying to steal his girlfriend, only to realise that it's not the girlfriend his rival is interested in. It's a neat conceit but the lyric doesn't really manage to do much with the set-up. It's a story without a punchline.\n\nAh but the music is pure joy.

{"text": "Though the melodies aren't quite as instantly memorable, the album is in many ways superior to its predecessor. The band's multi-part harmonies function more as a piece of the wide-screen arrangements rather than the dominant feature. The voice of Robin Pecknold is more out front and lyrically direct; against an intricate web of counterpoint melodies, he plays the troubled narrator wrestling with his place in the world. Employing everything from woodwinds to Tibetan singing bowls, with finger-picked acoustic guitars sailing atop rumbling timpani, the band makes a wonderful sound: rich but not overstuffed, intricate but not labored, virtuosic without sounding like anyone's showing off. The songs don't stick to verse-chorus formula, they're more like mini-suites that turn and twist without drawing attention to their complexity.\n\nIf there's a shortcoming, it's that the band is almost too subtle for its own good; all that beauty and detail is rarely played for dramatic effect. When Pecknold's pristine voice rises and finally cracks on \"The Shrine/An Argument,\" followed by a free-jazz freak-out, it's the type of musical jolt the rest of the album lacks.\n\nBut such outbursts probably wouldn't make sense in fleshing out the album's central theme. \"Could I wash my hands of just looking out for me?\" Pecknold sings on \"Montezuma.\" On the title song, he declares his desire to \"be a functioning cog in some great machinery, serving something beyond me.\"\n\nIn striving for more self-less version of self, Pecknold and his excellent band have made an album that embraces modesty. Which is why it may take a few listens for its rarefied combination of beauty and anxiety to hit home. In this case, another virtue that Pecknold extols -- patience \u2013 has its rewards.\n\n\"You may need to spend significant time questioning and even disliking Helplessness Blues before it reveals its gifts to you, but given that its creation is forever connected with human suffering, that price is only fitting"}
{"text": "Dusted Reviews\n\n\"The Art of Letting Go\" is Save The World's second track and first real song. Equal parts goofy energy and stoic reserve, it's as good a summary of this collaboration between Michael Mayer and Superpitcher as one could hope for. Mayer and Superpitcher (Christian name Aksel Schaufler) have been a major force in shaping contemporary house and techno music through the conduit of the Cologne-based Kompakt label, which Mayer runs. Music fans with only a passing knowledge of or interest in electronic music are likely familiar with the label via its consistent design philosophy: its penchant for retro-futurist, largely non-representational artwork gives the impression of a unitary brand, one whose signees aren't so much artists as an expedience for transmitting ideas lodged in the label itself. So when, after the squelchy, illegible intro of \"Hey!,\" a \"Billie Jean\" aping beat announces the real start of the album, the collaboration might pass, albeit momentarily, for something like Map of Africa.\n\nIt's not a huge surprise, even for a label staked on a deep, implied groove rather than the familiar catharsis of rock; still, it's a calibration, and a deliberate and openly strategic one at that. The idea of Kompakt as a overcoding entity is pretty far from the truth, but does go a certain distance in explaining why it took half a decade for the label, or the glitch-scarred and consistently innovative form of techno that it has become synonymous with, to gain the pitch of critical admiration and subsequent backlash that, for the past decade or so, has been pretty much de rigueur for anything that feels new. The song's bass, in the context of the label's oeuvre, can only be described as \"intensely fretted,\" its unsynth bleed emphasized by an epic hammer-on bridge. This is to say nothing of the lyrics, which tell the kind of story that can only be rendered in two lines: \"Let's get to it, alright, let me go,\" goes the smarmy first half, echoed in the second by a ghostly, desperate incantation of the song's title. The attention that the voice commands is deployed deliberately here as on the album's only other narrative, vocal track, the woozy, mythlike \"The Lonesome King.\" The same formal, architectural impulse inhabits these compositions as well as the more gradual construction and subtraction of tracks like the casually gorgeous \"Please Sunrise.\" Still essentially narrative, the structure is the story: it's Neu!'s \"Leb'wohl\" melted down and smuggled into Ibiza. \"The Lonesome King\" is likewise bathed in corrupted, nostalgic light. But while the pleasure of \"Please Sunrise\" is the unaccounted-for remainder of the track's transitions between compositional elements, \"The Lonesome King\" is a productive attempt to cram as much unexpected instrumentation (saxophone, trumpet, flute, and melodica, to begin with) into a song form that, unlike much Kompakt material, doesn't make up its own rules as it goes along.\n\nThe album, taken as a whole, is less of a departure than it may lead us to believe. The deflated faces that adorn the superheroes' chests are as good an indicator as the music \u2013 SuperMayer's not just puncturing the idea of supergroup or of Kompakt-as-brand; they're very openly draining out self-seriousness in a tongue-in-cheek attempt to court and bait an audience that's beginning to take a more specific interest in them, an audience whose first musical language is indie. It's also a critical feint that's designed, at least in part, to underline the fact that Kompakt and its artists straddle several big musical fault lines. By the time you reach the end of the album, though, you'll be convinced you were overthinking it: \"Cocktails for Two\" screams class like red wine, Steely Dan, and early '90s R&B. A heavy red velvet curtain cast down, the duo slip out the back door of their own scenario relatively unnoticed."}

There is a song at the end of the album titled \"Peter Makowski Has an Aneurysm\". I'm not sure what his father, Ed, thinks of this. Ed is a classical music guru. Why is this important? Because I've been working with Ed for years in music retail, and he kept talking about his son's band, and now their long-gestating debut is in my CD player. Strange, huh? Though it's doubtful that Ed would dig the song about his son's aneurysm, he can still appreciate that if you're going to do a rock album as dark as this, you might as well go full out. Song titles like \"Teapot Dome, Bitch\" and \"Dogfucker\" give you an idea of the contents inside, and even with the dry production and uninteresting guitar flourishes, their sense of melodicism is undeniable. The aforementioned \"Dogfucker\" is, in fact, a gut-wrenching and tragic ballad about loving a woman so much\u2026 until she commits the act mentioned in the title. \"You'd Look Cute in the Trunk of My Car\" is Blood Brothers on a budget, and they don't sound half bad.

Instead of the fever-dream intensity he brought to his gothic melodies in the 1980s, singer Ian McCullough relied on a subdued croon for both old favorites (\"The Cutter\") and new material (\"Nothing Lasts Forever\"). McCullough summoned some genuine fervor to a few songs, such as \"The Back of Love,\" but for the most part he played it cool, never shedding his fur-collared overcoat nor exerting himself enough to make it necessary. Accompanied by three additional musicians, moody lighting, and lots of fog, Will Sergeant's ringing, droning lead guitar and Les Pattinson's surging bass provided plenty of atmosphere.

{"text": "Tags\n\nEveryone's tags\n\nBiography\n\nLisa Issaksson, otherwise known as Lisa O Piu (Piu roughly translating as 'and more' relating to her band Piu), grew up in a small town on the outskirts of Stockholm in her native Sweden where she spent her time in horse stables dreaming of becoming a riding teacher and owning her own stables. When she wasn't with the horses she was drawing them, a passion that is reflected in her music today. As Lisa grew older and discovered music the drawings of horses soon became song lyrics and it wasn't long before Lisa had rescued her mothers old guitar from a life in the attic and began experimenting with her voice and song.\n\nThrough the years her love of music continued to grow and, apart from performing with friends and eventually forming the band Piu, she began exploring recording techniques with a friends multi-track recorder (lillportan).\n\nLisa's first recording, a cdr entitled 'Cantering' which was recorded on the four-track and released under the name of Lisa O Lillportan, was distributed by the small Swedish cdr label H\u00f6r upp and limited to a release of thirty copies.\n\nAs Lisa continues to perform her music at various venues around the Stockholm area her debut release through Autumn Ferment Records is nearing completion and will soon be released."}
{"text": "Dusted Reviews\n\nAlways a bit icy, each edition of Adult. has followed a different path below zero. Why Bother? drops the bass guitar that gave a black sheen to their synth 'n' caterwaul sound over the past few years. Now it's back to the blips, with every stab pushed into the squelching range. The pristine electro of their earlier work has accumulated road salt from the drive through death rock. They give us dirt this time, as scenic as that brown ice that builds up behind a car's wheel by the end of winter.\n\nAs their music has grown more detailed, the details have become ever more foreboding. The disco handclaps that lent goofy charm to an early track like \"Nite Life\" are still present in \"I'm Inclined to Vomit\" (predictably, one of the highlights here). But slipped between three other beats, the claps crack like the work of a chiropractor. The lyrics for \"Vomit\" are even less subtle than the title, yet the loops of crud and relentlessly off-center rhythms stagger into fully formed song. It's a common theme on Bother? - tunes bust out at punk tempos, glassy squalls fighting against the vocals with verse-chorus-verse familiarity rising out of all the twisting and shouting. The less ornate numbers come across more like instrumentals, even when Nicola Kuperus tries to sing. She actually carries a tune in a few spots here, a distinct departure from the constant harangue of D.U.M.E. and Gimme Trouble. It's a good strategy for making such willfully ugly music enticing. Each straight-ahead song has a hook, and while it's a hook weighted with hatefulness, it's something to grasp in the tornado of digital scuzz. The moodier and open-ended bits become a welcome chill out.\n\nWhy Bother? is the work of an \"album\" band, with their dance roots receding into the distance. There's a theme: the forces of conformity closing in, a disgust towards those that try to herd the sheep. There's the consistent fried-circuit sound. Two of the more fragmentary bits are the soundtrack for a video on their website. It's not a music video, it's more of an arthouse thing. Two figures wander separately, their heads cropped out of every shot. They keep describing the same geometric symbol- in chopped kindling, in embroidery, in blood. Adult. has become a self contained project - part music, part photography, all driving towards an aesthetic where the rusty and discarded and disjointed are presented with antiseptic precision.\n\nIf Adult. has forsaken the social functions of dance music, they still hold on to a few principles from their electro days; a willingness to go over the top without winking, rhythm kept as the centerpiece. The right beats can overcome the most haywire setting. \"Nite Life\" posed the question \"Which do I keep / you or my nightlife?\" The nightlife is gone, but so is any hint of daylight."}
{"text": "Gomez likes to have a good time all the time\n\n\"A lot of it's to do with really simple things, like the range of the song, what key it's in, what fits best...the rhythm of the song,\" Ottewell says. \"Ian's a lot better rhythmic singer than I am, so with songs like that, I just let Ian sing it. But that's not always the case. Sometimes you have to go with what sounds best.\"\n\n\"What sounds best\" seems to be a point of contention between critics on both sides of the pond. While the majority of American reviewers have shown slavish devotion, British scribes have been mostly underwhelmed with Gomez's latest.\n\nJasper James\n\nOne of these guys is named Olly Peacock. Seriously. Not making fun, just saying.\n\nMore About\n\n\"There's a bit of ill feeling toward this album in the British press, but nothing really savage yet, so that's good,\" Ottewell says. In fact, the biggest criticism of Gomez so far is that its music is the emotional equivalent of junk food: There's nothing of real substance for sentimental types to chew on. Indeed, with songs like \"Whipping Piccadilly\" (about going to a Beck concert and whacking a shoelace against the Piccadilly train-station sign), \"Tijuana Lady\" (with its nonsensical lyrics like \"enchilada desperado days\") and \"Ruff Stuff\" (\"Come back/I've been hangin' around in smack bogs, baby\"), Gomez isn't exactly exploring the same territory as its tear-soaked countrymen Radiohead and Starsailor. But the criticisms don't bother the band much.\n\n\"We don't really listen to [the critics]. It's not going to change who we are or how we make music,\" Ottewell says. Besides, the boys have greater challenges to face. \"Getting over hangovers rates pretty high. And football matches within the band. A member of our crew broke my toe in a challenge.\""}
{"text": "Every once in a while, a trend will sweep through a genre and become completely inescapable. Trap music has taken over mainstream rap in recent years, combining droning bass, skittering hi-hats, and aggressive boasting into an oddly hypnotic package.\n\nIt's the type of music you hear blaring from passing cars but all that you can really hear is the bass.\n\nSZA is using the foundation of trap music to make shimmering R&B with conceptually bizarre lyrics. It's trap music with the platinum chains replaced by flower anklets. It's less about dealing coke and more about sharing a bong at a tie-dye love-in.\n\nS could have just been an interesting novelty, but SZA herself makes it memorable as something more than that. Her vocals are drenched in echo and reverb, and while she can definitely sing well, her vocals are mostly kept light. She could overpower the songs if she really wanted to, but chooses to complement the production instead.\n\nThis turns out to be a great idea, because the combination of heavy bass and New Age music makes the songs bounce back and forth between club music and lullabies. It's not the type of music that will get you to tear the club up or beat down someone who just stepped on your shoes, even though it sounds like it was produced by the very same aggressive beatsmiths.\n\nThe lyrics of the songs are strange, but they manage to be fitting for such an odd musical mashup. \"I am not human / I am made of bacon\" isn't a deep lyrical statement, and \"Feeling like Topanga, Patti Mayonnaise\" is great if you liked Boy Meets World and Doug, but is out of context even within the song. The lyrics are nearly incomprehensible but they fit into the atmosphere of the songs perfectly.\n\nS is less than 30 minutes long, but its brief length seems intentional, as if it's merely a part of a larger project. It wastes a little too much time with skits and the song \"Wings\" is weak, but this EP is worth a listen. It could be the only album in recent memory that would appeal to hippies, hip-hop heads and anyone else who likes blasting music out of their car windows."}
{"text": "Luna\n\nPet Rock; 2008\n\nArtists:\n\nFind it at:\n\nIf the Aliens remind you of the Beta Band, it's because they almost are the Beta Band. When the Betas split in 2004, three of its original members-- keyboardist John MacLean, drummer Robin Jones, and guitarist Gordon Anderson (who had recorded solo as Lone Pigeon)-- decided they still had some creating to do together, and forged the Aliens. The new band, which released its debut album, Astronomy for Dogs, in 2007, like their former band, veers between experimentalism and pop songcraft. Luna, their sophomore effort, is cut from the same cloth.\n\nAt their best, the Aliens are clever composers, tuneful harmonists, and positioned in shallow leftfield. At their worst, they cry out for an editor and wander the outfield when they should be keeping their eye on the ball. Clocking in at over an hour, Luna probably would've been best served by a trim to around 45 minutes. Two songs break the 10-minute mark, and neither justifies it. Opener \"Bobby's Song\" gets good mileage in its midsection from playing with the speed and pitch of the vocal track, but the song takes it too far during a tiresome slowdown near the end. Still, there's a good song swimming in the psychedelic soup, and it pops up in the imaginative harmonica intro and the verses.\n\nThe other epic, \"Billy Jack\", is as unfocused as the movie it's named for. It opens with over a minute of vocals trying to find their way out of a processing morass while keyboards noodle, before finally arriving at a drifting verse that's overpopulated with noise. The song keeps finding its footing, and each time piles on too much reverb and distortion and loses it. They seem to have imagined it as some sort of psychedelic glam epic, but it only becomes that more than six minutes in. In contrast, \"Everyone\" is a great four-minute slice of sunshine pop-psych, with buoyant piano and harmonies.\n\nOther missteps include the awkward way \"Sunlamp Show\" suddenly and sloppily shifts rhythms mid-way through, the three spaced-out electronic interludes where one would suffice, or the repetitive and amelodic \"Magic Man\". On the whole, these songs overshadow the loveliness of the sparse ballad \"Theremin\" and the diaphanous closer \"Blue Mantle.\" But it's \"Boats\", a sort of self-cover of a Lone Pigeon song from 2004's Schoozzzmmii, that does the most to redeem the record with its spectral harmonies and spacious arrangement, which gives the impression of traveling through a galaxy as starbursts of piano drift by. Luna is enjoyable enough to listen to, and a lot of Beta Band followers will find plenty to enjoy here, but it's ultimately an album I didn't like as much as I wanted to, and one that doesn't really find its footing until it's almost over."}
{"text": "There's a growing scene of artists based primarily in NY (at least as far as the US scene is concerned) dedicated to the concept of making music using old video game hardware. Being fairly new to the scene myself, I don't claim to know much; but I have heard some really good stuff that's come out of it (you may recall this post about fellow \"chip scene\" artist Mark Denardo). However, until now I have not enjoyed anything I've heard as much as I do today's track. This song was recommended to me by a friend, and I am happy to pass the recommendation along to our readers.\n\nAnamanaguchi go beyond just making sounds with NES hardware, and integrate their 8-bit music with a full live-band setup (drums, bass, and two guitars). The electronic sounds mesh seamlessly with the more traditional components to create some of the most enjoyable power-pop I've heard recently. And unlike some 8-bit enthusiasts I've come across, Anamanaguchi's sound doesn't come off as gimmicky or dispensable."}

The transitions from song to song could've been smoother, but I forgot about that when I heard the cheerful \"I Just Can't,\" the too-happy-to-be-a-breakup-song breakup song that made me smile and think MXPX.\n\nOverall, Makin' Moves is tight.

{"text": "It's not exactly a unique take to point out the cognitive dissonance between the sunny surf rock layers of Album and its melancholy subject matter, but it's such a defining aspect of the album that you can't ignore it.It's an album of disillusioned late summer, when tans turn leathery, when flings turn into breakups, when warmth becomes suffocating heat.If you can take Christopher Owens' Elvis-Costello-after-a-night-of-speedballs vocals and you have half the appreciation for surf music that I do, then you'll find Album as lovely and moving as I have.\n\n\u2014All Mod Cons by The Jam\n\nElvis Costello meets The Who\n\nThe Jam is apparently massively successful in its native England, but that fame never translated across the Atlantic.

{"text": "Flip Your Wig: Hostage Calm \"Hostage Calm\"\n\nIt's hard to explain why you're a pop-punk fan if you are over the age of 20. Most people have a crystalline memory of Blink-182 running around naked and stop their curiosity there. The genre has as much potential to carry social change, introspection, and power as any other genre, but it's often lost in a quagmire of angst, questionable fashion, and chunky power chords. Luckily, there has been a resurgence of talented and articulate bands who have been building steady followings.\n\nConnecticut's Hostage Calm have spent ample time studying the Kid Dynamite and Gatsby's American Dream's playbooks, merging everything from breakneck hardcore, salsa numbers, three part vocal harmonies, and intricate time structures into a refreshing breath of exuberant music. Bored of the confines of hardcore music, but not it's messages, Hostage Calm delivered a perplexing 180 on their sonic approach to last year's self-titled effort. The energy remained, but, much like when Saves The Day broke through with \"Stay Where You Are\" and No Doubt went pop with \"Tragic Kingdom\", the whole approach changed. I'm happy to report that they are still as socially aware and relatable as ever.\n\nSongs like \"Ballots/Stones\" challenge the rationale of anti-gay-marriage politics with simple, infectious melodies while \"Rebel Fatigues\" takes a look at American foreign policies from the other perspective. Hardcore lifers need not fret; the blistering guitar work and breakdowns still pop up, just differently than before. Just because more is sung than yelled is no reason to jettison this to the used bin. Chris' singing is actually more endearing because it isn't studio or American Idol's perception of \"perfect\".\n\nConecticut's New Favorite Sons\n\nAlong with other bands like The Wonder Years, Set Your Goals, Transit, and Fireworks, Hostage Calm builds bridges between very different schools of thought and winning over crowds wherever they go. Personal biases for the genre aside (it rules), it's comforting to be reminded how something so simple can incorporate and mean so many different things at any given time. It's more refreshing, given the band's recent partnership with Alternative Press to urge New York senators to legalize gay marriage in their state, that the band puts their words into action like true activists and allies. If you'd like to have a half hour with a quirky, honest, and intelligent young men, you might want to consider following Hostage Calm, as they're nearly destined for greatness.\n\nRecommended If You Like:\nGatsby's American Dream's \"Gatsby's American Dream\"\nThe Wonder Years \"Suburbia, I've Given You All and Now I'm Nothing\"\nCrime in Stereo's \"The Troubled Stateside\""}
{"text": "Not long ago, I came across a band by the name of Nerves Junior that really blew me away. Who were these guys and where did they come from? This is the type of music the world needs to hear and support-- Nerves Junior is good music. Their full length album As Bright As Your Night Light, is one of my top albums of 2011 and hopefully will be yours too. Check out the interview with founding member Cory Wayne.\n\nWas there a strategy behind the mystery of who Nerves Junior is? For example was being more mysterious at first a way to spark curiosity? No, being mysterious was not intentionally a way to spark more interest, we are just chronically unorganized.\n\nWhere does the band name come from and what does it represent to you guys? The band name is a very silly silly idea. I wanted to be called The Nerves but there is already a pretty rad, pseudo \"popular\" band with that title. I was listening to a lot of Dinosaur Jr. at the time, who also found themselves in a similar predicament way back when, so we took a cue from them.\n\nYou're from Louisville, how is the music scene in that area? The music scene here is weird, but I feel like it is getting better. For example, I think we are the only \"indie\" band with a drum machine. But the punk and garage scene is off the chains.\n\nHow would you describe your sound and style of music? Our sound and style is a direct bastard. Organic Electro-Pop\u2026\u2026I'm just a lover of sounds, and while we explore a lot of different sounds, the constants are definitely the crisp punch of a snare on a drum machine that never changes, open string tunings, thick bass, et al.\n\nAs Bright As Your Night Light is one of my favorite albums of the year, can you explain briefly about the concept/process of the album? The album is a sort of concept about losing your mind in a desert and trying to recover. There's a lot of commentary on the direct influences of my own feelings, lovers, lack of money, drugs, dreaming in the daytime.\n\nWhat does the title of the album represent? It represents a combination of childlike sleep and the ability of certain things to shine threw the dark no matter what.\n\nI'm always a sucker for interesting cover art and for some reason As Bright As Your Nights' stands out a lot to me. Who designed the cover and what was the thought behind that? IT WAS ALL LOGAN REULET, and the art he created totally captured the childlike wonderment I was just speaking on.\n\nIf you had to chose your favorite song on the album what would it be? Least favorite (if you have one)? My favorite song is \"Champagne with Peaches,\" in my eyes there is a certain balance to it that\u2026 i dunno\u2026 it seems to speak to my beauty strings, the machines and instruments speak to each other very clearly\u2026 all call and response. I don't dislike any of the songs - if there was a weak link, it would've stayed on the cutting room floor.\n\nAny upcoming tour dates? No tour dates as of yet\u2026 working on getting a van first.\n\nWho is one artist or band you'd love to go on tour with? Clinic\u2026 very very badly. We'd be down with Lady Gaga too.\n\nLastly, what can we expect in the future of Nerves Junior? I dunno at the time, hopefully minimalism and more dancing, more fuzz, and more analog bass"}
{"text": "CaveNeverendless\n\nThe process of paring-away can reveal the power of purity and simplicity in music, or it can reveal the essential flimsiness of a band's entire approach. Cave's LP Neverendless mostly does the former, with just a smidgen of the latter. The Chicago quartet's early records\u2014especially the near-perfect Psychic Psummer\u2014called back to early-'70s art-rock, emphasizing rhythm and psychedelic fuzz. Neverendless is heavier, groovier, and much less eclectic. The album's five songs stretch and build, but the prevailing method here is repetition of riffs and beats for minutes on end, creating a sound halfway between hypnotic drone and sweet tension. Sometimes these songs\u2014nearly all instrumental\u2014sound like overtures for the epic rock album that Cave is disinclined to make. But the advantage of Neverendless' approach is that when Cave breaks from intricate pattern-making and just rocks out, arena-style (as on the album-opener, \"WUJ\") the moment of release is all the more satisfying because of the long wait. And when Cave steps on the gas and keeps driving forward on the 14-minute \"This Is The Best,\" the sense of infinite open space is awe-inspiring."}
{"text": "Interview\n\nI think I've always had this dream about recording my own album. I guess the time was right now. The Flower Kings have had the release of \"Retropolis\" in which I composed a few songs. Then I was inspired and off we go!\n\nAll songs on the album were composed by yourself. Did you had finished ideas when you went into the studio or were some parts even composed while recording?\n\nThe following songs where mainly completed before we started to record them in the studio: \"Into the dreamscape\", \"The ballerina from far beyond\", \"Speed wizard\", \"In the land of the pumpkins\", \"Three stories\". The rest of the material was partly instant composing. I think musicians always take influences from each other. That's why I prefer to play with Roine or Jaime. I mean they stand for good influences.\n\nBesides them, which other musicians did influence you the most?\n\nI just love symphonic rock, one of my biggest kicks was \"Relayer\". But I also like Fusionrock i.e. Weather Report. So that's the explanation to some of the material. But to answer your question. The answer is without any doubt Roine.\n\nOn your album you play many different kinds of keyboards i.e. Mellotron, Church Organ or Hammond. Are they all original or did you also use some samples?\n\nI'm playing both the original stuff and samples. To me it doesn't really matter which kind of instrument you are using. The important thing is how it sounds and how you're playing it. Another funny thing is that it's easier to play a real piano compared to a samplepiano.\n\nIs it you hiding behind the pseudonym Gepetto Azzaro?\n\nYes, I am Gepetto. I found that name could match with Roines pseudnoym, Mr. Don Azzaro."}
{"text": "[Locals Only] Stanleylucasrevolution, 'Evolutionary Sunset Call'\n\nYou'd assume it's led by some guy named Stanley Lucas, right? But Stanley Lucas is a fictional character, afflicted with a terminal illness (the specific condition doesn't seem to be important, but it's a prominent motif in several songs). Though the artist behind stanleylucasrevolution performs live (usually as a one-man-band with backing loops), he prefers not to be named or depicted in the media, instead asking outlets to run \"abstract images representing larger causes.\" It's rock meeting conceptual art in a way not usually seen outside the Lou Reed-Laurie Anderson marriage.\n\nMore About\n\nThe music itself is more conventional than you'd believe. Evolutionary Sunset Call, the latest stanleylucasrevolution release, features such surprisingly catchy songs as the social commentary-filled \"We Still Love Them\" and \"New Stone 40.\" Sure, there's plenty of weird stuff, too, such as \"(Intro in C),\" 42 seconds of seemingly random noises in the middle of the album. \"Two Ways\" starts with the same creepy voice sample (\"What's the matter with you, thought you were asleep\") repeated several times, followed by a dramatically slowed track with overdubbed vocals.\n\nGiven the potential as a singer and songwriter shown throughout the album, the prevailing question is if all this is a distraction preventing stanleylucasrevolution from further success, or the exact thing that distinguishes the \"band\" from the myriad more accessible acts out there. Evolutionary Sunset Call might not be enough to arrive at a definitive answer, but points have to be given for originality. There are a lot of ideas at work here, both musically and aesthetically. Like any piece of conceptual art, it's more about forcing you to think in a different way than the end product. And if the end product has some good hooks, all the better."}

Whether they will depends on the public's appetite for earnest melodies and lyrics that talk a lot without actually saying anything. Chris Martin's made a career out of it, so who knows, but Black Swan's generous servings of crescendo-and-strings guitar music are so all-encompassing that any charm is suffocated. They seem like a nice lot - but that's the problem, there's no edge. This is music for a Hollyoaks montage, or for waving mobile phones in the air to at V festival. It's hard to love."}
{"text": "Chemako\n\nChemako\n\nUltra Sound\n\nBluesWax Rating: 2 out of 10\n\nCategorize Under WTF Blues\n\nThere are several different styles of blues albums; this one lands under \"confusing.\" It's not that you can't label it with a certain style, it's just that it is so inconsistent from one song to the next you don't know what you are listening to. The vocalists even change from male to female almost from song to song. There needs to be some sort of a foothold to steer this ship and bring the listener somewhere.\n\nThe album is a project of three friends getting together and putting an album out. Sounds innocent enough until you have to sit through it. The odd part is that most of the album has these women singing, yet they aren't pictured in the album jacket. The two songwriters are, but three women who make a large portion of the album don't get pictured at all. I guess they missed press picture day. Overall somebody had to take the lead and make this project smooth. It's one thing to have fun with friends, but remember that it's a dog-eat-dog world out there and you may be wearing Milk Bone underwear.\n\nOne of the better songs here is the Lightnin' Hopkins-ish \"Dry Your Tears.\" It's a loose blues piece with Jimmy Ragazzon on the vocals and harp. It's a lazy song that you could just lay back to and not have a care in the world about. The opener, \"Red Diamond Train,\" is a strong song with the banjo plucking the way and Shan Kowert's dark vocals leading to a swampy run of rail. Annie Acton brings her \"Tears for Breakfast\" and it's a soulful tune you could easily listen to on this album.\n\nOn the other side you have to dig through songs like \"Let It Burn Wild,\" which sounds like Kenny Loggins' \"Return to Pooh Corner.\" Loggins' song will forever give me nightmares. Why record a song that sounds so similar?!? The lullaby song of the disc goes to \"Save the Moon.\" Someone thought to put it in the middle of the disc at song number six. Not a good choice. This song makes you stop the disc quickly. Already two tragic songs in the first six! Not good odds boys.\n\nAgain, it's been said before, making an album is a privilege not a right. Focus on what you what to say and say it, 'cause the only statement that this album left me with was \"umm\u2026\""}
{"text": "\"Making this album was a pretty painful process,\" admits Forms frontman Alex Tween when asked about the band's follow-up to 2004's incredibly well-received, Pitchfork-approved debut Icarus\u2014and, to be honest, his comment is a bit of an understatement. Recorded consecutively over a 50-day period in Illinois with Steve Albini (Nirvana, the Pixies) at Electrical Audio and assisted by Greg Norman (Built To Spill, Pelican) at Great Western Record Recorders, the process tested the New York act's limits of the band's sonics and sanity in ways that most of us couldn't even begin to imagine. \"We couldn't afford to take one day off because we'd already paid for the studio time; all for 30 minutes of music, which works out to 35 seconds a day,\" frontman Alex Tween explains, \"but we're really proud of how it came out.\"\n\nIndeed, despite (and listening to the lyrics, maybe partially because of) all the physical and financial struggles the band- which also features guitarist Brendan Kenny, bassist Jackson Kenny and drummer Matt Walsh- endured during the recording, the disc takes the band's unique brand of post-hardcore to indescribable new levels. Fading in and out of each other like a series of dream sequences, The Forms evokes the classic Dischord roster such as Shudder To Think and Fugazi as much as it does underappreciated '90s acts like Slowdive and the Dismemberment Plan, but puts things in a more accessible pop context that will appeal to record store nerds and NPR listeners alike. \"We've always felt like we've never fit in anywhere, especially in New York,\" Tween explains.\" But things seems to be changing; people seem to be open to something a little more challenging and different,\" he continues, adding the band feel a kinship with peers such as Battles, Deerhoof and Dirty Projectors.\n\nAbove all The Forms are perfectionists (Albini himself admitted he'd never worked with a band that had gone over the same piece of tape 58 times, as The Forms did on their debut) and if anything, that attention to detail is amplified on the band's latest disc. >From the hypnotic opener \"Knowledge In Hand\" to the alternately driving and droning (in a good way) \"Red Gun\", all of the songs on The Forms are distinctively different without compromising the band's unique vision. In fact, if the album's ethereal closer \"Getting It Back\" doesn't completely captivate you, well, we don't know what to tell you. \"With this new album we really didn't want to take the easy way out and instead tried to make our ideas work as songs by having parts work with each other organically and actually make sense,\" Tween explains. \"We still tried to mess with the idea of what a song is every chance we could get, but I think the end result is a lot more cohesive and refined than the first record.\""}

Continuous Thunder\n\nJapandroids Celebration Rock\n\nCelebration Rock was never supposed to happen for Japandroids, but I am sure they and their fans are glad it did. Originally the Vancouver duo was only planning on releasing their one full-length, the loud and fuzz-filled rocker Post-Nothing, because the band never really took off. I guess critical praise can change minds though, so the band decided to tour, things went well, and here we are.\n\nFor those less familiar, Japandroids are comprised of Brian King (guitar and vocals) and David Prowse (drums and vocals), and for two guys they make a big sound. It is said they are two guys trying sound like five, and if anyone can, they do.\n\nThere are a lot of similarities between Post-Nothing and Celebration Rock. Just one look at the covers lets you know that they aren't too different. And the fact that they are both 8 song albums, clocking in at 35 minutes a piece doesn't help. You still get that same big fuzzy sound and two dudes screaming at you. There are differences though, and those differences make Celebration Rock better than its predecessor.\n\nKnowing what we do about Post-Nothing, it's easy to hear the sound of two guys getting older, trying to be rock stars, and dealing with having to give it all up some day. It's what appeared to be happening in their lives, and while it still rocks, it's a bit of a bummer at times because it's where many of us have eventually gone (or sadly will be some day). Celebration Rock is the album of those same guys that ended up getting to become what they had hoped to become and lets the world know not to give up and that \"if they can do it, you can too.\" In doing so, it takes that similar sound, and puts a positive and uplifting spin on it all. Hell even starts and ends with fireworks!\n\nSimply put, if you want an album to rock out to this summer, Celebration Rock is it. It's made for running in the sun, driving fast, and screaming with your drunken friends late into the night. Maybe it's not all that different than the previous Japandroids album, but if it isn't broke, don't fix it\u2026 unless you make little fixes that make it better. This is what Japandroids have done this go round. In doing so they remind us, and themselves, that rock isn't about getting older, it's about being young forever.\n\nKey Tracks: The Nights of Wine and Roses, For the Love of Ivy, The House That Heaven Built"}

{"text": "Oyster #98: Cut Copy\n\n\"I like the idea of being a fan again.\"\n\nEven though they were robbed at the Grammys (by Skrillex!), I still love Cut Copy as much as the time I first heard 'Saturdays' late one night in a taxi. Heads and hearts halfstuck in another time and place, they make music for the perpetual nostalgic and the hopeless romantic. We met up to talk about the sounds of the past, present and future \u2014 so it was only fitting that the car-turned-timemachine from Back to the Future turned up and nearly distracted us all into oblivion.\n\nEmily Royal: What's your earliest memory of hearing music? Dan Whitford: My parents were endlessly listening to jazz records. So, for the first 20 years of my life I couldn't listen to jazz; I couldn't disconnect it from my parents. In terms of pop music, it would've been Michael Jackson. Tim Hoey: I joined a Michael Jackson fan club. I would take a picture of him to my hairdresser \u2014 from around the Bad era, when he had the Jheri curl \u2014 and I'd ask for her to cut my hair like that, but she never did. Whitford: You could probably almost do it these days. It was too straight back then, but now\u2026 Hoey: Well, I couldn't understand what the problem was. My parents listened to a lot of country music, so it just became background for me. My sister was really into INXS. I think Kick was the first album I ever bought, or maybe she bought it for me, but that was the first time I really started taking notice of music. Mitchell Scott: I have an early memory of watching Jesus and Mary Chain playing Sidewalking. I also remember my brother and I listening to the Top 40 and making mixtapes. At this point a DeLorean drives past. Whitford: Holy shit \u2014 that's a DeLorean! I have never seen a DeLorean in the flesh before. Hoey: That's insane! Whitford: What the fuck?!\n\nIt's got brand new plates! Whitford: I didn't know someone in Melbourne had a DeLorean. Scott: That's wild. Whitford: I've got to get a photo. Scott: [Focuses] Anyway, we were making tapes of the Top 40 countdown\u2026\n\nAnd you'd edit out the ads? Scott: Well, we'd just choose certain songs. Like, we'd always start recording each song, and then if we didn't like it we'd stop and rewind. It was a bit of a process.\n\nIt's an art. Hoey: [Still staring at the DeLorean] We should have that car for the photoshoot. Whitford: It's OK, I got a shot of it. Scott: The driver's on the wrong side! Whitford: It'd be American, I guess. I don't know if they made them anywhere other than the States. Hoey: I don't think there's a factory in Collingwood. Whitford: Sorry, this is blowing my mind right now. Continue!\n\nWait, what does the driver look like? Whitford: You mean, is it Michael J. Fox?\n\nNo, is it just someone? It's just some dude, isn't it. Whitford: Usually people in crazy cars like that are just someone normal. It's not, like, Usher.\n\nIt's never Usher. Speaking of major megasuperstars, who do you like? Is there anyone who you think is actually pretty good, even though their music is everywhere? Whitford: It's hard to pull someone out, at least for me. I think we're going through a bit of a period \u2014 or have been for a while now \u2014 where good music and popular music are divorced from one another. In the seventies you'd have this bubblegum-pop stuff, but then you'd also have these big-name artists doing their own thing \u2014 like Bowie, who was hugely popular but also wrote a lot of his own songs, produced his own records, worked with interesting people and was experimental as well. Now record companies are less likely to put their faith in people to make interesting pop records. They'd much rather get someone to write the song, get a hot-shot producer, and then find someone with the right look to represent it, instead of saying, \"Who's that weird British guy who looks like an alien? Let's take a chance on him.\" Hoey: Really mainstream stuff today has lost that subversive quality that it once had back when songs were kind of crossover. Whitford: Like, Lady Gaga is sort of subversive, but the actual music doesn't measure up. If the music was amazing I guess I'd be all over it. That's the disappointing part \u2014 the subversiveness is there, but it's lacking any real substance. Scott: And you're not going to find it from other mainstream pop acts like Chris Brown.\n\nWhat about rap and hip hop? Hoey: I'm not into it as much as I was in the nineties. Hip hop took over punk in the eighties and went for gold \u2014 like, instead of staying underground it sort of went for a broader consciousness, especially with groups like Public Enemy and NWA and then in the nineties Wu-Tang Clan and Dr Dre; people like that, I was really into. But I'm sure there are still really interesting things out there \u2014 Gonjasufi is someone who we've really gotten into in the last few years; he took hip hop and made it psychedelic. But, as far as really mainstream hip hop and R&B \u2026 it just washes over me, I don't get excited about any of it.\n\nWhat about someone like Lana del Rey? Scott: I've just heard the hype. Hoey: It's like the dubstep thing, for me. I don't really know what it is, but I hear a lot about it. Whitford: There's a bit of a phenomenon right now with pre-packaging indie stars the same way you'd do with a pop star. She's obviously someone who is talked about in those terms. I've heard it talked about in relation to Foster the People, but I think they are probably a genuine band that's benefited from having a major label push and having everything working for them; people are suspicious of their quick rise, though. But, specifically about Lana del Rey, I don't know \u2014 mainly because it's just not really the sort of music I listen to. Scott: You don't want to feel like you're being lied to. I think people can appreciate things that are manufactured, but people start to feel weird when they come across something that is manufactured but presented as though it's completely genuine.\n\nIt's like they think we won't know better. Scott: Exactly. Hoey: You're always going to be skeptical of something that's being pushed down your throat.\n\nWhat about new music? Hoey: For me, Connan Mockasin's Forever Dolphin Love was definitely a record that sounded like something from the future to me. That record has really blown me away \u2014 to the point where I actually had to track him down and write to him and tell him how much I thought it was really beautiful and amazing and something new. I like the idea of being a fan again \u2026 Now I make a really conscious decision to try and find new and interesting music, and he's probably been the best example, for me, of someone doing something really new.\n\nIs there a sound that defines this era? Like, today? Whitford: Dubstep? Hoey: [Laughs] Whitford: I don't think so. There are a few things that are kind of definitive, but we're in a weird time; trends have become so fragmented because of the internet. There are a million little sub-genres happening all at once. Animal Collective has been something we've followed for a while. Since their last record it seems like there's a whole bunch of post\u2013Animal Collective bands around doing stuff that sounds reminiscent of their sound and style. You can tell the influence that they've had. Hoey: And it comes back to great songwriting as well \u2014 not necessarily sounding like one thing or another. The craftsmanship is something that we really appreciate. Whitford: The challenge for a lot of modern musicians is to find an angle that sets them apart more than fitting in to the latest trend. People are hungry to hear something different to everything else. Like, if punk was big, people would want to hear something that has punk references in it but also sounds different. I guess that's the weird thing: we're in an era where music sounds really referential. Scott: And people are so aware of what their contemporaries are doing, because it's so much easier to be across everything that's going on currently. So, people used to be aware of what was happening in music, but more so in their town or country, which would lead to more of a Melbourne sound, or a Seattle sound, or a Dunedin sound. Now the same sort of thing exists, but there's no real barrier on it. It's not just a matter of going to the pub and seeing a band play, it's about being able to access it through a million other means. Those tight geographical scenes don't form the way they used to.\n\nTheoretically, then, what's going to happen? Whitford: To me, the fact that everything's so fragmented means that it's breaking down the way that major record labels run the music industry. Someone was saying that around a third of the Grammy winners this year were independent artists. So, it seems like the hold that major labels had over the music industry \u2014 and we're distributed through major labels, so we're part of this as well \u2014 is loosening. I see the end point, hopefully, as being a shift back to the importance of making good records and good music, rather than pre-packaging and making music on a production line; actually turning it into something where artists make music. If you like the music then you listen to it, if you don't then you'll listen to something else. To me, that's the way the industry should work. Hoey: And at the time it's tough to be aware of what's really making an impact. A lot of it comes from hindsight \u2014 a lot of great records don't become big until ten, fifteen years later. There's an idea of being desperate for something new, but disappointed with anything but the familiar \u2014 \"We recolonise past and future,\" which is actually a JG Ballard quote. At the time you don't think about it too much; it's always in retrospect that you go, \"Oh wow, that was a really important scene in music.\" Whitford: People are always trying to figure it out. I guess if you knew it at the time you'd be going out and making those records yourself."}
{"text": "Fresh off Earth House Show, Ishmael Talks New EP\n\nIshmael is busy these days. Invigorated with new material after recording an EP in the dead of night in New York's Tarbox Studios, the band reemerged at Earth House this past Saturday for a triumphant, proggy whirlwind of new tracks (like the infectious, rhythmically-baffling \"Feet Stomp\"), well-worn older jams, and...an impromptu Tool cover?\n\nAnyways, I caught up with the vastly gifted Wes-based four-piece, which includes familiar faces Jordan Lewis '13 and Andy Werle '12, as well as McGill's Nick Otte and NYU's Aaron Silberstein to talk about new material, legendary engineer Tim Palmer, and the pros and cons of Katy Perry's \"Part Of Me.\"\n\nThe Argus: Tell us about the new EP.\n\nIshmael: The songs are only a small portion of our original repertoire, so we were just trying to get all the colors of ourselves across as effectively as possible, and we think these songs were the right choices for that. I'd say we jumped at the chance to experiment a bit more with the toys at our disposal.\n\nA: What influenced you most while recording it?\n\nI: We were actually listening to the 24-track master tapes to \"Killer Queen.\" You can hear Freddie breathing.\n\nA: How did you manage to get set up with Tim Palmer in the first place?\n\nI: After we were finished with all of the actual recording and we were finished with nearly all of the \"production\" work, it was basically just a matter of doing our research about who we wanted to mix the record. We always knew that we wanted someone \"professional\" to do the final mixes and it just came down to finding someone that we trusted who would also agree to do the project. Luckily, Tim was very responsive to the music and really liked the rough mix that we sent him of \"Kansas 1943 (In The Future).\" He basically agreed to the project after hearing this first song.\n\nA: What was it like working with him?\n\nI: Getting the songs mixed was a weird experience because Tim lives in Austin, Texas. After we sent him the files on hard drives, we would suddenly get an email every couple of days with a mixed song that sounded a hundred times better than what we'd sent. The process basically consisted of sending him songs that were \"at the mix stage,\" and him starting with an initial pass at the song, and then two or three more mixes of each song that would be refined based on our comments. Throughout the entire process, Tim was really receptive to our input and was a pleasure to work with. Obviously, given his experience, we wanted to give him creative latitude. Sometimes, like with particular delays and reverbs, he made decisions that surprised us when we first heard them. We had gotten so used to hearing the songs sounding a particular way that when we first got them back we had to really allow ourselves to re-hear the songs like a first-time listener. It was a very interesting process to be involved in.\n\nA: Why record in the dead of night?\n\nI: The initial plan was to record it using our own gear in [bassist/singer] Nick's basement. We went out to buy all this crazy shit and even borrowed a mixer that had been used to record Paula Abdul from Sugarbox Studios where Jordan was working. But by then Jordan had been working at the studio long enough that his bosses were cool with letting us record when it was free, which was basically from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. So we basically recorded in the dead of night because we had to, but in retrospect we're happy it happened that way. There was something indescribable about being so creative, and loud, while most of New York slept, and it freed up our inhibitions so we could try some weird stuff.\n\nA: What exactly went down with the Eclectic \"bureaucratic bullshit\" last semester?\n\nI: We were all set to play there, but at 8 p.m. on the day of the show we heard through the grapevine that nobody had registered the show with the school and PSafe would shut it down if it went on at Eclectic. Luckily enough there was a show going on at Psi U the same night, and the organizers were extremely cool in letting us get a great slot at the last minute.\n\nA: How did you get those ridiculous rhythmic parts down on [first single] \"Feet Stop\"?\n\nAndy Werle: Well, our drummer Aaron tells us it's based on an Afro-cuban Bata rhythm that we excerpted. From there it was a matter of literally taking the first thing I played over it. Sometimes we fiddle with a song forever, but \"Feet Stomp\" flowed.\n\nJordan Lewis: I can't really comment too much on \"Feet Stomp\" since my part isn't actually that complex, but I would say that in general the more complex rhythmic stuff is approached usually by us asking, \"What could we do here that would really shake things up in a cool way?\" Rhythmically, what we're doing is not really that crazy, it's just that we try to put things together in ways that sound unique to us and hopefully to our listeners.\n\nA: What was the strangest part of playing at Earth House this weekend?\n\nI: Trying a bunch of new stuff. We went against our usual setlist scheme, played new tunes fresh, and learned a cover hours before (\"Stinkfist\" by Tool). Jordan took over on bass for \"Stinkfist,\" and Nick grabbed the mic and went to mosh in the crowd. It was heavy.\n\nA: If you could play a concert anywhere on campus, where would it be?\n\nI: Probably in the four-way intersection of High and Church on the back of a parked pick-up truck.\n\nA: What are some other Wes musical acts you especially admire?\n\nAW: Gamelan with Sumarsam.\n\nJL: The music grad students are doing some really cool stuff here. Nice and quiet.\n\nA: Which Wesleyan professor would you invite to an Ishmael concert?\n\nJL: [Assistant Professor of German Studies] Ulrich Plass.\n\nAndy: [University Professor of Music] Sumarsam.\n\nA: What's the best record of 2012 so far?\n\nAW: Technically not 2012, but I'm still listening to the \"The Hunter\" by Mastodon, which came out in September."}
{"text": "REVIEWSDead Confederate, 'Wrecking Ball'\n\nDead Confederate play exactly the kind of music a band called Dead Confederate should -- sluggish, sorrowful, searing, and Southern in virtually all the right ways. The Georgia quintet's debut may appeal to My Morning Jacket fans, but songs like \"Heavy Petting\" and \"Start Me Laughing\"(which recalls Kurt Cobain at his nastiest) possess more growl than that comparison implies. Then there's the atmospheric, album-defining \"The Rat,\" which simmers and soars -- and somehow makes the phrase \"Stupid human, shit for brains\" sound not just sensible, but vaguely significant."}

Like spandex biker shorts. Remember when those were hot? Other stuff transcends the era in which it was created. Sorta like oatmeal. It's always on the menu.\n\nSure, it's easy to take a young, all-female band such as the Coathangers, mash them up with the city's oldest beer-can-crushing stripper, and label the former trendy and the latter timeless. But that barely scratches the surface. Because there's nothing more timeless than watching a band full of cute twentysomethings provoke extreme reactions by throwing their femininity in everybody's face. On the other hand, if you've never had Blondie jab you in the face with her tits at the Clermont Lounge, you have yet to receive a true gag gift.\n\nLikewise, Atlanta's emerging rock scene is brand-spanking new compared with the city's entrenched rap industry. Yet bands such as the Black Lips and Deerhunter put Atlanta on blast in '07 with timeless techniques like DIY touring, grassroots promotion and buzz-worthy performances. Meanwhile, homegrown hip-hop relied on the viral marketing of YouTube dance-offs, mixtape massacres, and a fleeting fantasy to \"Party Like a Rockstar.\"\n\nJust like the city, the vibe Atlanta emits is a little bit country and a little bit controversial. Put the two together and you get something greater than the sum of our parts."}
{"text": "Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks: Fixin' to thrill\n\nStephen Malkmus and the Jicks: High five for the lo-fi Photo: Leah Nash\n\nWith a new Beck-produced LP under their belt, Stephen Malkmus and his Jicks continue to thrill\n\nAvailing of his days in 90s underground indie sensation Pavement, Stephen Malkmus is still regarded as one of those musicians to be spoken about in hushed, reverential tones. Following Pavement's acrimonious breakup in 1999, Malkmus threw his rather high-profile eccentricities into Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks, making meandering, and frequently ingenious, post-rock and pop(ish) albums with titles like Real Emotional Trash. Yet for the band's fifth full-length, Mirror Traffic, Malkmus has stepped away from the producer's desk, offered the reins to Beck and, in his own words, tried to make something \"relevant.\"\n\n\"I guess the marketplace determines how relevant something is, or just how people relate to something, if they can groove with it,\" says Malkmus, reached at home in Berlin. \"That's still a process that is being figured out, but people that write blogs about music like it. They like most things though. People are going to be mostly positive about most things, I think, it's not a really hateful world out there. I don't really know what I'm trying to achieve. You hear it when you know it on some songs by other people, if they've got the good spirit to them and good quality rock and roll that we love. We hear it in others, but you probably can't hear it in yourself because you're deluded by the effort or hope.\"\n\nThe influence of Beck on Mirror Traffic is unmistakable, and represents an inspired, if not somewhat unconventional, fit. For Malkmus, long the producer on every Jicks record and single, stepping away from the boards was actually easier than he thought.\n\n\"I didn't really know what [Beck] would bring to it and what his sound would be,\" reveals Malkmus. \"As it turned out, he went for a clean, slightly lo-fi sound, like I wouldn't call it hi-fi in terms of being wet and big, like somebody who was being fancy would be. Sometimes he wanted things to sound thin and small in a way, in an old-fashioned 60s way. You never really know what you're going to get when you work with somebody. We just went in and started, and then it was the sound coming out of the speakers. There was no effort to reprocess things like a big rock band or whatever. He's not into tricks and big, blown-out sounds. He's coming from a musician's side first, and I reckon that's comforting. You don't come away feeling worked into something you're not.\n\n\"Mirror Traffic is kind of weird within its parameters. There are some standard chord progressions, but if you combine it with my lyrics and voice, and the way the Jicks are playing around them, it's still kind of like pop punk or something. All the harmonies and melodies together\u2026 I wouldn't call it sophisticated, but it's really heady at times.\"\n\nStephen Malkmus and the Jicks Pop Montreal at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Corona September 23"}
{"text": "The 1975\n\nHome Town: Manchester\n\nContemporary British indie tends to come in for a bit of a battering. The critics lay plenty of charges at the landfill's door, but there's one jibe that rings true to even the most staunch defender's ear: young bands simply aren't writing big pop tunes. The 1975 certainly can't be accused of staring at their shoes, hiding behind abstraction, or burying their melodies under a wall of distortion. They write big melodious teenage pop songs with plenty of heart, and a focus on melody and sharp arrangements.\n\nThat's not to say they play entirely by convention. First off, The 1975 are from Manchester but Matt Healy sings like an American post-hardcore romantic (it's not just a Welsh phenomenon), occasionally dropping into a distinctly London drawl. The arrangements do shimmer, \"The City\" is remarkably slick but it's builds from a distinctly minimal fuzzed out bass line. The effect is remarkably similar to that of early-Razorlight, it sounds authentic enough to make indie hearts flutter but big enough to snag the pop crowd. However, The 1975 tend to counterpoint each pop song with a mood piece. \"Anitchrist\" and \"Facedown\" manage to simultaneously recall post-Joy Division acolytes The Editors and White Lies, and American arena heavyweights Thirty Seconds To Mars.\n\nListening to surefire hit \"Sex\", The 1975 oddly recall Ash, not sonically, but in the way that they take an distinctly American rock approach and distill it into a British indie product. The big single yelps and yearns, doing all the things that typical get young girls reaching for the sky screaming. Whether indie needs another mid-tempo, big emotion band remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure: The 1975 are custom built for success \u2013 and how often do we get to say that about an indie band these days?\n\nThe Buzz: Big emotional indie that plays to the back row, with occasional bursts of textural moodiness."}
{"text": "/\n\n/\n\nVideo: Battles f. Matias Aguayo, \"Ice Cream\"\n\nOne of the coolest things about listening to Battles' Gloss Drop is how it makes you feel crazily smart without being boring. It may be full of technical fireworks. Lots of stop-start instrumental moments and wild time signatures and sounds that we imagine can only be made by moving your fingers around a guitar really quickly and with supreme confidence. But it's also easy. There's not a moment where we're like, Gah what the hell, this sounds like what being on a jerky subway train feels like\u2014it's just clean weirdness. Here's a video for \"Ice Cream,\" which is one of the many tracks featuring the vocals of producer Matias Aguayo. It's not safe for work if you work in a straight-laced office. It is also not safe for work if you are a hormonally charged young teen.\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nThis video, and the entirety of Gloss Drop, have this song making much more sense to me than it did on first listen. Saw their live set last week and I didn't even miss Braxton- the 6 foot projections of Matias Aguayo and Kazu Makino during their respective guest vocal appearances were almost cooler than them actually being there with Battles, and also fall into that \"clean weirdness\" category."}
{"text": "Dear Rabbit plays The Horned Hand\n\nOn Dear Rabbit's Facebook page, there is a quote from the tiny Portland-based label Wil-Ru Records that describes the one-man band's \"They Don't Love The Songs\" album.\n\n\"Imagine attending a secret party thrown by Salvador Dali in an ornate smoke-filled drinking parlor in the dark belly of a creaky (frigate),\" it says, \"with Blackbeard, Captain Beefheart and a bunch of crazed, violent gypsies.

{"text": "The people who like Ritualism anyway, run from musicians to non. I know a lot of people who aren't musicians who really feel the record.\n\nAAJ: How was the recording done? Are all the guys in the same room with the drummer so you have the same ambience?\n\nDG: It was 16 bit ADAT in the studio. The drummer and I were in booths with Brad (Jones, the bassist) behind partitions. The horns were in another room and there was a main room where the piano and the organ were. I picked the studio because it was a nice room, acoustically, and everybody could see each other visually. It's important to have the band thing. It's pretty much all live...you know.\n\nAAJ: How long did it take? Like a second, right?\n\nDG: We tracked basically for two days..\n\nAAJ: Man, you guys are unbelievable...\n\nDG: I went back into the studio to do \"Confluence , because Imani (Uzuri-vocals) couldn't do it at the time. Actually, we aborted a previous session in January...I had James Genus instead of Brad on bass...the studio just didn't work out...the piano was out of tune...I had to pull the plug finally. I did have a finished version of \"Confluence from that session but I ended up throwing it out. We rerecorded it as a trio-bass, guitar and vocals.\n\nDG: Actually, she's on Herbie's new record, Future 2 Future. She wrote some lyrics for one of those tunes. I only heard parts of that cd so far. I met her a couple of years back through friends of mine. I just always loved the quality of her voice. She doesn't do \"jazz gigs..I heard her on her own gigs...drum'n'bass. She has a really rich deep kind of voice. At that point I wasn't thinking of her for my stuff, but as it turns out we collaborated and she wrote lyrics to \"Confluence . That date wasn't easy for her, but she certainly managed to pull it off.\n\nAAJ: How'd you get the rest of the band ?\n\nDG: Like I said, Brad was a sub. Now Brad has turned out to the better choice for this kind of music. I mean I love James but Brad has this looseness from playing with Ornette.\n\nAAJ: Ornette?!\n\nDG: Oh, yeah. Ornette, the Jazz Passengers, Marc Ribot. So the core band was there. The sidemen made sense. I mean part of it was just that I knew guys who were willing to do me huge financial favors for the music. I knew Rodney ( from Wayne, and he has this jazzy jazzy, but funky, other way of playing.\n\nDG: I think I met him through Binney ( who's also on the cd.\n\nAAJ: And Ravi and Ralph Alessi are through Steve Coleman?\n\nDG: Yeah.\n\nAAJ: And you're on Ralph's new thing?\n\nDG: That's not out yet. Check RKM for that ( I've got some space on that one, but I was disappointed with the amp I used for the session. That's some hard music too. Don Byron's on it as well as Nausheet Waits and Drew Gress.\n\nAAJ: Your record seems like a natural progression from Coleman to Lost Tribe to Trilok to your own thing, as opposed to some other directions you've gone in with other folks.\n\nDG: I guess it comes out of all those experiences...you know, playing with Steve and Trilok...though osmosis it's crept into my system. But even before I met Steve and the whole M-Base thing I had an attraction to odd meter music or whatever you want to call it. I was into Return to Forever and Mahavishnu and all that stuff.\n\nI was introduced to playing jazz when I first started taking guitar lessons at age 15, with John Baboian, a teacher at Berklee School of Music. Then I kind of worked my way backwards into straight ahead jazz. But I was always into that type of music. The stuff I'm doing now, at least the Ritualism thing, has got the odd meter stuff. I just find there to be a lot of unexplored territory, you know, with rhythms as it relates to modern jazz harmonies and melodies. I mean jazz in the rhythmic sense has been pretty much in 4:4 with the occasional 3:4 and that's...\n\nAAJ: That's it! That's what I really want to touch on with you. This is what Steve is known for and now you. You are one of the masters regarding this aspect.\n\nDG: Well, there are other people, but a lot of them come at it from a different angle, like Brad Shepik with Pachora and the Commuters (AAJ interrupts)\n\nAAJ: Yeah, but they're coming from ethnic rhythms.\n\nDG: Well, they're using things in 11 and 21 or whatever. Steve's thing has evolved within his own projects. Like it used to be \"this tune is in 5 and \"this is in 7 , but around \"Rhythm People it evolved into polymetric tunes. It went further with \"Black Science where the pianist was in one meter, the bassist was in another and I was in another and the parts would intersect at various points creating cross-rhythms.\n\nAAJ: Well, this is the wonderful complexity of your music.

Glen Hansard is the leader and primary songwriter for both of these acts, and he's now put out a long awaited solo album, Rhythm and Repose, that plays out many of the characteristics that made his work with The Frames and The Swell Season so powerful while still adding just enough new sounds to make for an album that stands with the rest of his works.\n\n\"You Will Become\" opens the album and sounds exactly like a Swell Season track and it has Marketa Irglova on backing vocals and piano. It's a very good way to open the album, but like most of the fist half of Rhythm and Repose there's too much familiarity with other Hansard work. \"Maybe Not Tonight\" cries out like many Frames songs and \"Talking To The Wolves\" also goes down the same road, although the percussion keeps the song moving and interesting.\n\nHansard isn't the strongest songwriter, the thing that's always made his songs work are the way he delivers his powerful vocals. And that talent is on full display on many of these tracks. \"High Hope\" is a paper thin song that would have fallen to pieces in anyone else's hands. The same criticism can be made on the slow ballad, \"Bird of Sorrow\". The song is filled with strings and an odd mixture of optimism and sadness that showed up frequently with The Frames.\n\nWhile the first batch of songs on Rhythm and Repose doesn't much to add to Hansard's catalog, most of the songs are forgiven by the remarkable set of songs that comes afterword, starting with \"The Storm, It's Coming\". Once again, Hansard's lyrics are quite see-through, but with such a compelling voice that sounds so sure of it's message, you can't help but be moved. The song is filled strings that bring the mood of dread that something bad is bound to happen even closer, although Hansard doesn't bring anything direct to the song that makes it close enough for the listener.\n\n\"Love Don't Leave Me Waiting\" is a very upbeat song that might be the best one on Rhythm and Repose that brings to mind Van Morrison's Moondance with Hansard's voice and the horns. The dread of \"The Storm, It's Coming\" rears it's head again on \"What Are We Gonna Do\" that's almost even darker with some very slow guitar with haunting strings in the background. And while the song starts off very compelling, it carries on for too long and loses it's feeling towards the end.\n\nThere's more than just acoustic songs here that bring The Swell Season to mind, there's several moments where added instrumentation makes all the difference. \"Races\" adds in some organ and banjo that keeps the song from being weak. \"Come Away To The Water\" also has banjo, and it almost comes out like a country song but Hansard's style of songwriting keep the song out country territory. \"Philanderer\" has some very rapid piano at the beginning with Hansard going into a very soft delivery that's reminiscent of Peter Gabriel.\n\nPeople already familiar with Hansard's previous work will find plenty here to enjoy, yet it might not be the best place to start for people who aren't as knowledgeable with Hansard's other groups. Rhythm and Repose has Hansard doing what he does best, and having a few missteps along the way. But there's just enough emotionally engaging tracks to keep this album from being a bland solo venture."}
{"text": "ABOUT THIS ALBUM\n\nAlbum Notes\n\nWILLAMETTE WEEK ... The group\u2014which sounds a bit like Band of Horses without all the studio bells and whistles\u2014trades in chord progressions and drum patterns normally associated with summery pop groups, but your takeaway emotion will likely be melancholy. It's a neat trick, actually: The record's stark, slightly seasick sheen calls more attention to the Historians' understated twang than to its tom or kick drum (the percussion floats in a mist somewhere behind the track). That, combined with frontman Dave Shur's achingly pure vocal approach, gives tracks like opener \"Flathead Lake\" and \"Old King Crow\" a rustic, AM-pop feel often tapped into by bands like R.E.M. and Okkervil River. But it's \"On the Way Home\" that reveals Future Historians' true colors: Sad bastards through and through. It's working out for them. CASEY JARMAN"}

{"text": "Sessions\n\nSunday, 18 March 2012\n\nSlow Animal - Slow Animal\n\nI got into Slow Animal a year or so ago, after their first initial demos were plugged on Pitchfork. They soon became a firm favourite, playing a distorted, loud, and fierce blend of garage rock and surf rock. Of course, I can hear your inner monologue from here chirping 'oh jeez, another surfy garage band? like that hasn't been hammered into the ground' And I know. But they're not mock imitations of Wavves and Jay Reatard like Bleeding Knees Club or something. They're special. Honest.\n\nWhat makes them worth checking out is that they pack the virtual aggression and energy of a punk band with the breezy and hazy chords and simplistic beats most associated with garage/surf bands. Plus, they'll go from that to suddenly transferring into crashing cymbals and powerful power chords. They're very much an energy building band. They bring more to the floor than most 'friend' bands that can only play major bar chords and get sporadic claps from mildly amused audience members who are politely trying to remind themselves that high amounts of energy isn't always key to a good band. And even if that is true, Slow Animal aren't a band that leave you waiting for loud attacks and catchy riffs. They give it to you from the start.\n\nWith their self titled debut album, it is evident they have progressed since their initial demos. The energy is higher, the drumming is fiercer, the songs are more detailed. A lot of the initial demos seemed to centre on small helpings of chords that often repeated. Not to say that is a bad thing, a they're still great songs, but with their debut release, the songs are a lot more fleshed out and mature. The band have evidently progressed.\n\nIn the new stuff, there are repetitive elements, sure, but there is still a clear feel that the band aren't focused on rewriting the same songs. And sure, there are typical calling cards, such as there use off their distinctive harmonies and hazy demeanour, but they still write bloody good songs. Songs like 'Teenage Strange', 'Liar' and 'Rather Have My Eyes Closed' stand out in particular - their unusual, yet catchy chord usage and playing styles, going from passive to intense, ultimately fill the songs out well.\n\nOverall, I was very pleased with SA's debut release and I know I'll be returning to it in the future. A nice start to your forthcoming summer.\n\nOh, also, they're giving their album away for free on their website -  - so there really isn't an excuse not to check these fuckers out."}

Currently working on a dual concentration Ph.D. in anthropology and ethnomusicology at the University of Wisconsin, Lynch has released a handful of albums while still in school, including 2010's mysterious and meandering Mare as well as the more focused, driving Terra (2011), both out on New Jersey's Underwater Peoples label.

{"text": "Post-rock is pretty hip these days, but many people think only at Sigur R\u00f3s or God Is An Astronaut when they hear \"post-rock\". So lets see a bunch of other post-rock bands that are not that famous, but that cool!\n\n1. Maybeshewill (United Kingdom)\n\nThis is the main reason that made me write this post. A brilliant five piece band from Leicester, active since 2005, with three albums in the pocket. Their sound features lots of piano and keyboard, although their keyboard player Matthew Daly is a full member only from 2011 (the band used samples for live shows until then). However, their song \"The Paris Hilton Sex Tape\" from their 2006 release \"Japanese Spy Transcript\" does not contain any moan by Paris (youtube that, but don't forget to include \"maybeshewill\" in the search field). The band tours pretty often in the UK, Europe and Asia, sometimes opening for bigger acts like God is an Astronaut. They run their own non-profit independent record label called \"Robot Needs Home\".\n\n2. Russian Circles (U.S.A.)\n\nA very powerful and original trio from the States, featuring a sampling/effects/looper-loving guitar player, a gay bass player and a 4/4 drummer, (where 4/4 does not stand at all for a measure, but for a 4 piece drum-kit with 4 cymbals). The term \"russian circles\" stands for an excruciating drill exercise used in ice hockey. So does the band actually live their band name? The Circles tour with Coheed And Cambria and Between The Buried And Me. Puck them on their Facebook page, they opened for Tool in the U. K. in 2007!\n\n3. Yndi Halda (England)\n\nPronounced YIN-dee hal-DAR, the band also features a violin player, which confirms their modern classic status. Active since 2001, the band started playing live only in 2007, switching from mostly electronic instruments to acoustic ones. They played only two shows in 2012, they sell their amps on Facebook and have a great EP released in 2007. \"Yndi Halda\" is Old Norse (a North Germanic language) for their self-titled debut called \"Enjoy Eternal Bliss\".\n\n4. Mono (Japan)\n\nOk, they have over 50k likes on Facebook, but this is probably because they have a girl on bass! Playing since 1999 with the same line-up, they just released their 6th album for their parents. Mono loves Iceland, the glockenspiel, reverb, distortion and delay. They play in stereo all over the world and you can find them on their official website.\n\n5. Tides from Nebula (Poland)\n\nPolski zesp\u00f3\u0142 post-rockowy utworzony w 2008 roku w Warszawie. This means that they are from Warsaw, formed in 2008 and they post-rock. Considered as one of the best \"export goods\" in Poland, the band released \"Aura\" in 2009 and \"Earthshine\" in 2011. Their latest single \"Hollow Lights\" was sold out in 4 hours and, of course, they use twitter and instagram, and they have no English Wiki page"}

{"text": "I first heard of Snowden about a year or so ago while listening to some internet radio site. The song was \"Kill the Power\" - a moody yet danceable, instantly catchy post-punk number - and I was hooked. Further investigation led to the Atlanta-based band's Web site ( where I found the entire self-titled EP made available for free download. Fuzzy guitars, driving beats, thumping bass lines and a droning voice combined for an intriguing first listen that just begged to be expounded upon.\n\nThankfully, the four-piece soon followed up with Anti-Anti, their debut full-length available on Jade Tree. The 12-song disc is a dance-happy meets cool gloom blur of smoke and fuzzed-out melodies, powerful and thought provoking lyrics and flat-out strong song writing.\n\nJordan Jeffares, vocalist and main brain behind Snowden was kind enough to take time away from touring, marketing and setting up the release of Anti-Anti in order to answer a few of my inquiries via e-mail. Here's what we discussed:\n\nSo first, the boring, typical \u2013 How did you all come together? How long has Snowden been around? Did you have any common interests that led you to form a band, etc.?\n\nThe band began when I was graduating from college in 2003. I'd been working on songs for years but only at that point did they ever get to anything decent. My brother helped me meet up with the first line up. We played for a year under that line up before vacation time started to run out for some of the guys so the line up changed to its current state the summer of 2004. I met Dave (Payne, guitar) through our first drummer and bassist. They were all jamming in a practice space.\n\nWhen the other guys ran out of vacation time, Chandler (Rentz, drums) had gotten wind that we were looking for a drummer from other people in the local Atlanta scene. A friend in Austin turned me onto Corinne (Lee, bass).\n\nAnd of course the dreaded \"How would you explain your sound?\" question. What are you trying to do with your music? Where are you now musically, and where would you like to go in the future?\n\nI'm trying to stay flexible and open to my view of Snowden and where it's going or been. There have been periods, especially in the very beginning of the band where I was trying really hard to make the music really different and it ended up making things too complicated. I constantly feel like good music is innovative, and since I want to make good music, I feel like I should always innovate.\n\nI feel like I've finally found a style but I'm very wary of even thinking of it that way because I don't want to lock myself into any paths. I don't want to have to worry about a song fitting on an album. I want every song to belong to itself.\n\nWhat are thoughts on \"rock 'n' roll\" right now, and how do you separate yourselves from other bands out there?\n\nThe line between indie rock and 'rock rock' used to be so clear, now there are 'indie' bands on major labels and bland rock bands on 'indie' labels. The terms that used to help you weed through music to get to the good stuff have fallen apart.\n\nThere's only so much you can do to try to separate yourselves. You try to do it with the music. Then we try to do it onstage every show. I used to be of the mindset that you should get on stage and let the music speak for itself, until one day we started going nuts and then people started responding like they never had before.\n\nWhat's your live performance like? What can fans expect to see when they check out Snowden?\n\nWe go nuts. We all stomp and jitter to the music. I have lots of nervous ticks that my brother always makes fun of. At the end of the show we're soaked through.\n\nIs there any message or theme behind your music? What do you hope people get out of hearing your stuff?\n\nThere are messages in every song, both introverted and extroverted. A lot of them are collages of situations or feelings. There are stories about places, disappointment, and revolution. I try to be dynamic with my lyrics. I never want to be a boring songwriter who writes about love all the time.\n\nWhat was it like writing and recording your EP? What are your thoughts about it?\n\nThe EP was a learning experience that should have been done better, but I'd only been doing music seriously for about 6 months at the time and there was no one looking out for us to make sure we didn't mess up. So, I did everything wrong. We worked with a horrible engineer who ruined the first attempt at it. Then I did the best I could mixing it with a friend from out of town and pressed it up, only so that I would remix it 8 months later and start giving it away for free through the website.\n\nI learned a lot from that EP. I learned not to rush things. I learned that an EP can be your ticket to bigger things if you can just wait and do it right and get people behind it instead of just trying to get something to sell at shows.\n\nYou decided to let people download the whole thing for free, how did that decision come about?\n\nIt just occurred to me that a band starting out has to give their music away, especially if they're unsigned/unmanaged/unconnected. The measly few grand that you could make off selling your music is nothing compared to the exposure you can get by giving it away. I tell all young bands to give away at least half of their songs if not more. Especially in the blog age, it's possible to do a blog campaign one week and have 50,000 people with your album on their hard drive/ipod the next week. You give it away today so that 1) people can learn about you and 2) so that you can sell them your debut LP next year.\n\nYou recently signed with Jade Tree, how did that come about, and what is it like now working with label support? Did it make things easier/harder when recording the full-length?\n\nJade Tree is about as indie as it gets. They're very responsive and active but we still decide on everything and do most stuff on our own. We have a publicist now, and college radio will get serviced, but we do our own Web design, our own recording, I'm booking the support tour right now, we do our merch, everything.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the full-length? How would you compare it to the EP? If someone takes one thing away from this album, what would you hope that to be?\n\nIt's more mature than the EP. Sonically, there's more space between things and I learned how to use my voice. Like the EP it's still moody. 8/12 are upbeat and the other 4 on the record are my favorites, the slow stuff.\n\n\"Victim Card\" and \"Kill the Power\" are both songs on the EP which made the full-length as well. Was there anything particularly special about those two songs that helped them make the cut? Does it indicate what sort of direction you might be heading with your sound?\n\nThose are both songs that really characterize our sound. Those songs are where we are right now, no question. \"Victim Card\" was originally a slow song that I rewrote because we didn't have enough upbeat stuff for our first show. On the full length it's the slow version and we close almost every show with this version. \"Kill the Power\" most indicates the direction we're going. It's got that weird powerful rhythm and the distorted bass line and all that.\n\nWhat is next for you guys, and is there anything else in particular that you'd like people to read about?\n\nI want people to read about our European tour and how we're blowing up in Turkey and why hasn't America caught on yet?!?!"}
{"text": "After the forest had stopped burning, Babel decided to walk back to where the monastery had stood to take inventory, with only the glockenspiel that he had saved from the flames as supplies. All the trees and any hunter's huts had been reduced to low laying burnt stuff, so he could see the blackened, but still standing ruins in the distance. It had been a frantic flight from the fire, but now, with everything gone, and all quiet descended, time took its time to get him there. Then the bellbirds began to return. Slowly at first, but as the rising sun caught the metal bars of the glockenspiel, more and more began to circle. Babel fond that if he held his metallophone to his ear he could understand their gongy tones, and that if held it sideways to his mouth, not only did it turn his frown into a tin-man's maniacal grin, but he could control the bellbirds movements. Not that he asked them to move that much, but sometimes he did, and if there had been anyone around to hear it, they might have thought a traveling symphony, or the annual Philip Glass Percussive Parade had been passing though.\n\nTranslation and Epilogue:\n\nBabel is the modern-classical outlet of Jakob Rehlinger, who can also be heard as the lonely guitar (that sounds like a peyote trip in the desert) called Moonwood, and also the owner of the great, Etobicoke based, experimental/freak-folk label Arachnidisks Recordings. One of the most prolific musicians in town, this is his third release this year on his own label, and his second as Babel. Glockengeister finds him in a quiet, minimal mood, experimenting with a recently acquisitioned glockenspiel that acts as a centerpiece for the album. Joined only occasionally by sparse percussion, that is similar to the backing bells of his Moonwood work, these pieces take all the time they need to mature, lasting anywhere from one and a half to thirteen minutes. There's a real feeling of exploration on this disk, as if his new fond instrument were a huge cathedral he had just inherited, and he was wandering threw all the rooms, discovering their particular personalities. Some require more attention than others. Some are busy with bells. Some are barely there. Overall, it's a very soft, spiritual atmosphere that should be your next soundtrack for falling asleep into lucid dreaming."}
{"text": "Posts tagged Fragrant WorldDuring a recent conversation I had playfully discussed the kind of music that you would want to hear as you \"die on the dancefloor\", we were mentioning a few bands, but none came as close to the harrowing, oft-brazen sounds of the latest from the Brooklyn trio, Yeasayer. With their patented off-kilter percussion and saturated bass, they have created an album for the end-times, without much preamble. Their previous records\u2014 the freak-folk All Hour Cymbals, and the playful Odd Blood\u2014 poised them as an experimental, even progressive synth pop outfit, engaging in more lofty ideals than their counterparts, artists like HEALTH or Miike Snow. On Fragrant World, they have neglected some of their better attributes for a more aggressive, eerie journey. While it remains rambunctious as ever, they've replaced the charming disorder that they became known for with dreariness, resulting in a much harsher listening experience. It fares relatively well for them, but doesn't make for their best work.\n\nUpon my initial listen, it was difficult to point out any \"single ready\" tracks, unlike the immediate \"2080\" or \"Ambling Alp\". However, after revisiting it over the past few weeks, it has redeemed itself continuously, reverting back to a more primal ambiance. The crunching, EDM tribal beats are perfected in most of the selections, most notably on \"Fingers Never Bleed\" and \"Damaged Goods\", but it's when they slow it down in the burner,\"Henrietta\" that they make the best work. Despite the album's desolate nature, there are some truly inspiring moments, most effectively in the song \"The Devil and the Deed\", with is juxtaposed title; it is the closest thing to a dance anthem on the entire record. Again, with constant listens, \"Blue Paper\" could also be deemed as a possible single, its handclaps making it a slightly more fun affair, not to mention the homage to Lionel Richie in its end.\n\nPessimism is dripping off this album, lyrically and thematically, slaving over everything from bank closures to environmental weariness. Yeasayer are anxious for the not-too-distance future, nervous for their livelihoods and those of their friends, and while they express it in a denseness unlike anything they've produced to date, it is the reflection of their past that keeps them grounded. When immortality seems more of a reality over time, by the album's end, they are closer to embracing it. The final track, \"Glass of a Microscope\", reminds me of Radiohead's Kid A; it's a creature born out of sterile and austere conditions, desperately trying to break the surface. It's not the grandest of ideals, but it's definitely hopeful.\n\nAs the Summer progressed it became evident as more albums were announced that August, September, and October would be three of the most impressive months for new albums in recent years.\n\nFor me to list them all would take too much time, but close to the top of this list is Yeasayer's highly-anticipated third album Fragrant World, an album with a lot of ground to cover if it's to match the critical acclaim of its predecessor Odd Blood.\n\nEarly reviews of the album seem to suggest that they're onto something with tracks such as \"Longevity\" and \"Henrietta\" generating a good amount of buzz, and showing that they haven't lost their experimental electronic quirk. I'm making my way through my first listen of it now and where Odd Blood had some huge tracks that could propel the band onto mainstream radio, Fragrant World seems to have replaced the \"hits\" with more in-depth songs that you can lose yourself in for weeks.\n\nFragrant World is released on August 21st via Secretly Canadian, and thanks to NPR you can listen to it in full below, nine days before it's released.\n\nThis morning Yeasayer made a boo boo. They dropped the video for their new track \"Longevity\" even though it wasn't supposed to come out until this afternoon/evening.\n\nIf you were one of the ones lucky enough to have caught it before it was removed, you'll know that it's got Yeasayer's off-the-wall brand of electronic indie-pop written all over it, though it's not as frantic and fizzing as some of their older tracks.\n\n\"Longevity\", along with \"Henrietta\", is taken from their new album Fragrant World, out on August 21st via Secretly Canadian."}
{"text": "I used to have a bit of obsession with the Magyars (the people, not the band). They settled what is now Hungary and have roots that trace back to my favorite figure in history: Attila the Hun. While I realize Attila did some pretty awful shit, he is also responsible for some pretty amazing things as well. The fact that he had Rome on its knees is impressive. Granted this wasn't Julius Caesar?s Rome, but that takes little away from what he did. When I think of the Huns and their conquests, I picture ragged and rolling green hills, sparsely populated with trees and rocks. There is a cinematic quality that suggests gnarly barbarians on horseback piercing the horizon in slow motion with spears in hand. Sounds dramatic, eh? One listen to \"Kings of Time\" by Finland's Magyar Posse and it makes perfect sense.\n\nRather than labeling this post rock, I prefer to think of it as past-post rock. What the hell am I talking about, you ask? While elements of big, orchestral post rock are the overriding theme in most of these songs, there's this aspect to them that harks back to hundreds of years ago. \"Kings of Time\" is filled with chant-like vocals that give these songs a classical feeling. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the 11-minute epic piece, \"Single Sparks are Not Spectral Fires.\" Opening in Godspeed You! Black Emperor fashion with minimal amp hum and guitar feedback, it slowly builds into a dense, machine-pounding fever pitch. To say this track is intense is a huge understatement. Strings climb and fall while a piano punches out each chord, before descending into a chaotic mess at the end of each bar. It's unbelievably good. Once the walls of screaming feedback hit, it's like a bomb going off in the middle of a crowded street. This should be the anthem of Attila the Hun. It's all at once majestic and raucous. I love this. But just when it seems like too much, just when it feels like the piece is about to physically assault you, it comes to a complete stop. It's like being launched into a midnight blue sky full of stars. As you grab onto the wings of a low flying bird, you are whisked away to another world that is free of blood-soaked fields. Soothing vocals chant above music that is equal parts Tortoise and some kind of traditional Finnish folk music. It's like being lost in the Tampere forest 100 miles outside Helsinki.\n\nThis song is such an adventure that one can easily get lost; it's really like three connected pieces. Each is their own entity, but they can't survive on their own. What is most impressive is not how good each part is, but how they are connected. The transitions are abrupt but perfect. It's as if one movement is swallowed by the next. By devouring itself, the song stays together and keeps things firmly on track. When the second part slows down, the listener is fooled into thinking the song is over. But it's not even close to it. Whimpering guitars are paired with whistling (yes, whistling!) and now you're stuck in the middle of some Western desert. The only thing on the horizon is a ghost town, it?s getting dark, and wolves begin to howl. It's stark. Strings tease of the coming night. More chanting is eventually overtaken by loud, distorted guitars. This is the finale; this is the part where they set off all the fireworks. For one song, \"Single Sparks are Not Spectral Fires\" is an album's worth of experience. It's absolutely brilliant.\n\nThere's an overall dark tone on this album that plays perfectly into the Hunnic mindset I have when listening to this. Minor chords are the preferred form of attack here, and they waste no time in delivering the final blows. \"Lufthan\" closes the album with grandeur and poise. Synthesizers are the leader here and they pull the instruments into battle with each other. Like the rest of the album, this track has an epic feeling to it. Each instrument is constantly chasing the synth; it is as though by killing it, they'll win, and this whole mess will be over. Midway through, it seems as though they've succeeded as the song practically disintegrates. But just when it seems it's down for the kill, it rises from the ashes and wreaks more havoc. In the end, the synth wins out and this upbeat track is the perfect end to one hell of a listening experience. I was sad that it was over, since I wanted more.\n\nIf Magyar Posse were from Montreal, they'd be huge in indie circles. They take an already proven formula (apocalyptic post rock) and turn it on its ass. This is a sprawling album that takes everything Godspeed You! Black Emperor has done and gives it a decidedly European twist. It has old world trademarks all over it, and I couldn't be happier. In that distant world, this is the soundtrack to Attila the Hun's siege of Rome. If Attila was a king then \"Kings of Time\" definitely deserves some kind of crown. This album is a masterful achievement"}

It was a time when artists produced albums and not singles, when sampling was frowned upon because it wasn't considered original and therefore not creative enough for commercial release, when what you could do with a guitar completely overshadowed what you could do with a computer. Where the fuck did all those bands go?\n\nEnter The Vliets. This four-piece band from Dallas, Texas was first introduced to LFTF by our main man Skrause. They make music we wish people could still make by pulling from elements of classic rock, psych rock, and psych folk to the point that their music doesn't belong in this era and is timeless.\n\nTell me about you guys.\n\nOur band name The Vliets (pronounced 'vleets') is in reference to Don Van Vliet aka Captain Beefheart, one of my all time favorite musicians and artists. I started this band about 2 years and we've had many different members. Right now the band consists of myself, Daniel Gonzalez, Luke Ferrell and John Solis. I play guitar, bass, synthesizer, piano, drums. Daniel is on bass, drums, synthesizer. Luke is synthesizer, piano. John is drums. Our dynamic is unique, as in we don't get together as a band and jam and write and figure things out. If I write a song, I will write it in it's entirety and record each part as well, and the same goes for Luke and Daniel. After the songs are recorded, we then know how all of our parts are intended to be played, we learn them, and play them live. I have 5 or 6 new songs I'm in the process of recording right now that the rest of the band hasn't even heard, and I know Luke has been working on a few that no one has heard yet either. I used to desperately want a band that could get together on a daily basis, be best friends, all be on the same page, and just make good music. But I found after trying to write with many people and be like that, that being a band is a very delicate thing with lots of ego's involved, and I hated it so this situation is perfect right now.\n\nI love your writing style of everyone kind of doing their own thing and then learning each tune from each other. Do you think this hinders your process though? Has it ever been the case that you just really do not like a tune that someone else wrote or someone doesn't like your tune? What do you say in a situation like that?\n\nIt doesn't hinder my process, I usually write most of the parts on the spot during recording and I have to be completely alone when doing so. It's difficult for me to write with others, and I've found that when I have collaborated it never turns out right and there's always something about the song that will bother me. Anytime a song comes to me, it's when I'm on the piano and my mind is blank with zero influence on what I'm actually playing, then something comes. I have to be alone while I'm doing this, anyone there is a distraction. Any song that I've written that I really like has been done that way and it's what's most comfortable to me.\n\nThere have definitely been times when one of us hasn't liked someone else's song, and it's a pretty awkward situation when that happens. It hasn't happened lately, but it did a lot in the past. Everyone who's been in the band is pretty passive aggressive though, sometimes when situations like that would arise, I'd start hearing about things others members had said about me to other people who weren't even in the band..So it's definitely a delicate matter. Sometimes feelings are hurt and people get pretty pissed off and will talk shit about you behind your back. But it's the same as if we were all writing a song together and someone didn't like a specific part someone is playing, rather we're all writing an album together and the songs are the parts, if that makes sense.\n\nTell me about your writing process.\n\nTo me, the process of writing music is a spiritual experience and/or communication with inter-dimensional spirits. I've never sat down and been like 'oh I want to write a song that sounds like this..' it doesn't work that way, and comes through in the music and feels contrived. Anytime I've written something that I actually like, it's come from somewhere else. It's a meditation of sort, your mind goes blank and you're playing your instrument, and then something is coming out of you that took no prior thought, it's just a thought, idea, image, or feeling that is being transmitted through you from another dimension, and you're just the instrument to pull it out of one dimension, and into this one. Then it's my job to take these messages or thoughts or whatever you want to call it, and arrange them and make sense out of them. I usually achieve that state by playing piano or synth, then once I figure out the basic chord structure of the song, I record the keys, and gradually add the guitars, bass, drums, vocals, etc.\n\nI agree with you that writing music is a very spiritual process. To emulate is to not be true to yourself. At some point though all ideas have been recycled and an attempt to make it your own becomes less apparent to the listener. So I guess my question is how do you know when you've been inspired? How do you know it's coming from your spiritual base and not from merely a combination of other sources? Could a combination act as a vehicle through which spiritual insight emerges? Does all that make sense?\n\nThat's a good question. You're right that ideas are definitely recycled, which can be good or bad. The act of listening to music and being greatly affected by it is the same sort of spiritual connection as if it presented itself to you and directly made it your song. For example, the other day I was listening to Radiohead and there was a way that Thom sang a line that invoked so much emotion that I immediately had to go write music and it wasn't because I wanted to write something that sounded similar to what I had heard, it was the feeling I got from it that made me excited to create. The way I think about it is that you're not inventing music, time or sound when you write a song, you're simply manipulating things that are already possible. I didn't invent the specific chords or notes I use in a song, I try to connect to the spiritual realm to find the feelings to translate through a recording with my instruments.\n\nThere will definitely always be an influence from artists I listen to and love, but I think that's more of a style thing than the actual writing, and hopefully it's not such an influence on my style that I'm just a knock off of others. I'm certain that all of my writings have come from a purely spiritual place, even if the inspiration was stemmed from another song, I believe that's just as communicative with the spiritual realm if the inspiration is the feeling, not the actual notes and melody being used. So to answer your question directly, yes a combination would definitely act as a vehicle for spiritual insight.\n\nHow do you know when you've finished a song?\n\nThere's a point when the song just feels right, and if it doesn't, it's not done. Sometimes I end up with a lot of instrumentals, because I believe that was the best way to get the emotion across, and adding lyrics and a melody would've been contrived therefore ruining the true nature of the song.\n\nYou seem to have a very calculated approach to writing music. You know what works for your style and what doesn't. With that said, what do you think is missing from modern music and why is it missing? Do you feel like some artists are really forcing artistic expression?\n\nAs far as what's missing, I'm not sure if it's the case for every city, but in Dallas it's more about acting like a band and doing things on stage that bands are expected to do or what you've seen bands do before, and that's not conducive to an artistic environment. It's kind of like I have friends that I'm super comfortable around and I know I could say anything to, like if I cried listening to a beautiful song or something and they wouldn't make me feel weird about having an emotion like that. I have other friends who would think I was a pussy for saying that because that's not typically socially acceptable. I want to feel like I can do anything on stage and experiment and fucking jam sometimes, and unfortunately Dallas isn't wired for that. Maybe other cities are different. So other than the live aspect, I don't really think that there's anything missing from music today, I'm excited about a lot of the new sounds coming out. Especially in electronic music.\n\nYes, definitely. Having a band and wanting it to make money or be popular basically means starting a small business. I think more times than not, bands will have a target audience and that really comes through in the music, it sounds bland and contrived. I don't like to talk negatively about bands, but The Black Keys are one who fit that description and they are everything that's wrong with modern music, in my opinion. It's just a style, with zero artistic substance and is totally forced. Besides, why not just go all the way and listen to The White Stripes, right? I think John Frusciante is the best example of everything that's right with modern music. The guy really does it for pure artistic expression. He's quit the Red Hot Chili Peppers twice after making them famous because he felt he was compromising his artistic integrity. Apparently right now he has the better part of 300-400 songs that he may not even release because he doesn't want it to become a product and I really admire that. Don't get me wrong though, I'm not saying it's wrong to be famous or make money off of your music, but you can easily separate the artists from the suits.\n\nWhere do you want your music to take you?\n\nI'm not sure. I don't know what I would do if a label wanted sign us and release albums and go on tour and all. I would only do something like that if it made it to where all I had to do was focus on writing music all day. That would be the best case scenario. Otherwise I'm completely happy recording songs on my own and releasing them on the internet.\n\nWhat do you think about social media?\n\nI think social media is great. It's how I've gotten my music out there. Among Twitter, Facebook and SoundCloud I've been able to reach hundreds of people with my music and have made friends with other artists in the process. We're based out of Dallas, and play in Dallas but no one really knows about us here. We have more people listening to our music in other countries than we do in our own city, and that's all due to blogs like LFTF and social media. Otherwise, I doubt anyone would ever hear our music.\n\nWhat's in store for The Vliets in the future?\n\nWho knows. In the immediate future, I have probably 20 new songs that are pretty much done and need to be recorded. So we'll play some shows here and there and hopefully release a ton of songs over the course of the year."}

{"text": "No related\n\nThe legend of Scottish band Belle And Sebastian began with a college course designed to help students prepare for a music career through hands-on experience. Glasgow's Stow College released one record a year through a music-business course, and Belle And Sebastian served as one of its guinea pigs. Over the course of less than a week in 1996, the group recorded Tigermilk, its now-beloved debut. Only 1,000 vinyl copies were made, and the original pressings remain sought-after collector's items, even though a CD version came out 1999. Later in '96, the band followed Tigermilk with If You're Feeling Sinister, a transcendent collection of literate, witty, sophisticated, and exquisitely sad pop songs that won the group an intensely devoted international following. After that album came a series of EPs, and eventually The Boy With The Arab Strap, the enigmatically titled Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like A Peasant, and then the soundtrack to Todd Solondz's controversial Storytelling. For Belle And Sebastian's latest album, the ambitiously genre-hopping Dear Catastrophe Waitress (due out Oct. 7), the group enlisted producer Trevor Horn, who has worked with everyone from ABC to Cher to Barry Manilow to Malcolm McLaren. The Onion A.V. Club recently spoke with Stuart Murdoch, Belle And Sebastian's primary singer and songwriter, about touring, publicity, songwriting, and the group's early days.\n\nThe Onion: A lot of Belle And Sebastian's songs deal with the emotions of childhood and adolescence. What was your own childhood like?\n\nStuart Murdoch: Run of the mill. I think it was pretty much the same as everybody else's.\n\nO: What were you interested in as a kid?\n\nSM: Football. AC/DC. It depends on what age I was. I'm sure I followed whatever the fad of the day was.\n\nO: What led you to become interested in music?\n\nSM: Well, my parents made me take piano lessons. It's the sort of thing that you get used to in childhood that you hate, but then you used to hate a lot of things. Now, I appreciate it vastly. I had a little group when I was about 11 or 12. It's actually quite funny, because if you see a picture of the group now, it pretty much looks like Belle And Sebastian. It's almost the same lineup, only there's more girls. It's the same kind of mixture. There were like four girls, two guys, two guitarists, a piano player\u2013I was the piano player. It was pretty much set.\n\nO: When you were in a group then, did you think about playing music professionally as an adult?\n\nSM: Not really. When I was 11 or 12, I wanted to be an airline pilot. I went to get my eyes examined, and they tested me for colorblindness. It seems like kind of a trivial thing to happen, but they show you all these sheets with letters and numbers. It's kind of bizarre. But you have to pick out what number you see on the page, and either you see a number or you see nothing at all. I picked out nothing at all. The lady said to me, \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" I said a pilot, and she said, \"Well, you'll never do that.\" It was kind of cruel. It would be poetic for me to say that at that moment I decided to be a rock star, but it's not true.\n\nO: What made you want to be an airline pilot?\n\nSM: It's the kind of random job when you're that age. You never really seem to get beyond being a fireman or a policeman or an airline pilot, that sort of thing. One of the three. Actually, I don't like flying, so now it seems kind of funny to me. It would be one of my least favorite jobs now. Still, I would much rather be flying the plane than the steward. I mean, if I'm going to die, I'd rather have a hand in my own death.\n\nO: How do you feel about the flying aspect of touring?\n\nSM: It's just something you have to get through. It's actually improved recently. Valium helps.\n\nO: What led to the formation of Belle And Sebastian?\n\nSM: I started writing tunes, and songs started coming to me around the end of '92, the beginning of '93. By '95, I was looking for musicians to form a group, but not sure of what I wanted. I was in a kind of half-assed music course, and I was recording demos and songwriting. That's where I met Stuart David, our [former] bass player. I said to myself that by Christmas '95, if I couldn't get a gig together, then I'd go to San Francisco, because I'd been there. Just at that point, some people involved with the course got in touch with me and said they'd heard a demo and wanted to help make the album that became Tigermilk.\n\nO: What was the recording process like? You did it in a week?\n\nSM: Five days. It was very well-planned. It had to be. The setup was that the college took a band a year and made a record. They were like a dummy record company, and they ran a music course so that students could get experience with working for a record company. We were the dummy band. Usually, they put out a single by the band, but we went to the proprietor of the course and explained how much money and time we had. I thought, \"In that time, I'm sure we could make an album.\" I wrote the tracks then and there, and we planned it really well. One of the tracks was already pretty much recorded. It was simple, because it was recorded live and based on me playing the acoustic guitar. All the arrangements were worked out for piano, violin, and trumpet.\n\nO: Do you think recording it so quickly benefited Tigermilk?\n\nSM: Yes, absolutely. There couldn't have been any other way. It was energetic and concise. I remember hearing the first three tracks after just a couple of days, and my adrenaline was going, because I couldn't believe it sounded so good.\n\nO: When did you realize that Tigermilk would take off the way it did?\n\nSM: It's funny, you know, because it became a so-called underground classic and something to get, but that didn't happen for ages. I remember taking the records around to the shops to sell. We only made a thousand vinyl copies. We gave away about 400 of the things; the college sent out 400 copies as part of the unit. They had to act like a record company, so they sent copies out to other record companies, and to people in the music business. We only had 600 to sell, and I remember trying to sell the things, and people telling me to slog off. We had a launch party where we tried to give the records away. I had never wanted that goofy old \"Tigermilk is hard to get\" thing, especially since I remember when we took a copy 'round to the local record shop, and it sat there in the window for the entire summer. I got embarrassed. I was like, \"My God, we can't even sell a thousand records. We can't even sell 600 records, and there's a copy in the record-store window whose sleeve is getting lighter and lighter.\" Its legendary status didn't come until much later.\n\nO: You didn't begin writing songs until relatively late in your life. What was the catalyst?\n\nSM: I don't know if it was the catalyst, but quite frankly, the biggest thing that's ever happened in my life was I got sick at the end of the '80s. I was sick for about seven years. That was a big desert at the time, a kind of vacuum in my life. From that, these songs started coming out, these melodies where I could express what I was feeling.\n\nO: How much of your songwriting is autobiographical?\n\nSM: I just got this image in my mind of a cake, of writing songs being like baking a cake. The autobiographical part of things is like the flour, and the romance side of things and the fantasy part are like the sugar and eggs. By the time you're done mixing it all together, it's hard to tell which is which. When you write a song, it just comes out. There'll be little strands of it, and some are of biography, and some are things that have happened or that you think about.\n\nO: Do you find it easier to write songs from your own point of view, or from the viewpoint of a character?\n\nSM: It's funny: I think I used to find it easier to write from the point of view of a character, and the only reason I think that is because I used to write a lot of songs from that perspective. Now, I think it's probably easier to write songs from an \"I\" perspective. Then again, maybe it's just a writer's conceit that the \"I\" they're writing from is actually them.\n\nO: Early in your career, Belle And Sebastian was famous for being reluctant to do interviews or photo shoots. What was the impetus behind that?\n\nSM: It was just sort of the circumstances. It's not really any kind of fascinating thing. It just seemed easier not to do press. It's one of those situations where music was important to us, and writing was important, arranging was important, practicing was important, as was playing gigs. When you've got a new band, you spend a lot of time trying to keep it together. It was a very large band, and things were all happening at once. It took a lot for the older members of the band to protect the younger members, to reassure them that songs would always have the upper hand. It seemed like the last thing we wanted to do was tell the world about it. It was all about trying to keep the family together. It was a dysfunctional band, and if I had a dysfunctional family, the last thing I'd want to do is go on Oprah and talk about it.\n\nO: When Belle And Sebastian started to take off in the U.S., the group seemed enigmatic. Do you think that added to its appeal?\n\nSM: You'd have to tell me, because I was on the inside, trying to hold things together and holding down a job on the side. I didn't really know too much about how people on the other side of the world think.\n\nO: What was your job at that point?\n\nSM: I was a caretaker at a church. It's still a part of my life, in that I made a lot of friends there, though I don't work there anymore. I was in charge of a lot of things. I did enjoy it.\n\nO: Trevor Horn produced the new album. What led you to hire him?\n\nSM: Well, he approached us. I don't know, it's all a bit vague. It just seemed to kind of happen. We were looking for a producer. I didn't want to do another record without a producer. A few names were kicked about, but with the other two people, the timing was bad. With him, it just seemed like good timing.\n\nO: How do you think having him as a producer affected the way the album was made?\n\nSM: It was just a lot more concentrated, having him and his organization. We were able to concentrate more on things that are meant to be concentrated on: playing, singing, arranging, and writing, rather than the production side.\n\nO: Did he have a lot of amusing stories about the groups he'd worked with?\n\nSM: He did. He kept us amused through many a spring and summer night with stories about Frankie Goes To Hollywood and ABC and Yes.\n\nO: In an interview, you said you were living halfway between the '60s and the '70s. What did you mean by that?\n\nSM: I don't remember saying that, but I think more and more that I'm a throwback, and that the band is a throwback. I think it's interesting how the stylings of the '60s and '70s and even the '80s can kind of set you off, how you mourn the passing of each decade and all the things that just aren't done these days.\n\nO: One of the songs on Dear Catastrophe Waitress contains the line \"If I could do just one near-perfect thing, I'd be happy.\" Do you feel like you've approached that kind of perfection in your career?\n\nSM: That was an old song from well before this album, but I think the closest we've probably come was with Tigermilk. There was a purity to that that'd be difficult to recapture. Since then, I'd have to say \"Jonathan David,\" the single.\n\nO: How do you think the departure of [bassist and singer] Stuart David has affected the band?\n\nSM: I think it's been good for the band. In my mind, him and Isobel [Campbell, cellist and singer] left at the same time, and I think it helped the group. I think it's made things more focused. They'd probably say the same thing.\n\nO:A Hard Day's Night is on the list of your favorite films. If someone were to make a film about a day in the life of Belle And Sebastian, what would it be like?\n\nSM: I think it'd be really boring. I'm not sure anybody would want to see it. It'd be a lot of us sitting around talking.\n\nO: Would there be scenes of you being chased through the streets by your fans?\n\nSM: I think it'd be just the opposite. We'd be chasing our fans through the streets."}
{"text": "It's been about 12 years since 'The Books' began, and less than a year since we ended. Now that it's over it's time for me to jot down as much as I can about the project, the places it lived, and it's odd life, before I forget it. As sad as I am that it's over, it was an amazing thing to be a part of, and I'm grateful to everyone for their support and unbelievable kindness through the years. For those of you who are interested in the back-story, here it is\u2026 feel free to ask questions, I'll try to answer them.\n\nIn order to revisit the beginning of 'The Books' I've got to summon some pretty worn memories. Like anyone, there have been so many phases and places I've been through since then, that my cursory memories of that time have become somewhat cartoonish. I think a great quality of music, like with smell, is it's ability to conjure up deep-seated memories from the more unworn parts of the mind; places where the acidity of everyday thought has not melted and reformed them into oversimplified pictures. So I think the best place for me to start is by listening to the first track 'The Books' made (well before we had a name):\n\nIt's been almost two years since I remastered this track and I haven't listened to it again until now. And, once again, my memory of the sound of this track is flat compared to the re-experience. Something about the un-glossy crackle of the surface of sound that snaps me back into the feeling of those days in the spring of 2000, in 'upstate Manhattan'. We lived at 30 Seaman Avenue, Apt. 4H, just north of 200th St (Dykman Ave) on the A. I was living with my girlfriend, Julie Wolfe, and I had only lived in the city for a short time, having recently moved down from North Adams, MA where I lived during college. Julie and I met at the Williamstown Art Conservation Center; she was (and still is) an 'objects' conservator, and I worked in the 'analytical' department, mostly doing microscope work and identifying pigments and binders in paintings, for the purpose of helping to restore them, or rooting out fakes.\n\nI studied chemistry in school, with the original intention of having a career as a biochemist. When I realized that biochemistry, in practice, consisted of mixing one extremely dilute clear solution with another, I quickly hopped over to organic chemistry, which was more my speed with its colors and smells and occasional ether fires. I was drawn to organic chemistry also for the pictures: 3d diagrams of molecules smashing together extremely quickly in microscopic space in vast numbers. Which leads to my first (of many) digressions\u2026 (bear with me).\n\nIn 1996 I got a summer job in a lab that studied liquid crystals, a branch of materials science that studied compounds that are both ordered and fluid at the same time. A contradiction really\u2026 a rule breaking state of matter that had properties of both solid and liquid, the most famous application being the LCD (liquid crystal display) you're likely looking at now. Mostly my job was synthesis\u2026 taking two molecules and intentionally making a third, then purifying the desired compound away from all the junk I created by accident (a necessary inefficiency in chemistry, as in life, is the unintended consequences). When we had a candidate for a material that would show liquid crystalline properties we would throw it under a polarized light microscope and heat it up until it melted. When most crystals melt they go totally dark under the microscope (like water), but liquid crystals do this:\n\nThat's right! Fuckin' amazingly beautiful! And the pattern moves and flows as the temperature changes. Which leads me to digression 2:\n\nArt. What a stupid word. Sounds like a painful turd. When I was a kid I would try to paint like Bob Ross. It took me until my first year in college to realize that Art gets a lot more complicated when neurotic self-consciousness gets involved. Pretty becomes ugly and vice versa. Your mind becomes a battle ground for conflicting belief systems, and you tighten a tourniquet around the part of your spine that connects your brain to your body. Every thought becomes a high stakes experiment. Language becomes pure manipulation. Everything becomes relative. For or against. In parallel with my study of chemistry I took a lot of art classes at school. I always thought visually, and being in the studio alone at night was relaxing, so kept taking classes despite the impending existential nightmare. I remember going out to dinner with a teacher of mine, named Sheila Pepe. I attempted to take solace in chemistry. \"There's Truth in chemistry\", I would argue, \"Chemistry is real, stuff is real. It's made of chemicals.\" She would look at me, roll her eyes in a loving way, and say \"Nick, chemistry is just another way of looking at things.\" A chink in the armor. This feeling tore me up; that my view of science and it's values were na\u00efve, and my innocence was becoming a hindrance to my education. I think the biochemical term for this is 'denatured'. I was becoming denatured. Then digression number 3:\n\nI got cancer. In the winter of 1997 I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease\u2026 a relatively rare form of lymph cancer that was slow growing, but required immediate treatment. I was 22 at the time. I dropped out of school for the spring and moved back home to the Boston area to start radiation therapy to my neck and chest. This news made me numb and stupidly idealistic at first\u2026 I felt fine, and was actually in good shape at the time, so it all felt a little abstract, except it derailed me, narrative wise. I expected a straight shot through school into a lab job, but all of a sudden there was this time to sit and notice stuff. Given my shift in perspective on mortality, noticing stuff became somewhat of a consuming job. Then there was the radiation. Imagine the worst sunburn of your life on both the outside and inside of your body. That's what it was like. Beyond that I lost my sense of taste. Eating candy, which I always enjoyed, became like chewing asprin. I couldn't swallow anyway, so my attention shifted to walking, listening to music, and making stuff\u2026 mostly painting with an airbrush I bought leading up to the treatment. I was making terrible abstractions of the natural world, mostly, and listening to 'The Police' box set and Primus.\n\nIt was the first time in my life (that I could remember) that I was not in school in March, April and May. In this liminal place, sitting on the side of the tracks as it were, noticing stuff was getting easier. Like listening to a bell ring to silence, it was not as if the bell was getting quieter, it was as if the background was getting louder and overwhelming the tone of the bell. Everything became brighter and more mysterious; ordinary things became strange and scary. The namable parts of things were overtaken by the phenomenon of them, everything having a history that was ultimately untraceable. As the fatigue from the radiation kicked in, those days sprawled into each other in a dreamlike way. My relationship to my body was interrupted in a way that made me look at myself like a specimen. I was disembodied. Again, denatured. Like a fried egg.\n\nGoing back to school that fall, I had what most people with a life-threatening illness have: an overdeveloped sense of urgency: as if life was running out and everything had to be done to the utmost. Since medical technology had given me a 'second chance' it somehow meant that I had to do something 'important' and fast. I threw myself into a chemistry thesis, working long hours in the lab, trying to succeed at making a molecule that, it turns out, was quite difficult to make. I quickly became exhausted and frustrated and short on temper and friends. Things were already losing their brightness, dampened by my own designs for them. My chemistry professor pulled me aside one day and said that I was the type of scientist that would have been better off in the 1800's when the frontier was more open, and being 'mad' was still a useful trait for a scientist. I felt embarrassed by this, but I knew she was right. I was never going to be satisfied working under florescent lights, striving for research money, publications, tenure or any of the necessary trappings of being a modern scientist. I quit my chemistry thesis right then. Feeling defeated, I started spending all my time in the art building.\n\nFor my first project I shaved my entire body, divided it into sections and took Elmer's glue casts of every square inch of skin. It was a trick I had learned as a boy, and somehow I had no choice but to take it to its logical extreme. All the peeling felt apt given my recent experience with radiation burns. In fact, I developed an obsession with peeling of all kinds. Removing the surface. Having tried and failed as a chemist completed what cancer had started, which was essentially a flipping of foreground and background. The periphery seemed a whole lot more enticing than the center. The great thing about innocence is that it gives you a place to rest. This place was gone, and still is gone. But Art, for all it's stupidity and pretense, feels like a genuine frontier (at it's best). A place where being restless is valuable.\n\nIt's at this point I moved to North Adams, MA and lived on my own for the first time. I'll continue the story from here, moving to NYC, meeting Paul, and making that first track in the next entry\u2026"}
{"text": "Thus far Dancing Wayang seems like it's just started to learn how to walk, with a limp. This time it hides it better. We did a review of Mats Gustafsson's release Needs! several weeks back and we're greeted here with a similar work by Peter Evans entitled Beyond Civilized and Primitive. One thing this label needs to get right based on the press releases we've received in the past is a little less glittering generality, a little more flat factuality. So, instead of saying something like \"this album features saxophones that will explode your mind like a thousand nebulas\", which I just made up right now to prove a point, let's just go with \"this album features saxophones\". The sheet of paper that came with this one is a complete two-semester course on proper press release writing with so many examples of what to avoid you wouldn't need to purchase a textbook. Dancing Wayang really seems like it has some good intentions in mind, but it needs to think a little more beforehand. Evans' work here is more substantive than Gustafsson, but it's still for a very limited audience.\n\nAs we're told, Peter Evans is a \"maverick trumpeter\" who moves into \"uncharted territory by utilizing the recording facilities as compositional tools\", whatever that means. Can it be used otherwise? \"Hey, guys, get this, I'm going to record this with a...microphone\". Opening with that sets up a huge expectation in a listener, especially for anyone not too familiar with free jazz or musicians like Evan Parker. Looking around at some of Peter Evans' performances sets the stage for an impressive feast, but its potential hits the floor with a socks-on-waxed-linoleum thud like the \"forceful brushwork of 15 year old [sic] artist Owen Gould\" on the cover. Don't think so? Well, for a press release that indicates Beyond Civilized and Primitive includes \"overdubbing and looping\" as \"two significant techniques employed...to expand on Evan's already boundary-pushing musical exploits\" it couldn't be more short on meaning when you finally take it in. From the sound of it, and if you do a little research, Evans is a talented trumpeter, but for those of us out there who listen to more complex experimental music this is like trying to get high on air after coming down off of PCP.\n\nCase in point, there is no true usage of looping or effects in this entire album until the last few tracks, nor is there any real show of Evans' talents. The first two songs are chunks of randomness where Peter manipulates the trumpet in a variety of ways. The second, to serve as an example, is a fluctuating run of random notes for way longer than necessary with no alteration to the basic sound, no effects, and certainly none of the overdubbing suggested in the press release, nor the \"extremes\" to which he is apparently pushing \"his instrument and his lungs\". Really, it sounds like it was damn hard to sustain for the twelve minutes it runs, but it just sounds like a child rapidly messing around with a toy trumpet during playtime, and they'd probably have more stamina due to the fact that they're hopped up on a pound of sugar. It isn't until well near the end that Evans actually starts to layer some of the sounds, creating a variety of interesting structures, but for the most part it sounds like what it is, some guy fooling around on a trumpet that no one will consider impressive unless they actually played the trumpet. Since that's about one kid in every high school who spends most of their time playing Star Craft, not so good. This kind of thing isn't easy to make from how it sounds alone, it's something you'd likely need to see, but that's something you don't get from it. Perhaps it's physically impressive, perhaps it presses the boundaries of what the human body is capable of doing while playing the trumpet, but so what? It's like someone recording the sounds of a trapeze artist; all you're going to hear is the swish of the ropes and slaps of the hands. Free jazz fans might get a kick out of it, but it's not a recommendation for others. Evans has some incredible videos online, but this is a poor representation of his style other than a few brief moments.\nMySpace"}
{"text": "The Trip\n\nOn first listen, Laetitia Sadier's solo debut--not counting the three albums by her former side project Monade, the first of which was almost entirely a homemade affair--sounds close enough to later Stereolab albums that a fellow Critical Mob staffer wondered aloud why the band bothered to break up. But just as each Stereolab album had subtle but important differences from the one before, The Trip reveals its unique aspects upon closer examination. The obvious difference is the relative lack of electronics: Sadier herself plays only guitar, and the vintage synthesizers are otherwise kept in check, coloring the songs rather than anchoring them. The overall vibe is often reminiscent of Sadier's beloved vintage '60s sunshine pop, most notably on a springy cover of \"By the Sea\" by cult favorites Wendy and Bonnie, which features an interlude of wordless harmonies directly reminiscent of The Free Design, the sibling act that Stereolab named a 1999 single after. The other two covers, sultry takes on Les Rita Mitsouko's mid-'80s dance hit \"Un Soir, Un Chien\" and the Gershwin standard \"Summertime,\" prove yet again Sadier's eternal hipness, but it's her original songs that stand out: after 20 years singing oblique, often theoretical lyrics, there's a startling first-person directness to songs like \"One Million Year Trip\" and \"Another Monster.\" Recorded half with her former Monade bandmates Emmanuel Mario and Julien Gasc and half with California polymath Richard Swift, the album nonetheless sounds remarkably uniform, testament to Sadier's singular musical"}
{"text": "Given the label's cultivation of previously unheralded talent such as Raime and Dalhous, a new name on Blackest Ever Black is always going to be an enticing prospect. Alexander Lewis seems keen to maintain a low profile, but A Luminous Veil is one of the most striking debuts in the field of industrial electronics we've heard in some time. Supposedly created using only synth, microphone and pedals, and apparently recorded in one take with minimal computer processing or post-production, it's a varied set from start to finish; opener \"The Third Room\" and \"Figure Moving\" both sound like synthesized power metal, while \"Mirror Fragment\" creates a foreboding drone landscape; \"She Demands Attention\" meanwhile places what sounds like a short wave radio monologue amidst squalling guitar feedback. With shades of the material coming from Dominick Fernow's Hospital Productions and the more extreme ends of Editions Mego, A Luminous Veil is essential listening.\n\nReview:\nPerhaps the most minimal Spectrum Spools release to date, The Sincere Interruption is Eric Lanham's first release under his own name after several ears of performing as Carl Calm and Palmetto Moon Electronic Group. Recalling the precision of early 00s Mille Plateaux and Raster-Noton, The Sincere Interruption clicks with glitches that sound like scrambled MP3 fragments, albeit held together with an invisible matrix beneath. Repetitive, yet imperceptibly evolving, this is a highly rewarding listen."}
{"text": "One of the best online music resources to emerge in the last couple of years has to be The Hype Machine. For the uninitiated, The Hype Machine is an aggregator of MP3 music blogs that allows punters to search for blogs and websites that have both written about a particular band and also made an MP3 available 'for evaluation purposes'.\n\nType in the name of a band and it returns a list that you can plough through and listen to right there on the page, or alternatively follow the links to the original sites and read more. Think of it like a Google that returns nothing but music and reviews, and to understand how comprehensive the service is, how deep it digs into the lonely corners of the internet, you can even find reviews on and music by Friends of the Stars.\n\nA statement such as 'it's an aggregator of Mp3 music blogs' would have made absolutely zero sense as little as 5 years ago, so we're very much not in Kansas anymore, and it hasn't taken long for savvy folk to cotton on to the fact that blogs are a great way of reachinga wider audience. Equally, it hasn't taken most music bloggers long to realise that there is a living to be made and free music to be had by producing a regular and trustworthy source of new music and comment. PR and Record Companies are now desperately cosying up to the very people they recently wanted to shut down and it seems even your Grandparents could explain to you what a Tastemaker is. We've come a long way in a short amount of time.\n\nSo, does the fact that a lot of people have written about a particular record make it a 'good record'? Obviously and categorically not. I won't name names here, but there were one or two albums released in 2008 that were both underwelming and overexposed, but what's new\u2026..\n\nDoes the fact that a lot of different people, each servicing their own niche audience (of whatever size), have chosen to feature (for whatever reason)the same album during the same calendar year make for a more interesting list than most 2008 lists? Yes, obviously. The Hype Machine's 2008 Zeitgeist is, then, a quantative list of the artists, albums and songs written about by thousands of independents worldwide and online during 2008.\n\nEach section is being released in chunks of 10 over the next few days. Yesterday saw the release of 50-41, today is 40-31 and so on and so forth until Friday 9th January, when we find out who and what is Top of the Pops. Aside from this being a clever way of making us all return each day, it also infuses this particular list with some authentic, old-fashioned tension - the like of which the actual charts haven't had since the Top 40 countdown actually meant something\u2026 and that, by the way, is a good thing"}
{"text": "Between the unexpected Jawbox and Black Star reunions, the Yacht Rock superjam, and the Roots subbing as the best backing band in late night (see: Elvis Costello, Monsters Of Folk, Paul Simon, the Lonely Island, Zach Morris), Jimmy Fallon's music department's did everything right in '09 to vault from newcomer to reigning king of late night music. But what cemented Late Night's status had less to do with gimmick than with consistently daring booking. And Jimmy started 2010 right last night with Japandroids \u2014 the exuberant and punky garage-pop duo that's probably sold less albums than Fallon's studio holds people \u2014 giving a relatively underexposed band a shot at winning some fans that don't read blogs or have the legs for CMJ. The Canadians brought \"Wet Hair,\" a song they Dropped on us last summer, punning in tandem on Bikini Kill and french kissing. When we first heard it the weather matched the wordplay; last night was likely on par with the Vancouver chill they suffered while writing it. So, a jam for all seasons:\n\nthis is a decent song for a 12 year old that just got his first guitar, learned three chords, and came up with three lyric lines with his friends that he thinks are witty.\nprops to fallon for bookin little indies but as far as the music on this one goes- ehhh\n\nJapandroids are passionate musicians; this song is a fun one and they rocked it. Yes, their lyrics are simple and their songs aren't too complex, but they're making music that they love to play and (some) people love to hear. Jimmy is indeed daring to host these guys, I just wish he would let those people standing behind them dance like they should at a real Japandroids show.\n\nYou should check out music where the artists actually have talent, you may dig it.\nDon't worry about what poseur friends/bloggies/urban outfitter salespeople tell you- trust me when I say technical musical ability and original creativity can still be cool.\n\nhi uhhhh\u2026.i'm 17\u2026.read pitchfork daily\u2026.uhhh\u2026\u2026my fav bands are japandroids and the pains of being pure at heart and cymbals eat guitars. japandroids are just so emotional you know? french kissing some french girls\u2026..they rock so hard\u2026.\n\nHey there\u2026 my name is dane\u2026 I am too hip for pitchfork and music in general\u2026 so instead i come on to this blog and troll people who only got into animal collective after MPP was released\u2026 I like own Spirit They're Gone before anyone like knew about them\u2026\np.s. I am on match.com under the name Dane LennonByrneWilsonLennoxCoxOberstSmithRingo\n\nall it takes is a guitar effects pedal or two and that suspended chord he's playing\u2026obtainable by any talentless hack with relatively functioning fingers.\ni don't think the stab at urban outfitters was to say there's something wrong with music snobber, but more that there's something wrong with music snobbery based on hype and fashion over real musical talent and content.\n\nThe performance wasn't terrible, it just wasn't anything interesting or impressive to me. It is a fact that the song is very simple in construction, requires little skill to play, and the lyrics are very elementary. That's not an opinion, it's like stating that playing tic tac toe is very simple in structure, requires little skill to play, etc. No big deal, the song and performance are just not that impressive.\nBlogs like this exist so that people can comment on posts\u2026so it's ridiculous that you're suprised people have negative things to say and assuming that it's the same person posting them just because your feelings are hurt is also absurd.\n\nYou're right it is absurd, so why are you doing it? There's so many things you said just now that just gave you away, crazy troll.\nTo me, it was the fact that you start new paragraphs like this. And then you go on blathering about \"SKILLZ\". Fuck off. Those are two guys making better music than full lineup bands. They aren't dfa 1979, but I like them. Its the sound I enjoy, and even if its talentless, simple chord progression that a child could play, they gave a great performance. I like garage rock, I like the simplicity. Go masturbate to Van Halen douchebag.\n\nIt's fine for what it is but you guys getting bent out of shape over the criticism are taking it too seriously. Normally I'm fine with \"just go with it\" fun time music. But this was annoying to me. The lyrics are not witty, I'm sorry. As for technical proficiency. . . so what. It all depends on what you're going for. They're not trying to impress anyone (obvs) and guess what? I'm not impressed. I'd rather see Times New Viking but hey, good for Japandroids. btw- can bands stop with the Japan puns please? Japandroids, Japanther, Japancakes. That's enough already!\n\nYes, exactly. Japandroids are great to see live because they get so into it and their songs are just lively and fun. I like them a lot, but I also like bands that are more \"serious\" or complex. I don't understand what about them could possibly make people so offended and hostile unless they're the kind of person who hates any band that happens to gain some commercial notice.\n\nThis band is great \u2014 definitely a record for the summer though. And since when is it requisite for punk (indie punk or otherwise) to have complex chord progressions or labyrinthine lyrics? It looks like you're looking for something that is distinctly at odds with the tenets of this genre.\n\n\"these guys are out there having fun\"\n\"they are great to see live because they get so into it\"\n\"making music because they want to and playing things they might like to play and do fun stuff\"\n\nGreat points, kids! All it takes to make good music is having some fun and getting into it. Nevermind having real originality, technique, vision, skill, and all those other annoying things that are ruining today's popular music.\n\nbands like japandroids annoy me. don't get me started on beat happening, or those television personalities. THEY MAKE MY BLOOD BOIL. brb guys, I need to calm down and listen to some dragonforce; those guys know how to play their stuff.\n\nHave you ever thought that it takes some balls to play punk. to stand out in front of everyone and give it all you got. The songs may be short but that's the point of punk. It's short and to the point, and say what you want however you want. Hasn't anyone ever listened to how goofy some ramones lyrics are, but they those songs are still great.\n\nthe balls it takes to play punk?! that's pretty funny. being a clown for kids' parties takes about the same amount of balls and they're both pretty fucking lame. i'd love to hear what makes punk more \"brave\" than say, getting in front of the same amount of people and playing some completely different music while \"giving it all you got\"\u2026\n\nThey are a band that bears watching. Their record is pretty nice \u2014 Wet Hair is the simplest song, to be sure. But to bash them because on one song last night they didn't display technical proficiency to your satisfaction last night is to bash the Ramones and Costello and the Pistols and dozens of other great bands that found that you didn't have to be Jimmy Page or Eric Clapton to advance music (and Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton agree with me, btw).\n\nI think Japandroids are a decent band but putting them in the same sentence as the Ramones and Costello is a joke. Costello is so versatile and wrote so many original and intricate songs.\nYes, the Ramones and the Pistols played short, simple punk songs but they innovated and had a lot more character and raw heart put into it. There's not much original about Japandroids, but they're fun enough.\n\nWhat did the Ramones innovate? They shamelessly pilfered from '50s pop music, '60s gargage, and early '70s proto-punk like the Dictators and MC5, and they even acknowledged it. Joey Ramone admitted half of what the band did was image and hype. That's what half of fucking rock n' roll is: image and hype.\n\nSeriously though, sometimes you want fillet mignon and sometimes you just want a greasy burger. Unless your vegan, at which point I don't know how to make an apt comparison you can relate to.\n\nThe technical proficiency dude probably has 30 different versions of the same Phish song on his iPod and is just now exploring indie rock because he's only been listening to one band since he was 15 and smoked pot for the first time. Now it's 15 years later and his 17 year old Pitchfork reading cousin was like \"Dude, Wilco has guitar solos too, you need to branch out\" at Christmas dinner and so he downloaded Sky Blue Sky and now all of a sudden he has opinions to share on a blog.\n\nMy friends who are into \"technical proficiency\" as a condition for quality in music? The ones who wear their suits from their work day to go see Widespread Panic more than one night in a row? The ones who basically dig Trey Anastasio for the same reasons they dig Lebron James or Roger Federer or Tony Hawk (alpha-male domination via technical prowess and virtuosity)? I don't even try to turn them on to music. Most closed-minded \"music fans\" on the planet.\n\nsounds like you think the only bands out there with proficiency are jambands\u2026that's stupid. i won't even get into how bizarre and off the mark that alpha male comment you made was\u2026yikes\n\nalso- the proficiency dude that brought up dragonforce was probably being sarcastic and you missed it. i think he's on your side, dude. everyone knows dragonforce blows.\n\nno one said japandroids need guitar solos or techincal proficiency to be good, they just need some redeeming quality to justify the hype and tv spot. ya know, besides being a sloppy two piece band that sings mediocre power chord songs with three lyrics.\n\nRockin out and proficiency are not mutally exclusive btw- Ever watch footage of Jimi Hendrix? Dude was off his nut freaking out bu It was amazingly skillful. Also Man Man are amazing musicians that are also total goofballs on stage. Don't get me wrong I love a one note guitar solo (Neil Young). There's room for the whole range of amateurish to virtuoso. Both can totally loose their shit and rock out. So pointing out that Jdroids are a bit lame doesn't make you a snob or a hater, it just makes you someone that prefers something with a little more to chew on.\n\nIt looks like all the Superfandroids that are getting bent out of shape are missing the point. I'm pretty sure Needsmoarchords that brought up \"proficiency\" was being satirical/sarcastic whatever. And the people before him commenting negatively on the performance weren't saying that you need profiency to make good music\u2026they were just saying this performance wasn't great. I think the point is that you should have some unique vision, technique, and or skills of some kind to create good music and not just some blah shit that will come and go.\nLook at bands a band like Radiohead- I can't think of a song of theirs that takes \"proficiency\" to play but it took some real talent to creat them. How about one another personal favorite- Pavement? They sucked at their instruments when they started and their songs aren't hard to play but they have a vision and real creative originality. Those bands are special, along with many others. I can't recall any other Japandroid songs so I'm not judging them overall but this song posted here is pretty unspecial. Don't be angry.\n\nFor real Steph, you need to go back and listen more closely to both Radiohead and Pavement. I know this isn't really the core of the discussion here but your examples of bands that are lacking in technical ability are just profoundly incorrect.\n\nI didn't mean Radiohead songs are easy to play and I didn't say they're \"lacking in technical ability\", they take a ton of ability to play. I just mean you don't have to be a PROFICIENT guitar, key, drum, bass, player to perform the songs, necessarily. And when I say \"proficient\" i mean it as \"Expert\", like a techincal pro. I'm not a stellar guitar player but was able to play (and figure out) most Radiohead songs by the time I was in college\u2026I'm no pro. The point is that Thom and co. have a ton more going for them and what they create/write is spectacular. They don't need to be shredding guitar gods because they have so much more going on.\nSame thing with Pavement. I'm sorry but if you think their songs are hard to learn/play, you don't know much about musical instruments. Does that matter? No, they have so much more going on and the genius behind the writing is key. It's raw, noisy, and loose\u2026great shit. That's why they're as iconic as they are so many years after they were releasing music. I doubt anyone will be talking about Japandroids next year. Best of luck to them, though.Sorry for the long post, didn't want to be misunderstood.\n\nI see nothing interesting or new here. A two person band is a big statement, and usually only super talented mega stars pull it off unless you're a guy/girl combo act. In this case, I don't see the talent that DFA, or the White Stripes, or Black Keys possess / ed. They have some personality. That's always good, but the music seems a bit contrived.\n\nIts funny to see the extent to which people will try to degrade a band just because they don't like them. How about you go and argue about things like politics where something can be argued about. People like the music and the techniques of how its played aren't going to change how it sounds to them. If what entertain's me doesn't entertain you then be a little more considerate and shut your mouth. Music is an abstract art it only exists in the time its played and listened to, so you can analyze it all you want but it mostly depends on how it sounds to the individual while they are listening to it.\n\nBob Seger says simple is good, but Japandroids is just okay. Reminds me of some of them them bands I saw in Katmandu. But whatever, man, good luck to them. I am happy for them kids that can remember their phrases enough to repeat em. Ted Nugent is a badass. You guys should check him out.\n\nI used to have the 'Cat Scratch Fever' LP. It went well with my Black Oak Arkansas, Johnny Winter and Charlie Daniels Band LPs. Who do you suppose would be the closest thing I could get to that these days?\n\nI read a comment over on the Owl City bashfest saying that usually Stereogum commentors were a positive bunch of people and they just needed one band to bash. I'm not buying it.\nI don't care for this band at all but don't think that all of the people that love them are ignorant and/or stupid. Watching people slap each other around verbally on the message boards is a strangely compelling sort of entertainment though\u2026\n\nThis music is easy to play!!! I don't like it!!! Wahhh wahhh.. I am a classically trained guitarist.. studied music theory, history, harmony out the wazzoo. I can appreciate technical music.. but i can also appreciate the opposite. It's fun summery type music.\n\nFantastic band who does a really good job at the style of music they're trying to convey. Too bad that people think certain bands are products of blog hype, personally I enjoyed this record immensely long before pitchfork and stereogum sunk it's teeth in. It's no technically dense Grizzly Bear, but for what it is it's perfect.\n\nCheck out Swearing at Motorists if you're looking for a top-notch two-piece \u2013 \"Number 7 Uptown\" or \"More Songs from the Mellow Struggle\" \u2013 beats the spit out of the White Stripes or these Japandroid jokers. Think, depth of emotion \u2013 not, necessarily, fun. Or, \"art\" and not \"kitsch.\"\n\nI dont think the lyics are aimed at 12 year olds, actually. i feel like this is more of a nostalgic sort of band\u2026 they're good with evoking memory through a simple sound and set-up. The entire album is kind of that way. And no, I don't read Pitchfork, NME, and honestly don't read stereogum all that often.\n\nAlso, people claim Buckethead is technically proficient, but have you heard any of his solo work? BORING. AS. HELL.\n\nI lol'd at some of these comments. Sounds like all the negative comments are coming from typical butthurt elitist guitar store employees, who still think other people actually enjoy listening to them wank off a Les Paul in their bedroom.\n\nJapandroids play good old fashoined emotional rock songs. Just go with it"}
{"text": "After OK Go performs on 'The Tonight Show With Conan O'Brien' on Friday, Jan. 8, the band will jet off to the UK to launch a European tour on Jan. 11, the very day the Chicago power pop quartet's latest album, 'Of the Blue Colour of the Sky,' is released there. Singer Damian Kulash tells Spinner that the record, which is released in the US one day later, was deeply influenced by heavy touring, which caused him to take stock of his song writing.\n\n\"We toured for 31 months without stopping,\" he says. \"I came home and tried to write a big blammo chord. Like, turn the amp to 11 and write a big power chord that tears your scalp off. The thrill of that after 700 days of shows in a row didn't do much. I was like, well, that's boring.\"\n\n'Of the Blue Colour,' which doesn't sacrifice OK Go's characteristic bristling hooks, also reflects personal and worldwide gloom, he says. \"We were all going through a tough time personally and globally. Firstly, the presidential campaign, the chaos. Then the recession. The world seemed so f---ed.\"\n\n\"It's a very dark record,\" Kulash continues. \"It is more introspective feeling, but that also comes from the way we made it -- sort of from the ground up rather than the top down. Ten years ago, I sat down and said 'Why doesn't the world make stadium rock anymore?' So, I wrote a song like that. Now, I can't work that way.\"\n\nIn short, Kulash was power-chorded out. \"Having expended that particular thrust, we sort of got back to how we listen to music, rather than how we learned to make it. There are a lot of '80s Prince influences on this record. You can almost hear exactly what I was listening to when I was 12 years old. There's a little bit of jangly on-the-porch Led Zeppelin, a bit of spacey electro Depeche Mode and there's a lot of Prince's 'Purple Rain'.\""}
{"text": "My Brightest Diamond, on the guitar: \"[It's] like someone you've been married to for 35 years, and it's still a great relationship, but the sex isn't quite the same.\"\n\nStory by Courtney Balestier Photos by Matt Wignal\n\nWith her slight frame, sweet voice and luminous eyes, Shara Worden\u2014the main creative force behind My Brightest Diamond\u2014looks the part of the playful sprite she embodies in MBD's ethereal, seemingly effortless songs. Funny, then, that Worden had a hell of a time learning how to write a proper song. Yes, it helps that she's classically trained (see a degree in opera studies from the University of North Texas), but the singer/arranger insists songwriting is not an academic exercise.\n\nAh, but what is it then?\n\n1. Find your style\nAt the beginning of her career, Worden spent an entire year cranking out a song a week. The ensuing catalog not only didn't please her; it garnered comparisons to Jewel and Lisa Loeb when she was really shooting for Jeff Buckley. Not for naught, the exercise taught Worden that she thrived writing modal music.\n\nAnd what is modal music, my dear? \"If you're singing 'doe, ray, me, fah, so, la, tea, doe,' you start on 'ray' instead of 'doe,'\" explains Worden. \"The landing place in tonal music is very resolute, but in modal music, you're never sure where you're landing. The scale is more of a circle.\"\n\n2. Interact with new sounds\nWorden went through a phase of playing with air organs she'd found on the street. When a friend sent her a kalimba (a.k.a. a \"thumb piano\") from Africa, she took it out of the package and started toying with it\u201410 minutes later, she'd written \"Apple\" for her second Asthmatic Kitty LP, A Thousand Shark's Teeth. Basically, she's studied the technique for so long that her body can kick into autopilot, absently strumming or plucking, while her mind creates the music. One might think this feat is easier to accomplish by playing the standard guitar than by, say, experimenting with an African percussion instrument. Not necessarily.\n\n\"The guitar is like someone you've been married to for 35 years, and it's still a great relationship, but the sex isn't quite the same,\" says Worden. \"You take each other for granted. That's how I feel about the guitar.\"\n\n3. Accept your method\nWorden is okay with not being a prolific songwriter. Instead, she \"broods.\" For a long time. Call it a gestation period: She ponders a would-be song's energy, tempo\u2014even, on meta occasions, the pondering itself\u2014for months. Then, after a 6-to-10-hour writing session, the song is born. \"I have to conceptualize it first,\" explains Worden. \"I don't write a lot of songs, but I also don't have a lot of B-sides to toss out.\"\n\nShe's abandoned the song-a-week pace for this arrangement. \"It's scary to accept. I'll think, 'I don't know if I can write anything else.' But I'm starting to accept it.\"\n\n4. Define your \"musical language\"\nAh, the warm blanket of experience: Worden knows her band, so when she writes their arrangements, she's well aware of which notes the French hornist can hit and what her drummer will think. For someone whose lyrics are so personal, though, this also means opening up.\n\n\"When you're starting out, you're thinking, 'Where's my space? What's my sound?'\" says Worden. \"You're very closed, very protective. But the only way I can grow is by opening myself up to a little bit of controversy. With my new album, I feel more open. I've defined my musical language\u2014I don't have to protect it.\"\n\n5. Know your routine \u2026 and when to stop it\nWorden has to write alone in her Brooklyn home studio. She has to know that no one will be able to hear her, and she has to have at least five hours. \"The first hour is usually shit,\" she says, so there's no pressure about running out of time. To compose a string arrangement, well, for that she requires an entire day. That's a lot of time for tinkering, but it's just as crucial to know when that time is up."}
{"text": "The Dreamy Dancers\n\nSchool of Seven Bells \u2013 Disconnect from desire\n\nThe Skinny: Dreamy. A word you'll see a lot. Also, poetic lyrics, like describing a lucid dream.\n\nThe review proper: Ah, School of Seven Bells, a trio who love their music to be reverberated and enveloping. This second album, Disconnect from desire, is considerably louder than Alpinisms, but hey, who wants the second album to be just the first album repackaged with a different cover?\nOf the very beginning, you're in for a treat. The vocalising attack is already in full gear in 'Windstorm', the face punch that opens the album. If you're a first comer to this band, this is the song that either will pique your interest or go into seclusion.\n\nThe groove maintained by the first songs moodily changes with an upbeat jolt, courtesy of 'Babelonia', the overdriven song that is as dreamy as they come. The treated vocals, the simple but thunderous guitar riff and the tambourine (classy!) make it quite catchy. As layered as the song is, it keeps building, with more stuff building upon it.\n\n'Joviann' is beautiful, like a Monet-coloured skyline, it's dreamy, with the combination of voices by and the music going for a wall of sound approach (with a few pauses). The track does take its time, though, so the more impatient ones might not dig this.\n\nHowever, if you want something jittery, go for 'Camarilla', swaggering the right combination of guitar with synth work. It's one of the briskest songs in the whole album, without ever abandoning the ethereal sound that encompasses what School of Seven Bells is.\n\nLyrics wise, I can't find any fault, it's the perfect compliment to such a surreal sound. There's some sweet moments, and then there's the defiant declaration that hurts just because it is quite true : \"More useless to me than a motto is a creed / 'Cause this vain imposition is a loaded decision / Hiding in it's vision a treacherous seed\" (from 'Camarilla')\n\n'Dial' is another prime cut from Disconnect from Desire. There's no simple way to describe this intricate song and trying to put it in a box that goes into bit or bat genre would be useless. It is breezy and dreamy, simple as that. The music throws a few curveballs (I dig the voice inflection during the \"I was relieved\" part of the song, going from an angelic tone to a sigh of relief).\n\nThere are a couple of songs that didn't do the trick, though, but then again, it would be improbable to like it as a whole. Maybe 'Bye bye bye' would be the only one that I would take out of the mix, as 'Dust devil' felt as the stronger twin in the electronica infused song from the album.\n\n'The wait' is a perfect album closer for Disconnect from Desire. The instrumentation is sparse, just adding a few strokes here and there, it's all about the voice(s), and again, the mental imagery of the lyrics. I hate to waffle this review with more lyrics, but here they go \"We get so hypnotized by / The imposed rhythms of the passing time / Urgency solely defined by / Degrees of dissatisfaction in our minds\".\n\nIt is an album that does require your full attention. As just background music (a common malaise on the consumer-side of today's music), it's acceptable, but as a full experience, it's lush and poetic (check the lyrics for 'Dial', really"}
{"text": "Blog: musicforants.com\n\nAll Tiny Creatures ' new album, Harbors , is a bit of an enigma. Each song is both similar and wildly different than the ones that surround it, making it a slippery record to dissect. This is due to both the pedigree of people involved in the project (Collections of Colonies of Bees/Volcano Choir) and the different guest vocalists that give each song a distinct feel. But as wily a creature as it is, it's nigh impossible not to get swept way in its hypnotic spell. Nowhere is this more evident than on \"Glass Bubbles\". Indicative of [...]"}
{"text": "The Bureau files.\n\nThere's a pretty wide range of styles on the album. There are uptempo, danceable tracks, but also some rockers and a couple melancholy ballads.\n\nCracchiolo:Well, I write in phases, and I always try to write a crop of songs that's different from the ones that came before. For me, the post-punk time is so apt because this really is just more complicated punk rock. If I hear a band and it's straightforward and uptempo...I mean, I'm not talking about bratty, screamy punk-rock shit. I'm talking about stuff that's a little smarter and more mature than that. That's the stuff that gets me really excited, but by no means is it all that I listen to. And it all finds its way into the writing at some point. I mean, Jamie loves Steely Dan. I love Steely Dan.\n\nMore About\n\nThat reminds me \u2014 I've heard rumors of some impromptu Steely Dan sing-alongs when you guys get together...\n\nCracchiolo:That's true.\n\nToon:I don't know what you're talking about.\n\nCracchiolo:OK, it's not true. [Laughs] The way Jamie and I joined the band was that we worked at a comic book store together, and between the two of us and our manager at the time, the place was basically like a non-stop rock opera. It was ridiculous. Like, parody lyrics to Rush and Queen and the Doobie Brothers constantly."}
